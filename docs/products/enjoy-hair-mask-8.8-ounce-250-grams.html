            <li>Love this product.  </li>

            <li>I love the way I can style after using Enjoy Hair Mask.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job making hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>First time user and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Great product at a better price than my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>Eh... It does not smell good, makes my hair feel kind of gross after it</li>
            <li>I like this hair mask and it feels nice when I first use it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product provides detangle and smoothing without any added weight.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Still a light conditioner, so it can be used every day.</li>
            <li>I use this 1-2 times a week along with the enjoy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>great for keeping my hair nourished &amp; deep conditioned.</li>
            <li>Been using Enjoy for about 7 years now.</li>
            <li>Great deep hair conditioner mask at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>Really great for remy and/or human hair extensions, it helps A LOT with the tangling and matting that happens around the nape of the neck.  </li>
            <li>I would totally recommend it, has replaced my conditioner for sure!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Really can see a difference in texture and manageability of hair very quickly!</li>
            <li>This is a great product to soften and de frizz dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and gets weighed down easily, this product doesn&#x27;t add any weight, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I use this mask at least twice a week, wonderful!</li>
            <li>, I did not find this label to be true.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for wavy thick, unruly hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with most hair products it&#x27;s more of a placebo effect rather than an actual result.</li>
            <li>Great hair mask that rinses off completely and leaves hair so soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>My coarse hair feels healthy and frizz free even in the humid summer weather!</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, The results are not extremely noticable but there is a difference.</li>
            <li>My Grrrrl swears by this stuff, to the point of where it&#x27;s much more pleasant to track down and purchase, than live with the consequences of her running out</li>
            <li>I found the Enjoy Hair Care Mask very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole line of products is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week on my over treated and heat damaged hair and it make my hair so soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>If your hair needs a pick me up this will make feel healthy and Soft again</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money as I have found nothing else on the market that compares.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy and actually seems to moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair cant feel soft without enjoy!</li>
            <li>I have have purchased so many products at the salon only to get home and think, nothing special.</li>
            <li>It also wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and just slid right out of it in clumps.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Feels soft and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>This makes my bleached out hair feel so soft and strong.</li>
            <li>I go to a salon that uses Enjoy products only so I was already familiar with this product</li>
            <li>I thought there was nothing better, but I&#x27;m always willing to try something new, and my new replacement for this product is believe it or not, Suave, Keratin Infused.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be amazed how soft and smooth your hair will feel.</li>
            <li>This really helped my hair be stronger (even with just one use!)</li>
            <li>Been a fan since they first launched and sold bottles for $13 until they wanted to compete with Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I do use conditioner daily and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I think it actually works better than my previous favorite, this product, Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Enjoy hairmask made it soft and look so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference with shine and general appearance and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>It feels like a thick, buttery cream when it goes into my hair (sounds gross but is really awesome), and really helps detangle in the shower.</li>
            <li>It lasts long, i use it at least twice a week, very happy</li>
            <li>Years of coloring had left it pretty out of control, but Enjoy has tamed it.  </li>
            <li>You just have to be sure to thoroughly dry the extensions afterwards.</li>
            <li>I just purchased my second order, which they packaged and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>use it everyday and my hair has never been in such great shape.  </li>
            <li>Makes such a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>They also have a conditions that you spray on towel dried hair that is amazing too.</li>
            <li>Gives you that &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that you feel in your hair when it&#x27;s been really well conditioned, if you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Bought this after using a friends ENJOY Mask, but must&#x27;ve been a different formula because this did nothing for my hair but leave it greasy.</li>
            <li>This works really well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel very silkily and takes away the frizz.  </li>
            <li>intensive smoothing mask was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very course hair that has been damaged.  </li>
            <li>Delivered fast too.</li>
            <li>Also, this price is MUCH cheaper than buying at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li>Smells good, like coconut and is a thick application..</li>
            <li>you can find the original it is equal to a $250.00 Brazilian blow out at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s always a bit delicate after bleaching it, and the Enjoy hair care Hair Mask always gets it back in tip top shape!  </li>
            <li>I have very thick and fairly unruly and frizzy color treated blond hair that really needs to be tamed.</li>
            <li>This works better and in less time.</li>
            <li>I then tie a plastic bag over the top of my head covering all my hair to keep it damp while I watch TV for a half hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product previously and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Also I got several compliments on my hair when I first began using it!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and it is so much healthier since I have been using it.,</li>
            <li>I wish they carried other Enjoy products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a heavy duty conditioner than a mask and it leaves my hair uber silky and soft</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very soft but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>So soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I first started using it back in 2007</li>
            <li>I love this product and I have a hard time finding it.  </li>
            <li>it leave the hair soft but nothing else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I now use it once a week  - makes my hair really soft and manageable -</li>
            <li>After I finish styling, it makes my hair soft, manageable, and silky.</li>
            <li>This hair mask leaves my hair silky soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy Professional Hair care .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish I could say it made my hair luxuriously soft</li>
            <li>I use it daily with a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>Add moisture and restores that soft silky feeling.</li>

            <li>Makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky soft.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I color treat the heck out of my hair which leaves it pretty dry and damaged in the lower section.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Cant live without this stuff - changed my entire look!</li>
            <li>This stuff is a real life saver for dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be a must buy especially since I had such high hopes per all the 5* reviews!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much, so will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I use this several times a week to keep my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly dry hair, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Based on the amazing 5 star reviews I read here on Amazon, I bought this product for my very dry, thin and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Left on longer than suggested time, left hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Only product that really works on my coarse, dry hair!  </li>
            <li>No long term effects.</li>
            <li>I have straight slinky hair and using anything in my hair weighs it down</li>
            <li>even though I use Kerastase and other high end hair products.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel less damage after all the coloring, straight ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>First I apply on wet hair after shower, blow dry, twist up, then leave in for several hours, and finally wash out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Awesome &amp; very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for over a month now and honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> The whole hair care line is great!</li>
            <li> This does a nice job at conditioning and softening hair.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing treatment</li>
            <li> Kind of like eating a McDonald&#x27;s hashbrown.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and expectations, that this product would be absolutely wonderful, but for me, it did nothing more than condition my hair...</li>
            <li> The product was nicely packaged for safe shipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth that even makes me wonder if everything is actually good for me.</li>
            <li> This is great as a deep conditioner 2 to 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;Great for colored hair, weightless and smells great....</li>
            <li> Too good to be true</li>
            <li> ENJOY is the Best conditioning and nourishment treatment, by far!</li>
            <li> Safe for color treated hair too.</li>
            <li> The mask was okay, but with the shampoo and conditioner duo (hydrating formula)</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.  </li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The items came correct and in good condition the first time.</li>

            <li> Love Enjoy hair products ....</li>
            <li> I love the way I can style after using Enjoy Hair Mask.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job making hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> First time user and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Great product at a better price than my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Eh... It does not smell good, makes my hair feel kind of gross after it</li>
            <li> I like this hair mask and it feels nice when I first use it</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product provides detangle and smoothing without any added weight.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Still a light conditioner, so it can be used every day.</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2 times a week along with the enjoy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> great for keeping my hair nourished &amp; deep conditioned.</li>
            <li> Been using Enjoy for about 7 years now.</li>
            <li> Great deep hair conditioner mask at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> Really great for remy and/or human hair extensions, it helps A LOT with the tangling and matting that happens around the nape of the neck.  </li>
            <li> I would totally recommend it, has replaced my conditioner for sure!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Really can see a difference in texture and manageability of hair very quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to soften and de frizz dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and gets weighed down easily, this product doesn&#x27;t add any weight, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I use this mask at least twice a week, wonderful!</li>
            <li> , I did not find this label to be true.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for wavy thick, unruly hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with most hair products it&#x27;s more of a placebo effect rather than an actual result.</li>
            <li> Great hair mask that rinses off completely and leaves hair so soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> My coarse hair feels healthy and frizz free even in the humid summer weather!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, The results are not extremely noticable but there is a difference.</li>
            <li> My Grrrrl swears by this stuff, to the point of where it&#x27;s much more pleasant to track down and purchase, than live with the consequences of her running out</li>
            <li> I found the Enjoy Hair Care Mask very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole line of products is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week on my over treated and heat damaged hair and it make my hair so soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> If your hair needs a pick me up this will make feel healthy and Soft again</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money as I have found nothing else on the market that compares.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and creamy and actually seems to moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair cant feel soft without enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have have purchased so many products at the salon only to get home and think, nothing special.</li>
            <li> It also wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and just slid right out of it in clumps.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Feels soft and easy to style.  </li>
            <li> This makes my bleached out hair feel so soft and strong.</li>
            <li> I go to a salon that uses Enjoy products only so I was already familiar with this product</li>
            <li> I thought there was nothing better, but I&#x27;m always willing to try something new, and my new replacement for this product is believe it or not, Suave, Keratin Infused.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed how soft and smooth your hair will feel.</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair be stronger (even with just one use!)</li>
            <li> Been a fan since they first launched and sold bottles for $13 until they wanted to compete with Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do use conditioner daily and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I think it actually works better than my previous favorite, this product, Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Enjoy hairmask made it soft and look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super soft!</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference with shine and general appearance and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> It feels like a thick, buttery cream when it goes into my hair (sounds gross but is really awesome), and really helps detangle in the shower.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, i use it at least twice a week, very happy</li>
            <li> Years of coloring had left it pretty out of control, but Enjoy has tamed it.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be sure to thoroughly dry the extensions afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second order, which they packaged and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> use it everyday and my hair has never been in such great shape.  </li>
            <li> Makes such a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> They also have a conditions that you spray on towel dried hair that is amazing too.</li>
            <li> Gives you that &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that you feel in your hair when it&#x27;s been really well conditioned, if you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this after using a friends ENJOY Mask, but must&#x27;ve been a different formula because this did nothing for my hair but leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> This works really well for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very silkily and takes away the frizz.  </li>
            <li> intensive smoothing mask was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very course hair that has been damaged.  </li>
            <li> Delivered fast too.</li>
            <li> Also, this price is MUCH cheaper than buying at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Smells good, like coconut and is a thick application..</li>
            <li> you can find the original it is equal to a $250.00 Brazilian blow out at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s always a bit delicate after bleaching it, and the Enjoy hair care Hair Mask always gets it back in tip top shape!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and fairly unruly and frizzy color treated blond hair that really needs to be tamed.</li>
            <li> This works better and in less time.</li>
            <li> I then tie a plastic bag over the top of my head covering all my hair to keep it damp while I watch TV for a half hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product previously and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Also I got several compliments on my hair when I first began using it!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it is so much healthier since I have been using it.,</li>
            <li> I wish they carried other Enjoy products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a heavy duty conditioner than a mask and it leaves my hair uber silky and soft</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very soft but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> So soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I first started using it back in 2007</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have a hard time finding it.  </li>
            <li> it leave the hair soft but nothing else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I now use it once a week  - makes my hair really soft and manageable -</li>
            <li> After I finish styling, it makes my hair soft, manageable, and silky.</li>
            <li> This hair mask leaves my hair silky soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy Professional Hair care .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I could say it made my hair luxuriously soft</li>
            <li> I use it daily with a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li> Add moisture and restores that soft silky feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair suuuuper soft</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky soft.  </li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I color treat the heck out of my hair which leaves it pretty dry and damaged in the lower section.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Cant live without this stuff - changed my entire look!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a real life saver for dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be a must buy especially since I had such high hopes per all the 5* reviews!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much, so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week to keep my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly dry hair, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Based on the amazing 5 star reviews I read here on Amazon, I bought this product for my very dry, thin and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Left on longer than suggested time, left hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Only product that really works on my coarse, dry hair!  </li>
            <li> No long term effects.</li>
            <li> I have straight slinky hair and using anything in my hair weighs it down</li>
            <li> even though I use Kerastase and other high end hair products.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel less damage after all the coloring, straight ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> First I apply on wet hair after shower, blow dry, twist up, then leave in for several hours, and finally wash out.</li>
            <li> I have extremely course dry hair and with the help of a new hair dryer and this stuff, the bleach damage is gone.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering as long as they carry it.</li>
            <li> never really feels the same without this!</li>
            <li> so I know to be sure to get them completely out :(</li>
            <li> would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Did not perform as labeled as an Intensive smoothing mask, for enriching dry hair</li>
            <li> Also use the luxury shampoo and the hair oil before I blow dry and curl.</li>
            <li> , it makes my hair very soft and silky, and it isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Costs way less on Amazon than at my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I am one of those hair product people who tries lots of product.</li>
            <li> This hair masque works wonders on my dry, processed hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> no positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Repairs your hair from damage due to coloring or bleaching.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and my hair</li>
            <li> if your hair is dry and braking this is a little miracle.</li>
            <li> have thick color treated hair and alternate between the hair mask and luxury conditioner.</li>
            <li> but this is just not true...</li>
            <li> Once I apply this mask, my hair does feel different while wet, but nothing can help it once it gets dry and goes back to its freezy curly merino sheep looking bush. :(</li>
            <li> I am a dirty blonde with rather thin, curly, highlighted, and VERY freezy hair.</li>
            <li> and it does not make your hair limp or oily.</li>
            <li> It might be a bit heavy for thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> Or I usually just leave it in while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Kinda pointless</li>
            <li> I have thick hair &amp; this is what my stylist tells me to use.</li>
            <li> and I bought it on Amazon where it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again I was disappointed with lack of basic improvements to frizz and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I am a die hard advocate of this product, however I do believe I found the very secret of why it works so well, Keratin.</li>
            <li> Just wish the manufacturer didn&#x27;t make it impossible to get.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having to cut four inches off my hair because it damaged it so badly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Enjoy it is awesome.  Just wish the manufacturer didn&#x27;t make it impossible to get.  Happy to be able to order from Amazon!  I will keep ordering as long as they carry it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Leaves your hair silky smooth. My hair stylist told me I can leave it for hours if I want to do a deep conditioning treatment. Or I usually just leave it in while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Based on the amazing 5 star reviews I read here on Amazon, I bought this product for my very dry, thin and wavy hair.  I had high hopes and expectations, that this product would be absolutely wonderful, but for me, it did nothing more than condition my hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells great&lt;br /&gt;Yes it leave the hair soft but nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair type, this product did nothing else than what my in shower conditioner does and I want a deep conditioning/hydrating treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it in shower until I&#x27;ve used it all but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Best ever if you want truly nourishing moisture. Gives you that &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that you feel in your hair when it&#x27;s been really well conditioned, if you know what I&#x27;m talking about. I color treat the heck out of my hair which leaves it pretty dry and damaged in the lower section. I actually use this as a daily conditioner, but just use a separate lighter conditioner around the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Awesome &amp; very hydrating. I have thick hair &amp; this is what my stylist tells me to use. It&#x27;s cheaper online of course. I use it 2x per week. Safe for color treated hair too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my hair stylist used it in the salon to give my hair some &amp;#34;nutrients&amp;#34; after coloring my hair.  It makes my hair feel soft and hydrated.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> ENJOY is the Best conditioning and nourishment treatment, by far! I use this mask at least twice a week, wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very good hair product. Hair was chemically treated and felt like straw. Enjoy hairmask made it soft and look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> in comparison to &amp;#34;cortex&amp;#34; which only lasted the day you use it. It lasts long, i use it at least twice a week, very happy</li>
            <li> Fantastic and light!  Very mosturizing w/o making hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> very good deep conditioner.. I use it one a week for glossy hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair care product out there. The brand is awesome. The items came correct and in good condition the first time.</li>
            <li> The mask was okay, but with the shampoo and conditioner duo (hydrating formula) I ended up having to cut four inches off my hair because it damaged it so badly.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.  It smells wonderful, it makes my hair very soft and silky, and it isn&#x27;t so heavy that it weighs my hair down.  I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li> Bought this after using a friends ENJOY Mask, but must&#x27;ve been a different formula because this did nothing for my hair but leave it greasy. I use masks all the time so I know to be sure to get them completely out :( shame maybe I&#x27;ll ask to see if she got a different one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I am one of those hair product people who tries lots of product. I have fine hair and this product provides detangle and smoothing without any added weight.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> my friend recommended this product. I now use it once a week  - makes my hair really soft and manageable -</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair look and feel great! I would totally recommend it, has replaced my conditioner for sure!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair feeling amazing and it smells great too! I love enjoy products and this one did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> This works really well for my hair.  I&#x27;ve used Bumble &amp; Bumble and Unite hair masks. This works better and in less time.</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioning treatment I have ever used.  It makes a huge difference with shine and general appearance and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! I use it twice a week on my over treated and heat damaged hair and it make my hair so soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner to use after coloring your hair.  It leaves your hair very soft but not greasy.  It can be used as often as needed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. It feels like a thick, buttery cream when it goes into my hair (sounds gross but is really awesome), and really helps detangle in the shower. After I finish styling, it makes my hair soft, manageable, and silky. Also I got several compliments on my hair when I first began using it! Big fan!</li>
            <li> it makes my hair really soft and feels great. I have blonde Caucasian hair type</li>
            <li> Love it... If your hair needs a pick me up this will make feel healthy and Soft again</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price will do business again. It is as described and works great</li>
            <li> use it everyday and my hair has never been in such great shape.  Years of coloring had left it pretty out of control, but Enjoy has tamed it.  Feels soft and easy to style.  Highly recommend Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very good product, helped repair my hair, continue to use weekly to protect and repair my hair, would by from this seller again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother to apply heat when I use this product.  I simply wash and rinse my hair then rub this lotion on and comb it in.  I then tie a plastic bag over the top of my head covering all my hair to keep it damp while I watch TV for a half hour or so.  Then I rinse thoroughly.  You&#x27;ll be amazed how soft and smooth your hair will feel.</li>
            <li> I go to a salon that uses Enjoy products only so I was already familiar with this product and I love it!  My hair feels so soft, shiny and conditioned after and lays beautifully.  The seller is offering this product for a great price and I actually received it a day earlier than promised.  The product was nicely packaged for safe shipping.  I wish they carried other Enjoy products so I could shop here even more!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible treatment in helping restore health to my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> This hair mask leaves my hair silky soft and shiny. I do not use it every day. I use it once a week. I highly recommend this product and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes my hair feel very silkily and takes away the frizz.  Still a light conditioner, so it can be used every day.</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair be stronger (even with just one use!) if your hair is dry and braking this is a little miracle.</li>
            <li> I am a dirty blonde with rather thin, curly, highlighted, and VERY freezy hair. Once I apply this mask, my hair does feel different while wet, but nothing can help it once it gets dry and goes back to its freezy curly merino sheep looking bush. :(</li>
            <li> Great mask for a great price! Leaves hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> I found the Enjoy Hair Care Mask very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy Professional Hair care .&lt;br /&gt;The intensive smoothing mask was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I followed instructions and left in my hair for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;With no positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I tried  again for 20 minutes with plastic cap and some heat.&lt;br /&gt;Again I was disappointed with lack of basic improvements to frizz and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Did not perform as labeled as an Intensive smoothing mask, for enriching dry hair, I did not find this label to be true.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my hair soft and manageable! I have extentions and they look and feel great! I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have very course hair that has been damaged.  This product really makes my hair softer and more manageable.  Love it</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it. How ever the story is the same.&lt;br /&gt;They take a great product. And reformulate.&lt;br /&gt;If you can find the original it is equal to a $250.00 Brazilian blow out at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for over a month now and honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair. As with most hair products it&#x27;s more of a placebo effect rather than an actual result. My hair is very fine and gets weighed down easily, this product doesn&#x27;t add any weight, which I liked. As for split end repair, this is why I bought the mask, I have seen no difference whatsoever. Wish I could say it made my hair luxuriously soft but this is just not true... All in all, I&#x27;m not 100% against using it. It won&#x27;t be a must buy especially since I had such high hopes per all the 5* reviews! Although it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product previously and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to soften and de frizz dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and feel of my hair after using Enjoy hair mask!! I leave it in as a leave-in conditioner and sometimes use it as a daily conditioner too if I need extra attention.</li>
            <li> Only product that really works on my coarse, dry hair!  Have tried many others, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I use it daily with a gentle shampoo. It tends to leave residue after a while so I use a weekly clarifying shampoo too. very happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. I have extremely course dry hair and with the help of a new hair dryer and this stuff, the bleach damage is gone. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Smells great, leaves hair silky and hydrated. Revived my extensions! I use this 1-2 times a week along with the enjoy shampoo and conditioner. Best products I have come across!</li>
            <li> Great product.  A hairstylist used it on me and I bought it on Amazon where it was less expensive.  Smells wonderful, works wonderfully to get rid of tangles.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this hair mask. It&#x27;s more like a heavy duty conditioner than a mask and it leaves my hair uber silky and soft</li>
            <li> For the best results use it once a week. First I apply on wet hair after shower, blow dry, twist up, then leave in for several hours, and finally wash out. You will be amazed!I</li>
            <li> Great products - leave hair silky smooth! Really can see a difference in texture and manageability of hair very quickly!</li>
            <li> Love it. Conditions my daughters curly unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Love Enjoy hair products .... This is great as a deep conditioner 2 to 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;Great for colored hair, weightless and smells great....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. The whole hair care line is great! Smells good, like coconut and is a thick application.. Repairs your hair from damage due to coloring or bleaching. I give this a big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great hair mask that rinses off completely and leaves hair so soft, silky and shiny. A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love using this stuff. Use as a mask for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my curly hair.  Add moisture and restores that soft silky feeling.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Didn&#x27;t make it softer or anything. It also wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair and just slid right out of it in clumps.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.....great for keeping my hair nourished &amp; deep conditioned.</li>
            <li> Eh... It does not smell good, makes my hair feel kind of gross after it and it does not style well. Maybe its just my hair.. not all products will work for your hair. everyone is different. but i won&#x27;t buy this again ever!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair suuuuper soft I love it</li>
            <li> The best mask I have ever used and I have used plenty.</li>
            <li> Makes such a huge difference in my hair. So soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair.  I love the way I can style after using Enjoy Hair Mask.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First time user and I&#x27;m in love! Left on longer than suggested time, left hair incredibly soft and manageable. Perfect for wavy thick, unruly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update... I&#x27;m hooked! I just purchased my second order, which they packaged and shipped quickly! I will never buy another bottle of conditioner again! Since using this product, the health of my hair has changed dramatically. My frizz and split ends are non existing. I haven&#x27;t had a trim in almost a year and you can&#x27;t even tell! Best discovery since finding &#x27;it&#x27;s a 10&#x27; lite leave in conditioner/hair protection. I would give this product a perfect 10 if possible!</li>
            <li> This hair masque works wonders on my dry, processed hair without weighing it down.  I use it as my every day conditioner and it keeps my hair looking great.  Costs way less on Amazon than at my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> As a Hairstylist, I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. This makes my bleached out hair feel so soft and strong. One of my favorites still after almost 10 years!</li>
            <li> hair ruined by extensions, enjoy came to the rescue! In 2 weeks my hair is healthier and fuller, love!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have a hard time finding it.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a better price than my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I like this hair mask and it feels nice when I first use it but the day after my hair feels the same. No long term effects. Kinda pointless</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week to keep my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and fairly unruly and frizzy color treated blond hair that really needs to be tamed. This works about the best that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Makes your hair so soft. Delivered fast too.</li>
            <li> Been using along time. My salon sometimes sells out. Great product! If You continue to carry this product, I will continue to order. Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
            <li> was not any good did not do what it said it would do stuck with it seller would not refund it.</li>
            <li> Best mask! Have used for years and love it. I have very thick hair and I can comb through it like butter when applying in the shower. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product brings moister back into my hair. My hair looks fuller and softer. This product is a must have for my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for dry hair.  One of my favorites!!  Great price and will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair super soft! It does the job. I have thick curly dry hair, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes my hair feel less damage after all the coloring, straight ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using Enjoy for about 7 years now. Been a fan since they first launched and sold bottles for $13 until they wanted to compete with Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick color treated hair and alternate between the hair mask and luxury conditioner. Also use the luxury shampoo and the hair oil before I blow dry and curl. Definitely worth the money as I have found nothing else on the market that compares.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for all hair types</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and creamy and actually seems to moisturize my hair.  My hair&#x27;s always a bit delicate after bleaching it, and the Enjoy hair care Hair Mask always gets it back in tip top shape!  a total must have for me!</li>
            <li> I have have purchased so many products at the salon only to get home and think, nothing special. NOT the case with this product! This stuff is a real life saver for dry brittle hair. I use it all the time, not just as a deep conditioner and it does not make your hair limp or oily. You will be happy with your purchase! They also have a conditions that you spray on towel dried hair that is amazing too. The whole line of products is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. have used for several years. I have straight slinky hair and using anything in my hair weighs it down but I do use conditioner daily and this is my favorite.  A little goes a long way.  My hair dresser has used this product also for the 10 years that I have been going to her.</li>
            <li> Great product recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I love this! My coarse hair feels healthy and frizz free even in the humid summer weather!</li>
            <li> My hair cant feel soft without enjoy! I have tried other products and my hair never really feels the same without this!</li>
            <li> I like the results after I used this. My hair was conditioned and shiny! I love Enjoy products, mask, shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Cant live without this stuff - changed my entire look!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product.  The scent is amazing, The results are not extremely noticable but there is a difference.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a stylist and loves this hair mask. It does a great job making hair soft and shiny. Also, this price is MUCH cheaper than buying at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Great deep hair conditioner mask at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  My hair feels silky soft.  You immediately feel the softness.  It might be a bit heavy for thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this mask.  My hair is so soft and it is so much healthier since I have been using it.,</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING, great for tangly hair, damaged hair hair extensions. I am a die hard advocate of this product, however I do believe I found the very secret of why it works so well, Keratin. I thought there was nothing better, but I&#x27;m always willing to try something new, and my new replacement for this product is believe it or not, Suave, Keratin Infused. I think it actually works better than my previous favorite, this product, Enjoy. So if you want to try it this works great, if you want to try something better, try Suave Keratin Infused.</li>
            <li> I have tried them ALL but this remains the best!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes hair feel and look wonderful.  Would definitely buy again.  Don&#x27;t need much, so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Favorite Hair Mask!! I first started using it back in 2007 and I always come back to it.. even though I use Kerastase and other high end hair products.</li>
            <li> This does a nice job at conditioning and softening hair. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing treatment</li>
            <li> this is wonderful..&lt;br /&gt;what a difference it has made. WOW</li>
            <li> Really great for remy and/or human hair extensions, it helps A LOT with the tangling and matting that happens around the nape of the neck.  And it definitely extends the life of your extensions.  You just have to be sure to thoroughly dry the extensions afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky like a waterfall after using this hair mask. It&#x27;s so smooth that even makes me wonder if everything is actually good for me. Kind of like eating a McDonald&#x27;s hashbrown. Too good to be true</li>
