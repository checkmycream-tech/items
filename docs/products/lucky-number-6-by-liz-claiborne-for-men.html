            <li>This is my all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li>So many men&#x27;s fragances today either smell like tobacco and coffee;</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me wheeze like many men&#x27;s colognes.  </li>

            <li>I love this scent on my husband and he likes it too, but we can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere</li>
            <li>Have used this product before and could not find it in my area any more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend buying any kind of fragrances online unless you are already familiar with what it smells like.</li>
            <li>Nice rich sandlewood and spice scent.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews on this cologne were all true, this fragrance is just simply beautiful.</li>
            <li>Though it took a little while to be delivered, this was a great product and it came in great condition.</li>
            <li>Though it took a little while to be delivered, this was a great product and it came in great condition.</li>
            <li>It was also cheap but smelled 10x better than this.  </li>
            <li>Great deal by far.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, but after spraying my body and shirt, the smell disappears in about an hour.  </li>
            <li>On time transaction and very satisfied with the product! Will definitely buy again from this seller soon!</li>
            <li>I truly believe it&#x27;s the musky aroma of pheasant and baby fleece that this cologne so accurately captures.</li>
            <li>I think it was a great buy, I bought it as a Christmas present...</li>
            <li>It smells kinda cheap and like alcohol.</li>
            <li>After 20 years of searching for that scent I am happy to say that I have finally found it.</li>
            <li>it might not even register the light, leathery, vanilla, baby powder</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 16 year old son but it smells so good</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought it right then.</li>
            <li>it was 40$+ for the same bottle), but it&#x27;s unique and awesome... and women seem to really like it.  </li>
            <li>bottle is a VERY nice size and in a red glass bottle with the dragon on it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sad because it is really that good.</li>
            <li>First, this product was able to be sent to APO/FPO address.    </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I like its unique smell and</li>
            <li>I like the scent and so do many others evidently.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally Christmas 2006.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m gonna try to shovel this stuff on my 17 year old nephew because maybe it&#x27;s more appropriate for his age group.  </li>
            <li>I always look for fragrances that are clean, aromatic, enticing but not obtrusive or obnoxious.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong but has a fresh and clean scent.</li>
            <li>I am buying some for my man right now as a matter of fact!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>But, since the second time I wore it, she&#x27;s loved it.  </li>
            <li>Still not a bad fragrance,</li>
            <li>Many options available through this retailer, such as gift sets, and a great mid price scent.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time at work while wearing Lucky Number 6.</li>
            <li>My favorite Cologne for my husband so far!!</li>
            <li>Very masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li>Came fast!!</li>
            <li>This is more musky and mature.</li>
            <li>This is the second bottle for my husband and my son also liked it, and you know that can be tricky.</li>
            <li>For the price, its worth buying.</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t project worth a damn.</li>
            <li>As for the scent it is a nice different blend of aromas.</li>
            <li>I first found Lucky No. 6 at a department store soon after it came out.</li>
            <li>Shipping was on time, and company is quick and willing to help resolve any issues that may arise.</li>
            <li>it is very strong and will clear a room if you use to much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use this with mutliple sprays right before I get out of the car or immediately before an event because it just won&#x27;t let itself be known.</li>
            <li>What i wanted and at the right price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly strong but very masculine and not too obnoxious.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff cheap on amazon expecting high quality cologne.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the most compliments I have ever gotten was off Lucky 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i have noticed alot more girls just standing closer to me in general, hugging me for no reason and talking to me.      </li>
            <li>Small great.</li>
            <li>Smells a little different which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great smell, pretty long lasting, good for younger and older men.  </li>
            <li>Luckily we had his last bottle still on hand to easily swap the tops out without having to return the item.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My First Cologne.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Exactly how I remembered the smell.</li>
            <li>so just be aware the scent out of the bottle</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s something with which you must experiment first.</li>
            <li>My wife didn&#x27;t like it the first time I put it on...</li>
            <li>Someday I will travel the globe and find steady work, but in the meantime I will douse myself in Lucky Number 6 and scam on cougars.</li>
            <li>The first time I caught a whiff of a man walking by with the Llucky 6 on  </li>
            <li>(Even if you don&#x27;t at least we can have that fantasy) LOL.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and wear it daily.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, when a woman gets close to you and smells this cologne, you&#x27;ll get an interested eye and a complement ;)</li>
            <li>, that you should definitely avoid it so that there is more for me.</li>
            <li>The cologne smell great itself but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Very masculin scent that actually gets better the longer</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, light, a little spicy, different than most other colognes.  </li>
            <li>Retail wrapped, came earlier than expected, and the low price was the best part.</li>
            <li>Although \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;, a Lucky Brand cologne, is also made by a Liz Claiborne company and has a similar name, these two are nothing at all alike.</li>
            <li>I recommend and will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a little bit on my hand, and my hand smelled amazing for hours and hours afterward.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty much the same but quite a bit lighter than the original.</li>
            <li>Great everyday scent that last all day</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>the aroma is very</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>But the cologne itself I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, package was missing the Katana, but it&#x27;s a nice looking bottle and box.</li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments on this than any of my other colognes.</li>
            <li>I am a long way from fashion model material but my finely sculpted forearms combined with this irresistible scent makes me a magnet to the ladies.</li>
            <li>The cologne was original, with its classic scent lasting the day.</li>
            <li>Just know that it doesn&#x27;t last the full day and fades sooner than desirable.</li>
            <li>a definite must have at a price that is super affordable</li>
            <li>favorite cologne in a BIG bottle at a low price</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not even in the same category as \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Only writing a review to let people know that I actually think it smells better leaving the bottle in the truck.  </li>
            <li>so far all the compliments have been positive and I appreciate that no one can name what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may have to follow him where he is going to make sure other women are leaving their hands off of him!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite for a few years.</li>
            <li>The Lucky Number 6 scent is very pleasing to the senses and subtle, making it a good choice if you want to be low key.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate buying this again and at the current price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love cologne and wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly but the top was broken.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is very captivating, there are some subtle but noticeable notes that just make your senses come alive...</li>
            <li>When I walk into a bar or any other establishment filled with \\&quot;honeys\\&quot;, people notice.</li>
            <li>This cologne came new and was shipped on time, although I should&#x27;ve upgraded to quicker shipping.  </li>
            <li>It has a very soft scent of sandalwood that keeps getting smoother as the time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item sells for a much higher price in our local retail outlets, and is a quality scent that gets compliments all the time.  </li>
            <li>First and last time I do that.</li>
            <li>Not the first or last time</li>
            <li>Mild perfume ,not the intensity that I expected</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent with hints of sandalwood though remains very fragrant and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Strong and very masculine - the only downside is it&#x27;s not that long lasting</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how old these people are or what they&#x27;re accustomed to wearing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this cologne became so cheap (a few years ago when it was advertised in Maxim</li>
            <li>The package had that old guy smell to it, but I gave it a try anyways.</li>
            <li>The old guy smell went away, but it&#x27;s not one of those soothing smells like Unforgiven by Sean John.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son; whose 19 years old likes it and wears it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a masculine scent...</li>
            <li>When I was 13 years old</li>
            <li>For young men specifically.</li>
            <li>Probably not a cologne a 45 year old man would wear.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old</li>
            <li>Must be an old batch.</li>
            <li>That is in comparison to many other expensive colognes; I enjoy this one so much</li>
            <li>One was my first bottle of Lucky 6 (the other was Acqua Di Gio back when I was younger) .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly strong and will last about half a day or so.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a different spin on a classic fragrance, but this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fragrance must has been a fake because it did not smell good and did not last.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is that I bought some of the original lucky brand about 4 years ago and that stuff isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li>No regrets for buying it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through only a couple variations in cologne so far in life and this one stands out about the rest.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a few compliments.</li>
            <li>The scent is not the same it is full of alcohol and you practically have to spray the half of a bottle for it to smell an hour later.</li>
            <li>I bought this ga&#x27;bage  because of the amount of positive reviews and because of the price thinking that I had initially found a hidden gem.  </li>

            <li> Its amazing when I put it on</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews and regret to say that this is a better room spray than worn.</li>

            <li> First and foremost, women absolutely love this cologne!!</li>
            <li> This is more like a \\&quot;Fisher Price</li>
            <li> At this price ($15.61 including tax and shipping to NY), I can&#x27;t imagine a better deal for a bottle of cologne.</li>

            <li> As the title says Ive always love the smell of this cologne as well as Mambo, i just wish</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li> So many men&#x27;s fragances today either smell like tobacco and coffee;</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me wheeze like many men&#x27;s colognes.  </li>
            <li> There are much better colognes out there</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and the price.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for this cologne for a while - I love this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  </li>

            <li> Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my husband and he likes it too, but we can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and could not find it in my area any more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying any kind of fragrances online unless you are already familiar with what it smells like.</li>
            <li> Nice rich sandlewood and spice scent.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews on this cologne were all true, this fragrance is just simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> Though it took a little while to be delivered, this was a great product and it came in great condition.</li>
            <li> Though it took a little while to be delivered, this was a great product and it came in great condition.</li>
            <li> It was also cheap but smelled 10x better than this.  </li>
            <li> Great deal by far.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, but after spraying my body and shirt, the smell disappears in about an hour.  </li>
            <li> On time transaction and very satisfied with the product! Will definitely buy again from this seller soon!</li>
            <li> I truly believe it&#x27;s the musky aroma of pheasant and baby fleece that this cologne so accurately captures.</li>
            <li> I think it was a great buy, I bought it as a Christmas present...</li>
            <li> It smells kinda cheap and like alcohol.</li>
            <li> After 20 years of searching for that scent I am happy to say that I have finally found it.</li>
            <li> it might not even register the light, leathery, vanilla, baby powder</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 16 year old son but it smells so good</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought it right then.</li>
            <li> it was 40$+ for the same bottle), but it&#x27;s unique and awesome... and women seem to really like it.  </li>
            <li> bottle is a VERY nice size and in a red glass bottle with the dragon on it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sad because it is really that good.</li>
            <li> First, this product was able to be sent to APO/FPO address.    </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like its unique smell and</li>
            <li> I like the scent and so do many others evidently.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally Christmas 2006.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m gonna try to shovel this stuff on my 17 year old nephew because maybe it&#x27;s more appropriate for his age group.  </li>
            <li> I always look for fragrances that are clean, aromatic, enticing but not obtrusive or obnoxious.</li>
            <li> Its not too strong but has a fresh and clean scent.</li>
            <li> I am buying some for my man right now as a matter of fact!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> But, since the second time I wore it, she&#x27;s loved it.  </li>
            <li> Still not a bad fragrance,</li>
            <li> Many options available through this retailer, such as gift sets, and a great mid price scent.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time at work while wearing Lucky Number 6.</li>
            <li> My favorite Cologne for my husband so far!!</li>
            <li> Very masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li> Came fast!!</li>
            <li> This is more musky and mature.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle for my husband and my son also liked it, and you know that can be tricky.</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth buying.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t project worth a damn.</li>
            <li> As for the scent it is a nice different blend of aromas.</li>
            <li> I first found Lucky No. 6 at a department store soon after it came out.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time, and company is quick and willing to help resolve any issues that may arise.</li>
            <li> it is very strong and will clear a room if you use to much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this with mutliple sprays right before I get out of the car or immediately before an event because it just won&#x27;t let itself be known.</li>
            <li> What i wanted and at the right price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly strong but very masculine and not too obnoxious.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff cheap on amazon expecting high quality cologne.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the most compliments I have ever gotten was off Lucky 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have noticed alot more girls just standing closer to me in general, hugging me for no reason and talking to me.      </li>
            <li> Small great.</li>
            <li> Smells a little different which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great smell, pretty long lasting, good for younger and older men.  </li>
            <li> Luckily we had his last bottle still on hand to easily swap the tops out without having to return the item.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My First Cologne.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Exactly how I remembered the smell.</li>
            <li> so just be aware the scent out of the bottle</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s something with which you must experiment first.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it the first time I put it on...</li>
            <li> Someday I will travel the globe and find steady work, but in the meantime I will douse myself in Lucky Number 6 and scam on cougars.</li>
            <li> The first time I caught a whiff of a man walking by with the Llucky 6 on  </li>
            <li> (Even if you don&#x27;t at least we can have that fantasy) LOL.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and wear it daily.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, when a woman gets close to you and smells this cologne, you&#x27;ll get an interested eye and a complement ;)</li>
            <li> , that you should definitely avoid it so that there is more for me.</li>
            <li> The cologne smell great itself but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very masculin scent that actually gets better the longer</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, light, a little spicy, different than most other colognes.  </li>
            <li> Retail wrapped, came earlier than expected, and the low price was the best part.</li>
            <li> Although \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;, a Lucky Brand cologne, is also made by a Liz Claiborne company and has a similar name, these two are nothing at all alike.</li>
            <li> I recommend and will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little bit on my hand, and my hand smelled amazing for hours and hours afterward.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty much the same but quite a bit lighter than the original.</li>
            <li> Great everyday scent that last all day</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> the aroma is very</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> But the cologne itself I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, package was missing the Katana, but it&#x27;s a nice looking bottle and box.</li>
            <li> I have gotten more compliments on this than any of my other colognes.</li>
            <li> I am a long way from fashion model material but my finely sculpted forearms combined with this irresistible scent makes me a magnet to the ladies.</li>
            <li> The cologne was original, with its classic scent lasting the day.</li>
            <li> Just know that it doesn&#x27;t last the full day and fades sooner than desirable.</li>
            <li> a definite must have at a price that is super affordable</li>
            <li> favorite cologne in a BIG bottle at a low price</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not even in the same category as \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Only writing a review to let people know that I actually think it smells better leaving the bottle in the truck.  </li>
            <li> so far all the compliments have been positive and I appreciate that no one can name what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may have to follow him where he is going to make sure other women are leaving their hands off of him!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for a few years.</li>
            <li> The Lucky Number 6 scent is very pleasing to the senses and subtle, making it a good choice if you want to be low key.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate buying this again and at the current price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love cologne and wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but the top was broken.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very captivating, there are some subtle but noticeable notes that just make your senses come alive...</li>
            <li> When I walk into a bar or any other establishment filled with \\&quot;honeys\\&quot;, people notice.</li>
            <li> This cologne came new and was shipped on time, although I should&#x27;ve upgraded to quicker shipping.  </li>
            <li> It has a very soft scent of sandalwood that keeps getting smoother as the time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item sells for a much higher price in our local retail outlets, and is a quality scent that gets compliments all the time.  </li>
            <li> First and last time I do that.</li>
            <li> Not the first or last time</li>
            <li> Mild perfume ,not the intensity that I expected</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent with hints of sandalwood though remains very fragrant and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Strong and very masculine - the only downside is it&#x27;s not that long lasting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how old these people are or what they&#x27;re accustomed to wearing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this cologne became so cheap (a few years ago when it was advertised in Maxim</li>
            <li> The package had that old guy smell to it, but I gave it a try anyways.</li>
            <li> The old guy smell went away, but it&#x27;s not one of those soothing smells like Unforgiven by Sean John.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son; whose 19 years old likes it and wears it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a masculine scent...</li>
            <li> When I was 13 years old</li>
            <li> For young men specifically.</li>
            <li> Probably not a cologne a 45 year old man would wear.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old</li>
            <li> Must be an old batch.</li>
            <li> That is in comparison to many other expensive colognes; I enjoy this one so much</li>
            <li> One was my first bottle of Lucky 6 (the other was Acqua Di Gio back when I was younger) .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly strong and will last about half a day or so.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a different spin on a classic fragrance, but this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This fragrance must has been a fake because it did not smell good and did not last.</li>
            <li> The funny thing is that I bought some of the original lucky brand about 4 years ago and that stuff isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> No regrets for buying it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through only a couple variations in cologne so far in life and this one stands out about the rest.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a few compliments.</li>
            <li> The scent is not the same it is full of alcohol and you practically have to spray the half of a bottle for it to smell an hour later.</li>
            <li> I bought this ga&#x27;bage  because of the amount of positive reviews and because of the price thinking that I had initially found a hidden gem.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find and unique, no one has this smell.</li>
            <li> Comes on a little sweet but settles with a little musk.</li>
            <li> One bottle was factory sealed with clear plastic, the other was not.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and the spray nozzle gives too much of a blast.</li>
            <li> last very long though.</li>
            <li> I typically use Armani and more expensive scents, but this is my daily go-to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I recently found Stetson Black to be a very similar scent</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box Lucky 6 came in, I was kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, or ladies, if you&#x27;re tired of not hitting the right notes with your scent, try this.  </li>
            <li> For me, a 29 year old business owner; to parade in this to work, church, or even an after work function (</li>
            <li> : You only need one to one and a half sprays of this.</li>
            <li> I often dreamed of a smell that would capture both my raw and primal side and my unparalleled sensitivity towards nature and the human race.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you are tired of femme smelling \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; colognes.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell can change due to your body&#x27;s pH</li>
            <li> I know the heat normally changes the smell for the worse</li>
            <li> Found this product at a small retail store down in CA a while back, and could not find it again, until checking Amazon.</li>
            <li> an hydroponic plum scent smells lightly herbal not a very strong unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> My other half loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> every time I wore it, I got at least one compliment from a different girl all the time.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not nearly as sweet as some of the other colognes that I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cologne didn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s box.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered two bottles to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> But it softens, and is an eau de toilette which I have always been told is a watered down cologne.  </li>
            <li> does not always mean it will smell the same on your body.    </li>
            <li> He had lots of trouble with other brands he used before this one..</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne after using Polo Black for a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love when my boyfriend wears this cologne the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the seller did a terrible job packing and shipping, the spray nozzle came damaged and some had spilled in the package and soaked the box.</li>
            <li> I have to put my wrist or elbow up to my skin to smell it and even then, its so subtle, the person close enough to smell</li>
            <li> After every first spray I think to myself, dang, this stinks.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to search around several websites before finding it as it is no longer a common brand found on the kiosk at a department store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT RICH BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION</li>
            <li> a citrus salad or, the worst, your father, because it was the only thing available.</li>
            <li> I like Issey, Purple Label, Mont Blanc, Curve Chill, Realities and a few others.  </li>
            <li> This is not an everyday cologne, but something that you would wear to an evening event.</li>
            <li> MUCH LESS A FORMAL SOCIAL GATHERING) would be absurd.  </li>
            <li> Although I never made it to Ecuador, I am afraid of heights, and I cannot bear to be in enclosed spaces, this masculine scent exudes otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for the past 2 years and have racked up over six phone numbers</li>
            <li> No love for this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but as the bottle would suggest it has oriental notes and some woody notes.</li>
            <li> That sucks.</li>
            <li> It stirs an air of romance and mystery with subtle notes of sensativity that women like to think our men have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is no longer in production, but it is very hard to find now.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Tough to find a weakness... except that you might want something else to shake things up sometimes.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this fragrance for years and l never have tired of it.</li>
            <li> Very subtle fragrance</li>
            <li> but it is very subtle yet enticing.</li>
            <li> My gf likes this cologne and after exhausting all means, was unable to find here in Korea.  </li>
            <li> you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Definitely a casual scent, and not the \\&quot;I want to impress,\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very captivating, there are some subtle but noticeable notes that just make your senses come alive... a definite must have at a price that is super affordable</li>
            <li> The cologne was original, with its classic scent lasting the day. No regrets for buying it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> On time transaction and very satisfied with the product! Will definitely buy again from this seller soon! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s different, but not TOO different.  I wished it lasted longer though.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I bought this ga&#x27;bage  because of the amount of positive reviews and because of the price thinking that I had initially found a hidden gem.  INCORRECT.  I don&#x27;t know how old these people are or what they&#x27;re accustomed to wearing but this just ain&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;m not trying to hurt anyones feelings but I&#x27;m gonna try to shovel this stuff on my 17 year old nephew because maybe it&#x27;s more appropriate for his age group.  This is more like a \\&quot;Fisher Price My First Cologne.\\&quot;  For me, a 29 year old business owner; to parade in this to work, church, or even an after work function (MUCH LESS A FORMAL SOCIAL GATHERING) would be absurd.  The funny thing is that I bought some of the original lucky brand about 4 years ago and that stuff isn&#x27;t bad.  It was also cheap but smelled 10x better than this.  Please, b4 you buy this product, look for it in your local stores and get a tester sample.  For my tastes I like Issey, Purple Label, Mont Blanc, Curve Chill, Realities and a few others.  I&#x27;M NOT RICH BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION (yet) so with the exception of purple label, none of those fragrances cost over $40.  Do yourself a favor and try one of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this cologne became so cheap (a few years ago when it was advertised in Maxim it was 40$+ for the same bottle), but it&#x27;s unique and awesome... and women seem to really like it.  At this price ($15.61 including tax and shipping to NY), I can&#x27;t imagine a better deal for a bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for a few years. Very subtle fragrance</li>
            <li> favorite cologne in a BIG bottle at a low price</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box Lucky 6 came in, I was kinda disappointed. The package had that old guy smell to it, but I gave it a try anyways. After about ten minutes of wearing it, I decided that I did like it. The old guy smell went away, but it&#x27;s not one of those soothing smells like Unforgiven by Sean John. Not a 5 star cologne, but that&#x27;s my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, package was missing the Katana, but it&#x27;s a nice looking bottle and box.</li>
            <li> This cologne came new and was shipped on time, although I should&#x27;ve upgraded to quicker shipping.  My husband loves this cologne and we couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this perfume from perfumania, but after looking at the sale price for this item then I went ahead and got it.  I was happy with the scent when I purchased it before, but please do not buy from this seller.  The scent is not the same it is full of alcohol and you practically have to spray the half of a bottle for it to smell an hour later.</li>
            <li> First, this product was able to be sent to APO/FPO address.    My gf likes this cologne and after exhausting all means, was unable to find here in Korea.  The Lucky Number 6 scent is very pleasing to the senses and subtle, making it a good choice if you want to be low key.</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne after using Polo Black for a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works for me.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a girl or your father.  My fianc&amp;eacute; loves it as well and that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, or ladies, if you&#x27;re tired of not hitting the right notes with your scent, try this.  I can all but promise you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found it on Amazon.  Stores around here and where I work don&#x27;t offer it anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews and regret to say that this is a better room spray than worn. A teenager or meathead can get away with this crappy scent but if you want to have tasteful approval then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My favorite Cologne for my husband so far!! Great price.</li>
            <li> Though it took a little while to be delivered, this was a great product and it came in great condition. The friend I purchased it for loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling cologne for men. You know its there but its not over powering.</li>
            <li> this is such a great product!  they are sold for 40$+ at the mall so i got it here.    this product smells very very good and trust me when i say this, it works!    im 17 years old and not the best looking and i have noticed alot more girls just standing closer to me in general, hugging me for no reason and talking to me.      if your a guy you will not regret getting this!</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price - a bargain buy! and a good one at that. Saw Lucky6 among the best reviewed men&#x27;s EDT sprays in 2009-10 and took a punt. Strong and very masculine - the only downside is it&#x27;s not that long lasting but since it&#x27;s not an EDP i&#x27;d take that. Definitely worth a few compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son; whose 19 years old likes it and wears it often.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like sandalwood, amber, flora an hydroponic plum scent smells lightly herbal not a very strong unpleasant smell the aroma is very manly.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a VERY nice size and in a red glass bottle with the dragon on it. I think it was a great buy, I bought it as a Christmas present...I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will buy it over and over again. This is the best way to spend $20!!!!! Simply awesome</li>
            <li> Exactly how I remembered the smell. Retail wrapped, came earlier than expected, and the low price was the best part.</li>
            <li> I bought this for 35US before the price was dropped to 13US. Its an amazing fragrance however its power dies after 4 hours. So you have to respray it.   every time I wore it, I got at least one compliment from a different girl all the time.    The bottle was slippery and it broke when I dropped it.</li>
            <li> Although \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;, a Lucky Brand cologne, is also made by a Liz Claiborne company and has a similar name, these two are nothing at all alike. This is more musky and mature. Still not a bad fragrance, but it&#x27;s not even in the same category as \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;. I was hoping for a different spin on a classic fragrance, but this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy it again, though.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle for my husband and my son also liked it, and you know that can be tricky.</li>
            <li> After every first spray I think to myself, dang, this stinks.  But it softens, and is an eau de toilette which I have always been told is a watered down cologne.  It will help to treat your shirts as you would with a cologne, the smell lasted and I actually prefer the smell at the end of the day than just after application.    Definitely a casual scent, and not the \\&quot;I want to impress,\\&quot; scent.  If you like to smell good, this is good variety, but if your looking for the invisible I.D. you might want to keep looking.    I do like the scent, especially infused with motor exhaust off my bike!  Not quite the punctuation of the fifth star, however.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this. I don&#x27;t recommend buying any kind of fragrances online unless you are already familiar with what it smells like. Also, the smell can change due to your body&#x27;s pH so just be aware the scent out of the bottle does not always mean it will smell the same on your body.    I first found Lucky No. 6 at a department store soon after it came out. I loved it so much I bought it right then. I paid a lot more money than what it&#x27;s being sold for now but I&#x27;m not sad because it is really that good. So you understand my taste in men&#x27;s cologne, I like Polo, Tommy Bahama, Burberry Brit etc. I think if you like those, you would probably like this as well. A little does go a long way and the spray nozzle gives too much of a blast. I&#x27;d rather have it without the spray bottle but that&#x27;s just my preference. I have gotten more compliments on this than any of my other colognes. This is not the most popular cologne out there and for that I&#x27;m thankful. I like its unique smell and so far all the compliments have been positive and I appreciate that no one can name what I&#x27;m wearing. I would not hesitate buying this again and at the current price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find and unique, no one has this smell. I think this is invincible aroma for Asian (Korean,. Etc)men to meet the female.</li>
            <li> This item sells for a much higher price in our local retail outlets, and is a quality scent that gets compliments all the time.  Highly recommended if you are tired of femme smelling \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; colognes.</li>
            <li> As the title says Ive always love the smell of this cologne as well as Mambo, i just wish theyd keep making mambo or selling it in stores</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite scent. It&#x27;s fairly strong but very masculine and not too obnoxious. It&#x27;s hard to describe but as the bottle would suggest it has oriental notes and some woody notes. I&#x27;d grab a bottle while you can because I never see it in stores anymore and I think it&#x27;s been discontinued. I recently found Stetson Black to be a very similar scent and it&#x27;s also inexpensive, so check that out if you can&#x27;t find this one.</li>
            <li> Found this product at a small retail store down in CA a while back, and could not find it again, until checking Amazon. Great deal by far. Many options available through this retailer, such as gift sets, and a great mid price scent. I typically use Armani and more expensive scents, but this is my daily go-to. Shipping was on time, and company is quick and willing to help resolve any issues that may arise. Definitely check them out.</li>
            <li> I practically bathe in this...love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> My daughter told me that her husband liked this cologne but it was no longer being sold.  I purchased this as a gift for him for Christmas and he was very thrilled.  A great price too.</li>
            <li> I recommend was excellent buy</li>
            <li> I always look for fragrances that are clean, aromatic, enticing but not obtrusive or obnoxious. So many men&#x27;s fragances today either smell like tobacco and coffee; a citrus salad or, the worst, your father, because it was the only thing available. I liked \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Lucky 6\\&quot; is excellent as well. But, it&#x27;s something with which you must experiment first. If you don&#x27;t wear it awhile before investing, it may not work with your personal chemistry. That&#x27;s a constant warning. For me, tho, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Got it for my hubby he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful scent. Doesn&#x27;t stain the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Smell stays on all day long. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The ONLY cologne I buy for my husband.  Nice rich sandlewood and spice scent.  Not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make me wheeze like many men&#x27;s colognes.  Great everyday scent that last all day and I can still smell it&#x27;s warm notes when I hug him when he gets home at the end of the day.  Very masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li> ny ex boy friend loved it ! He received daily compliments from men and women.....i thought it smelled very nice also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through only a couple variations in cologne so far in life and this one stands out about the rest.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it the first time I put it on...it&#x27;s not nearly as sweet as some of the other colognes that I&#x27;ve bought.  But, since the second time I wore it, she&#x27;s loved it.  I do too.    It&#x27;s definitely a masculine scent...I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda cheap and like alcohol. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> There are much better colognes out there</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments...</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and the price.</li>
            <li> Good smell. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> great cologne. Have loved it for years.</li>
            <li> My go-to cologne...chiks dig it.  I always receive compliments</li>
            <li> When I was 13 years old I imagined myself as an adventurous cave explorer/cliff diver living in the jungles of Ecuador. I often dreamed of a smell that would capture both my raw and primal side and my unparalleled sensitivity towards nature and the human race. After 20 years of searching for that scent I am happy to say that I have finally found it. Although I never made it to Ecuador, I am afraid of heights, and I cannot bear to be in enclosed spaces, this masculine scent exudes otherwise. When I walk into a bar or any other establishment filled with \\&quot;honeys\\&quot;, people notice. I truly believe it&#x27;s the musky aroma of pheasant and baby fleece that this cologne so accurately captures. I am a long way from fashion model material but my finely sculpted forearms combined with this irresistible scent makes me a magnet to the ladies. I have worn this cologne for the past 2 years and have racked up over six phone numbers and I was even offered someone&#x27;s table when they were leaving. Someday I will travel the globe and find steady work, but in the meantime I will douse myself in Lucky Number 6 and scam on cougars.</li>
            <li> I love cologne and wear it everyday.  I bought this stuff cheap on amazon expecting high quality cologne.  This was designer cologne.  It smells fine, but after spraying my body and shirt, the smell disappears in about an hour.  That sucks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 16 year old son but it smells so good I had to get some for myself.</li>
            <li> Works me UP!! This is one of the best smelling cologne&#x27;s that I have ever had the PLEASURE of smelling. I am a woman who knows what my man should smell like.The first time I caught a whiff of a man walking by with the Llucky 6 on  I actually followed him to stop him and ask what the name of his cologne was. It stirs an air of romance and mystery with subtle notes of sensativity that women like to think our men have. (Even if you don&#x27;t at least we can have that fantasy) LOL. Great Cologne! I am buying some for my man right now as a matter of fact! I may have to follow him where he is going to make sure other women are leaving their hands off of him!!</li>
            <li> You wont be disjointed. Smells a little different which is perfect for me. I like the scent and so do many others evidently. Just know that it doesn&#x27;t last the full day and fades sooner than desirable.</li>
            <li> Though it took a little while to be delivered, this was a great product and it came in great condition. The friend I purchased it for loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad and he loves it, they don&#x27;t sell it at any stores anymore so I found it for him and he loves it!!</li>
            <li> I love this colonge. I wish it came in an even bigger bottle. I may have to buy a 2nd bottle as a back up. Great fragrance, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Comes on a little sweet but settles with a little musk.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this fragrance for years and l never have tired of it. Its not too strong but has a fresh and clean scent.</li>
            <li> Best cologne I have ever worn in 30 + years. That is in comparison to many other expensive colognes; I enjoy this one so much I usually have to search around several websites before finding it as it is no longer a common brand found on the kiosk at a department store. Long lasting scent with hints of sandalwood though remains very fragrant and fresh smelling. Constantly receive compliments on it. Well worth at least a trial period.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this cologne for a while - I love this cologne.  Highly recommend the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think this cologne smells amazing. I sprayed a little bit on my hand, and my hand smelled amazing for hours and hours afterward. It is an awesome cologne and for $18? your stealing it.</li>
            <li> did not like , good scent for someone over 65 .</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  So much more posh than the price.</li>
            <li> Mild perfume ,not the intensity that I expected</li>
            <li> I bought this originally Christmas 2006.  I have purchased replacement sprays on this site 4 different times.  Great price and we love love the smell.</li>
            <li> I had found this fragrance just by chance at a TJ Maxx and bought it at a whim.  So when my husband run out of it, I had to buy it again. It is one you never see advertised but it is very subtle yet enticing.</li>
            <li> I thought they stopped making this cologne.  I was very happy to see that it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> Buy it...... Trust me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and wear it daily.  I get complemented quite often on how good I smell...women love it.  It&#x27;s not overly strong and will last about half a day or so.  Trust me, when a woman gets close to you and smells this cologne, you&#x27;ll get an interested eye and a complement ;)</li>
            <li> Very masculin scent that actually gets better the longer you wear it.  This is not an everyday cologne, but something that you would wear to an evening event. It has a very soft scent of sandalwood that keeps getting smoother as the time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: You only need one to one and a half sprays of this. it is very strong and will clear a room if you use to much.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and I wish Liz Claiborne still sold it. Smells pretty much the same but quite a bit lighter than the original.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling aftershave my husband ever wore! He had lots of trouble with other brands he used before this one..</li>
            <li> No one else should buy this. It&#x27;s been discontinued and smells so good, that you should definitely avoid it so that there is more for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cologne didn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s box. Otherwise, I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it--- my boyfriend had been looking everywhere for it. Perfect Xmas gift.</li>
            <li> This fragrance must has been a fake because it did not smell good and did not last. Threw it out with the trash eventuall. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite men&#x27;s colognes of all time.  Been buying it for years from different vendors.  This vendor I give a 5-Star! for good price, good condition, good delivery time.</li>
            <li> Husband love the sent so do I great choice</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in good condition. My only complaint is that I ordered two bottles to give as gifts.  One bottle was factory sealed with clear plastic, the other was not. So I only gave the sealed one as a gift and let my husband keep the one that wasn&#x27;t factory sealed.</li>
            <li> Women and men love this! I rate this as one of the best for anyone wanting to capture and arouse a man or women.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff, as does my wife. I don&#x27;t know if it is no longer in production, but it is very hard to find now.</li>
            <li> No love for this fragrance.  Made the mistake of buying it without sampling it.  First and last time I do that.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews on this cologne were all true, this fragrance is just simply beautiful. I recommend and will certainly buy again. Give it a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells great for women or men to wear! Great size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> a dutiful feeling comes over me when I wear it  its definitely one of my all time favorites but get the big bottle you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> My other half loves this cologne. It arrived quickly but the top was broken. Luckily we had his last bottle still on hand to easily swap the tops out without having to return the item.</li>
            <li> I love when my boyfriend wears this cologne the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the seller did a terrible job packing and shipping, the spray nozzle came damaged and some had spilled in the package and soaked the box. But the cologne itself I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this smell. Been wearing for almost 10 years. Only writing a review to let people know that I actually think it smells better leaving the bottle in the truck.  I know the heat normally changes the smell for the worse but I think it improves it.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, light, a little spicy, different than most other colognes.  If you want a great scent that isn&#x27;t predicable, give it a try. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different colognes over the years, and have only emptied out two bottles ever.  One was my first bottle of Lucky 6 (the other was Acqua Di Gio back when I was younger) .  Definitely the most compliments I have ever gotten was off Lucky 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great smell, pretty long lasting, good for younger and older men.  Great for work, or on the weekends.  Tough to find a weakness... except that you might want something else to shake things up sometimes.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip - try and get it when it&#x27;s sub $20... it&#x27;s not always that cheap, but a HECK of a deal when it is!!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. It was very hard to find in stores. Also, if you do find it, you&#x27;ll pay much more!</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth buying. Without a doubt, awesome bottle and smells fine initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t project worth a damn. I have to put my wrist or elbow up to my skin to smell it and even then, its so subtle, the person close enough to smell it might not even register the light, leathery, vanilla, baby powder finish it leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this with mutliple sprays right before I get out of the car or immediately before an event because it just won&#x27;t let itself be known. Its amazing when I put it on but I worry that its not being smelled by anyone else but me.</li>
            <li> What i wanted and at the right price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent! Not the first or last time I will buy this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a very good smelling cologne for men. For young men specifically. Probably not a cologne a 45 year old man would wear. I am 25 years old and I find this cologne to be great. First and foremost, women absolutely love this cologne!! I get compliments all the time at work while wearing Lucky Number 6. As for the scent it is a nice different blend of aromas. Once you spray it on you are surrounded by the luxurious smell. As for the fade factor of it, you may feel like it will wear off after several hours, BUT IT ACTUALLY STAYS WITH YOU ALL DAY. I have had women ask tell me I smell delicious at almost the end of my 9 hour shifts at work!! This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. The cologne smell great itself but doesn&#x27;t last long. When I bought it before, it lasted all say. Must be an old batch.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my husband and he likes it too, but we can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere anymore so I was very excited to find it here!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and could not find it in my area any more. Very happy with purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just like I remember.  Came fast!!</li>
            <li> Perfect and Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Small great. The smell&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last very long though.</li>
