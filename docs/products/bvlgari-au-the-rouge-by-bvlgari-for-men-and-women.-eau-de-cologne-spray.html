            <li>I was a bit worried about how my nose would perceive the fig and walnut notes, but Au The Rouge (ATR) turned-out to be a pleasant surprise and one of the best tea scents I have smelled.</li>
            <li>She prefers Beautiful and so do I.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary depending on how your body chemistry reacts with it, but for me its a great all day scent.</li>

            <li>surely another lesson learned on \\&quot;You Pay For What You Get\\&quot; as well as \\&quot;Never Buy Perfume Online\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li>I love this scent!</li>
            <li>I love that it lasts all day!</li>

            <li>include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it won&#x27;t replace au the vert in my heart, but it&#x27;s spicier nature is growing on me.</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive nose to smells/perfumes etc, so this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>There shipping is super fast and the tracking from UPS is superb.  </li>
            <li>i really love it .</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>In order to understand better, let me tell you that \\&quot;Polo Sport\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hugo</li>

            <li>So glad to have found it bc</li>
            <li>My favorite</li>
            <li>I thought that if I was trying to be \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, I would have been better off getting one of those \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; or \\&quot;smell</li>
            <li>I will now order more of my beauty products from Beauty [...]</li>
            <li>I was taking a risk on the scent, because I love au the vert, but this one was untested...</li>
            <li>much as I enjoyed this scent...</li>
            <li>In the end, I feel Gucci Pour Homme II is a perfect night-in cuddle scent for a man whereas Au The Rouge is the female equivalent.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, light scent.  </li>
            <li>Quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>all my favorite perfumes have been discontinued and I love when I can find them.</li>
            <li>great product with a clean fresh scent for either a man or a woman.  </li>
            <li>When I got this cologne it was with free Prime shipping, and for the price this is an excellent daily wear</li>
            <li>Packaging and presentation is very cool.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>right at the opening (think Lipton teabag), which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is o.k., but I will not buy anything but Beautiful in the future.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled a sample bottle and tried it, instantly liked it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent with a heavy warm fig smell, with</li>
            <li>These were free giveaways at the Emirates airline business class.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars, because the scent is rather light.</li>
            <li>It is light, with a touch of the tea notes.  </li>
            <li>I am very much a girly-girl, and I love The Rouge.</li>
            <li>it worth it!</li>
            <li>Maybe Bulgari discontinued this fragrance, but it&#x27;s too cool that it&#x27;s available here.  </li>
            <li>The cellophane overwrap was not sealed on one end, the box itself did not look original, and the so-called perfume was so watered-down (or alcoholed-down, or whatever they did to it)</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>It is so clean and unisex.</li>
            <li>I knew it was the one for my special occasions.     </li>
            <li>Although a man can certainly rock ATR, I feel it is better suited for the females.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to others and will most certainly use again for any and all fragrance needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s woodsy, not flowery or sweet.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and my girl friend love this</li>
            <li>Used a sample I got on an Emirates flight earlier and loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I enjoy wearing Silver Mountain Water and Gucci Pour Homme II because I feel they are a bit more masculine tea fragrances, and SMW lasts 8+ hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>Wears away quickly though.</li>
            <li>a great violet come down.  </li>
            <li>bought a battle of this at Marshall&#x27;s several years ago and found it too powerful for a summer fragrance, but I remembered its fruity, rich, warm scent.  </li>
            <li>and I always worry that the second spray won&#x27;t smell as good as the first one of the day.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes the fig and walnut emerge to give this fragrance a touch of sweetness (but not too sweet), depth and character...which is really very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, not sweet or overpowering in any way.</li>
            <li>It is one of those, which you either like or dislike but at the price its being offered, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try ..    </li>
            <li>this scent is not overpowering but is rather mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the exotic tea and spice scent, as it&#x27;s not a ridiculously saccharine stench like you&#x27;d find at certain stores in the mall and in many other perfumes.</li>
            <li>I really wonder if it&#x27;s original....</li>
            <li>is right up there too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more figgy than tea-y, and really different from the spicy, vanilla-y florals that abound on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it back in my collection.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and good notes of tea ..</li>
            <li>The smell is good, but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Cologne&#x27;s preference is very individualistic, so views may differ.</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>thanks to AMAZON and the people who post their recommendations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>well, much like a man in his prime being released from 30-days of solitary confinement and then housed with the Swedish no-tan-line Bikini Team, this fragrance has no staying power.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much she puts on</li>
            <li>but I will continue to look because I like it just that much.</li>
            <li>you Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>bought this because it was a good deal, or at least appeared to be.</li>
            <li>notice that this particular cologne lasts all day for me, when I get home</li>
            <li>very quick delivery, just as expected!</li>
            <li>However, my favorite of the Bvlgari scents is Green Tea.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite Bvlgari fragrance but the Bvlgari Green Tea</li>
            <li>let the fact that men and women can wear it, the smell is definitely unisex enough that either sex can easily wear this cologne/perfume.  </li>
            <li>It has a raw silk scent in it, and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it and will keep it in my arsenal of everyday use products!</li>
            <li>I must say that Beauty [...] has such a LARGE variety of products from Chanel to Moschino to MAC to DIOR.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft floral scent and it makes me want to home her in my arms and cuddle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly spicy, but also sweet as it dries.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a little diferent from other Bvlgari perfum (lighter) but the essence it´s OK.</li>
            <li>Definitely, its not everyday use.</li>
            <li>I researched beauty encounter and many other online beauty product companies and must say that I give them 10 thumbs up, because I&#x27;m a little scared that the product that I order is a water down version of the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Although this purchase smells exactly the same, just doesn&#x27;t last any longer than a few hours.</li>

            <li> very quick delivery, just as expected!</li>
            <li> However, my favorite of the Bvlgari scents is Green Tea.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite Bvlgari fragrance but the Bvlgari Green Tea</li>
            <li> let the fact that men and women can wear it, the smell is definitely unisex enough that either sex can easily wear this cologne/perfume.  </li>
            <li> It has a raw silk scent in it, and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it and will keep it in my arsenal of everyday use products!</li>
            <li> I must say that Beauty [...] has such a LARGE variety of products from Chanel to Moschino to MAC to DIOR.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft floral scent and it makes me want to home her in my arms and cuddle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly spicy, but also sweet as it dries.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little diferent from other Bvlgari perfum (lighter) but the essence it´s OK.</li>
            <li> Definitely, its not everyday use.</li>
            <li> I researched beauty encounter and many other online beauty product companies and must say that I give them 10 thumbs up, because I&#x27;m a little scared that the product that I order is a water down version of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Although this purchase smells exactly the same, just doesn&#x27;t last any longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> The scent would last a long time.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> and I had been searching for this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> if I were you before they are all long gone</li>
            <li> I can only give this one a like due to performance issues.</li>
            <li> Instead, it suggests a mature woman who&#x27;s adventurous and exotic.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was sad when I found it had broken during a move.</li>
            <li> It has a slight vanilla scent along with the red tea notes, but it is faint enough and balanced well with the red tea scent that it doesn&#x27;t smell too masculine or too</li>
            <li> This was such a waste but</li>
            <li> that it not only smelled a bit odd, but the scent immediately dissipated in a few minutes of wear.  </li>
            <li> I realize it is Eau de Cologne and not Eau de Parfum, but still the scent is very weak and wears out way too quick compared to other Eau de Colognes I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> This is a little heavier than Au The&#x27; Blanc</li>
            <li> I have to spray on a few spritzes.</li>
            <li> I DID have trouble finding a lotion for layering</li>
            <li> I was given a small trial by my parents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> The idea that it is a unisex scent is laughable since both sexes are likely to reject it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find and you probably need to go on-line to get it.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with how it smells on me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable.</li>
            <li> I can still faintly smell it on me.  </li>
            <li> I have been obsessed with it after staying at a hotel that supplied them in guest&#x27;s bathrooms.</li>
            <li> but I find The Rouge difficult to find and when I see it online</li>
            <li> but it was getting too expensive for my budget</li>
            <li> Casually use this every now and then</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the product when it came.  </li>
            <li> Too bad that Bvlgari is no longer making it.</li>
            <li> The tea provides an herbal base, the fig is a hefty fruity note, and it&#x27;s just lovely!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad Bvlgari is no longer producing this fragrance!  </li>

            <li> Refreshing and light. However, my favorite of the Bvlgari scents is Green Tea. This stuff is hard to find and you probably need to go on-line to get it. I couldn&#x27;t even find it at the Bvlgari store in Epcot. I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere in Denver. I only wish it would last longer. I need to spritz myself twice a day to maintain the scent and I always worry that the second spray won&#x27;t smell as good as the first one of the day. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints, so maybe it&#x27;s just me. I did find this through Amazon on-line.</li>
            <li> i really love it . I give it to my mom. and she became a fan of it . thank you</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s woodsy, not flowery or sweet.  Salish lodge had soap and lotion of this scent so I had to have the cologne.</li>
            <li> This is the gift for my sister,she say it is very nice and her friends like it too.we&#x27;ll buy some again.</li>
            <li> Cologne&#x27;s preference is very individualistic, so views may differ. In order to understand better, let me tell you that \\&quot;Polo Sport\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hugo Boss\\&quot; are my stock colognes... I was introduced to this cologne via a sample vial .. The moment I used it .. I knew it was the one for my special occasions.     Definitely, its not everyday use. It is long lasting and good notes of tea .. It is one of those, which you either like or dislike but at the price its being offered, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try ..    If you don;t like it .. you can give to someone you know who can appreciate it ...</li>
            <li> Elegant scent at an excelent price... it worth it!</li>
            <li> Bought some for my wife. She prefers Beautiful and so do I. It is o.k., but I will not buy anything but Beautiful in the future.</li>
            <li> Smell really good I really love it.</li>
            <li> this scent is not overpowering but is rather mesmerizing. it&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable. Packaging and presentation is very cool. I have used this fragrance with Versace men and it harmonizes quite well</li>
            <li> This is simply great! INTOXICATING you will not be dissapointed! There is not a cologne like it. you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I was given a small trial by my parents. Liked the smell ever since. Casually use this every now and then</li>
            <li> Love the smell, my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> very quick delivery, just as expected!</li>
            <li> Love this.  So glad to have found it bc I searched all over for it.  My favorite</li>
            <li> When I got this cologne it was with free Prime shipping, and for the price this is an excellent daily wear cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the fact that men and women can wear it, the smell is definitely unisex enough that either sex can easily wear this cologne/perfume.  It has a slight vanilla scent along with the red tea notes, but it is faint enough and balanced well with the red tea scent that it doesn&#x27;t smell too masculine or too feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that this particular cologne lasts all day for me, when I get home I can still faintly smell it on me.  Your mileage may vary depending on how your body chemistry reacts with it, but for me its a great all day scent.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled with how it smells on me.  I would not buy this again for myself and I have not smelled it on a man yet.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled a sample bottle and tried it, instantly liked it. The scent would last a long time. These were free giveaways at the Emirates airline business class. I had enough samples to last for a couple of months. Although this purchase smells exactly the same, just doesn&#x27;t last any longer than a few hours. I really wonder if it&#x27;s original....</li>
            <li> I love this cologne spray! I wish Bvlgeri didn&#x27;t discontinue this scent. I have been obsessed with it after staying at a hotel that supplied them in guest&#x27;s bathrooms. It is so clean and unisex. I am giving it 4 stars, because the scent is rather light. I have to spray on a few spritzes.</li>
            <li> Maybe Bulgari discontinued this fragrance, but it&#x27;s too cool that it&#x27;s available here.  The Rouge is WONDERFUL!  It&#x27;s more figgy than tea-y, and really different from the spicy, vanilla-y florals that abound on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a battle of this at Marshall&#x27;s several years ago and found it too powerful for a summer fragrance, but I remembered its fruity, rich, warm scent.  I dug it out when the snow started falling this winter, and found it to be the perfect winter fragrance.  The tea provides an herbal base, the fig is a hefty fruity note, and it&#x27;s just lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description says this is a unisex fragrance, evoking after-shaves and Irish Spring.  Not so much.  I am very much a girly-girl, and I love The Rouge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but I find The Rouge difficult to find and when I see it online I will purchase it because I love the fragrance!  It is light, with a touch of the tea notes.  Packaging was great and I received it within the same week I ordered!  Did not know this was also made for men&#x27;s use...but I love it and will keep it in my arsenal of everyday use products!</li>
            <li> I had been using this perfume for a couple of years now but it was getting too expensive for my budget nowadays so I decided to look for it online instead of buying at the department store.  I found it on Amazon at a surprisingly low price so I immediately ordered one.  Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the product when it came.  The cellophane overwrap was not sealed on one end, the box itself did not look original, and the so-called perfume was so watered-down (or alcoholed-down, or whatever they did to it) that it not only smelled a bit odd, but the scent immediately dissipated in a few minutes of wear.  I thought that if I was trying to be \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, I would have been better off getting one of those \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; or \\&quot;smell-alikes\\&quot; at the mall.  I wanted to return it to Amazon but found out that perfume was NOT a returnable product.  This was such a waste but surely another lesson learned on \\&quot;You Pay For What You Get\\&quot; as well as \\&quot;Never Buy Perfume Online\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> The smell is good, but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time.Anyway, still i will recommend my friends to use it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this scent from Beauty [...] and I must say that I am sooooo happy that I did.  I researched beauty encounter and many other online beauty product companies and must say that I give them 10 thumbs up, because I&#x27;m a little scared that the product that I order is a water down version of the real thing.  I must say that Beauty [...] has such a LARGE variety of products from Chanel to Moschino to MAC to DIOR.  There shipping is super fast and the tracking from UPS is superb.  I will now order more of my beauty products from Beauty [...] thanks to AMAZON and the people who post their recommendations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance and I had been searching for this one for a long time. The delivery was on time and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> very good very good very good very good excellent thank you very good very good very good very good excellent thank you very good very good very good very good excellent thank you very good very good very good very good excellent thank you Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> Excellent value, speedy delivery. I was taking a risk on the scent, because I love au the vert, but this one was untested... Honestly, it won&#x27;t replace au the vert in my heart, but it&#x27;s spicier nature is growing on me.</li>
            <li> I get spiced, lemon, orange-pekoe tea right at the opening (think Lipton teabag), which is nice. Within a few minutes the fig and walnut emerge to give this fragrance a touch of sweetness (but not too sweet), depth and character...which is really very nice. I was a bit worried about how my nose would perceive the fig and walnut notes, but Au The Rouge (ATR) turned-out to be a pleasant surprise and one of the best tea scents I have smelled. Sounds good, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I enjoyed this scent...well, much like a man in his prime being released from 30-days of solitary confinement and then housed with the Swedish no-tan-line Bikini Team, this fragrance has no staying power. ATR sits close on my skin and does it&#x27;s Houdini impersonation (i.e., disappearing act) on my skin in about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I enjoy wearing Silver Mountain Water and Gucci Pour Homme II because I feel they are a bit more masculine tea fragrances, and SMW lasts 8+ hours on my skin. Although a man can certainly rock ATR, I feel it is better suited for the females. In the end, I feel Gucci Pour Homme II is a perfect night-in cuddle scent for a man whereas Au The Rouge is the female equivalent. I can only give this one a like due to performance issues.</li>
            <li> My favorite because its so close to aromatherapy scents!!! I have a really sensitive nose to smells/perfumes etc, so this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I got this fragrance for my girlfriend. She smells wonderful when she wears it. I don&#x27;t know how much she puts on but I&#x27;ve never been offend by it and I can anyways smell it. It&#x27;s a soft floral scent and it makes me want to home her in my arms and cuddle.</li>
            <li> great product with a clean fresh scent for either a man or a woman.  Too bad that Bvlgari is no longer making it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Au the Rouge de Bvlgari para los hombres. Eau de Cologne Spray 3.4 Oz. is a premium product, valued beyond price</li>
            <li> bought this because it was a good deal, or at least appeared to be. It&#x27;s almost scent-less...there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Perfect. Great price and fast delivery. Will recommend to others and will most certainly use again for any and all fragrance needs.</li>
            <li> Great Scent, glad I can find it here.</li>
            <li> Great scent for me and my husband to share since we both love it!!</li>
            <li> Too bad Bvlgari is no longer producing this fragrance!  It is beautiful!  I looked at the list of fragrances in this perfume and they are all my favorites!</li>
            <li> It is a nice, light scent.  Perfect for work or an evening out on the town!  Great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> I realize it is Eau de Cologne and not Eau de Parfum, but still the scent is very weak and wears out way too quick compared to other Eau de Colognes I have used in the past.  The scent is delicious though</li>
            <li> {Public serveice announcenment) since it&#x27;s discontinued, I&#x27;d get a back up if I were you before they are all long gone</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent but I guess that is a personal thing.  I would not buy this again and would definitely NOT recommend it to anyone.  The idea that it is a unisex scent is laughable since both sexes are likely to reject it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It&#x27;s slightly spicy, but also sweet as it dries. I love that it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, not sweet or overpowering in any way. Feels fresh.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little diferent from other Bvlgari perfum (lighter) but the essence it´s OK. The package was great.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and my girl friend love this</li>
            <li> Bvlgari ONCE AGAIN Ladies and Gents! This is a little heavier than Au The&#x27; Blanc but you can STILL wear this one year-round. It&#x27;s discontinued (don&#x27;t know why they would do a thing like that) but it CAN be found. I DID have trouble finding a lotion for layering but I will continue to look because I like it just that much.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent with a heavy warm fig smell, with a great violet come down.  I would recommend this for winter wear.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with this item. Used a sample I got on an Emirates flight earlier and loved it. Not disappointed at all. My wife feels it&#x27;s feminine but I don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Eight years ago, I bought a bottle of this in Germany. I love the exotic tea and spice scent, as it&#x27;s not a ridiculously saccharine stench like you&#x27;d find at certain stores in the mall and in many other perfumes. Instead, it suggests a mature woman who&#x27;s adventurous and exotic.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was sad when I found it had broken during a move. I&#x27;m glad to have it back in my collection. Also, the bottle I bought was not diluted with alcohol or otherwise corrupted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not purchase my bottle from this seller. I purchased it from a different person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance.  It is my favorite Bvlgari fragrance but the Bvlgari Green Tea is right up there too.</li>
            <li> It has a raw silk scent in it, and I love it. all my favorite perfumes have been discontinued and I love when I can find them. Wears away quickly though.</li>
