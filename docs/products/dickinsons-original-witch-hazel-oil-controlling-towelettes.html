            <li>It has minimized my pores and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>and I use these towelettes in the morning and they are amazing.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS AMAZING</li>
            <li>These come in sturdy individual plastic packets that are great for travel because there isn&#x27;t the issue of a pack of wipes that ends up drying out if it isn&#x27;t perfectly sealed.</li>
            <li>These witch hazel wipes are nice.</li>
            <li>I find that my skin tightens up (in a good way) when I use these, and that this is able to remove makeup that cleansing alone didn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li>Handy way to carry witch hazel with you while traveling.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are really nice but for the price I suggest just getting the bottle from a store.</li>

            <li>Feels nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Excellent toner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>perfect for after a work out at the gym, removing makeup and just clearing ur skin completely.</li>
            <li>Keeps them fresh and great for travel.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fairly pleasant and wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also great for taking off oil after the gym or a hot summer day.</li>

            <li>Just the best for a cool day or a quick clean of the face.</li>

            <li>These were just okay.</li>
            <li>I love these oil control towelettes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it removes even more dirt and make-up after I&#x27;ve already washed my face.</li>
            <li>Surely, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes.  </li>

            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>My acne is not 100% better</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have to buy some more before I run out.</li>
            <li>However, they are more costly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love and will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t drying like most astringents.</li>
            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>I love the towelettes.  </li>
            <li>I will have to order more.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite cleansing towelettes.</li>
            <li>Love these towelettes.</li>
            <li>This would be handy for travel (no liquids for the TSA to get excited about) and it also helps keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li>I keep getting them because I love how clean they make my skin!</li>
            <li>One terrifically nice thing about these towelettes is they are more than adequately saturated with witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I originally bought them to take on a trip to Italy--they were great to use to freshen up on the plane and in Italy on the hot summer days.  </li>
            <li>greatest wet wipes ever made : )</li>
            <li>So convenient and clean!</li>
            <li>These towelettes are perfect for slipping into your purse and using whenever the need arises.</li>
            <li>These are so good for gentle cleansing even while on the go.</li>
            <li>Perfect to throw in ur bag, and even wipe ur hands if ur outside and grabbing a quick bite to eat.</li>
            <li>Considering the wipes are so gentle, they clean remarkably well.</li>
            <li>I like these a lot for an on-the-go clean, can throw in the gym bag or backpack for a refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li>I use them exclusively and love the way my face feels really clean when I&#x27;m done using them.</li>
            <li>These towelettes are decently saturated with good solution.</li>
            <li>These wipes are of strong material and have plenty of witch hazel on each sheet.</li>
            <li>having individual towelettes that you can use and dispose as you good is nice to have.</li>
            <li>Scent is very light, not at all bothersome, and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Great to clean off make up plus clear up acne.</li>
            <li>So now we just use it as a first-aid for superficial cuts and scrapes and it works fine because it has anti-bacterial properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fit in your purse easily.  </li>
            <li>They are really moist &amp; refreshing!</li>
            <li>Using witch hazel as a toner is beneficial for your skin but the scent of Dickinson&#x27;s is a huge turn-off.</li>
            <li>These are great to have on hand, especially when water isn&#x27;t readily available.</li>
            <li>and theres a huge improvement with my skin.</li>
            <li>These are great to stash in your purse, especially during the summer months.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and someone told me this stuff was amazing for that.</li>
            <li>but it also gives me a smooth, even surface on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I will say that I can find them at Walgreens every so often for $3.99, but next to that Amazon has great prices for these.</li>
            <li>These are great at the end of the day in a city or exploring when you just feel overall mucky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wipes are generously sized and I rarely need more than one.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy and got my money back</li>
            <li>Easy to use, leaves my skin feeling wonderfully clean.  </li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I use them to help clear up acne and they work fairly well.</li>
            <li>This is not the case with the Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my skin while using them.  </li>
            <li>Worth it, always restockin!</li>
            <li>Or if you feel too lazy to wash your face use one of these (best astringent), or use them for sunburns.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for removing make up, but it left my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>They soothe &amp; clean my skin well.</li>
            <li>so I use this to keep my face clean through out the day.</li>
            <li>Clean and convenient.</li>
            <li>The convenience of having something you can put in your purse or luggage for a trip, in your desk, great at the beach, and toss a few in your gym bag for a refreshing &amp;#34;quick clean face and neck&amp;#34; after a workout.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, item exactly as described :)</li>
            <li>Leaves yo&#x27; face feeling fresh, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The material is nice and soft too</li>
            <li>Love them so much.</li>
            <li>It cool of my skin.</li>
            <li>The keep my face oil-free and gives me a cool feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>They helped so much when my husband and I got a sunburn, it works way better than aloe vera.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was that I recieved it really quick.</li>
            <li>The reason these are the best wipes is they are individually packages so they never dry out.</li>
            <li>you ever get a mild sunburn, these help cool the burn as well.</li>
            <li>You will notice this on your first use and they will actually become even more effective the longer you use them.</li>
            <li>and I moved to a super humid climate which makes me break out often.  </li>
            <li>Thayers adds more beneficial ingredients such as aloe and rosewater to their witch hazels and they smell lovely.</li>
            <li>I use these regularly and the individual packs make them perfect to stuff in my bag, car, and desk at work!</li>
            <li>Depends or your needs, this could be good if you need a tougher fabric to apply the witch hazel than toilet paper.</li>
            <li>Perfect for removing makeup, or just cleaning your skin, after only using this product for several days, I noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>They are large and soft and the witch hazel feels lovely and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Very handy, refreshing, nothing negative about the product.</li>
            <li>I love that these are not sticky and feel so refreshing after sweating, a workout, a long car trip...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very convenient to have when needed.</li>
            <li>Sounds gross, but I had to have more!</li>
            <li>Being individually wrapped keeps them more hygienic and easily portable.</li>
            <li>Me and my wife found it very soothing and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Really cleaned out my pores for clearer pimple free skin.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing, keeps face so soft.</li>
            <li>I also feel these are effective at long-term (several hours, anyway)</li>
            <li>nice thing about these is that they&#x27;re individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fresh, but the smell is something you can get used to.</li>
            <li>Many uses - face, hands, quick overall clean up.</li>
            <li>Large and damp enough to clean effectively.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say that is just my personal opinion about the many uses of the Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I received the product and found the cloths are much thicker than they look in the image.</li>
            <li>Refreshed right away.</li>
            <li>I never expected to see such a great difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>As I said, they are more than adequately saturated with witch hazel - which gives you plenty of solution to apply to your entire face.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many pre-moistened pads that it honestly feels like I&#x27;ve tried them all, and they all had the same problem - not enough solution on the pad.</li>
            <li>They are so nice, in fact, that my husband has taken to stealing them for his desk at work, using them after a long day in front of the computer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good to help clear up back acne  </li>
            <li>These wipes are just as good as the bottle&#x27;n cotton route in terms of toning; however, the wipes themselves are so refreshing when I use them that I actually prefer them to my previous routine.</li>
            <li>Most makeup removing/cleansing towelettes and toners use witch hazel as an ingredient to make their product work, so using these Dickinson&#x27;s wipes instead gives you the same solution without being diluted.</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes and have been using them daily for two years.  </li>
            <li>Since using these my skin has been so much better, I only wash it once a day at night</li>
            <li>Natural and no animal testing which is something that is important to me.</li>
            <li>I like something to throw in my gym bag as a skin refresher for after a workout, but for some reason most facial wipes, even those for oily or combo skin, seem to make me break out.</li>
            <li>I use them on my face at night before bed and any time I feel like I&#x27;m hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be better if you use it for face, neck, chest, and back, maybe?</li>
            <li>My face is refreshed but I also like to use on shoulders and arms during hot days.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>my favorite go-to for simple face cleansing</li>
            <li>but as a skin pick-me-up on hot days, these babies are just the thing.</li>
            <li>I keep them in my purse for hot sunny days to keep the oil away and it leaves my skin so smooth and not dried out.</li>
            <li>This is gentle!  </li>
            <li>use these daily, sometimes more.  </li>
            <li>And I really really like them!  </li>
            <li>it was at first recommended from Dr. Oz.</li>
            <li>These really freshen you up well!</li>
            <li>I like it when i first try it.</li>
            <li>i love keeping these pads in my car or back pack.</li>
            <li>Wish box had more than 20 (only reason I gave 4 stars)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t normally use &#x27;witch hazel&#x27;, but wanted some kind of astringent in individual packet form to take on trip.  </li>
            <li>The towelettes are extra large,(5&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34;)  more than sufficient for cleaning face, neck  and even wipe hands and arms.</li>
            <li>My skin can get dried out very easily, and despite the fact these have a good amount of alcohol, they don&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to created scents and like that this product leans more towards natural cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>being an invalid means you have to keep everything very clean and degermed as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>I feel wasteful using this product, because the wipes are large and contain way more witch hazel than necessary for just the face.</li>
            <li>The leave your skin feeling refreshed, clean and soft.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a more mature wipe, that has natural scents and ingredients</li>
            <li>Contains Aloe and botanical extracts so it will not dry out your skin, just leave you with fresh clean smelling skin  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic and work like no other.</li>
            <li>These towelettes are nice &amp; large, unlike other towelettes.</li>
            <li>Being a long time user of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel, love these towelettes.  </li>
            <li>With a light hand, the texture is gentle enough for me to use around my eyes, if necessary, yet is strong enough to stand up to more vigorous rubbing.  </li>
            <li>The individual packages ore easy to open and the wipes are folded in a way that they separate easy.</li>
            <li>The witch hazel does have a strong smell but it does not last.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite travel facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The wipes are individually sealed in metal packettes, so they were fine, but the box was ruined and had to be tossed.</li>
            <li>Very stinky towelette but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wiping one across my forehead, they are very cooling and soothing when I have a headache/migraine.</li>
            <li>I really like these wipes.</li>
            <li>It did not hurt my eyes, but these do contain a bit of grain alcohol, and you really don&#x27;t want to get that in your eye.  </li>
            <li>I bought it twice, really work for my oil skin in summer.</li>
            <li>Be careful of witch hazel supplements as they can interfere with many medications (&amp;#60;--doctor).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really convenient since my face gets greasy.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really serve the purpose for which I got it.</li>
            <li>They are very conveniently packaged.</li>
            <li>I never knew how much dirt was on my face until I began using witch hazel (</li>
            <li>and I make use of this after &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; and she loves the way it soothes her skin in the delicate areas as do I after a good &amp;#34;sexual work out&amp;#34;....refreshing and cleansing.....</li>
            <li>It is definitely large enough to thoroughly clean the face and</li>
            <li>They smell clean and fresh, with no real overpowering</li>
            <li>These work better than any other face wipe cloth I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main ingedient in Tuck&#x27;s Pads, and these are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>cleansing, yet not harsh.  not terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li>These natural towelettes makes washing up in the middle of the day super easy, because it not only cleans and disinfects, it tones.</li>
            <li>The less liquids I take on board the better, so this sort-of-liquid isn&#x27;t counted in my toiletries allowance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
            <li>The only individually wrapped, light on chemicals cleansing towelettes I could find!  </li>
            <li>So Refreshing Facial Cleansing Cloths Singles, but they have discontinued this product and only make bulk packaged towelettes--which they sent me once contrary to what I had ordered...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try them</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Each towelette is individually wrapped to keep it fresh and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how wet they are compared to other face wipes, they have all natural ingredients (witch hazel which I love for keeping acne at bay!)  </li>
            <li>I use them on a hot day or when I travel, especially in the airplane before landing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very handy to carry, don&#x27;t dry the skin like other products do, and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally against facial products that have a lot of chemicals, but the witch hazel actually helps to decrease inflammation, so I&#x27;m okay with it topically.  </li>
            <li>This is a very convenient travel facial toner!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are approved for use as a first aid for minor cuts or scrapes, but I also use them for these purposes.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 boxes thus far</li>
            <li>even for use as a personal wipe on occasion, they are very soothing and non-drying.  </li>
            <li>I keep them in my bag, so when my skin get very oily in the day, especially in the Summertime.</li>
            <li>I have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My teen daughter uses these pads and Cetaphil gentle cleanser exclusively.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and have found this is the one product that actually makes my skin feel great as opposed to completely dried out all the time, while fighting blemishes as well as products containing harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were mainly just a convenience for me in the evenings, but I didn&#x27;t like them enough that I would ever purchase them again.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes how well they take off makeup with being &#x27;chemically&#x27; and harsh to the skin--in fact, they leave skin feeling soft and cool to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The towelettes are not the largest facial towelettes I&#x27;ve ever used, but they&#x27;re large enough to use all over my face if I use both sides.  </li>
            <li>Seem like a decent value for ~20¢ apiece as an occasional this when you don&#x27;t have access to your regular toner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly large and quilted in a way that I can rip in half really easily and put the unused half back into the foil packet, (rolling the opening up to keep moist) for later use.</li>
            <li>This specific brand&#x27;s witch hazel has a very medicinal scent to it that lingers long after you put it on your face.</li>
            <li>I actually will use these instead of washing with soap and water often, because they don&#x27;t strip as much natural moisture from your skin.</li>
            <li>my friend with similar acne issues and sensitive skin recommended it to me).</li>
            <li>Cleanses and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>They refresh and remove gunk, but do not dry your skin out</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much softer than other similar products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The cloths are large, a good size, and they aren&#x27;t thin (not super thick, but they haven&#x27;t torn when using them) and they are soft and not scratchy like some cloths like this can be.</li>
            <li>These towelettes  are soft to the skin, but tough on dirt, deep cleaning the pores leaving your skin soft, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>One other main point is that they are indeed &amp;#34;oil controlling&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>now, firstly my skin to normal and sometimes dry at the tzone, and during the weather changing i get a few bumps underneath the eyes, this takes care of it !!</li>

            <li> These witch hazel wipes are nice.</li>
            <li> I find that my skin tightens up (in a good way) when I use these, and that this is able to remove makeup that cleansing alone didn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li> Handy way to carry witch hazel with you while traveling.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are really nice but for the price I suggest just getting the bottle from a store.</li>

            <li> I love these oil control towelettes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it removes even more dirt and make-up after I&#x27;ve already washed my face.</li>

            <li> love that these soften my skin while removing oil.</li>
            <li> I love the soothing witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> My acne is not 100% better</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have to buy some more before I run out.</li>
            <li> However, they are more costly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love and will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t drying like most astringents.</li>
            <li> Love.  </li>
            <li> I love the towelettes.  </li>
            <li> I will have to order more.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite cleansing towelettes.</li>
            <li> Love these towelettes.</li>
            <li> This would be handy for travel (no liquids for the TSA to get excited about) and it also helps keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> I keep getting them because I love how clean they make my skin!</li>
            <li> One terrifically nice thing about these towelettes is they are more than adequately saturated with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I originally bought them to take on a trip to Italy--they were great to use to freshen up on the plane and in Italy on the hot summer days.  </li>
            <li> greatest wet wipes ever made : )</li>
            <li> So convenient and clean!</li>
            <li> These towelettes are perfect for slipping into your purse and using whenever the need arises.</li>
            <li> These are so good for gentle cleansing even while on the go.</li>
            <li> Perfect to throw in ur bag, and even wipe ur hands if ur outside and grabbing a quick bite to eat.</li>
            <li> Considering the wipes are so gentle, they clean remarkably well.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot for an on-the-go clean, can throw in the gym bag or backpack for a refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li> I use them exclusively and love the way my face feels really clean when I&#x27;m done using them.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are decently saturated with good solution.</li>
            <li> These wipes are of strong material and have plenty of witch hazel on each sheet.</li>
            <li> having individual towelettes that you can use and dispose as you good is nice to have.</li>
            <li> Scent is very light, not at all bothersome, and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Great to clean off make up plus clear up acne.</li>
            <li> So now we just use it as a first-aid for superficial cuts and scrapes and it works fine because it has anti-bacterial properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fit in your purse easily.  </li>
            <li> They are really moist &amp; refreshing!</li>
            <li> Using witch hazel as a toner is beneficial for your skin but the scent of Dickinson&#x27;s is a huge turn-off.</li>
            <li> These are great to have on hand, especially when water isn&#x27;t readily available.</li>
            <li> and theres a huge improvement with my skin.</li>
            <li> These are great to stash in your purse, especially during the summer months.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and someone told me this stuff was amazing for that.</li>
            <li> but it also gives me a smooth, even surface on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I will say that I can find them at Walgreens every so often for $3.99, but next to that Amazon has great prices for these.</li>
            <li> These are great at the end of the day in a city or exploring when you just feel overall mucky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wipes are generously sized and I rarely need more than one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy and got my money back</li>
            <li> Easy to use, leaves my skin feeling wonderfully clean.  </li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I use them to help clear up acne and they work fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is not the case with the Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my skin while using them.  </li>
            <li> Worth it, always restockin!</li>
            <li> Or if you feel too lazy to wash your face use one of these (best astringent), or use them for sunburns.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for removing make up, but it left my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> They soothe &amp; clean my skin well.</li>
            <li> so I use this to keep my face clean through out the day.</li>
            <li> Clean and convenient.</li>
            <li> The convenience of having something you can put in your purse or luggage for a trip, in your desk, great at the beach, and toss a few in your gym bag for a refreshing &amp;#34;quick clean face and neck&amp;#34; after a workout.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, item exactly as described :)</li>
            <li> Leaves yo&#x27; face feeling fresh, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The material is nice and soft too</li>
            <li> Love them so much.</li>
            <li> It cool of my skin.</li>
            <li> The keep my face oil-free and gives me a cool feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> They helped so much when my husband and I got a sunburn, it works way better than aloe vera.</li>
            <li> The only good thing was that I recieved it really quick.</li>
            <li> The reason these are the best wipes is they are individually packages so they never dry out.</li>
            <li> you ever get a mild sunburn, these help cool the burn as well.</li>
            <li> You will notice this on your first use and they will actually become even more effective the longer you use them.</li>
            <li> and I moved to a super humid climate which makes me break out often.  </li>
            <li> Thayers adds more beneficial ingredients such as aloe and rosewater to their witch hazels and they smell lovely.</li>
            <li> I use these regularly and the individual packs make them perfect to stuff in my bag, car, and desk at work!</li>
            <li> Depends or your needs, this could be good if you need a tougher fabric to apply the witch hazel than toilet paper.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing makeup, or just cleaning your skin, after only using this product for several days, I noticed an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> They are large and soft and the witch hazel feels lovely and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Very handy, refreshing, nothing negative about the product.</li>
            <li> I love that these are not sticky and feel so refreshing after sweating, a workout, a long car trip...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very convenient to have when needed.</li>
            <li> Sounds gross, but I had to have more!</li>
            <li> Being individually wrapped keeps them more hygienic and easily portable.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife found it very soothing and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Really cleaned out my pores for clearer pimple free skin.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing, keeps face so soft.</li>
            <li> I also feel these are effective at long-term (several hours, anyway)</li>
            <li> nice thing about these is that they&#x27;re individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fresh, but the smell is something you can get used to.</li>
            <li> Many uses - face, hands, quick overall clean up.</li>
            <li> Large and damp enough to clean effectively.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that is just my personal opinion about the many uses of the Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I received the product and found the cloths are much thicker than they look in the image.</li>
            <li> Refreshed right away.</li>
            <li> I never expected to see such a great difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> As I said, they are more than adequately saturated with witch hazel - which gives you plenty of solution to apply to your entire face.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many pre-moistened pads that it honestly feels like I&#x27;ve tried them all, and they all had the same problem - not enough solution on the pad.</li>
            <li> They are so nice, in fact, that my husband has taken to stealing them for his desk at work, using them after a long day in front of the computer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good to help clear up back acne  </li>
            <li> These wipes are just as good as the bottle&#x27;n cotton route in terms of toning; however, the wipes themselves are so refreshing when I use them that I actually prefer them to my previous routine.</li>
            <li> Most makeup removing/cleansing towelettes and toners use witch hazel as an ingredient to make their product work, so using these Dickinson&#x27;s wipes instead gives you the same solution without being diluted.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes and have been using them daily for two years.  </li>
            <li> Since using these my skin has been so much better, I only wash it once a day at night</li>
            <li> Natural and no animal testing which is something that is important to me.</li>
            <li> I like something to throw in my gym bag as a skin refresher for after a workout, but for some reason most facial wipes, even those for oily or combo skin, seem to make me break out.</li>
            <li> I use them on my face at night before bed and any time I feel like I&#x27;m hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be better if you use it for face, neck, chest, and back, maybe?</li>
            <li> My face is refreshed but I also like to use on shoulders and arms during hot days.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> my favorite go-to for simple face cleansing</li>
            <li> but as a skin pick-me-up on hot days, these babies are just the thing.</li>
            <li> I keep them in my purse for hot sunny days to keep the oil away and it leaves my skin so smooth and not dried out.</li>
            <li> This is gentle!  </li>
            <li> use these daily, sometimes more.  </li>
            <li> And I really really like them!  </li>
            <li> it was at first recommended from Dr. Oz.</li>
            <li> These really freshen you up well!</li>
            <li> I like it when i first try it.</li>
            <li> i love keeping these pads in my car or back pack.</li>
            <li> Wish box had more than 20 (only reason I gave 4 stars)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally use &#x27;witch hazel&#x27;, but wanted some kind of astringent in individual packet form to take on trip.  </li>
            <li> The towelettes are extra large,(5&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34;)  more than sufficient for cleaning face, neck  and even wipe hands and arms.</li>
            <li> My skin can get dried out very easily, and despite the fact these have a good amount of alcohol, they don&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to created scents and like that this product leans more towards natural cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> being an invalid means you have to keep everything very clean and degermed as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> I feel wasteful using this product, because the wipes are large and contain way more witch hazel than necessary for just the face.</li>
            <li> The leave your skin feeling refreshed, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a more mature wipe, that has natural scents and ingredients</li>
            <li> Contains Aloe and botanical extracts so it will not dry out your skin, just leave you with fresh clean smelling skin  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic and work like no other.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are nice &amp; large, unlike other towelettes.</li>
            <li> Being a long time user of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel, love these towelettes.  </li>
            <li> With a light hand, the texture is gentle enough for me to use around my eyes, if necessary, yet is strong enough to stand up to more vigorous rubbing.  </li>
            <li> The individual packages ore easy to open and the wipes are folded in a way that they separate easy.</li>
            <li> The witch hazel does have a strong smell but it does not last.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite travel facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The wipes are individually sealed in metal packettes, so they were fine, but the box was ruined and had to be tossed.</li>
            <li> Very stinky towelette but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wiping one across my forehead, they are very cooling and soothing when I have a headache/migraine.</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt my eyes, but these do contain a bit of grain alcohol, and you really don&#x27;t want to get that in your eye.  </li>
            <li> I bought it twice, really work for my oil skin in summer.</li>
            <li> Be careful of witch hazel supplements as they can interfere with many medications (&amp;#60;--doctor).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really convenient since my face gets greasy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really serve the purpose for which I got it.</li>
            <li> They are very conveniently packaged.</li>
            <li> I never knew how much dirt was on my face until I began using witch hazel (</li>
            <li> and I make use of this after &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; and she loves the way it soothes her skin in the delicate areas as do I after a good &amp;#34;sexual work out&amp;#34;....refreshing and cleansing.....</li>
            <li> It is definitely large enough to thoroughly clean the face and</li>
            <li> They smell clean and fresh, with no real overpowering</li>
            <li> These work better than any other face wipe cloth I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main ingedient in Tuck&#x27;s Pads, and these are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> cleansing, yet not harsh.  not terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li> These natural towelettes makes washing up in the middle of the day super easy, because it not only cleans and disinfects, it tones.</li>
            <li> The less liquids I take on board the better, so this sort-of-liquid isn&#x27;t counted in my toiletries allowance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
            <li> The only individually wrapped, light on chemicals cleansing towelettes I could find!  </li>
            <li> So Refreshing Facial Cleansing Cloths Singles, but they have discontinued this product and only make bulk packaged towelettes--which they sent me once contrary to what I had ordered...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try them</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Each towelette is individually wrapped to keep it fresh and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how wet they are compared to other face wipes, they have all natural ingredients (witch hazel which I love for keeping acne at bay!)  </li>
            <li> I use them on a hot day or when I travel, especially in the airplane before landing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very handy to carry, don&#x27;t dry the skin like other products do, and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally against facial products that have a lot of chemicals, but the witch hazel actually helps to decrease inflammation, so I&#x27;m okay with it topically.  </li>
            <li> This is a very convenient travel facial toner!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are approved for use as a first aid for minor cuts or scrapes, but I also use them for these purposes.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 boxes thus far</li>
            <li> even for use as a personal wipe on occasion, they are very soothing and non-drying.  </li>
            <li> I keep them in my bag, so when my skin get very oily in the day, especially in the Summertime.</li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My teen daughter uses these pads and Cetaphil gentle cleanser exclusively.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and have found this is the one product that actually makes my skin feel great as opposed to completely dried out all the time, while fighting blemishes as well as products containing harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were mainly just a convenience for me in the evenings, but I didn&#x27;t like them enough that I would ever purchase them again.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes how well they take off makeup with being &#x27;chemically&#x27; and harsh to the skin--in fact, they leave skin feeling soft and cool to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The towelettes are not the largest facial towelettes I&#x27;ve ever used, but they&#x27;re large enough to use all over my face if I use both sides.  </li>
            <li> Seem like a decent value for ~20¢ apiece as an occasional this when you don&#x27;t have access to your regular toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly large and quilted in a way that I can rip in half really easily and put the unused half back into the foil packet, (rolling the opening up to keep moist) for later use.</li>
            <li> This specific brand&#x27;s witch hazel has a very medicinal scent to it that lingers long after you put it on your face.</li>
            <li> I actually will use these instead of washing with soap and water often, because they don&#x27;t strip as much natural moisture from your skin.</li>
            <li> my friend with similar acne issues and sensitive skin recommended it to me).</li>
            <li> Cleanses and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> They refresh and remove gunk, but do not dry your skin out</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much softer than other similar products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are large, a good size, and they aren&#x27;t thin (not super thick, but they haven&#x27;t torn when using them) and they are soft and not scratchy like some cloths like this can be.</li>
            <li> These towelettes  are soft to the skin, but tough on dirt, deep cleaning the pores leaving your skin soft, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> One other main point is that they are indeed &amp;#34;oil controlling&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> now, firstly my skin to normal and sometimes dry at the tzone, and during the weather changing i get a few bumps underneath the eyes, this takes care of it !!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t remove make-up very well, especially massacre or waterproof massacre on days I wear make-up.</li>
            <li> The cloths are thick and pretty generous, yet flushable.</li>
            <li> Bulk packaged wipes dry out easily and are not ideal for on-the-go or traveling.  </li>
            <li> Frequently in the summer my face gets oily or sweaty and I need a little refresher.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to do that on a long day and them reapply it.</li>
            <li> no chance of spilling since these are little individual packages easily opened when you want to, unlikely to open otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Over time, Dickinson&#x27;s has also made my pores less apparent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item due to the TV commercial I watched.  </li>
            <li> They also have other uses as an astringent and basic skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> these do the job without irritating delicate skin or causing more irritation because of soap sensitivity and chafing.  </li>
            <li> Even if you use them everyday, a box can still last a long time.</li>
            <li> The perform exactly as expected and described.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion and it was just what i expected.</li>
            <li> Also, they never leave your skin dry and tight - the way a high-alcohol astringent can do.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d do that on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> They soothe irritations, can replace toner, and unlike other witch hazels I&#x27;ve tried that have aloe, these do not leave me feeling sticky or eventually cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> Could not live without these!!!</li>
            <li> The foil package is sturdy and thick to prevent drying out like some other similar packaged products.  </li>
            <li> The uses for these conveniently wrapped wipes are endless!</li>
            <li> and I have had less break outs.</li>
            <li> small note, though, the box was crushed when I got the product</li>
            <li> They do make my face feel a little oily, though.</li>
            <li> In fact, I find them less drying than plain, alcohol-free witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I keep a few in my purse, in my car, in my desk, at all times.</li>
            <li> Always stash a few in my purse.  </li>
            <li> When I run out, I&#x27;ll use plain witch hazel and carry along a washcloth, which will have the side benefit of lessening what I throw out.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s no better way to make friends in a sweaty amusement park line than whipping one of these babies out and offering it to someone.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the witch hazel of the past, trust me.  </li>
            <li> I use these as make up remover wipes when I am being too lazy...</li>
            <li> The cloths are thick and they contain a lot of the witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I have them on auto subscribe, making them even less expensive.</li>
            <li> I know Dickinson&#x27;s and Amazon stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> What a game changer.</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I also  found that my face turned blotchy in spots after using it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive</li>
            <li> I never purchase expensive toners for my skin, at home I use a bottle of witch hazel and on the road, I use these!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed !!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These towelettes are nice &amp; large, unlike other towelettes. They are really moist &amp; refreshing!</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient travel facial toner!  The less liquids I take on board the better, so this sort-of-liquid isn&#x27;t counted in my toiletries allowance.  (I even asked!)  Besides that, it eliminates the need to carry liquid toner and cotton swabs.  So convenient and clean!</li>
            <li> Being individually packaged, these are PERFECT for travel. I always take them with me to refresh on international flights and don&#x27;t have to worry about them being counted as a liquid. The witch hazel balances my oily skin and prevents me from breaking out. Over time, Dickinson&#x27;s has also made my pores less apparent. Most makeup removing/cleansing towelettes and toners use witch hazel as an ingredient to make their product work, so using these Dickinson&#x27;s wipes instead gives you the same solution without being diluted.</li>
            <li> These are great to stash in your purse, especially during the summer months. They are perfect for oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item due to the TV commercial I watched.  I never expected to see such a great difference in my skin.  It is wonderful for removing make up, but it left my skin feeling clean and soft.  Hats off!!!!</li>
            <li> The Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes are a great buy. The perform exactly as expected and described. I use these as a facial toner after washing my face and before moisturizing. One terrifically nice thing about these towelettes is they are more than adequately saturated with witch hazel. I have tried so many pre-moistened pads that it honestly feels like I&#x27;ve tried them all, and they all had the same problem - not enough solution on the pad. This is not the case with the Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes. As I said, they are more than adequately saturated with witch hazel - which gives you plenty of solution to apply to your entire face. They also have other uses as an astringent and basic skin cleanser. I don&#x27;t know if they are approved for use as a first aid for minor cuts or scrapes, but I also use them for these purposes. However, please read and follow all the manufacturer&#x27;s recommended usage instructions. I&#x27;m just giving my opinion. I don&#x27;t want to read one day that somebody said, but I read it in a review on Amazon... Suffice it to say that is just my personal opinion about the many uses of the Dickinson&#x27;s Original witch hazel oil controlling towelettes. One other main point is that they are indeed &amp;#34;oil controlling&amp;#34;. You will notice this on your first use and they will actually become even more effective the longer you use them. Also, they never leave your skin dry and tight - the way a high-alcohol astringent can do. The leave your skin feeling refreshed, clean and soft. I would highly recommend these to anyone. Please buy with confidence. I know Dickinson&#x27;s and Amazon stand behind their products. I hope you have as terrific an experience as I had with this product.</li>
            <li> I donate stop buying these they are amazing!!</li>
            <li> These were just okay. I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in my skin while using them.  They were mainly just a convenience for me in the evenings, but I didn&#x27;t like them enough that I would ever purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite travel facial cleanser.  They are large and soft and the witch hazel feels lovely and refreshing.  Greta product.</li>
            <li> I love these oil control towelettes. I have very oily skin and someone told me this stuff was amazing for that. I tried it and not only does it help reduce the oil throughout the day but it also gives me a smooth, even surface on my cheeks. It has minimized my pores and my skin looks amazing. I also ended up buying the bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel toner and I use it every night after I wash my face and in the morning before I put my face lotion on. It removes dirt like nothing else! I was my face with facial wash then follow it with the witch hazel toner on a cotton ball. I can&#x27;t believe that it removes even more dirt and make-up after I&#x27;ve already washed my face. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Convenient to carry and works so well! I ordered these because I read about them, and they work like a charm in terms of both preserving moisture and cleansing efficiently!</li>
            <li> Me and my wife found it very soothing and comfortable. Surely, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Very handy, refreshing, nothing negative about the product. It&#x27;s fairly large and quilted in a way that I can rip in half really easily and put the unused half back into the foil packet, (rolling the opening up to keep moist) for later use.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes.  They&#x27;re very handy to carry, don&#x27;t dry the skin like other products do, and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes and have been using them daily for two years.  I like how wet they are compared to other face wipes, they have all natural ingredients (witch hazel which I love for keeping acne at bay!)  They are great to keep in your gym bag, car, purse, etc.  I will say that I can find them at Walgreens every so often for $3.99, but next to that Amazon has great prices for these.</li>
            <li> Great for wiping your face clean after workouts so you don&#x27;t get sweat pimples!</li>
            <li> The uses for these conveniently wrapped wipes are endless! I make sure I always travel with them. The cloths are thick and pretty generous, yet flushable. I&#x27;ve used them as a facial toner, wipe, and even used them to relieve eye strain and headaches caused by eye strain. Just placing them on my eyes, sometimes holding in place with an eye/sleeping mask. The cooling effect helps and witch hazel is known to reduce inflammation. I have them on auto subscribe, making them even less expensive.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot for an on-the-go clean, can throw in the gym bag or backpack for a refreshing face wash. Seem like a decent value for ~20¢ apiece as an occasional this when you don&#x27;t have access to your regular toner.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Dickinson&#x27;s this has made all the difference for my skin.  I have naturally oily skin and I moved to a super humid climate which makes me break out often.  Since using these my skin has been so much better, I only wash it once a day at night and I use these towelettes in the morning and they are amazing.  I highly recommend you try them you won&#x27;t be disappointed !!!</li>
            <li> Cleanses and does not dry out my skin. Feels nice and refreshing. Perfect for travelling. Natural and no animal testing which is something that is important to me. Love them!</li>
            <li> Very stinky towelette but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd time to order this wonderful product. My gf and I make use of this after &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; and she loves the way it soothes her skin in the delicate areas as do I after a good &amp;#34;sexual work out&amp;#34;....refreshing and cleansing.....this will remain a must in our bedroom I ordered 4 boxes thus far</li>
            <li> These come in sturdy individual plastic packets that are great for travel because there isn&#x27;t the issue of a pack of wipes that ends up drying out if it isn&#x27;t perfectly sealed. These are great at the end of the day in a city or exploring when you just feel overall mucky. Not the best for makeup removal, but they do an okay job. The material is nice and soft too</li>
            <li> MY GRANDSON&#x27;S USE IT DAILY ON THEIR FACE FOR THEIR BLEMISHES..IT WORKS AMAZING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these. I like something to throw in my gym bag as a skin refresher for after a workout, but for some reason most facial wipes, even those for oily or combo skin, seem to make me break out. Since my Mom raised me on using witch hazel as toner, I figured I&#x27;d try to go back and see if it works as well as fancier, more expensive toner options, and guess what? It&#x27;s even better. Mom did know best.</li>
            <li> These feel great and refreshing. They do make my face feel a little oily, though.</li>
            <li> Love using these to remove makeup or just feel refreshed...great for travel....excellent packaging and refreshing scent makes these a must have</li>
            <li> Very easy to travel with</li>
            <li> I used to overpay for these at the drugstore but now I know I can get them on Amazon! I keep a few in my purse, in my car, in my desk, at all times. And there&#x27;s no better way to make friends in a sweaty amusement park line than whipping one of these babies out and offering it to someone. Freshness in a pouch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good to help clear up back acne  refresh your face and help with breakout and redness. Would repurchase</li>
            <li> Great for travel. I use it as a facial astringent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel to tone my skin for about 5 years. These wipes are just as good as the bottle&#x27;n cotton route in terms of toning; however, the wipes themselves are so refreshing when I use them that I actually prefer them to my previous routine. They are so nice, in fact, that my husband has taken to stealing them for his desk at work, using them after a long day in front of the computer.  Now I have them on subscribe-and-save!</li>
            <li> Using witch hazel as a toner is beneficial for your skin but the scent of Dickinson&#x27;s is a huge turn-off. This specific brand&#x27;s witch hazel has a very medicinal scent to it that lingers long after you put it on your face. So now we just use it as a first-aid for superficial cuts and scrapes and it works fine because it has anti-bacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great witch hazel toner that&#x27;s actually pleasant to use you should check out the Thayers brand. Thayers adds more beneficial ingredients such as aloe and rosewater to their witch hazels and they smell lovely. Their toners actually work better than anything from the expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> This are very convenient and they work great. The cloths are thick and they contain a lot of the witch hazel. They are very effective in getting my skin very clean and I have had less break outs. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product at great price, came in great shape. wonderful for your purse &amp; at home in spring &amp; summer to whipe off excess sweat &amp; oils from all those yard &amp; home chores</li>
            <li> I love these cloths and use them to remove makeup, dirt and oils that can collect on your face throughout the day. Even if you use them everyday, a box can still last a long time. The aloe in the cloth helps them to feel very smooth on your skin - great purchase.</li>
            <li> Could not live without these!!!</li>
            <li> These witch hazel wipes are nice. The cloths are large, a good size, and they aren&#x27;t thin (not super thick, but they haven&#x27;t torn when using them) and they are soft and not scratchy like some cloths like this can be. They smell clean and fresh, with no real overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiping one across my forehead, they are very cooling and soothing when I have a headache/migraine. I use them on my face at night before bed and any time I feel like I&#x27;m hot and sweaty. They are good for a quick cleanup of my hands and I can carry them with me. They help also with hemorrhoid symptoms and itching. That&#x27;s the main ingedient in Tuck&#x27;s Pads, and these are much cheaper. My daughter likes how well they take off makeup with being &#x27;chemically&#x27; and harsh to the skin--in fact, they leave skin feeling soft and cool to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get a mild sunburn, these help cool the burn as well. I recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small note, though, the box was crushed when I got the product--it came in an envelope and was not protected. The wipes are individually sealed in metal packettes, so they were fine, but the box was ruined and had to be tossed.</li>
            <li> I feel wasteful using this product, because the wipes are large and contain way more witch hazel than necessary for just the face. I guess it would be better if you use it for face, neck, chest, and back, maybe?</li>
            <li> Use this daily and nightly on my face..It is refreshing, keeps face so soft.</li>
            <li> greatest wet wipes ever made : )</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes. I got a sample and have been buying them since. I love to use them all over. My face is refreshed but I also like to use on shoulders and arms during hot days. The witch hazel does have a strong smell but it does not last. It is wonderful to feel refreshed without out feeling perfumed after. I am very sensitive to created scents and like that this product leans more towards natural cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that these soften my skin while removing oil. I love the soothing witch hazel. The #1 perk is that they are individually packaged so I add them to my purse or diaper bag when I am on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a more mature wipe, that has natural scents and ingredients this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I love that these are not sticky and feel so refreshing after sweating, a workout, a long car trip...even for use as a personal wipe on occasion, they are very soothing and non-drying.  I will buy these forever and keep them at work, home, in my purse or luggage and in my car if I had one!</li>
            <li> I like to use toners with witch hazel after cleansing my face.  I&#x27;d been dispensing toner onto a cotton pad, then wiping it over my face.  I thought I&#x27;d try a towelette, instead, and only have to buy one product instead of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these a lot.  The towelettes are not the largest facial towelettes I&#x27;ve ever used, but they&#x27;re large enough to use all over my face if I use both sides.  They&#x27;re much softer than other similar products I&#x27;ve used.  I find that my skin tightens up (in a good way) when I use these, and that this is able to remove makeup that cleansing alone didn&#x27;t get.  I also feel these are effective at long-term (several hours, anyway) oil control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attempted to use these to remove eye makeup.  It works, even on waterproof mascara.  However, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d do that on a regular basis.  It did not hurt my eyes, but these do contain a bit of grain alcohol, and you really don&#x27;t want to get that in your eye.  In a pinch, though, these would work as makeup-removing wipes, as well.  I like that they contain aloe as well as alcohol; I think the moisturizing effects of the aloe help to counteract the drying effect of the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice thing about these is that they&#x27;re individually wrapped.  This would be handy for travel (no liquids for the TSA to get excited about) and it also helps keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of wipes to use after exercise or just to control oil and sweat/bacteria buildup</li>
            <li> These are very handy and feel good and I&#x27;ll continue to use up the ones I have, but I finally read the ingredients and would prefer not to use sodium benzoate on my skin. When I run out, I&#x27;ll use plain witch hazel and carry along a washcloth, which will have the side benefit of lessening what I throw out.</li>
            <li> Love these. I use them to help clear up acne and they work fairly well. Great to clean off make up plus clear up acne. My acne is not 100% better but they do help. They only con is that it has a funky smell to it, only reason not to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fresh, but the smell is something you can get used to.</li>
            <li> So convenient.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> my favorite go-to for simple face cleansing</li>
            <li> I keep getting them because I love how clean they make my skin! Yes they have an odor but I use them at night or after a workout/physical activity where I am going to shower after eventually so it has never bothered me. You get used to the smell. Best Witch Hazel product I know of!</li>
            <li> I bought it twice, really work for my oil skin in summer. When I didn&#x27;t make-up in the day time, I use it once one day and keep my skin not looks oily</li>
            <li> These wipes are great and so refreshing.  I originally bought them to take on a trip to Italy--they were great to use to freshen up on the plane and in Italy on the hot summer days.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Handy way to carry witch hazel with you while traveling. I have a subscribe and save for these, so I never run out.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, item exactly as described :) Love this product !!!!</li>
            <li> love these!  cleansing, yet not harsh.  not terribly expensive.  perfect in a pinch at home and away.</li>
            <li> Love them so much. I keep them in my bag, so when my skin get very oily in the day, especially in the Summertime. It cool of my skin. It feels refreshing. The only complaint I have about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t remove make-up very well, especially massacre or waterproof massacre on days I wear make-up. On the days I don&#x27;t wear any make-up, this product is my bag, so I can refresh my skin during the day. I have to buy some more before I run out.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion and it was just what i expected. I would recommend using this product, cleans scraps and oil off face really good.</li>
            <li> I discovered these wipes by accident and holy moly! What a game changer.Frequently in the summer my face gets oily or sweaty and I need a little refresher. These wipes are the perfect thing. They refresh and remove gunk, but do not dry your skin out - this is not your mother&#x27;s Seabreeze antiseptic! I should add that these wipes are not for removing makeup and I wouldn&#x27;t put them on my lips or eyes at all, but as a skin pick-me-up on hot days, these babies are just the thing.</li>
            <li> These work better than any other face wipe cloth I&#x27;ve tried. They soothe &amp; clean my skin well. Also great to take on camping trips.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are decently saturated with good solution. Easy to use and very convenient to have when needed. Have reordered more!</li>
            <li> My skin can get dried out very easily, and despite the fact these have a good amount of alcohol, they don&#x27;t dry my skin. In fact, I find them less drying than plain, alcohol-free witch hazel. They soothe irritations, can replace toner, and unlike other witch hazels I&#x27;ve tried that have aloe, these do not leave me feeling sticky or eventually cause my skin to break out. However, they are more costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are generously sized and I rarely need more than one. With a light hand, the texture is gentle enough for me to use around my eyes, if necessary, yet is strong enough to stand up to more vigorous rubbing.  Considering the wipes are so gentle, they clean remarkably well. Scent is very light, not at all bothersome, and dissipates quickly. Being individually wrapped keeps them more hygienic and easily portable. These are great to have on hand, especially when water isn&#x27;t readily available. Sure beats wet-naps!</li>
            <li> Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I use these regularly and the individual packs make them perfect to stuff in my bag, car, and desk at work!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I order it all the time. I keep them in my purse for hot sunny days to keep the oil away and it leaves my skin so smooth and not dried out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dickinson&#x27;s for years. I use it when I have to shower at work after workouts. It helps keep my face clean and feeling great. I was really excited when I received the product and found the cloths are much thicker than they look in the image. It is definitely large enough to thoroughly clean the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have found this is the one product that actually makes my skin feel great as opposed to completely dried out all the time, while fighting blemishes as well as products containing harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the liquid product you also cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong product. I got hemorrhoidal pads instead of facial toweletts. The only good thing was that I recieved it really quick.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; extremely refreshing, practically no fragrance; many uses.</li>
            <li> Excellent toner for sensitive skin. Leaves yo&#x27; face feeling fresh, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to EVERYONE.  It isn&#x27;t the witch hazel of the past, trust me.  This is gentle!  I am totally sold on these toweletts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried oil controlling toner, primers, lotions, makeup. NOTHING works as well as these do. I no longer need to blot my face 20 times a day...THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell but it does remove the excess makeup.</li>
            <li> should work for what I need</li>
            <li> use these daily, sometimes more.  being an invalid means you have to keep everything very clean and degermed as much as possible.  these do the job without irritating delicate skin or causing more irritation because of soap sensitivity and chafing.  no chance of spilling since these are little individual packages easily opened when you want to, unlikely to open otherwise.  good price</li>
            <li> The only individually wrapped, light on chemicals cleansing towelettes I could find!  And I really really like them!  Bulk packaged wipes dry out easily and are not ideal for on-the-go or traveling.  These are great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Basis So Refreshing Facial Cleansing Cloths Singles, but they have discontinued this product and only make bulk packaged towelettes--which they sent me once contrary to what I had ordered... I wasn&#x27;t happy and got my money back and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Dickinson&#x27;s... I also like that there is witch hazel in these.  I&#x27;m generally against facial products that have a lot of chemicals, but the witch hazel actually helps to decrease inflammation, so I&#x27;m okay with it topically.  Be careful of witch hazel supplements as they can interfere with many medications (&amp;#60;--doctor).  There is some scent to these but it&#x27;s fairly pleasant and wears off quickly.  I actually will use these instead of washing with soap and water often, because they don&#x27;t strip as much natural moisture from your skin.</li>
            <li> Love them they are perfect for removing my makeup. I sometimes have to do that on a long day and them reapply it. The reason these are the best wipes is they are individually packages so they never dry out. These truly are the best I have tried them all</li>
            <li> Bought this product becasue it was at first recommended from Dr. Oz. Worth it, always restockin! perfect for after a work out at the gym, removing makeup and just clearing ur skin completely. I have used this after the gym for my face and before i go to bed and theres a huge improvement with my skin. now, firstly my skin to normal and sometimes dry at the tzone, and during the weather changing i get a few bumps underneath the eyes, this takes care of it !! Absolutely love and will recommend to everyone. Perfect to throw in ur bag, and even wipe ur hands if ur outside and grabbing a quick bite to eat.</li>
            <li> My wife uses then all the time.</li>
            <li> These wipes are of strong material and have plenty of witch hazel on each sheet. The individual packages ore easy to open and the wipes are folded in a way that they separate easy.</li>
            <li> Like that these are individually wrapped. Keeps them fresh and great for travel.</li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin so I use this to keep my face clean through out the day. Works well in the summer to prevent unwanted &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel is a wonderful solution for any skin issue. These natural towelettes makes washing up in the middle of the day super easy, because it not only cleans and disinfects, it tones. These really freshen you up well!</li>
            <li> I use these as make up remover wipes when I am being too lazy... I love them! I have also used these on my dogs allergy irritated skin to limit the chance of infection. Clean and convenient. Individually wrapped and may uses!</li>
            <li> I like it when i first try it.</li>
            <li> I love these!  Always stash a few in my purse.  They remove oil and dirt and leave no residue or stickiness on my face.</li>
            <li> i love keeping these pads in my car or back pack. it&#x27;s really convenient since my face gets greasy. also has a neutral smell and that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! I buy it all the time  for my oily skin</li>
            <li> These are the best for cleaning my face from all the clay dust that I get in the studio. Also great for taking off oil after the gym or a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> I have an oily t-zone and use these to control the oil. These are fantastic and work like no other. I&#x27;ve tried Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel in the bottle, but it&#x27;s not even close to these towelettes. Is it the added aloe? Don&#x27;t know, but I do know Drew Barrymore raved about these (which is why I initially tried them) and you know, Drew is spot on with her recommendation.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, leaves my skin feeling wonderfully clean.  Gentle yet effective. I like the smell too.  Wish box had more than 20 (only reason I gave 4 stars)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally use &#x27;witch hazel&#x27;, but wanted some kind of astringent in individual packet form to take on trip.  So this works fairly well.  unfortunately, I also  found that my face turned blotchy in spots after using it.  Don&#x27;t think I am &#x27;witch hazel&#x27; compliant...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having individual towelettes that you can use and dispose as you good is nice to have.</li>
            <li> These are so good for gentle cleansing even while on the go. They aren&#x27;t drying like most astringents. Really cleaned out my pores for clearer pimple free skin. Oh and they are inexpensive too!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really serve the purpose for which I got it. I was looking for another product and accidentally bought this.</li>
            <li> With a teenager on the go and dealing with pimples these are a great way to get clean skin on the go. She can wipe her face after sports or bring them with her when she stays a friends house. I also use the for traveling. Family uses the big bottle at home for skin care. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these towelettes off and on for years. I especially like bringing them with me as my cleanser when I travel. Each towelette is individually wrapped to keep it fresh and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing-wise, I think they do a nice job of removing dirt and oil without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> Great price, gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li> Love.  The perfect travel toilette.  Prefer over baby wipes.  Fit in your purse easily.  Many uses - face, hands, quick overall clean up.</li>
            <li> Being a long time user of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel, love these towelettes.  The convenience of having something you can put in your purse or luggage for a trip, in your desk, great at the beach, and toss a few in your gym bag for a refreshing &amp;#34;quick clean face and neck&amp;#34; after a workout. AND they are great for conditioning the skin. Contains Aloe and botanical extracts so it will not dry out your skin, just leave you with fresh clean smelling skin  No bottles to worry about leaking.  The foil package is sturdy and thick to prevent drying out like some other similar packaged products.  The towelettes are extra large,(5&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34;)  more than sufficient for cleaning face, neck  and even wipe hands and arms. These towelettes  are soft to the skin, but tough on dirt, deep cleaning the pores leaving your skin soft, moist and fresh. I would not leave home without them.</li>
            <li> I love the towelettes.  The keep my face oil-free and gives me a cool feeling on my face.Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I love these! I will have to order more. These are great to throw in my gym bag and really clean up the sweat after a great workout. They are very conveniently packaged.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  I never purchase expensive toners for my skin, at home I use a bottle of witch hazel and on the road, I use these!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive but then again so is gauze or pads. This is a combination of witch hazel and gauze. Depends or your needs, this could be good if you need a tougher fabric to apply the witch hazel than toilet paper.</li>
            <li> Discovered this in my deceased Grandmother&#x27;s basement cleaning up. Sounds gross, but I had to have more! So I ordered it in bulk online. It makes my skin look radiant!</li>
            <li> These towelettes are perfect for slipping into your purse and using whenever the need arises. Perfect for removing makeup, or just cleaning your skin, after only using this product for several days, I noticed an improvement in my skin. Removes dirt and oils, while not drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> helps with oil control and break-outs</li>
            <li> Convenient.  Large and damp enough to clean effectively.</li>
            <li> These are indespensable. I used them a lot on our California trip. Just pat them on your face when you&#x27;re on the plane and your face won&#x27;t feel gross from the cabin air. Or if you feel too lazy to wash your face use one of these (best astringent), or use them for sunburns. They helped so much when my husband and I got a sunburn, it works way better than aloe vera.</li>
            <li> Convenient, portable, inexpensive, and mild; nonetheless, refreshing and excellent cleanser.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter uses these pads and Cetaphil gentle cleanser exclusively.  Her face has cleared up 100%.  Great product.  I have it on my subscribe and save with Amazon so it is delivered automatically.</li>
            <li> Just the best for a cool day or a quick clean of the face. Refreshed right away. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel or carrying in my purse to clean up at the office, after the gym, etc. A great, easy, quick &amp; non-perfumey way to freshen up my face before I touchup or reapply my makeup on the go. Love these.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite cleansing towelettes. I use them exclusively and love the way my face feels really clean when I&#x27;m done using them.</li>
            <li> Perfect to throw in your purse and go.</li>
            <li> Love these towelettes. I take them when I travel and they are great for washing your face after flying or cleaning your hands when you don&#x27;t have access to a sink. Very refreshing and get all the makeup off. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in my bag. I use them on a hot day or when I travel, especially in the airplane before landing. I have extremely sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I use these all of the time. Keep them in my purse and on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I now use regular witch hazel which is like $1.50 at the drugstore. I never knew how much dirt was on my face until I began using witch hazel (my friend with similar acne issues and sensitive skin recommended it to me). The towelettes are really nice but for the price I suggest just getting the bottle from a store.</li>
