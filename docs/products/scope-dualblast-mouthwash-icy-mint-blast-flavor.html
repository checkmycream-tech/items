    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>literally the best tasting mouthwash i have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Crest pro health is awesome and no hurt.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need the bite that those alcohol based antiseptic mouth rinses have, then this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>and it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Both are great.</li>
            <li>It does work great, but i guess when i read &amp;#34;Icy mint blast&amp;#34; i was expecting a stronger mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>GOOD MOUTHWASH,</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Scope has always been a good product.</li>
            <li>but makes me wonder if it&#x27;s doing as good of  a job.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t my favorite mouthwash, but it does work well and does it&#x27;s job for a great value.</li>
            <li>Very unique taste!  </li>
            <li>WAS NICE UNTIL IT RAN OUT.</li>
            <li>In the most simplest terms this is a quality product for a fair price.</li>
            <li>But it does feel great, and i tasted a more cinnamon-mint flavor then strong mint, if you like that taste, which i did.</li>
            <li>I love the scope mint blast, it leaves a very refreshing feeling in your mouth afterwards</li>
            <li>Good to use after any meals, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>The bottle shape is nice and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash is a mixture of mellow and refreshing - with an aftertaste that seems like some type of candy.</li>
            <li>It tastes ok as well.  </li>
            <li>Prefer the more efficient Listerine-style packaging.</li>
            <li>Odor control seems to be okay, but the tartar control has not improved.  </li>
            <li>The taste is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Listerine and Crest mouthwash are way better than Scope.</li>
            <li>Good fresh feeling after.</li>
            <li>that makes you know the product has done its job to remove, protect, &amp; freshen the breath......  : )</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really love the flavor of this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>ok I guess, it is just mouthwash and saved me a trip to the store...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like some washes do.  </li>
            <li>Does not have a stinging or burning like so many mouth washes do, a bit of an aftertaste</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, WORK</li>
            <li>Gives the mouth and nice clean feel and yet adding a nice fresh minty smell to the breath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We love this stuff - it&#x27;s strong but not over-powering.  </li>
            <li>I love the strong taste.</li>
            <li>It feels like it does a good job overall and was a good price when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I am happy so far with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it when they go on sale because I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to pay full price.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fit easily in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>AS EXPECTED, GREAT TASTE, MY SISTER LOVE IT</li>
            <li>, this is important to me</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is cheap.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this if it were free.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I can tell you this lacks the sting and strength of Listerine, but it works, tastes pretty good and doesn&#x27;t have any side affects that I am aware of (looking at you Crest).</li>
            <li>Very fancy bottle,also the whole presentation very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tricky to find a good mouthwash - most are overbearing with the stinging, others will leave an overly long aftertaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it at that price!</li>
            <li>PREFER LISTERINE ULTRA CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for them,i could feel their warm smile over the phone.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the taste might be too strong but this one is just right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really explain it other than awesome.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is not harsh at all, and has a nice even flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cost me like $3, not bad.</li>
            <li>This is a very pleasant mouthwash - unlike other leading brands that burn your mouth when your done, your mouth feels fresh and crisp.  </li>
            <li>The mouthwash is pretty strong but not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Personally though I still feel Listerine is better, just has a more refreshed feeling after using than this one.</li>
            <li>Mild burn, does what a mouthwash does.</li>
            <li>This particular formula tastes tons better than a leading mouthwash, and proves that you can successfully rinse without destroying your taste buds.  </li>
            <li>Wow what a blast, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash taste like candy and does not keep your breath fresh like Crest does.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t very practical, the cap DOES NOT have a dual purchase like most other mouthwashes, so I have to measure the pour on my own.</li>
            <li>oh so good without the over kill burning effect of alcohol like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I like having minty fresh breath, but if my food still tastes funny after an hour that&#x27;s no</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I still prefer the old stand-by Listerine.</li>
            <li>I like ones with a higher alcohol content for that thorough rinse after finding a hair in my food.  </li>
            <li>actually just double-checked the ingredient list to be sure there was alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Is it just me or does this stuff taste exactly like Jagermeister?</li>
            <li>Last&#x27;s most of the day too.</li>
            <li>It is not overbearingly strong and the nice aftertaste doesn&#x27;t last very long (as in, overbearing the flavor of anything you eat/</li>
            <li>, it keeps my mouth clean longer than many other mouthwash brands, however it doesn&#x27;t taste like mint!</li>
            <li>Scope icy mint blast is named right, good mouthwash, the entire family likes it.</li>
            <li>Did you know that you could do this on Amazon, have a product shipped to you on a certain day or month?</li>
            <li>Only ordered this because it was so cheap, bottom line is Listerine is the way to go for mouthwash, no others compare.</li>
            <li>It really helps refresh myself every time.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash works really well</li>
            <li>This seems to work very well without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I got this mouthwash for only $2.00 with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>SO THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a terrible aftertaste like some other brands.</li>
            <li>I just think the flavor is nice and there is very little burn.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have all the whitening and medication of more expensive brands, but is really good for a mid day refresh or morning rinse.</li>
            <li>Subtracted one star for the odd shaped bottle and top.  </li>
            <li>but I would rather pay a few dollars extra for the better clean feeling.</li>
            <li>750ml is enough for ONE person for ONE month, so if you subscribe &amp; save, be sure to add multiple items.</li>
            <li>Nice feel, keeps your mouth clean but without the harsh burn that you may get form other products like Listerine.</li>
            <li>That initial taste disappears pretty fast, but every time I use this stuff, I have flashbacks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a very short time but so far, I really love it.</li>
            <li>This is certainly worth a second look.</li>
            <li>At the right price, I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much of a mouthwash connoisseur, but this one&#x27;s pretty refreshing and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bitter or otherwise off-putting taste.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice taste, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean, and apparently smelling fresh -- at least no one has backed away since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>I did not feel that my mouth was half as clean after using Scope as it was using a Listerine product or Crest.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, I cannot say how this might affect you.</li>
            <li>one full turn before it clicks down.</li>
            <li>mouthwash seems to last, but its not super strong in flavor or in scent on the breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides several flaws it does leave my mouth feeling very clean for a long time, even after immediate use I am able to eat or drink something and not have a weird taste to it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh all day long, I have it on buy later with a date to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Icy Mint Blast means exactly that.</li>
            <li>However if you need something less intense then this is a decent substitute.</li>
            <li>I think the green feels a little bit more intense than the blue</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of scope, but I wished it was a little stronger and lasted fresh longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a tiny sample of this mouthwash in the mail from their website directly as a freebie.</li>
            <li>My slightly germaphobic self feels a little bit more calm after a few gargles with this blue concoction.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong or weak.</li>
            <li>ITS DONT LAST LONG, BUT ITS OKAY AND BRING THE PRICE DOWN A LITTLE AROUND 3.49 .</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m used to Listerine and the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that makes you really think it&#x27;s working hard.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, and the taste isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> It did what it was supposed to do but did not WOW me.  </li>
            <li> this mouthwash is different from what i expected..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee it will leave your mouth smelling the way you want, but it will definitely erase any other smells and tastes in there.</li>
            <li> sample I received was the green version of this, but I ended up buying the blue.</li>
            <li> Scope Icy Mint Blast was 2.97 in October 2013.</li>
            <li> This along with some other products was used in a care package as a gift for someone close, i figure would like to have some of your products.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 nights and then decided to empty it down the sink and trash it.</li>
            <li> BUT THE PRICE IS NOT RIGHT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> As a longtime Listerine user, the only complaint I had was the price - so when a deal came around for Scope, I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was a bad move the mouthwash does not give me that clean feeling as Crest Pro-Health does.</li>
            <li> This is not the brand I typically buy, but it was on sale.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t create an odd taste with either of those flavors.  </li>
            <li> It does contain alcohol which will give your mouth a little burn</li>
            <li> It does leave a weird aftertaste, similar to what orange juice after brushing, but it does it for everything in a less bitter way.</li>
            <li> I used Scope in the past, but found they general have poor tartar control.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a strong burn.</li>
            <li> Amazon usually has a coupon for these making it around $1.50 after subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SMALL BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mouth wash and not much more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Be sure to watch out for the angry leprechaun, he gets NASTY.</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but weird.</li>
            <li> The cap is a little annoying to &amp;#34;unclip&amp;#34; while turning.</li>
            <li> but it tastes like cinnamon which leaves me very confused.</li>
            <li> This Dualblast version is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> mad my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> It was that bad.</li>
            <li> Killer price, and it works well on neutralizing bad odors.</li>
            <li> Well this doesnt taste terrible, not great either</li>
            <li> my breath was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gives the mouth and nice clean feel and yet adding a nice fresh minty smell to the breath.&lt;br /&gt;I just like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tricky to find a good mouthwash - most are overbearing with the stinging, others will leave an overly long aftertaste. I like having minty fresh breath, but if my food still tastes funny after an hour that&#x27;s no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a tiny sample of this mouthwash in the mail from their website directly as a freebie. The mouthwash is a mixture of mellow and refreshing - with an aftertaste that seems like some type of candy. It is not overbearingly strong and the nice aftertaste doesn&#x27;t last very long (as in, overbearing the flavor of anything you eat/drink afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample I received was the green version of this, but I ended up buying the blue. Both are great.</li>
            <li> This is not the brand I typically buy, but it was on sale. I am happy so far with my purchase. At the right price, I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have several different kinds of mouthwash depending on my mood and my needs.  I like ones with a higher alcohol content for that thorough rinse after finding a hair in my food.  My slightly germaphobic self feels a little bit more calm after a few gargles with this blue concoction.  It tastes ok as well.  I do not use it every day but I don&#x27;t mind to use it when I do have that need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is important to me so maybe it is to someone else but I like mouthwashes that don&#x27;t clash with my toothpaste.  I alternate between Colgate Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide and Tom&#x27;s Mango Gel and this doesn&#x27;t create an odd taste with either of those flavors.  It pleases me.</li>
            <li> Only ordered this because it was so cheap, bottom line is Listerine is the way to go for mouthwash, no others compare.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is cheap. The fragrance is nice, and the taste isn&#x27;t bad. There&#x27;s not a terrible aftertaste like some other brands. Amazon usually has a coupon for these making it around $1.50 after subscribe and save. It&#x27;s definitely worth it at that price!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is not harsh at all, and has a nice even flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually just double-checked the ingredient list to be sure there was alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash seems to last, but its not super strong in flavor or in scent on the breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a garlic lover or have halitosis, perhaps a stronger mouthwash will be necessary.</li>
            <li> Always a dependable product</li>
            <li> It does work great, but i guess when i read &amp;#34;Icy mint blast&amp;#34; i was expecting a stronger mint flavor. But it does feel great, and i tasted a more cinnamon-mint flavor then strong mint, if you like that taste, which i did. It wasn&#x27;t my favorite mouthwash, but it does work well and does it&#x27;s job for a great value.</li>
            <li> I drink this before bed every night to drown out the sounds of my wife bitching. Once it takes hold, you have entered a world of blissfulness! Be sure to watch out for the angry leprechaun, he gets NASTY.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean, and apparently smelling fresh -- at least no one has backed away since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Subtracted one star for the odd shaped bottle and top.  Prefer the more efficient Listerine-style packaging.</li>
            <li> I used Scope in the past, but found they general have poor tartar control.  Odor control seems to be okay, but the tartar control has not improved.  This Dualblast version is disappointing.  For tartar control and odor elimination you should go with Listerine.</li>
            <li> literally the best tasting mouthwash i have ever used.  The taste is fantastic!  Can&#x27;t really explain it other than awesome.</li>
            <li> Listerine and Crest mouthwash are way better than Scope. I did not feel that my mouth was half as clean after using Scope as it was using a Listerine product or Crest. Good price but I would rather pay a few dollars extra for the better clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This particular formula tastes tons better than a leading mouthwash, and proves that you can successfully rinse without destroying your taste buds.  I recommend giving it a try.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Icy Mint Blast means exactly that. Prepare to have your mouth blown away by the Icy-ness of this mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for when you&#x27;re going out on a date, so the girl you&#x27;re with doesn&#x27;t have to put up with your crappy breath. You might even get a second date.</li>
            <li> GOOD MOUTHWASH, BUT THE PRICE IS NOT RIGHT FOR ME. PREFER LISTERINE ULTRA CLEAN. WAS NICE UNTIL IT RAN OUT. THIS IS A SMALL BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant mouthwash - unlike other leading brands that burn your mouth when your done, your mouth feels fresh and crisp.  It has a nice taste, and a little goes a long way.  750ml is enough for ONE person for ONE month, so if you subscribe &amp; save, be sure to add multiple items.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff - it&#x27;s strong but not over-powering.  Good fresh feeling after.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, keeps your mouth clean but without the harsh burn that you may get form other products like Listerine.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and leaves your breath smelling oh so good without the over kill burning effect of alcohol like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I love the strong taste. It really helps refresh myself every time. Good to use after any meals, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> This item is packaged well and the mouthwash quality is what I would expect from this manufacturer.  The bottle is tall so it doesn&#x27;t fit easily in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I love the scope mint blast, it leaves a very refreshing feeling in your mouth afterwards that makes you know the product has done its job to remove, protect, &amp; freshen the breath......  : )</li>
            <li> mad my teeth hurt. Crest pro health is awesome and no hurt.</li>
            <li> I think i got this mouthwash for around $1.xx shipped with the subscribe and save program. It works fine, but I still prefer the old stand-by Listerine.</li>
            <li> Very unique taste!  I can&#x27;t guarantee it will leave your mouth smelling the way you want, but it will definitely erase any other smells and tastes in there.</li>
            <li> Like it! It does the job! The bottle shape is nice and easy to hold. My dentist uses the same one!</li>
            <li> Wow what a blast, I really love this product. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh all day long, I have it on buy later with a date to purchase it.  Did you know that you could do this on Amazon, have a product shipped to you on a certain day or month?</li>
            <li> Is it just me or does this stuff taste exactly like Jagermeister? That initial taste disappears pretty fast, but every time I use this stuff, I have flashbacks.</li>
            <li> It did what it was supposed to do but did not WOW me.  The price was comparable to the store.</li>
            <li> As a longtime Listerine user, the only complaint I had was the price - so when a deal came around for Scope, I thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;. I used it for 3 nights and then decided to empty it down the sink and trash it. It was that bad. There was no &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; like Listerine has and in the middle of the night my breath was terrible. I wouldn&#x27;t use this if it were free.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need the bite that those alcohol based antiseptic mouth rinses have, then this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really love the flavor of this mouthwash. I just started using this a couple of days ago and it is excellent. It does contain alcohol which will give your mouth a little burn but it&#x27;s not a strong burn. How this mouthwash compares to others in a technical sense I cannot say. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a very short time but so far, I really love it. If you have sensitive teeth, I cannot say how this might affect you. I just think the flavor is nice and there is very little burn. The minty freshness lasts for a while after you use it to. Good product.</li>
            <li> This along with some other products was used in a care package as a gift for someone close, i figure would like to have some of your products. Worked very well for them,i could feel their warm smile over the phone.Very fancy bottle,also the whole presentation very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mouth wash and not much more. The taste/freshness tends to stick with you for a while. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a mouthwash connoisseur, but this one&#x27;s pretty refreshing and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bitter or otherwise off-putting taste.  Seems to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Liek the flavor, no after burn or taste lingering.  You can drink your OJ and not still taste this product.</li>
            <li> Scope Icy Mint Blast was 2.97 in October 2013. Now it&#x27;s 13.69. Spit THAT out.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of scope, but I wished it was a little stronger and lasted fresh longer.</li>
            <li> Killer price, and it works well on neutralizing bad odors. It does leave a weird aftertaste, similar to what orange juice after brushing, but it does it for everything in a less bitter way. Hard to explain, but weird.</li>
            <li> Cost me like $3, not bad. Tastes ok I guess, it is just mouthwash and saved me a trip to the store...</li>
            <li> This mouthwash works really well, it keeps my mouth clean longer than many other mouthwash brands, however it doesn&#x27;t taste like mint! The label and color all point to mint flavor but it tastes like cinnamon which leaves me very confused. It also isn&#x27;t very practical, the cap DOES NOT have a dual purchase like most other mouthwashes, so I have to measure the pour on my own. Besides several flaws it does leave my mouth feeling very clean for a long time, even after immediate use I am able to eat or drink something and not have a weird taste to it. I recommend it,</li>
            <li> I use Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and decided to give this mouthwash a try because it was cheaper. It was a bad move the mouthwash does not give me that clean feeling as Crest Pro-Health does. The mouthwash taste like candy and does not keep your breath fresh like Crest does. I do not recommend this product because it does not work.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like some washes do.  I would buy this again and will.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash is pretty strong but not too overpowering.  I think the green feels a little bit more intense than the blue but I still like both of them.  I love it when they go on sale because I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to pay full price.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the taste might be too strong but this one is just right. Not too strong or weak. Last&#x27;s most of the day too.</li>
            <li> Scope icy mint blast is named right, good mouthwash, the entire family likes it. Scope has always been a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Listerine and the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; that makes you really think it&#x27;s working hard.  This seems to work very well without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;...but makes me wonder if it&#x27;s doing as good of  a job.</li>
            <li> this mouthwash is different from what i expected.. but i didn&#x27;t know this had alcohol for one...&lt;br /&gt;but it does the job.. so i would recommend this product.. but a heads up .. it has ALCOHOL..&lt;br /&gt;now a days majority of products don&#x27;t have this ingredient anymore</li>
            <li> I like the bottle. The cap is a little annoying to &amp;#34;unclip&amp;#34; while turning. I just turn the cap one full turn before it clicks down. That way I can open it easier...</li>
            <li> Does not have a stinging or burning like so many mouth washes do, a bit of an aftertaste but what mouthwash doesn&#x27;t have that. Solid buy.</li>
            <li> In the most simplest terms this is a quality product for a fair price. The subscribe and save saves me from having to remember to by or look for a store that has it on sale. Doesn&#x27;t have all the whitening and medication of more expensive brands, but is really good for a mid day refresh or morning rinse.</li>
            <li> Well this doesnt taste terrible, not great either but it is mouth wash so what can you expect. It feels like it does a good job overall and was a good price when I bought it. Personally though I still feel Listerine is better, just has a more refreshed feeling after using than this one. However if you need something less intense then this is a decent substitute.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, WORK AS EXPECTED, GREAT TASTE, MY SISTER LOVE IT AND IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE, GO SCOPE.</li>
            <li> I got this mouthwash for only $2.00 with free shipping.  I really love the way this makes my mouth feel fresh. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Mild burn, does what a mouthwash does.</li>
            <li> ITS DONT LAST LONG, BUT ITS OKAY AND BRING THE PRICE DOWN A LITTLE AROUND 3.49 . SO THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review mouthwash. I can tell you this lacks the sting and strength of Listerine, but it works, tastes pretty good and doesn&#x27;t have any side affects that I am aware of (looking at you Crest). This is certainly worth a second look. I like the other Scope products, so I could not assist you if you dislike those and want to know if this is different enough.</li>
