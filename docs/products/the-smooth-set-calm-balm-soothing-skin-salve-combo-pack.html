            <li>Love this product and great customer service!</li>
            <li>works good after mangrooming</li>
            <li>Every good revue I read abut this prduct before buying it was dead-on.</li>
            <li>The combo pack really works great and from experience, I can say this is the best hair removal product on the market for men.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because it works better!</li>
            <li>Fantastic works great</li>
            <li>use at you own risk</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and seems to work as indicated.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite since it smells and stings</li>
            <li>BallsBalm just filled that gap!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it does keep them nice and smooth just like the way I like them</li>
            <li>My hubby and I love it.</li>
            <li>Waaaaaaay better than any OTC product branded for women that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>While the removal cream worked ok, ~this~ is the product I love.</li>
            <li>It is called the SMOOTH SET - however</li>
            <li>dose what its supposed to do makes em smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on as a lotion, but absorbs quickly, and then almost feels like a talc powder.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was a much gentler hair removal product than the original.</li>
            <li>If figured if it was good enough for sensitive skin on your boys</li>
            <li>then it was good enough for sensitive skin on your face.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, absorbs completely without any residue (even in schweaty Texas summers), scent-free, light but moisturizes well, leaves freshly shorn sensitive skin feeling velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely want to purchase this if you get the 3 pack of the hair removal cream since you will need this after :)</li>
            <li>This stuff works perfect and you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know why the high price!</li>
            <li>So much that I steal it every time I shave.</li>
            <li>see any difference to any other respectable moisturizer</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and relaxed!</li>
            <li>Will certainly be buying this product again when my current supply runs out!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t clear at all whether this included both the lotion and hair removal creme.</li>
            <li>I started with this as part of the Bare Pair kit.</li>

            <li> And a little actually goes quite far!</li>
            <li> Does leave a film, but it calms the area down (especially if you left the hair remover on too long).  </li>

            <li> Although I am not happy that Amazon only offers this as an add on to an additional order.</li>
            <li> Another benefit is that the lotion isn&#x27;t super cold out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> its slimey but takes care of itchiness down there its heats up.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes along way.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Disappointed with the advertising on this product. I was mislead into the thinking that this included the actual hair removal creme. It wasn&#x27;t clear at all whether this included both the lotion and hair removal creme. I thought this product was a much gentler hair removal product than the original. THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL HAIR REMOVAL CREME.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my third shipment.  The combo pack really works great and from experience, I can say this is the best hair removal product on the market for men.  It&#x27;s strong enough to be effective, but without the awful odor some of the other products have.  Another benefit is that the lotion isn&#x27;t super cold out of the bottle.  I&#x27;ve noticed hair grows back finer than some of the other removal creams as well.  The soothing skin salve is great and I use it for a day or two after application.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere anytime I shave</li>
            <li> its slimey but takes care of itchiness down there its heats up. to</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  Just got my &amp;#34;combo pack&amp;#34;.  It is 2 of the same bottle.  An after hair removal lotion.  It is called the SMOOTH SET - however, neither bottle is a hair removal.  BAD ADVERTISING and a complete waste of money.  Just finding out now AMAZON doesn&#x27;t even carry the hair remover that goes with this.</li>
            <li> just after lostion and also found out that this product (the hair revover part) can couse you to go starile..  use at you own risk</li>
            <li> Fantastic works great no itch burn or sting</li>
            <li> Product is not good in my opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with hair as long as I can remember! Removing it with creams has been one of those methods. Not my favorite since it smells and stings and you have nothing to use after the treatment. BallsBalm just filled that gap! Great product, no stinging, no greasy feeling, just comfort! I love it. And a little actually goes quite far!</li>
            <li> Works well, just wish the hair remover worked as well. But that may be just my &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of hair. But still use the balm after doing some &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works and feels great ....even on legs,arms all over,,,,Great product!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this is amazing!  No bumps or redness and there is minimal itchiness.  Made in the USA too!  I am overly impressed!  Best product out there!</li>
            <li> I use it and I don´t see any difference to any other respectable moisturizer, I don&#x27;t know why the high price!</li>
            <li> Great after using the hair remover.  Does leave a film, but it calms the area down (especially if you left the hair remover on too long).  Definitely want to purchase this if you get the 3 pack of the hair removal cream since you will need this after :)</li>
            <li> works good after mangrooming</li>
            <li> I do got big balls ... but it does keep them nice and smooth just like the way I like them</li>
            <li> Love this product and great customer service! Leaves skin feeling soft and relaxed! Will certainly be buying this product again when my current supply runs out!</li>
            <li> Great for any after shaved areas</li>
            <li> dose what its supposed to do makes em smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face for after-shave lotion. Great stuff! Eliminates razor burn and irritation. If figured if it was good enough for sensitive skin on your boys then it was good enough for sensitive skin on your face.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I love it. So much that I steal it every time I shave. Waaaaaaay better than any OTC product branded for women that I&#x27;ve used. Non-greasy, absorbs completely without any residue (even in schweaty Texas summers), scent-free, light but moisturizes well, leaves freshly shorn sensitive skin feeling velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> Every good revue I read abut this prduct before buying it was dead-on. If this stuff doesn&#x27;t work as advertised it&#x27;s because it works better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got happy balls !</li>
            <li> I started with this as part of the Bare Pair kit. While the removal cream worked ok, ~this~ is the product I love. I&#x27;ve gone back to shaving for my removal needs, but I still use this. It goes on as a lotion, but absorbs quickly, and then almost feels like a talc powder. It&#x27;s dry, but your skin doesn&#x27;t stick to itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. If you&#x27;re removing body hair, any body hair, use this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff works perfect. Nothing ever worked for me to keep razor bumps away. This stuff works perfect and you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Very easy to apply and seems to work as indicated.  It does not leave a sticky or greasy after effect.</li>
            <li> Works great!  A small amount goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have never used or even considered using such a product. After seeing this advertised I tried it.I like it and will continue to buy. Although I am not happy that Amazon only offers this as an add on to an additional order.</li>
