            <li>Great product at a good deal.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews about people saying that they aren&#x27;t good for eye makeup removal</li>
            <li>They are good but not what I was expecting or used to.</li>
            <li>Rinse &amp; you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good makeup remover wipe</li>

            <li>Good price and good product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I loved it.</li>
            <li>and I am sure they work great, but wouldn&#x27;t get them again - just don&#x27;t like the consistency.</li>
            <li>These also soap up nicely, so you get a really great lather - something I love.</li>
            <li>They do a great job of removing makeup and make my face feel so clean!</li>

            <li>These are pretty great!</li>
            <li>and I tend to break out, but these wipes do not irritate my skin and it feels refreshing afterwards!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are easy and they lather very nicely.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li>These cloths are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing way to cleanse your face.  </li>
            <li>Amazing deal here because for 4 boxes of 33, they are $17 at Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li>You get the cloth moist and then it suds up nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These cloths are so handy for taking on trips, just pack what you need in a sandwich baggie</li>
            <li>But I suspect this might be my own idiosyncratic reaction.  </li>
            <li>and they produce an abundant amount of cleansing foam.  </li>
            <li>This may have been my own mistake, but I thought these were the pre-moistened cloths.</li>
            <li>but that was my own fault for not reading the description entirely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>I prefer the soapy kind.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using soap on my face, and these are handy to have.</li>
            <li>Great for exfoliating and clean my face so well.</li>
            <li>Provide a great clean.  </li>
            <li>Give you a thorough and great clean.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for using in the shower, they do a great job of removing dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a mild face exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price and they came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, smells great, and quick!</li>
            <li>but these make it so easy!  </li>
            <li>Using these makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>These are the best ones that foam up with warm water and help keep my skin clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>They are HUGE!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great buy :)</li>
            <li>These are the best facial cloths.  </li>
            <li>Just count out how many you need and put them in a zip-lock baggie...  </li>
            <li>Prefer these much more over the pre-moistened cloths.  </li>
            <li>Love these, they remove all traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>I actually wash my face twice a day now. :D</li>
            <li>use every night and love them</li>
            <li>I love these, regardless.</li>
            <li>I believe I have more oily skin.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter think these are the best facial wipes.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I love these toweletts.</li>
            <li>They are disposibile which is better than soiling my wash cloths.</li>
            <li>, I was looking for a more all-in-one method.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these cloths for many years</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>this product is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>And believe me I tried them ALL before I resorted to the cloths. :-)</li>
            <li>I have ordered this many time from the stores.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of these cloths.  </li>
            <li>Love these to take makeup off,  Makes it easier to travel without having to carry along liquid</li>
            <li>Love the clothes and have used them for years.</li>
            <li>the exfoliating surface is more robust and you feel cleaner after youre done</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>I love the way these cloths are so sturdy and do not fall  apart if I have to scrub makeup off.  </li>
            <li>This one in comparison has more of an exfoliating texture to it.</li>
            <li>these work best for me because they have the double sided fabric to work with.  </li>
            <li>Love the 4 in 1 cloths.  </li>
            <li>What more could I ask from this?</li>
            <li>the clothes are ok, when they are gone</li>
            <li>i wont order them again.there&#x27;s something about them that dries my skin more than i like.</li>
            <li>Although most have commented on how big they are, I think they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter (age 12)  has started to use them also, she</li>
            <li>My skin always feels nice and clean after each use.</li>
            <li>but their more like pretty good.</li>
            <li>Full size is too much cleanser for one job, so it&#x27;s perfect and economical when they are on sale!</li>
            <li>They are soft, and mildly fragrant, they are perfect!</li>
            <li>It is still as good as the first day I discovered it.</li>
            <li>Also perfect for travel since they are dry, disposable &amp; compact.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be super amazing</li>
            <li>and I love how easy they are to travel with too.</li>
            <li>This does an excellent job of cleaning the makeup and debris off my face, and it&#x27;s compact enough to fit into any ole space in my carry-on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man and this is not the best item for rough</li>
            <li>This is my favourite facial cleanser, perfect for regular days, and great for days/nights you wear makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for me and my young sons to easily use and store.  </li>
            <li>They clean quite well and leave my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>They clean your skin pronto and leave it healthy looking...  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>My face is combination but gets oily quite easily in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li>These cloths are so easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>My wife is very pleased as she showed me how much make-up the wipes takes off even AFTER she cleans her face.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty handy.</li>
            <li>I use this because its way more convenient than having a tube full of something.</li>
            <li>Takes off make up, but most importantly you can feel your pores getting clean.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a small box or a baggie to store them in though because they just come in a plastic baggie inside a box that is not the best for storing them - to keep them dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They get rid of my makeup just fine.</li>
            <li>Finally I found these on Amazon, great price for the product and delivery to Australia, very quick service and the product arrived in a week.</li>
            <li>Since it is huge, I cut each piece into two using a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>These work great as a facial cleanser and do not create any acne issues!</li>
            <li>Light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>They are the same cloths i use to use and am happy that I have them for my travels again.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for traveling...</li>
            <li>Price is great for these and they&#x27;ll last me forever.</li>
            <li>They are great for removing makeup and the daily build up of dirt on the face.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s delivered to you for free</li>
            <li>and they keep my skin even-toned and breakout free.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, cleans face great, but doesn&#x27;t do so well at removing mascara or stay-put eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I debated returning them, but found that the individual packages work great for traveling...</li>
            <li>There is no scent to these cloths either which is important to me and there is nothing in them that irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>Her began using these years ago, when they were available at Costco.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fact that you have a soft side for your eyes and a side for the rest of your face</li>
            <li>these are perfect leaving you with a fully clean fresh face which some wet cloths do not provide.....</li>
            <li>The price is incredible you will find them in other stores for $12-to $14.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I feel about the Combination/Oily kind in particular--</li>
            <li>/&gt;These wipes take off my eye makeup very easily, and are gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>That is originally what I was looking for</li>
            <li>My inner hippie wept for the earth, and the rest of me just wept for joy that I found these cloths for such a good price.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these to take on a  cruise with me.</li>
            <li>I wish they came in a plastic box that was bathroom friendly.</li>
            <li>I meant to just buy wipes to clean my face.</li>
            <li>I use eye makeup remover pads and then just use the cloths to clean and residual eye makeup.</li>
            <li>it gets my face clean.</li>
            <li>They clean great, they are dry</li>
            <li>It does the job of exfoliating and clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so nice and clean when I use these, and I love that I can actually see the dirt on the cloth!</li>
            <li>my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean if I go a day without them.</li>
            <li>I use one every night to remove my makeup &amp; clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly and leave you felling refreshed and clean and take off  those blackheads</li>
            <li>it does what it suppose to do, clean your face.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>and and get my face really clean.</li>
            <li>The pad lathers well after applied with water and makes the face streak like clean.  </li>
            <li>I will continue for a long time.......or until Olay makes something better (can you imagine!!)</li>
            <li>Now, my face is smoother, my pores aren&#x27;t as large and my skin looks somewhat better</li>
            <li>Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use a full cloth per use--I rip them in half--and they still get the job done.</li>
            <li>These are good facial clothes.</li>
            <li>I just bought the Sensitive kind and will see if there&#x27;s a difference there.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for 13 years and I absolute love them.</li>
            <li>These supposedly had a side that was for exfoliation, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any marked difference between the two sides.</li>
            <li>Ive used this product for over 2 years and can only say good things about it.</li>
            <li>she loves them so much I am going to have to continue buying more of these because she doesn&#x27;t like anything</li>
            <li>They have a clean scent and just give you an all around clean, fresh face.</li>
            <li>I put these in my glass storage containers for the bathroom as a quick face washing option.  </li>
            <li>They take off my makeup quickly and allow me to scrub my pores with ease.</li>
            <li>Regardless, along with the oil came mild but persistent acne.</li>
            <li>For the most part - using these cloths daily has helped my skin tremendously - much better than all the face washes I tried.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally for awhile, I was glad when I found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>ive tried the normal skin version of this, but like this one better because:&lt;br /&gt;a) my skin is more combination/oily than normal</li>
            <li>My skin is always soft, I have no issues with acne, and as a bonus, I use my used wipe to clean off the counter top after I am done putting my makeup on.</li>
            <li>They work really well and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of these, much too strong.</li>
            <li>A few years ago my face began to become oilier - very ironic since I had perfect skin throughout my teen years and my twenties. :-)</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of makeup remover pads, both wet and dry, but these really do seem to work the best.  </li>
            <li>When I use my toner after using these pads there is rarely any makeup that shows up on the cotton pads.  </li>
            <li>I use them daily and its really nice for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They work nicely for a daily cleaning cloth.</li>
            <li>The wipes comes with its own moisturizers and it is the last thing she does before she retires for the night.  </li>
            <li>so I ended up with like 8 years&#x27; worth of these things.  </li>
            <li>removes makeup really well, tho really stubborn waterproof mascara will reguire additional remover.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my evening routine more stream lined</li>
            <li>These are effective and gentle on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Many other people love them though, so try it if you think you might like them.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again because I have found other, more convenient, wipes that I like better.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and made my skin feel soft, does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>These cloths are just right to cleanse your face without drying.  </li>
            <li>have combination skin &amp; find this to be the right strength of cleanser; not drying but gets rid of the oil &amp; gunk from the day.  </li>
            <li>Run them under water and wipe all that sweaty nastyness right off their face.  </li>
            <li>lightly dampen the \\&quot;cloth\\&quot; to get it sudsy &amp; remove my eye makeup first with the gentle side.  </li>
            <li>I feel like these really get my skin really clean and exfoliates.</li>
            <li>they help remove my make up and clean my face very well.</li>
            <li>I use them in the shower and possibly unlike most, it&#x27;s perfect for my face, behind my ears and neck.</li>
            <li>theyre super easy to use, especially for travel.</li>
            <li>I ordered these cloths as part of the subscribe and save feature because I was looking for a new way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>My only complain is that I wish the cloths would exfoliate better.</li>
            <li>It took some time to get my face back to where it should be but am pleased it is getting rid of the oil and dirt</li>
            <li>If I am too lazy to use my Clarisonic, these are the next best thing to use to remove all my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really love these cloths for removing makeup and especially when coming in from sport activities with a face all covered with  sunscreen...</li>
            <li>Love using this facial cloth.  </li>
            <li>It was a better price than in my local stores.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite facial cloths and I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li>I began using these cloths every day: twice a day at first and then just once a day as my skin began to improve.</li>
            <li>They recently changed the packaging look &amp; name of these cloths slightly, &amp; at first I thought Olay quit making the cloths I love &amp; have used for years.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for my daughter and she really likes them!</li>
            <li>What more could a teen ask for!</li>
            <li>I love this washing pads and use them daily.</li>
            <li>These are the only ones that I have used for year, so glad they come in bulk online.</li>
            <li>Once the soap in the cloth is used up, I just use more soap or body wash like one would with a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li>My own fault, i expected these to be the moist cloths, they are the ones that you need to add water to though</li>
            <li>But until then I&#x27;ll keep using these religiously. :-)</li>
            <li>I used to love these, but they seem to have changed the cloths that they use recently.</li>
            <li>These are still good for traveling as you can just pack a few instead of lugging around a bottle of face wash.</li>
            <li>These are the original Oil of Olay facial wipes, with the slightly rough side that is good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>This item is really great for travel since it stays dry until you wet it and also works well to keep on hand for quick makeup changes for going out after work, etc.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean after and not dried out.</li>
            <li>leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>, Makes my face feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I love these cloths and have for a long time.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is a quality control issue I think - some packages are soapier than others (a good thing) and some cloths are more abrasive than others.</li>
            <li>The side with blue dots washes more gently than the side without dots which really exfoliates your skin.</li>
            <li>I love that they have a smooth side which I use for my eyes and then a more textured side that I use on the rest of my face where I scrub a little harder.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it if you don&#x27;t have a clean face, or want a fresh face when ever.</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry patches on otherwise oily skin, and these used to slough them off quite nicely, but now they don&#x27;t do much more than the average face wash.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have re-ordered the &#x27;normal&#x27; Olay facial cloths which I love.</li>
            <li>so it was easy for me to sign on to get it regularly!  </li>
            <li>Not bad, they are much better than using plain soap.</li>
            <li>My face is left smooth ready for my day and/or night treatments.</li>
            <li>I would not say that these alone have completely cleared their skin, but they definitely make a huge improvement!  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and they leave me feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>They work really well though.</li>
            <li>Very sudsy.</li>
            <li>The item arrived fast and on time and as described.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>Work really well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>would only use this after shaving and have a 100% smooth baby face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The olay 4-in-1 combination, really helps me in the mornings with i use both sides of the cloth to wash my face.</li>
            <li>They get very sudsy and do cleanse your face well.</li>
            <li>Removes make up fast and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>/oily really is the one for me.</li>
            <li>These are so much more than I expected, and so affordable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get these.  </li>
            <li>Ive also used the \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; skin version and it works very well as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li>They suds up really well</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>Really cleans off the makeup and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>These are great for when you don&#x27;t actually want to take the time to use actual facial products and save yourself some time.</li>
            <li>It is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>These cloths are not like moist baby-wipes that are ready to use out of the package.</li>
            <li>I just really like how my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>They suds up really well</li>
            <li>I may order another box after these are all gone, but I do really like them.</li>
            <li>Yes To Cucumbers Facial Towelettes, Natural Glow, 30 ct.]] is better at removing make up.</li>
            <li>Seems to be okay, but the package I received was a non-retail box with individually packaged wiped marked as &amp;#34;SAMPLE NOT FOR SALE&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling soft and clean, not tight.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a cloth, my face feels extra clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Using the full size allows me to remove as much makeup as possible.</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li>These combination/oily daily facials leave my skin feeling clean when nothing else does.</li>
            <li>Then I got the new ones (from Costco!)</li>
            <li>Dried out too fast in package and price was better with Kirkland.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly to help remove makeup because most regular cleansers just can&#x27;t properly do that.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize they were a different cloth from the regular ones, which are like a gauze material and I love those.  </li>
            <li>They are so much more simple to use than smaller cleaning pads or a washcloth with soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just more convenient for me to use regular face wash for daily use than to lather this cloth</li>
            <li>Better than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; daily facial cloths.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using since high school.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these over soap bars.</li>
            <li>I say they are alright because they clean ok, not great.</li>
            <li>Since using these my skin is feeling smooth and clean, never dry or tight.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m wearing a heavier foundation (rarely), I also use a makeup removing cloth prior to washing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the cleansing cloths for normal and combination/oily and the combo</li>
            <li>This seems to take away no steps from a normal face wash routine.  </li>
            <li>I switch between Normal or Combination depending on the season and the weather.  </li>
            <li>I love this because if I&#x27;m going somewhere I can just pop a few in my bag and not worry about them drying out or making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Chicago and the weather and environment can play havoc with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it brand new on my face because the wash is impregnated with soap.  </li>
            <li>The new ones aren&#x27;t as &#x27;scrubby.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I had been using these for years and will now have to find a new product.</li>
            <li>Overall however, I love how you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out since you wet them as needed.</li>
            <li>I purchased these daily facial cloths expecting to receive 2 plastic containers filled with 33 cloths each.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling refreshed and very clear.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, eczema and all, and they have never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>i just pack a couple cloths with my other toiletries and am good to go for a few days.</li>
            <li>Even using these everyday 1 pad will easily work</li>
            <li>I really like these Olay facial cloths.  </li>
            <li>As a frequent traveler.</li>
            <li>No need to spend a fortune on facial cleansers...even removes waterproof mascara, just need to rub the soapy bubbles gently on eyes for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>and I always get compliments that at 61 my face has no wrinkles and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>Provides deep cleansing using the rougher texture, and gentle cleaning around the eyes with the smoother texture.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complete my face morning and evening face cleaning routine without them.</li>
            <li>I never liked the idea of using a washcloth more than once without sanitizing it.  </li>
            <li>They have one soft side and one rougher side.  </li>
            <li>No idea how old these are, if they were stored well, etc.</li>
            <li>fabulous product and much less than stores!</li>
            <li>and they only have the moist cloths which dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it everyday to clean my face of all that acne causing stuff.</li>
            <li>Have used these for years but am now starting to have difficulty finding them for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I actually use the exfoliating side first and then turn over to the regular side.</li>
            <li>The cloths really seem to exfoliate and deep cleanse, which apparently is what I needed.</li>
            <li>As another user mentioned, when they first came out with these several years ago, the cloths actually scrubbed &amp; exfoliated your skin a bit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these since high school (I&#x27;m 33 now), and they&#x27;re the only thing that helps with break-outs without burning or eating away at my face.</li>
            <li>You only need to use half of a cloth to get your whole face clean, so it&#x27;s a double value!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Olay products and as usual this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>and they really wash off the oil from waking up and from the long day.</li>
            <li>After recently moving to Australia I discovered that they are not a common product here</li>
            <li>Everyone feels better even when sick if they can find a convenient easy way when there is no one to help.</li>
            <li>I recommend these cloths to anyone who may find him or herself in the same situation as me – needing a new skin care regiment.</li>
            <li>and they are durable enough that I can use one each day as a new and disposable washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, &amp; the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found to remove my eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t irritate is</li>
            <li>I would use them 2-3 times a day and they definitely helped my face clear up a lot!</li>
            <li>It does have to have water added, so they are not wet wipes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that gets rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li>My suggestion would be to pay the extra money and purchase direct from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have used the Olay &#x27;normal&#x27; facial cloths for years and tried the combination/oily last month.</li>
            <li>I cut it in half as I don&#x27;t use much make up so</li>
            <li>I do cut each sheet in half as it seems to be too much lather/cleaning potential from 1 sheet.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazing deal here because for 4 boxes of 33, they are $17 at Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li> You get the cloth moist and then it suds up nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These cloths are so handy for taking on trips, just pack what you need in a sandwich baggie</li>
            <li> But I suspect this might be my own idiosyncratic reaction.  </li>
            <li> and they produce an abundant amount of cleansing foam.  </li>
            <li> This may have been my own mistake, but I thought these were the pre-moistened cloths.</li>
            <li> but that was my own fault for not reading the description entirely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I prefer the soapy kind.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using soap on my face, and these are handy to have.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Great buy :)</li>
            <li> These are the best facial cloths.  </li>
            <li> Just count out how many you need and put them in a zip-lock baggie...  </li>
            <li> Prefer these much more over the pre-moistened cloths.  </li>
            <li> Love these, they remove all traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> I actually wash my face twice a day now. :D</li>
            <li> use every night and love them</li>
            <li> I love these, regardless.</li>
            <li> I believe I have more oily skin.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter think these are the best facial wipes.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> I love these toweletts.</li>
            <li> They are disposibile which is better than soiling my wash cloths.</li>
            <li> , I was looking for a more all-in-one method.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cloths for many years</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> this product is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> And believe me I tried them ALL before I resorted to the cloths. :-)</li>
            <li> I have ordered this many time from the stores.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of these cloths.  </li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> I love the way these cloths are so sturdy and do not fall  apart if I have to scrub makeup off.  </li>
            <li> This one in comparison has more of an exfoliating texture to it.</li>
            <li> these work best for me because they have the double sided fabric to work with.  </li>
            <li> Love the 4 in 1 cloths.  </li>
            <li> What more could I ask from this?</li>
            <li> the clothes are ok, when they are gone</li>
            <li> i wont order them again.there&#x27;s something about them that dries my skin more than i like.</li>
            <li> Although most have commented on how big they are, I think they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter (age 12)  has started to use them also, she</li>
            <li> My skin always feels nice and clean after each use.</li>
            <li> but their more like pretty good.</li>
            <li> Full size is too much cleanser for one job, so it&#x27;s perfect and economical when they are on sale!</li>
            <li> They are soft, and mildly fragrant, they are perfect!</li>
            <li> It is still as good as the first day I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Also perfect for travel since they are dry, disposable &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be super amazing</li>
            <li> and I love how easy they are to travel with too.</li>
            <li> This does an excellent job of cleaning the makeup and debris off my face, and it&#x27;s compact enough to fit into any ole space in my carry-on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and this is not the best item for rough</li>
            <li> This is my favourite facial cleanser, perfect for regular days, and great for days/nights you wear makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for me and my young sons to easily use and store.  </li>
            <li> They clean quite well and leave my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> They clean your skin pronto and leave it healthy looking...  </li>
            <li> Easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> My face is combination but gets oily quite easily in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li> These cloths are so easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased as she showed me how much make-up the wipes takes off even AFTER she cleans her face.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty handy.</li>
            <li> I use this because its way more convenient than having a tube full of something.</li>
            <li> Takes off make up, but most importantly you can feel your pores getting clean.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a small box or a baggie to store them in though because they just come in a plastic baggie inside a box that is not the best for storing them - to keep them dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They get rid of my makeup just fine.</li>
            <li> Finally I found these on Amazon, great price for the product and delivery to Australia, very quick service and the product arrived in a week.</li>
            <li> Since it is huge, I cut each piece into two using a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> These work great as a facial cleanser and do not create any acne issues!</li>
            <li> Light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> They are the same cloths i use to use and am happy that I have them for my travels again.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for traveling...</li>
            <li> Price is great for these and they&#x27;ll last me forever.</li>
            <li> They are great for removing makeup and the daily build up of dirt on the face.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s delivered to you for free</li>
            <li> and they keep my skin even-toned and breakout free.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after use.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, cleans face great, but doesn&#x27;t do so well at removing mascara or stay-put eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I debated returning them, but found that the individual packages work great for traveling...</li>
            <li> There is no scent to these cloths either which is important to me and there is nothing in them that irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> Her began using these years ago, when they were available at Costco.  </li>
            <li> I loved the fact that you have a soft side for your eyes and a side for the rest of your face</li>
            <li> these are perfect leaving you with a fully clean fresh face which some wet cloths do not provide.....</li>
            <li> The price is incredible you will find them in other stores for $12-to $14.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I feel about the Combination/Oily kind in particular--</li>
            <li> /&gt;These wipes take off my eye makeup very easily, and are gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> That is originally what I was looking for</li>
            <li> My inner hippie wept for the earth, and the rest of me just wept for joy that I found these cloths for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these to take on a  cruise with me.</li>
            <li> I wish they came in a plastic box that was bathroom friendly.</li>
            <li> I meant to just buy wipes to clean my face.</li>
            <li> I use eye makeup remover pads and then just use the cloths to clean and residual eye makeup.</li>
            <li> it gets my face clean.</li>
            <li> They clean great, they are dry</li>
            <li> It does the job of exfoliating and clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels so nice and clean when I use these, and I love that I can actually see the dirt on the cloth!</li>
            <li> my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean if I go a day without them.</li>
            <li> I use one every night to remove my makeup &amp; clean my skin.  </li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly and leave you felling refreshed and clean and take off  those blackheads</li>
            <li> it does what it suppose to do, clean your face.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> and and get my face really clean.</li>
            <li> The pad lathers well after applied with water and makes the face streak like clean.  </li>
            <li> I will continue for a long time.......or until Olay makes something better (can you imagine!!)</li>
            <li> Now, my face is smoother, my pores aren&#x27;t as large and my skin looks somewhat better</li>
            <li> Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use a full cloth per use--I rip them in half--and they still get the job done.</li>
            <li> These are good facial clothes.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Sensitive kind and will see if there&#x27;s a difference there.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 13 years and I absolute love them.</li>
            <li> These supposedly had a side that was for exfoliation, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any marked difference between the two sides.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for over 2 years and can only say good things about it.</li>
            <li> she loves them so much I am going to have to continue buying more of these because she doesn&#x27;t like anything</li>
            <li> They have a clean scent and just give you an all around clean, fresh face.</li>
            <li> I put these in my glass storage containers for the bathroom as a quick face washing option.  </li>
            <li> They take off my makeup quickly and allow me to scrub my pores with ease.</li>
            <li> Regardless, along with the oil came mild but persistent acne.</li>
            <li> For the most part - using these cloths daily has helped my skin tremendously - much better than all the face washes I tried.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally for awhile, I was glad when I found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ive tried the normal skin version of this, but like this one better because:&lt;br /&gt;a) my skin is more combination/oily than normal</li>
            <li> My skin is always soft, I have no issues with acne, and as a bonus, I use my used wipe to clean off the counter top after I am done putting my makeup on.</li>
            <li> They work really well and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of these, much too strong.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my face began to become oilier - very ironic since I had perfect skin throughout my teen years and my twenties. :-)</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of makeup remover pads, both wet and dry, but these really do seem to work the best.  </li>
            <li> When I use my toner after using these pads there is rarely any makeup that shows up on the cotton pads.  </li>
            <li> I use them daily and its really nice for your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They work nicely for a daily cleaning cloth.</li>
            <li> The wipes comes with its own moisturizers and it is the last thing she does before she retires for the night.  </li>
            <li> so I ended up with like 8 years&#x27; worth of these things.  </li>
            <li> removes makeup really well, tho really stubborn waterproof mascara will reguire additional remover.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my evening routine more stream lined</li>
            <li> These are effective and gentle on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Many other people love them though, so try it if you think you might like them.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again because I have found other, more convenient, wipes that I like better.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and made my skin feel soft, does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> These cloths are just right to cleanse your face without drying.  </li>
            <li> have combination skin &amp; find this to be the right strength of cleanser; not drying but gets rid of the oil &amp; gunk from the day.  </li>
            <li> Run them under water and wipe all that sweaty nastyness right off their face.  </li>
            <li> lightly dampen the \\&quot;cloth\\&quot; to get it sudsy &amp; remove my eye makeup first with the gentle side.  </li>
            <li> I feel like these really get my skin really clean and exfoliates.</li>
            <li> they help remove my make up and clean my face very well.</li>
            <li> I use them in the shower and possibly unlike most, it&#x27;s perfect for my face, behind my ears and neck.</li>
            <li> theyre super easy to use, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered these cloths as part of the subscribe and save feature because I was looking for a new way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> My only complain is that I wish the cloths would exfoliate better.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get my face back to where it should be but am pleased it is getting rid of the oil and dirt</li>
            <li> If I am too lazy to use my Clarisonic, these are the next best thing to use to remove all my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I really love these cloths for removing makeup and especially when coming in from sport activities with a face all covered with  sunscreen...</li>
            <li> Love using this facial cloth.  </li>
            <li> It was a better price than in my local stores.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite facial cloths and I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li> I began using these cloths every day: twice a day at first and then just once a day as my skin began to improve.</li>
            <li> They recently changed the packaging look &amp; name of these cloths slightly, &amp; at first I thought Olay quit making the cloths I love &amp; have used for years.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter and she really likes them!</li>
            <li> What more could a teen ask for!</li>
            <li> I love this washing pads and use them daily.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones that I have used for year, so glad they come in bulk online.</li>
            <li> Once the soap in the cloth is used up, I just use more soap or body wash like one would with a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> My own fault, i expected these to be the moist cloths, they are the ones that you need to add water to though</li>
            <li> But until then I&#x27;ll keep using these religiously. :-)</li>
            <li> I used to love these, but they seem to have changed the cloths that they use recently.</li>
            <li> These are still good for traveling as you can just pack a few instead of lugging around a bottle of face wash.</li>
            <li> These are the original Oil of Olay facial wipes, with the slightly rough side that is good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This item is really great for travel since it stays dry until you wet it and also works well to keep on hand for quick makeup changes for going out after work, etc.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean after and not dried out.</li>
            <li> leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> , Makes my face feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I love these cloths and have for a long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is a quality control issue I think - some packages are soapier than others (a good thing) and some cloths are more abrasive than others.</li>
            <li> The side with blue dots washes more gently than the side without dots which really exfoliates your skin.</li>
            <li> I love that they have a smooth side which I use for my eyes and then a more textured side that I use on the rest of my face where I scrub a little harder.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it if you don&#x27;t have a clean face, or want a fresh face when ever.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry patches on otherwise oily skin, and these used to slough them off quite nicely, but now they don&#x27;t do much more than the average face wash.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered the &#x27;normal&#x27; Olay facial cloths which I love.</li>
            <li> so it was easy for me to sign on to get it regularly!  </li>
            <li> Not bad, they are much better than using plain soap.</li>
            <li> My face is left smooth ready for my day and/or night treatments.</li>
            <li> I would not say that these alone have completely cleared their skin, but they definitely make a huge improvement!  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and they leave me feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> They work really well though.</li>
            <li> Very sudsy.</li>
            <li> The item arrived fast and on time and as described.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> Work really well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> would only use this after shaving and have a 100% smooth baby face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The olay 4-in-1 combination, really helps me in the mornings with i use both sides of the cloth to wash my face.</li>
            <li> They get very sudsy and do cleanse your face well.</li>
            <li> Removes make up fast and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> /oily really is the one for me.</li>
            <li> These are so much more than I expected, and so affordable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get these.  </li>
            <li> Ive also used the \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; skin version and it works very well as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also exfoliate gently.</li>
            <li> They suds up really well</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> Really cleans off the makeup and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> These are great for when you don&#x27;t actually want to take the time to use actual facial products and save yourself some time.</li>
            <li> It is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> These cloths are not like moist baby-wipes that are ready to use out of the package.</li>
            <li> I just really like how my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> They suds up really well</li>
            <li> I may order another box after these are all gone, but I do really like them.</li>
            <li> Yes To Cucumbers Facial Towelettes, Natural Glow, 30 ct.]] is better at removing make up.</li>
            <li> Seems to be okay, but the package I received was a non-retail box with individually packaged wiped marked as &amp;#34;SAMPLE NOT FOR SALE&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling soft and clean, not tight.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a cloth, my face feels extra clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> Using the full size allows me to remove as much makeup as possible.</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li> These combination/oily daily facials leave my skin feeling clean when nothing else does.</li>
            <li> Then I got the new ones (from Costco!)</li>
            <li> Dried out too fast in package and price was better with Kirkland.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly to help remove makeup because most regular cleansers just can&#x27;t properly do that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they were a different cloth from the regular ones, which are like a gauze material and I love those.  </li>
            <li> They are so much more simple to use than smaller cleaning pads or a washcloth with soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just more convenient for me to use regular face wash for daily use than to lather this cloth</li>
            <li> Better than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; daily facial cloths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using since high school.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these over soap bars.</li>
            <li> I say they are alright because they clean ok, not great.</li>
            <li> Since using these my skin is feeling smooth and clean, never dry or tight.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m wearing a heavier foundation (rarely), I also use a makeup removing cloth prior to washing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the cleansing cloths for normal and combination/oily and the combo</li>
            <li> This seems to take away no steps from a normal face wash routine.  </li>
            <li> I switch between Normal or Combination depending on the season and the weather.  </li>
            <li> I love this because if I&#x27;m going somewhere I can just pop a few in my bag and not worry about them drying out or making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago and the weather and environment can play havoc with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it brand new on my face because the wash is impregnated with soap.  </li>
            <li> The new ones aren&#x27;t as &#x27;scrubby.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I had been using these for years and will now have to find a new product.</li>
            <li> Overall however, I love how you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out since you wet them as needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased these daily facial cloths expecting to receive 2 plastic containers filled with 33 cloths each.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling refreshed and very clear.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, eczema and all, and they have never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> i just pack a couple cloths with my other toiletries and am good to go for a few days.</li>
            <li> Even using these everyday 1 pad will easily work</li>
            <li> I really like these Olay facial cloths.  </li>
            <li> As a frequent traveler.</li>
            <li> No need to spend a fortune on facial cleansers...even removes waterproof mascara, just need to rub the soapy bubbles gently on eyes for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> and I always get compliments that at 61 my face has no wrinkles and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Provides deep cleansing using the rougher texture, and gentle cleaning around the eyes with the smoother texture.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complete my face morning and evening face cleaning routine without them.</li>
            <li> I never liked the idea of using a washcloth more than once without sanitizing it.  </li>
            <li> They have one soft side and one rougher side.  </li>
            <li> No idea how old these are, if they were stored well, etc.</li>
            <li> fabulous product and much less than stores!</li>
            <li> and they only have the moist cloths which dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday to clean my face of all that acne causing stuff.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years but am now starting to have difficulty finding them for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I actually use the exfoliating side first and then turn over to the regular side.</li>
            <li> The cloths really seem to exfoliate and deep cleanse, which apparently is what I needed.</li>
            <li> As another user mentioned, when they first came out with these several years ago, the cloths actually scrubbed &amp; exfoliated your skin a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since high school (I&#x27;m 33 now), and they&#x27;re the only thing that helps with break-outs without burning or eating away at my face.</li>
            <li> You only need to use half of a cloth to get your whole face clean, so it&#x27;s a double value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Olay products and as usual this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> and they really wash off the oil from waking up and from the long day.</li>
            <li> After recently moving to Australia I discovered that they are not a common product here</li>
            <li> Everyone feels better even when sick if they can find a convenient easy way when there is no one to help.</li>
            <li> I recommend these cloths to anyone who may find him or herself in the same situation as me – needing a new skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> and they are durable enough that I can use one each day as a new and disposable washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, &amp; the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found to remove my eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t irritate is</li>
            <li> I would use them 2-3 times a day and they definitely helped my face clear up a lot!</li>
            <li> It does have to have water added, so they are not wet wipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that gets rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li> My suggestion would be to pay the extra money and purchase direct from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have used the Olay &#x27;normal&#x27; facial cloths for years and tried the combination/oily last month.</li>
            <li> I cut it in half as I don&#x27;t use much make up so</li>
            <li> I do cut each sheet in half as it seems to be too much lather/cleaning potential from 1 sheet.</li>
            <li> Because they come in a plain box, 2 sets together, they are very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have a normal to slightly oily face</li>
            <li> but alas I should have read more carefully!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for the &#x27;wet&#x27; cloths because they always go dry in the package once opened no matter how careful it is re-sealed after each use...  </li>
            <li> Even my mother commented that such a small item didn&#x27;t need THAT much safety padding.</li>
            <li> The good news is that they are really big and you can get twice the value by cutting them in half.</li>
            <li> another user mentioned as well, I also cut these cloths up in half because they are far too big.</li>
            <li> I didnt want to carry my usual face wash with me and these seems very convenient.</li>
            <li> They are dry cloths (which I MUCH prefer to the wet ones), &amp; they have little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on them for exfoliating purposes.  </li>
            <li> These wipes come dry, and you just need a little hot water to make them a little foamy.</li>
            <li> and I plan to keep buying these as long as they are sold here.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Daily Facial Cloths for a little over a year now</li>
            <li> The back of them (without the blue dots) have a little scrub to them.</li>
            <li> Like that they won&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> These are dry cloths which lather well when water is applied.  </li>
            <li> so I think they work well even for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face well, gets all the oil off and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> This product is dry</li>
            <li> B001F51T3Q Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid]]</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft on one side and a little rougher on the other.  </li>
            <li> These are dry sheets that you have to get wet.</li>
            <li> These are dry wipes that you wet with water.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> They are not pre-moistened; they are dry and you wet them to wash your face.</li>
            <li> My skin is not really combination, it&#x27;s dry but</li>
            <li> and these left me feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a convenient way to wash my face, but they aren&#x27;t any more convenient than using regular face wash (and yes, I am so lazy that I sometimes find washing my face with face wash to be inconvenient).  </li>
            <li> and I like the little blue beads on the wipe help to remove the makeup</li>
            <li> I would use the cloths as an exfoliator once a week on the rough side of the cloth.</li>
            <li> I used to use those wet makeup removers &amp; then cleanser</li>
            <li> All you do is wet, wash and throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I did not read product description correctly but you need to wet these in order to use them.</li>
            <li> You wet them, wash your face, rinse your face and throw the wipe away.</li>
            <li> Im not much for all these cleansing products but tried these</li>
            <li> , I cut mine in half because it seems like a waste not to because the sheets are so big.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using them either</li>
            <li> They work well, and are extremely convenient.  </li>
            <li> Rougher texture on one side - smoother on the other.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other Olay daily facials have small holes throughout, but these do not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years and have tried other products when I&#x27;ve run out of Olay.</li>
            <li> They have tiny micro-beads on them to do a little scrubbing, but they aren&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the type of container they come in.</li>
            <li> I am a little upset because it is not exactly what I wanted, I thought they were already moist wipes with no rinse off</li>
            <li> If I am not wearing makeup I cut the sheet and use half.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a 33-wipe pack from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Previously I was using eye makeup remover and face wash</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using a yogurt cream-based cleanser</li>
            <li> I get this on my subscribe and save account and pay half the price than if bought separately at the store.</li>
            <li> Both are very active with sports and struggle with some &amp;#34;teen acne&amp;#34; issues.  </li>
            <li> Olay is one of the very few products that no matter what I try from their line thus far does not react badly with my extremely over sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You have to soak the little papers to get them soapy, rub them to get them foamy, wash your face, and then rinse your face.  </li>
            <li> I use these nightly to remove my makeup and just get a little cleaner.</li>
            <li> After I rinse the suds out, I place a little eye makeup remover on it to get all my eye make up off.</li>
            <li> I never really washed my face with face washing stuff because face washing stuff sucks</li>
            <li> These are so convenient to carry a few in their gym bags.  </li>
            <li> I just pull one cloth out everyday.</li>
            <li> The tissues were all dried.</li>
            <li> These do the job, but they are a thin fibrous material with small blue dots on them.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy these at the grocery store or Target, but I ordered them on Amazon since I was already placing an Amazon order for another product.  </li>
            <li> I was using the Neutrogena makeup wipes before these, but they were too small.</li>
            <li> ive used theses for about the past  fifteen years</li>
            <li> I just felt lazy to go pick one up and ordered them online.  </li>
            <li> Pack a few in a plastic baggie, &amp; you&#x27;re set!    </li>
            <li> Way back I tried cutting them in half as some suggested and that was just too small for me.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding these in the store and saw amazon had them.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to evenly tear it by hand.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell which is the &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li> However, I do not like getting water/soap in my eyes so it was not effective at removing eye makeup for me.</li>
            <li> No more need for a separate exfoliating mask!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena scrub pads for acne and was unable to find them anywhere</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was not it.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> so I can keep them in my suitcase and not have to worry about them going bad.</li>
            <li> The burning isn&#x27;t horrible, but I think that Olay could make these so that no eye burning would occur since Olay claims to remove eye makeup.    </li>

            <li> I usually buy these at the grocery store or Target, but I ordered them on Amazon since I was already placing an Amazon order for another product.  The price was comparable to what i pay in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, these are the only cloths that remove all my makeup.  I don&#x27;t even use a full cloth per use--I rip them in half--and they still get the job done.</li>
            <li> These cloths are just right to cleanse your face without drying.  These work great as a facial cleanser and do not create any acne issues!</li>
            <li> I love these!  The scent is amazing.  Light and not overpowering.  If I am not wearing makeup I cut the sheet and use half.  I have combination skin and they leave me feeling clean but not dry.  My only complain is that I wish the cloths would exfoliate better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. You get the cloth moist and then it suds up nicely.  Perfect for refreshing in the morning or anytime.  My skin always feels nice and clean after each use.</li>
            <li> I was using apricot scrub that doesn&#x27;t work for oily skin. It took some time to get my face back to where it should be but am pleased it is getting rid of the oil and dirt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy :)</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and used these cloths when travelling as it saves on taking bottles and keeping within the 100ml limit when taking hand baggage only on flights. After recently moving to Australia I discovered that they are not a common product here and they only have the moist cloths which dry out quickly. Finally I found these on Amazon, great price for the product and delivery to Australia, very quick service and the product arrived in a week. They are the same cloths i use to use and am happy that I have them for my travels again. I do not use them on a daily basis as I like the cleanse tone and moisturise routine but for travels up to a couple of weeks and over night stops these are perfect leaving you with a fully clean fresh face which some wet cloths do not provide..... Very happy indeed!</li>
            <li> These are the best facial cloths.  I&#x27;ve been using since high school.  And that was over 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> I get these on the save and subscribe program.  I have used many brands of makeup remover pads, both wet and dry, but these really do seem to work the best.  If I am too lazy to use my Clarisonic, these are the next best thing to use to remove all my makeup.  When I use my toner after using these pads there is rarely any makeup that shows up on the cotton pads.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years but am now starting to have difficulty finding them for a decent price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I actually bought these by mistake. I meant to just buy wipes to clean my face. These are dry sheets that you have to get wet. They work really well though. I would use them 2-3 times a day and they definitely helped my face clear up a lot!</li>
            <li> I really love these cloths for removing makeup and especially when coming in from sport activities with a face all covered with  sunscreen...They clean your skin pronto and leave it healthy looking...  I don&#x27;t care much for the &#x27;wet&#x27; cloths because they always go dry in the package once opened no matter how careful it is re-sealed after each use...  These are fantastic for traveling... Just count out how many you need and put them in a zip-lock baggie...  They take up no room in your travel bag and just toss away when used...  They are the best!</li>
            <li> I really like these Olay facial cloths.  They&#x27;re soft on one side and a little rougher on the other.  Great for exfoliating and clean my face so well. If I&#x27;m wearing a heavier foundation (rarely), I also use a makeup removing cloth prior to washing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cloths are so handy for taking on trips, just pack what you need in a sandwich baggie and you&#x27;re good to go.  Prefer these much more over the pre-moistened cloths.  Price is great for these and they&#x27;ll last me forever.</li>
            <li> Love these, they remove all traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding these in the store and saw amazon had them. I feel like these really get my skin really clean and exfoliates. I read the reviews about people saying that they aren&#x27;t good for eye makeup removal and I agree. I use eye makeup remover pads and then just use the cloths to clean and residual eye makeup.</li>
            <li> These are the best freaking things for my face since... my face!  I never really washed my face with face washing stuff because face washing stuff sucks but these make it so easy!  I actually wash my face twice a day now. :D</li>
            <li> I started to break out when I used these.  But I suspect this might be my own idiosyncratic reaction.  Others may or may not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> They work really well and easy to travel with.  I put them in a plastic bag and tuck them into my purse if I need to use them outside of my home.  I use them daily and its really nice for your skin.</li>
            <li> These are good facial clothes. I have been using the Neutrogena scrub pads for acne and was unable to find them anywhere so I tried these.  They are good but not what I was expecting or used to.</li>
            <li> This is pretty handy. It would be great for travels. I like that it takes your eye makeup off too. That is originally what I was looking for and I found this combination face and eye makeup remover. My face feels clean after and not dried out. Very sudsy.</li>
            <li> use every night and love them</li>
            <li> These cloths are amazing.  Just dampen with water and they produce an abundant amount of cleansing foam.  I feel my face is thoroughly cleasnsed and all traces of makeup removed.  Great when traveling.  My face is left smooth ready for my day and/or night treatments.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I do not give these 5 stars is because the cloths burn my eyes when I try to take off waterproof mascara. The burning isn&#x27;t horrible, but I think that Olay could make these so that no eye burning would occur since Olay claims to remove eye makeup.    I love these, regardless. They are HUGE! And, they really do a great job of removing makeup, including eye makeup (despite the bearable burning). I was using the Neutrogena makeup wipes before these, but they were too small. I never felt like I could remove all my makeup.    With these cloths, get every drop of makeup off and then I cleanse my face with my daily cleanser!    If anything, use these for makeup removal, they work great!</li>
            <li> The item arrived fast and on time and as described. I thought I had combination skin, however after using these I believe I have more oily skin. After using these, my forehead was way greasy by the middle of the day. After this, I tried using Biore ice cleansing facial wash, and it has helped keep my skin non-greasy and get rid of pimples. I still use the olay cloths just to remove makeup, and use for travel. I would use the cloths as an exfoliator once a week on the rough side of the cloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years.  They remove makeup, eyeliner, mascara &amp; foundation, while cleaning my skin.  I used to use those wet makeup removers &amp; then cleanser but with this product, it&#x27;s one step and you get the added benefit of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lightly dampen the \\&quot;cloth\\&quot; to get it sudsy &amp; remove my eye makeup first with the gentle side.  Then I flip it over to the exfoliation side to wash my face &amp; remove foundation.  Rinse &amp; you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin &amp; find this to be the right strength of cleanser; not drying but gets rid of the oil &amp; gunk from the day.  Also perfect for travel since they are dry, disposable &amp; compact.</li>
            <li> I put these in my glass storage containers for the bathroom as a quick face washing option.  They work well, and are extremely convenient.  All you do is wet, wash and throw it away.  Love these!</li>
            <li> I cannot find these larger sizes so I am thankful you have them!!!!! They work sooooo well!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter think these are the best facial wipes.</li>
            <li> As a frequent traveler. These have everything I need combined into one wipe. Love them</li>
            <li> I love these toweletts. They are great for removing makeup and the daily build up of dirt on the face. They are disposibile which is better than soiling my wash cloths. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Not bad, they are much better than using plain soap.</li>
            <li> These are pretty great! It&#x27;s a good makeup remover wipe and I like the little blue beads on the wipe help to remove the makeup build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. No need to spend a fortune on facial cleansers...even removes waterproof mascara, just need to rub the soapy bubbles gently on eyes for a minute or so.  Smells wonderful, lots of lather.</li>
            <li> Love using this facial cloth.  I cut it in half as I don&#x27;t use much make up so don&#x27;t need the whole thing.  Feels it gets my face clean.</li>
            <li> This may have been my own mistake, but I thought these were the pre-moistened cloths. They are not. They do need water to activate for cleaning. Once I got used to it though, this works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work nicely for a daily cleaning cloth.</li>
            <li> Provide a great clean.  Easy to travel with.  Great for me and my young sons to easily use and store.  Like that they won&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be the makeup removing wipes but alas I should have read more carefully!  These are still good for traveling as you can just pack a few instead of lugging around a bottle of face wash.</li>
            <li> Work really well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They clean great, they are dry so I can keep them in my suitcase and not have to worry about them going bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and this is not the best item for rough faces.&lt;br /&gt;I would only use this after shaving and have a 100% smooth baby face.&lt;br /&gt;The cloth pieces get snared in your hairs.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It does the job of exfoliating and clean. I don&#x27;t wear make up, so this review just for regular cleansing.</li>
            <li> Dried out too fast in package and price was better with Kirkland.</li>
            <li> My face feels so nice and clean when I use these, and I love that I can actually see the dirt on the cloth! That lets me know that it is indeed doing its job. I use this mainly to help remove makeup because most regular cleansers just can&#x27;t properly do that. These also soap up nicely, so you get a really great lather - something I love. They have a clean scent and just give you an all around clean, fresh face. No complaints from me!</li>
            <li> My two teenage daughters use these daily.  Both are very active with sports and struggle with some &amp;#34;teen acne&amp;#34; issues.  These are so convenient to carry a few in their gym bags.  Run them under water and wipe all that sweaty nastyness right off their face.  I would not say that these alone have completely cleared their skin, but they definitely make a huge improvement!  Because they are so convenient, my girls actually use them.....that is a plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I used to buy it at Target and Walmart but it&#x27;s cheaper if you subscribe and save with Amazon.  Plus it&#x27;s delivered to you for free so you save on gas and time as well.  It works great as a mild face exfoliator.  Because it&#x27;s a cloth, my face feels extra clean after using it.  It does a great job with removing makeup as well.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for using in the shower, they do a great job of removing dry flaky skin.  They leave my skin feeling soft and clean, not tight.  I have super sensitive skin and I have never had a problem with them.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. I have very sensitive skin, eczema and all, and they have never irritated my skin. My skin is always soft, I have no issues with acne, and as a bonus, I use my used wipe to clean off the counter top after I am done putting my makeup on. I am almost 50 and I am constantly being told that I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s or 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a 33-wipe pack from Amazon.  My wife is very pleased as she showed me how much make-up the wipes takes off even AFTER she cleans her face.  The wipes comes with its own moisturizers and it is the last thing she does before she retires for the night.  This 66-count should last for a while and I might do the Amazon Subscribe and Save program to keep these delivered periodically.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be super amazing but their more like pretty good. I do like them for my face but it does burn my eye area. Overall however, I love how you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out since you wet them as needed. For the price I&#x27;d only buy them on sale though.</li>
            <li> I ordered these cloths as part of the subscribe and save feature because I was looking for a new way to clean my face.  Previously I was using eye makeup remover and face wash, I was looking for a more all-in-one method.  Unfortunately, this was not it.  They cleaned my face well enough, but eyemakeup was often left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something just for your face, these will do - If not, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> The olay 4-in-1 combination, really helps me in the mornings with i use both sides of the cloth to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cloths for many years and they keep my skin even-toned and breakout free.  When I run out or forget to use them my skin begins to misbehave.  I know taught my teenage son to use these and they work on his skin too.  I can tell by just looking at his face whether he used them or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since high school (I&#x27;m 33 now), and they&#x27;re the only thing that helps with break-outs without burning or eating away at my face. My only complaint is a quality control issue I think - some packages are soapier than others (a good thing) and some cloths are more abrasive than others.</li>
            <li> ive used theses for about the past  fifteen years and I love them. they help remove my make up and clean my face very well. I use them every day. my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean if I go a day without them. a really great product and I always get compliments that at 61 my face has no wrinkles and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> I just prefer cleansing my face with these rather than using facewash and my hands. I still show makeup residue on my cotton ball when I follow with toner but I had that no matter what facewash I used and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT! I guess I wear a lot of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are easy and they lather very nicely. Way back I tried cutting them in half as some suggested and that was just too small for me. Using the full size allows me to remove as much makeup as possible. I don&#x27;t know how I feel about the Combination/Oily kind in particular-- I have the oiliest skin ever and nothing makes a difference. But I like the two different sides. I actually use the exfoliating side first and then turn over to the regular side. I just bought the Sensitive kind and will see if there&#x27;s a difference there.</li>
            <li> These are the best face clothes out there.  I use one every night and I love how easy they are to travel with too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for these. They were too sudsy for me and I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Many other people love them though, so try it if you think you might like them. These are dry wipes that you wet with water. They get very sudsy and do cleanse your face well. However, I do not like getting water/soap in my eyes so it was not effective at removing eye makeup for me. I prefer the pre-moistened wipes that aren&#x27;t sudsy.</li>
            <li> Been using these for awhile now and this was a great price.  Now I won&#x27;t run out before I go to the store again.</li>
            <li> These do the job, but they are a thin fibrous material with small blue dots on them.  I didn&#x27;t realize they were a different cloth from the regular ones, which are like a gauze material and I love those.  I&#x27;m using them up and I am sure they work great, but wouldn&#x27;t get them again - just don&#x27;t like the consistency.</li>
            <li> Rougher texture on one side - smoother on the other.  Provides deep cleansing using the rougher texture, and gentle cleaning around the eyes with the smoother texture.  Foams up well.  These are dry cloths which lather well when water is applied.  My skin feels so smooth after use.  Removes make up fast and efficiently.  Highly recommend these and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> this product is a favorite of mine. i use them twice daily and they really wash off the oil from waking up and from the long day. otherwise my skin would get pimples.</li>
            <li> My face is combination but gets oily quite easily in the T-zone area. I&#x27;ve tried both the cleansing cloths for normal and combination/oily and the combo/oily really is the one for me. I use this in combination with the [[ASIN:B001F51T3Q Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid]] and my face doesn&#x27;t get as oily. I&#x27;ve been using the cleansing cloths for almost three months now and even after a month, I noticed a difference in skin texture. Now, my face is smoother, my pores aren&#x27;t as large and my skin looks somewhat better (I still have blemishes here and there but they have gotten a bit lighter and I know that takes time to go away so I&#x27;m not expecting instant results here). Previously, I was using a yogurt cream-based cleanser but I like how these cloths cleanse and exfoliate at the same time. No more need for a separate exfoliating mask!</li>
            <li> These are so much more than I expected, and so affordable. They are so much more simple to use than smaller cleaning pads or a washcloth with soap. They take off my makeup quickly and allow me to scrub my pores with ease. Because they come in a plain box, 2 sets together, they are very affordable. Make sure you have a small box or a baggie to store them in though because they just come in a plastic baggie inside a box that is not the best for storing them - to keep them dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night I use these to remove eye makeup, foundation, dirt, etc. and I plan to keep buying these as long as they are sold here.</li>
            <li> Made me break out ALOT.  I kept forgetting to turn off auto-order so I ended up with like 8 years&#x27; worth of these things.  I couldn&#x27;t give them away because people were having the same problems so they ended up in the garbage.</li>
            <li> removes makeup really well, tho really stubborn waterproof mascara will reguire additional remover.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my evening routine more stream lined</li>
            <li> This item was as advertised. It was a better price than in my local stores. Works well for our family.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite facial cloths and I have tried them all.  They take off all my makeup, even the waterproof eye makeup.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my face began to become oilier - very ironic since I had perfect skin throughout my teen years and my twenties. :-) Regardless, along with the oil came mild but persistent acne. I began using these cloths every day: twice a day at first and then just once a day as my skin began to improve. I incorporated a daily Olay moisturizer and voila!! - My skin looks and feels great! Whenever I see some oil starting to build up again, I resume the twice-daily usage until I see improvements. For the most part - using these cloths daily has helped my skin tremendously - much better than all the face washes I tried. And believe me I tried them ALL before I resorted to the cloths. :-) The cloths really seem to exfoliate and deep cleanse, which apparently is what I needed. I recommend these cloths to anyone who may find him or herself in the same situation as me – needing a new skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this many time from the stores.  I just felt lazy to go pick one up and ordered them online.  These are effective and gentle on sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t complete my face morning and evening face cleaning routine without them.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of these cloths.  I use one every night to remove my makeup &amp; clean my skin.  They are dry cloths (which I MUCH prefer to the wet ones), &amp; they have little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on them for exfoliating purposes.  Some of the other Olay daily facials have small holes throughout, but these do not.  The cloth is solid.    I do NOT use these to remove my eye makeup.  I have very sensitive eyes, &amp; the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found to remove my eye makeup that doesn&#x27;t irritate is Clinique Take Off the Day Makeup Remover.  It&#x27;s made for lips &amp; eyes only.    These cloths are absolutely wonderful for travel.  Pack a few in a plastic baggie, &amp; you&#x27;re set!    They recently changed the packaging look &amp; name of these cloths slightly, &amp; at first I thought Olay quit making the cloths I love &amp; have used for years.  I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I did not read product description correctly but you need to wet these in order to use them. So if I am already standing in front of the sink who needs them?</li>
            <li> This product works great. I am a little upset because it is not exactly what I wanted, I thought they were already moist wipes with no rinse off but that was my own fault for not reading the description entirely.&lt;br /&gt;Still used them, they work great, smell nice, I cut mine in half because it seems like a waste not to because the sheets are so big.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this product. It is still as good as the first day I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Love these to take makeup off,  Makes it easier to travel without having to carry along liquid</li>
            <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 13 years and I absolute love them. They do a great job of removing makeup and make my face feel so clean! I have tried the ones that do not require water and I just don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling. I hope these are still around for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.  They&#x27;re perfect for removing makeup and exfoliating my skin in the shower.</li>
            <li> lathers nicely. I do cut each sheet in half as it seems to be too much lather/cleaning potential from 1 sheet. Also I feel each individual sheet is too big. Lastly, cleans face great, but doesn&#x27;t do so well at removing mascara or stay-put eyeliner. [[ASIN:B00367NWGI Yes To Cucumbers Facial Towelettes, Natural Glow, 30 ct.]] is better at removing make up.</li>
            <li> I get this on my subscribe and save account and pay half the price than if bought separately at the store. Love the clothes and have used them for years. I have sensitve skin and the clothes leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Give you a thorough and great clean. Cleans thoroughly and leave you felling refreshed and clean and take off  those blackheads</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for about a year now. theyre super easy to use, especially for travel. i just pack a couple cloths with my other toiletries and am good to go for a few days. ive tried the normal skin version of this, but like this one better because:&lt;br /&gt;a) my skin is more combination/oily than normal&lt;br /&gt;b) the exfoliating surface is more robust and you feel cleaner after youre done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, recommend a hundred times over!</li>
            <li> always a good quality product</li>
            <li> This item is really great for travel since it stays dry until you wet it and also works well to keep on hand for quick makeup changes for going out after work, etc.  This is not a drying formula and works well to cleanse without harming the skin.</li>
            <li> fabulous product and much less than stores! I definitely will be ordering from this vendor again. Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get these.  I thought they would be a convenient way to wash my face, but they aren&#x27;t any more convenient than using regular face wash (and yes, I am so lazy that I sometimes find washing my face with face wash to be inconvenient).  You have to soak the little papers to get them soapy, rub them to get them foamy, wash your face, and then rinse your face.  This seems to take away no steps from a normal face wash routine.  These supposedly had a side that was for exfoliation, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any marked difference between the two sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Olay products and as usual this one did not disappoint. They clean quite well and leave my face feeling very smooth. Olay is one of the very few products that no matter what I try from their line thus far does not react badly with my extremely over sensitive skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in the stores any more. I cut them in half to make them last longer. Great.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter and she really likes them! Easy to use, smells great, and quick! What more could a teen ask for!</li>
            <li> These are just alright cleansing cloths. You wet them, wash your face, rinse your face and throw the wipe away. It does have to have water added, so they are not wet wipes. I say they are alright because they clean ok, not great. I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again because I have found other, more convenient, wipes that I like better. Just my personal preference!</li>
            <li> This is great for traveling when you can&#x27;t put a lot of liquid in your carry-on.  This does an excellent job of cleaning the makeup and debris off my face, and it&#x27;s compact enough to fit into any ole space in my carry-on.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  What I always use and these are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used the Olay &#x27;normal&#x27; facial cloths for years and tried the combination/oily last month. I don&#x27;t like them! The cloth is too scratchy, it feels a bit like rubbing sandpaper on my face. Plus, I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of these, much too strong. I have re-ordered the &#x27;normal&#x27; Olay facial cloths which I love. They are soft, and mildly fragrant, they are perfect!</li>
            <li> it does what it suppose to do, clean your face. depends how your skin is, it works great for both my husband and I</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and they are just the best.  Takes off make up, but most importantly you can feel your pores getting clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased these daily facial cloths expecting to receive 2 plastic containers filled with 33 cloths each.  Instead I received 66 individually packaged cleansing cloths.  I debated returning them, but found that the individual packages work great for traveling...so I have kept them!&lt;br /&gt;These wipes take off my eye makeup very easily, and are gentle on my skin.  I have combination/oily skin and I tend to break out, but these wipes do not irritate my skin and it feels refreshing afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love this washing pads and use them daily. They are convenient and affordable.</li>
            <li> Use these on a daily basis.  I switch between Normal or Combination depending on the season and the weather.  I live in Chicago and the weather and environment can play havoc with my skin.  I love the way these cloths are so sturdy and do not fall  apart if I have to scrub makeup off.  I have been using these for years!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for over 2 years and can only say good things about it. Im a guy, but I use this because its way more convenient than having a tube full of something. I just pull one cloth out everyday. I used it everyday to clean my face of all that acne causing stuff. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and very clear. Remember to moisturize after using this. Ive also used the \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; skin version and it works very well as well. This one in comparison has more of an exfoliating texture to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Daily Facial Cloths for a little over a year now and I will never use anything else to wash my face. These cloths are so easy and convenient to use. They are not pre-moistened; they are dry and you wet them to wash your face. I love this because if I&#x27;m going somewhere I can just pop a few in my bag and not worry about them drying out or making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also exfoliate gently. The side with blue dots washes more gently than the side without dots which really exfoliates your skin. They suds up really well, I&#x27;ve never felt like the cloths were going to run out of cleanser so you can scrub for quite a while- great for makeup! Since using these my skin is feeling smooth and clean, never dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I bring it with me for travel. Since it is huge, I cut each piece into two using a pair of scissors. They are fibrous so it is hard to evenly tear it by hand. It smells pleasant and made my skin feel soft, does not dry out my skin. Both sides felt almost equal. It is hard to tell which is the &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li> These are the only facial cleansing cloths I have found that truly get your make-up off without causing your eyes to burn in the process.  I love that they have a smooth side which I use for my eyes and then a more textured side that I use on the rest of my face where I scrub a little harder.  There is no scent to these cloths either which is important to me and there is nothing in them that irritates my skin.  My skin is not really combination, it&#x27;s dry but these work best for me because they have the double sided fabric to work with.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using them either so I think they work well even for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  I have not used wash clothes in years because after one use they tend to irritate my skin.  I cannot use the pre-moistened ones because they just push the dirt into my skin and grind the makeup into my pores.  These are the best ones that foam up with warm water and help keep my skin clean and clear.  These are the only ones that I have used for year, so glad they come in bulk online.</li>
            <li> I never liked the idea of using a washcloth more than once without sanitizing it.  I really like these and they are durable enough that I can use one each day as a new and disposable washcloth.  I use it brand new on my face because the wash is impregnated with soap.  Once the soap in the cloth is used up, I just use more soap or body wash like one would with a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> Have been using these Olay facial pads for years. Really cleans off the makeup and is gentle on my face. I highly recommend these over soap bars.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife, at her request.  Her began using these years ago, when they were available at Costco.  Recently Costco replaced the Olay brand of cloths with a Kirkland brand, which my wife used and didn&#x27;t like at all. Women Huh?</li>
            <li> I am used to premoistened clothes. But, I got these on a sale and gave them a try. I have a normal to slightly oily face and these left me feeling a little dry. The good news is that they are really big and you can get twice the value by cutting them in half. These are great for when you don&#x27;t actually want to take the time to use actual facial products and save yourself some time.</li>
            <li> My own fault, i expected these to be the moist cloths, they are the ones that you need to add water to though</li>
            <li> The price is incredible you will find them in other stores for $12-to $14. I paid $7.50 great savings. I loved the fact that you have a soft side for your eyes and a side for the rest of your face</li>
            <li> It is better than what I expected. I like to use the cloths to remove makeup. The price is somewhat satisified.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these locally for awhile, I was glad when I found them here on Amazon. This is my favourite facial cleanser, perfect for regular days, and great for days/nights you wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived on time, but the packaging was a little...excessive. I was happy to get my item in great condition without it being squished or torn, but the box it arrived in could have held 2 or 3 of this product! Even my mother commented that such a small item didn&#x27;t need THAT much safety padding. My inner hippie wept for the earth, and the rest of me just wept for joy that I found these cloths for such a good price.</li>
            <li> As another user mentioned, when they first came out with these several years ago, the cloths actually scrubbed &amp; exfoliated your skin a bit &amp; I loved it. Then I got the new ones (from Costco!) and I still have not finished using them. They sit in a ziplock bag in my bathroom for whenever I travel since that&#x27;s the only time I use them now. It&#x27;s just more convenient for me to use regular face wash for daily use than to lather this cloth up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another user mentioned as well, I also cut these cloths up in half because they are far too big. So you can actually use a 66count pack 132 times &amp; can save money this way.</li>
            <li> I use these nightly to remove my makeup and just get a little cleaner. These cloths are not like moist baby-wipes that are ready to use out of the package. These wipes come dry, and you just need a little hot water to make them a little foamy. They have tiny micro-beads on them to do a little scrubbing, but they aren&#x27;t harsh. They get rid of my makeup just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought these on sale a couple weeks ago. Im not much for all these cleansing products but tried these and they are awesome, Makes my face feel so clean and soft. I definitely recommend it if you don&#x27;t have a clean face, or want a fresh face when ever.</li>
            <li> Love the 4 in 1 cloths.  They have one soft side and one rougher side.  Makes my face feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> Does not work as informed. The tissues were all dried. Threw them away. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face well, gets all the oil off and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. What more could I ask from this?</li>
            <li> This product is dry but I always carry water or can find water at a rest stop.  At home when not feeling well they are a great way to get cleaned up. Everyone feels better even when sick if they can find a convenient easy way when there is no one to help.</li>
            <li> Better than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; daily facial cloths. Cleans very well, I don&#x27;t wear heavy foundation or make up by the way.</li>
            <li> These are the original Oil of Olay facial wipes, with the slightly rough side that is good for exfoliating. I just hope I can keep finding them!</li>
            <li> These combination/oily daily facials leave my skin feeling clean when nothing else does. I&#x27;ve used them for years and have tried other products when I&#x27;ve run out of Olay. It always takes weeks for my skin to recover! I&#x27;m 39 and still waiting for that post-adolescent skin to kick in! But until then I&#x27;ll keep using these religiously. :-)</li>
            <li> I prefer these cloths versus the wipes.  I prefer the soapy kind.  This is a great price and they came quickly.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three years so it was easy for me to sign on to get it regularly!  I just really like how my skin feels after using it. I will continue for a long time.......or until Olay makes something better (can you imagine!!)</li>
            <li> I originally bought these to take on a  cruise with me. I didnt want to carry my usual face wash with me and these seems very convenient. Well, the trip was cancelled so I used these on a whim one night after a party. To my surprise, these worked great at taking off my makeup.  They suds up really well and and get my face really clean. After I rinse the suds out, I place a little eye makeup remover on it to get all my eye make up off. I may order another box after these are all gone, but I do really like them.</li>
            <li> They work great! I&#x27;ve used them for years. It&#x27;s the only thing that gets rid of my adult acne.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing way to cleanse your face.  The pad lathers well after applied with water and makes the face streak like clean.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used for last 10 years.  Reduces exposure to bacteria from reusing a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good deal.  You only need to use half of a cloth to get your whole face clean, so it&#x27;s a double value!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using soap on my face, and these are handy to have. I cut them into halves. Full size is too much cleanser for one job, so it&#x27;s perfect and economical when they are on sale!</li>
            <li> Using these makes my face feel very smooth. They do a very good job of removing oil, dirt and make-up. The only complaint I have is the type of container they come in. I wish they came in a plastic box that was bathroom friendly.</li>
            <li> the clothes are ok, when they are gone i wont order them again.there&#x27;s something about them that dries my skin more than i like.</li>
            <li> Seems to be okay, but the package I received was a non-retail box with individually packaged wiped marked as &amp;#34;SAMPLE NOT FOR SALE&amp;#34;. No idea how old these are, if they were stored well, etc. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money and purchase direct from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I used to love these, but they seem to have changed the cloths that they use recently. The new ones aren&#x27;t as &#x27;scrubby.&#x27; I tend to have dry patches on otherwise oily skin, and these used to slough them off quite nicely, but now they don&#x27;t do much more than the average face wash. I had been using these for years and will now have to find a new product. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love these cloths and have for a long time. Amazing deal here because for 4 boxes of 33, they are $17 at Sam&#x27;s Club. Although most have commented on how big they are, I think they&#x27;re perfect. I use them in the shower and possibly unlike most, it&#x27;s perfect for my face, behind my ears and neck. The back of them (without the blue dots) have a little scrub to them. I&#x27;ll always use these.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these! She uses them every night to wash off her makeup. Even using these everyday 1 pad will easily work but I would watch though...she loves them so much I am going to have to continue buying more of these because she doesn&#x27;t like anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in the stores anymore.  I don&#x27;t know if they are discontinued.  They are great for taking your makeup off.</li>
            <li> I buy this product all the time.  I carry them with me on trips and keep some&lt;br /&gt;in my car.  My grand daughter (age 12)  has started to use them also, she&lt;br /&gt;says it helps keep her acne in control.</li>
