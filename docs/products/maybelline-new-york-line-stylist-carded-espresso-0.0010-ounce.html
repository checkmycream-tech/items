            <li> &lt;br /&gt;IT HIGHLY.  </li>
            <li> * Maybelline New York Line Stylist works well to define brows  </li>
            <li> it is the only one I have found thin enough to make your eye brows look real and not painted on</li>
            <li> Not really...</li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t find anything I like quite as much as this one for that dark, thin line.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Line Stylist is the only pencil I&#x27;ve found that yields a thin line that stays for several hours.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge &amp; the dark brown color is flattering for anyone</li>
            <li> Not quite like Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Brow Eyebrow Pencil that was discontinued in dark brown.  </li>
            <li> bought a few other colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> However it is very dark if you use the pencil to fill them in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously going to hide in a potato sack for the rest of my life when I run out of this pencil.</li>
            <li> , this is going to be hard when I run out!</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND IN STORES.  </li>
            <li> Revlon has all day wear products too (but no non-sharpening pencil-like crayon this thin).</li>
            <li> I am still mad at maybelline for discontinuing this overpriced product with no suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> So sad that it was discontinued. :(  </li>

            <li> * Maybelline New York Line Stylist works well to define brows  * Great for everyday use, like to keep one in my purse, have the bronze gleam  * I like it much better than Maybelline New York Define a Brow  * Still recommend trying the Benefit Brow liner set</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye liner.  So sad that it was discontinued. :(  Still can&#x27;t find anything I like quite as much as this one for that dark, thin line.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I have ever had! Nice color, stays all day long! I wish they could have those at the stores</li>
            <li> i love it! i wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued. I cant find anything else like it, I dont know what I&#x60;m going to do without it.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used - not sure why Maybelline has taken it out of the retail stores.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PENCIL.  WOULD RECOMEND&lt;br /&gt;IT HIGHLY.  IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND IN STORES.  HAVING IT DELIVERED IS A BIG PLUS.&lt;br /&gt;THISP PENCIL HAS A VERY FINE POINT AND IT STAYS&lt;br /&gt;THAT WAY THROUGHOUT USE, SO IT MAKES EASY TO&lt;br /&gt;DO VERY FINE LINES..</li>

            <li> This is the best eye liner I have found.It goes on easily,neatly and doen&#x27;t smudge. This eyeliner really is water proof. Love,love it!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner out there !!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Precision make up application at its finest. I am still mad at maybelline for discontinuing this overpriced product with no suitable replacement. But who cares about brand loyalty anymore. Revlon has all day wear products too (but no non-sharpening pencil-like crayon this thin). If you love this product like I do...continue to buy here until its gone for good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously going to hide in a potato sack for the rest of my life when I run out of this pencil. Not really... But it&#x27;s a very good pencil! I&#x27;ve been using it my whole life, this is going to be hard when I run out! This seller was on time, and the product was in tact. If anyone finds anything similar to this pen please let me know!!</li>
            <li> They make the perfect line without to much eyeliner.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Not quite like Maybelline&#x27;s Define-A-Brow Eyebrow Pencil that was discontinued in dark brown.  This Espresso color is much darker and oily...it smudges and isn&#x27;t ideal for eyebrows but works ok as an eye liner but expect it to smudge.</li>
            <li> nice color. good price. free shipping. easy to use. would really recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few other colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;thanks maybelline!</li>
            <li> Having looked everywhere for these eyeliners, I was told they were being discontinued.  I was very glad to finally find them online!</li>
            <li> This product has always been one of my favorites since it came out, I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it. The only problem is that it&#x27;s overpriced!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since Define-A-Brow was discontinued and it&#x27;s a great dupe. However it is very dark if you use the pencil to fill them in. I shape my eyebrows with this and fill them in with MAC Expresso using my MAC 266 brush.</li>
            <li> I use this product to put finishing touching on my brows since define a brow in dark brown was discontinued. It works great on brows and as a line but expect to buy two a month because it wears away fast. The last one I offered crumbled alot but I have yet to find a cheaper substitute for the Mac spiked pencil or define a brow. Definitly worth giving a chance.</li>
