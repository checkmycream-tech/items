            <li>and it just feels so good.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite \\&quot;fun\\&quot; - in that it&#x27;s a citrusy smell that activates some pleasant, awakening receptors in the brain (but very lightly).  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing.  </li>

            <li>Made my hair healthy and more manageable!</li>
            <li>The price is awesome too compared to salon professional hair care products.</li>
            <li>(This is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried..</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of Pantene Pro-V (pretty good) and Herbal Essences (I mainly liked the \\&quot;Hello</li>
            <li>It smelled so nice and made my hair really easy to style.</li>
            <li>If it does to your hair what it does to mine - you&#x27;ll have silky smooth, healthy hair!</li>
            <li>Always feels clean, and leaves my hair very smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>Ok product.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but worked ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most of the drugstore brands, but this is definitely not TIGI&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s just an awesome product !!!</li>
            <li>Ok, well, that&#x27;s what I have found helps keep my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely  love the smell of it</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for????</li>
            <li>and they love it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair on the days that I use this with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Smells great and cleans hair very well.</li>
            <li>I found myself using more, more, more to get the lather I enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo for my oily but dry hair.</li>
            <li>In particular, I LOVE their Self-Absorbed Shampoo which has a wonderful fruity fragrance and actually does a great job of cleaning my hair while leaving it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it, and its fine.</li>
            <li>Just fine.  </li>
            <li>I love TIGI products and the Self Absorbed Mega Nutrient Shampoo is no exception.</li>
            <li>So convenient to purchase online and such a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It smells soooo good and makes your hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, very inexpensive product (when you buy from Amazon of course) and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the pump attachment, but the shampoo itself is very nice.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a shampoo that will give me the kind of hair you see on commercials; shiny, thick, beautiful.</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling clean at ALL.)    </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love the large pump bottle.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how shiny and soft</li>
            <li>and I also told my mom about it (also blonde with fairly damaged hair)</li>
            <li>- I really enjoy Bed Head&#x27;s Self Absorbed (I did NOT like Control Freak over this).  </li>
            <li>Good thing that this was the only thing in the order.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair color lasted well with this (mild?)</li>
            <li>My husband said my hair hasn&#x27;t looked that good in a long time...</li>
            <li>I have chemically treated hair (platinum blonde) and my hair has never been this healthy!</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell, oh the smell!  </li>
            <li>Kind of a cross between melon and grapefruit.     </li>
            <li>Head Self Absorbed Mega Nutrient shampoo and</li>
            <li>Well worth it for how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The price was right too.     </li>
            <li>It cleans and keeps my hair very soft and easy to care for.</li>
            <li>Second, the shampoo rinses very clean - literally squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it left my hair feeling soft and light unlike supermarket products.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get 3 times more shampoo and conditioner for the same exact price!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love all Bed Head products and was excited to see it offered on Amazon and available at such a competitive price.</li>
            <li>and it really did wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li>just very citrusy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and light, with no residue.  </li>
            <li>With the thought that the shampoo would be beneficial to healthy hair, two containers were purchased but the tingling&lt;br /&gt;sensation was not present.</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels so much stronger already!</li>
            <li>I have extremely long hair, and this product seems to really be great for my long lengths.</li>
            <li>Because I have blond highlights, I pair this shampoo with their equally great Dumb Blonde conditioner and love the results.</li>
            <li>My hair can pretty much handle any ol shampoo</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair really soft, I&#x27;ve tried every kind of expensives Shampoos ( Nexus, Matrix, Redken, Sebastian...) and not a single one of those has left my hair so soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>and I know that - the people sending it not so much - will never buy from them again</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t really improved much.</li>
            <li>Just wished i would have found it on here because its much cheaper.</li>
            <li>(so much so that he&#x27;s using the products now, too.)  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this shampoo for anyone - regardless of having dyed/treated hair or not.</li>
            <li>I REALLY hope BH never replaces or d</li>
            <li>I have my hair highlighted regularly, and this shampoo keeps it soft, silky, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It was a lot cheaper than some of the other TIGI products I love (Oatmeal Honey &amp; Curls Rock) but still said it was a \\&quot;Mega Vitamin Conditioner.\\</li>
            <li>Now, after using Bed Head, her hair is silky shiny again and clean as a whistle like it was when she was much younger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo quite often and was so pleased to find it on Amazon at such a low price!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my kids (normal hair).  </li>
            <li>and i smell like a bowl full of fruit all day long!</li>
            <li>The trick is to keep it in your hair for no more than 3-5 mins, try it and you&#x27;ll see why this is better</li>
            <li>I first purchased this shampoo last year.  </li>
            <li>the only thing was when I looked at my hair in the mirror it looked pretty dull...sprayed some shine spray on it and problem fixed!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and colored; this makes it so soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I even use it in my 3 year old daughters ringlet curly hair</li>
            <li>It makes your hair instanly soft and it lathers well.</li>
            <li>This had me worried, but I decided not to judge too early and followed with the Selfabsorbed conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Within a very short period of time I noticed my hair really responded to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that its viscosity is just right so that it sits firm in your palm when you pump it out, but it&#x27;s loose enough to work easily into your hair (for men..</li>
            <li>I am used to more lather with only a third less from costlier shampoos.</li>
            <li>I had not used this shampoo prior to purchase, but it was highly recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a hair mask of peppermint that leaves your hair extra soft</li>
            <li>After trying everything under the sun for my 11 year old daughter, we finally tried Bed</li>
            <li>and I would say it&#x27;s Normal to Dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>I have had a lot less fly-aways and split ends since I started using this right after my last hair cut.</li>
            <li>This absolutely works for her and with Amazon prime and subscribe &amp; save discounts it costs about the same as other name brand department store shampoos!!</li>

            <li> I have ordered many things from Amazon itself, not an outside vendor, and have never had it arrive in bad shape but this product had leaked, was a sticky mess, and had a piece of reinforced packing tape around the cap which means that whoever packed it in the Amazon warehouse knew it was leaking before they packed it! I am very disappointed because I have always had such good experiences purchasing from Amazon. I bought this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas but it&#x27;s too sticky and obvious that some is missing that I will have to just throw it away. I should have bought it in a drug store. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo quite often and was so pleased to find it on Amazon at such a low price!  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the pump attachment, but the shampoo itself is very nice.</li>
            <li> II ordered this product which is great - this time I ordered for a friend who lives in Europe - I kept the bottles wrapped after I saw the bottles were orange - after I carried them to Italy in my luggage about 3 weeks later - we opened them to find they had sent the conditioner and not the shampoo - very disappointing - the product is wonderful and I know that - the people sending it not so much - will never buy from them again</li>
            <li> Ok product.  Not my favorite, but worked ok.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so damn GOOD, you just love it. It leaves your hair really soft, I&#x27;ve tried every kind of expensives Shampoos ( Nexus, Matrix, Redken, Sebastian...) and not a single one of those has left my hair so soft and easy to detangle. I highly recommend it and you guys should also try Treat me right it&#x27;s a hair mask of peppermint that leaves your hair extra soft and it just feels so good. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Conditioner because my hair was drying out in the winter from running. It was a lot cheaper than some of the other TIGI products I love (Oatmeal Honey &amp; Curls Rock) but still said it was a \\&quot;Mega Vitamin Conditioner.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m still using it, and its fine. Just fine.  My hair hasn&#x27;t really improved much. I have fairly thin curly hair and I would say it&#x27;s Normal to Dry during the winter. It&#x27;s better than most of the drugstore brands, but this is definitely not TIGI&#x27;s best. If you have oily hair or need something lighter for the summer, this might be the shampoo for you. I don&#x27;t plan to buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I have chemically treated hair (platinum blonde) and my hair has never been this healthy! Although I did not buy from this seller, I bought my shampoo and conditioner set at costco I would recommend it to everyone. The smell is amazing and it left my hair feeling soft and light unlike supermarket products. I used to use dove moisture shampoo and conditioner but my hair always felt heavy and had a nasty residue that I could literally scratch off no matter how long I rinsed my hair for. This bed head product did wonders for me and I also told my mom about it (also blonde with fairly damaged hair) and she has had great results with it. I even use it in my 3 year old daughters ringlet curly hair and it&#x27;s amazing how shiny and soft her hair is now, she&#x27;s prone to getting knots but not with these little miracles. The price is awesome too compared to salon professional hair care products. Overall it&#x27;s just an awesome product !!!</li>
            <li> I love the large pump bottle. I see some don&#x27;t...but for me, it is the best thing since sliced bread. Great for the shower. The price was right too.     Also, my hair color lasted well with this (mild?) shampoo. Scent is fruity and yummy. Kind of a cross between melon and grapefruit.     My only fault with this shampoo is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of lather with it. I found myself using more, more, more to get the lather I enjoy. Three squirts. I am used to more lather with only a third less from costlier shampoos. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Pantene Pro-V (pretty good) and Herbal Essences (I mainly liked the \\&quot;Hello Hydration\\&quot; formula) in the past, but I would take Bed Head&#x27;s Self-Absorbed shampoo over those any day.  The smell is quite \\&quot;fun\\&quot; - in that it&#x27;s a citrusy smell that activates some pleasant, awakening receptors in the brain (but very lightly).  I like the fact that its viscosity is just right so that it sits firm in your palm when you pump it out, but it&#x27;s loose enough to work easily into your hair (for men.. I have no idea how to gauge this for women with long hair..).  The trick is to keep it in your hair for no more than 3-5 mins, try it and you&#x27;ll see why this is better (I can&#x27;t find the words to explain it).  Basically, it does it&#x27;s job of cleaning and revitalizing (my hair definitely feels moisturized and healthier) in that time, so rinse it out.    On days that I go swimming, I use conditioner after shampooing with Bed Head - Nexxus&#x27; Humectin, Extreme Moisture Conditioner (This is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.. definitely give it a shot if you can find it.  I get it where I get my hair cut.  But do NOT get Nexxus&#x27; Theratin Extreme Moisture shampoo - it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling clean at ALL.)    Ok, well, that&#x27;s what I have found helps keep my hair healthy.  Hope it helps.    Bottom line - I really enjoy Bed Head&#x27;s Self Absorbed (I did NOT like Control Freak over this).  I fully recommend you all to try it!  If it does to your hair what it does to mine - you&#x27;ll have silky smooth, healthy hair!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love all Bed Head products and was excited to see it offered on Amazon and available at such a competitive price. My only con is the pumping delivery sometimes gets stuck and doesn&#x27;t seem to pump enough shampoo out. Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> I currently bought this at Walmart because I was looking for a extremely fruity shampoo and conditioner. This is it!! I absolutely  love the smell of it and it really did wonders for my hair! My husband said my hair hasn&#x27;t looked that good in a long time...he even uses it because of the smell! I pair it with coconut water chill body wash and i smell like a bowl full of fruit all day long! It smells like oranges? mangoes? just very citrusy! Made my hair healthy and more manageable! Just wished i would have found it on here because its much cheaper. I love all Bedhead products!!</li>
            <li> I received my shampoo on time, however, when I opened the package, half the bottle was completely drained and dripping out of the box.  It only had two pieces of bubble wrap, that clearly were not enough to make sure the bottle didn&#x27;t leak.....very disappointed.  I will not purchase this on-line again!!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this because my mom had a bottle when I visited. It smelled so nice and made my hair really easy to style. But after using it for a couple weeks my hair just feels greasy all the time. This is really weird because I have very dry hair. It&#x27;s not for me. So, the quest goes on.</li>
            <li> After trying everything under the sun for my 11 year old daughter, we finally tried Bed Head Self Absorbed Mega Nutrient shampoo and what a difference it makes!!! The other stuff would never really get her hair clean, it always looked and felt a little grimy and dull. Now, after using Bed Head, her hair is silky shiny again and clean as a whistle like it was when she was much younger. My hair can pretty much handle any ol shampoo but my daughter is another story... This absolutely works for her and with Amazon prime and subscribe &amp; save discounts it costs about the same as other name brand department store shampoos!!</li>
            <li> It smells soooo good and makes your hair sooooo soft. What more could you ask for???? I have had a lot less fly-aways and split ends since I started using this right after my last hair cut. It makes your hair instanly soft and it lathers well.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a shampoo that will give me the kind of hair you see on commercials; shiny, thick, beautiful. Well, this one seems to do the trick for me.    Great smelling shampoo like all the Bed Head products I&#x27;ve tried.  I especially like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand of shampoo/conditioner out there - all the regular stuff in the store (Pantene, Dove, Herbal Essensces, Aussie, etc.) and the expenive salon brands (Nexxus, Matrix, Redken, Aquage, Cebu, etc). But my hair was never really happy with any one of these.  Recently, I tried It&amp;ly as recommended by my hair stylist.  When I asked him about Tigi&#x27;s shampoos, he frowned and said that those are the cheapest salon shampoos and he doesn&#x27;t even bother carrying it because it is below him (LOL).  Regardless, after trying the It&amp;ly, which is three times the price of Bedhead selfabsorbed, I decided to try Bedhead anyway.      First of all, the smell, oh the smell!  I want to put this stuff on a cracker and eat it because it smells so gooood.  Second, the shampoo rinses very clean - literally squeaky clean.  This had me worried, but I decided not to judge too early and followed with the Selfabsorbed conditioner.  My hair feels amazing.  It&#x27;s soft and light, with no residue.  And my husband loves the way my hair smells (so much so that he&#x27;s using the products now, too.)  Overall, very inexpensive product (when you buy from Amazon of course) and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bed Head products for years and they&#x27;ve never let me down.  In particular, I LOVE their Self-Absorbed Shampoo which has a wonderful fruity fragrance and actually does a great job of cleaning my hair while leaving it soft and shiny.  I have color-treated hair and this does a good job of keeping the chemically treated parts in excellent condition.  Despite constant bleaching, my hair is *not* at all dry or damaged and I believe this shampoo plays a big role in that.  Because I have blond highlights, I pair this shampoo with their equally great Dumb Blonde conditioner and love the results. I would absolutely recommend this shampoo for anyone - regardless of having dyed/treated hair or not.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for my oily but dry hair.It cleans and keeps my hair very soft and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this shampoo last year.  I had not used this shampoo prior to purchase, but it was highly recommended to me.  fore.  Within a very short period of time I noticed my hair really responded to this shampoo.  My hair is never dry, limp or dried out.  The quality I purchased  last year was 25.36 oz. and I still have some left.  Great value for the price and great product, too.  Kathie &amp;#34;K&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  had a hard time finding it in the stores so tha&#x27;ts why  started looking for it online. I think it is also a little cheaper onlne.</li>
            <li> This came in perfect, brand new condition. I love TIGI products and the Self Absorbed Mega Nutrient Shampoo is no exception. I have my hair highlighted regularly, and this shampoo keeps it soft, silky, and healthy looking. I have extremely long hair, and this product seems to really be great for my long lengths. It smells peachy and very pleasant. The price is excellent, my salon charges twice as much. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Ordered on mistake. Amazon prompt in reply to me. Still tried the product wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever.  I bought this for my kids (normal hair).  Their hair was getting so dried out by supermarket shampoos; I could not believe the difference when I switched them to this and they love it.  My hair is fine and colored; this makes it so soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair on the days that I use this with the conditioner.  I REALLY hope BH never replaces or d/c&#x27;s this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was introduced through a sample single shampoo packet. The single use packet seemed to tingle to the hair&lt;br /&gt;follicles. With the thought that the shampoo would be beneficial to healthy hair, two containers were purchased but the tingling&lt;br /&gt;sensation was not present. So the tingling was one time marketing tool to entice. duped</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, have been using it for years and there is no comparison. leaves no residue, smells awsome! other shampoos make the back of my neck break out. it hasn&#x27;t once since iv&#x27;e used this product!</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels so much stronger already! My hair had been falling off at the ends and feeling so unhealthy after too much processing...the only thing was when I looked at my hair in the mirror it looked pretty dull...sprayed some shine spray on it and problem fixed! Well worth it for how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Why not buy this product from Amazon instead of the grocery store?  You&#x27;ll get 3 times more shampoo and conditioner for the same exact price!</li>
            <li> So convenient to purchase online and such a great shampoo.  Always feels clean, and leaves my hair very smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> it is what it is, unfortunately the cap on the bottle wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight so some of it leaked. Good thing that this was the only thing in the order.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at a reasonable price. Smells great and cleans hair very well. No residue. Very happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift for my daughter-in-law and I know she loves this brand.  I also bought the conditioner for her.</li>
