            <li>/&gt;I am very impressed with this cleansing bar</li>
            <li>Once or twice weekly is ideal.  </li>
            <li>These soap bars are excellent for treating acne-prone skin, but, as the header of my review suggests, too much of a good thing....</li>
            <li>Works great all on types of skin.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for exfoliating my face.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>here?&lt;br /&gt;The product is great and lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;s not scented, so it doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>/&gt;These bars are a good size and have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Proactive products have always been a good and reliable product.  </li>
            <li>So, I was delighted to find all the the good properties of Proactiv in a cleansing bar form.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just turned 82 and this is indeed a superior cleansing bar for those in my age group.  </li>
            <li>I hear lots of good feedback on them</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job of cleaning my skin (and to have helped), and my skin feels nice after using it.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance, nice lather, refreshing tingle and brings a tightness to the face.</li>
            <li>Nice soap bars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They suds up like soap even though there&#x27;s no soap in them, and they do leave your skin feeling relatively nice.</li>
            <li>My son liked it too.  </li>
            <li>It does have a really nice fragrance, and my skin feels refreshed, because it cleans and leaves the skin feeling reinvigorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the nice things about the cleansing bar is its shape.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been kind of meh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use my mom happy too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful clarifying soap that leaves my face soft.  </li>
            <li>After not being able to use [[ASIN:B00TI6TSHI Proactiv+</li>
            <li>However, I really do see this as a great option for vegetarians and vegans out there and for that I have to give Proactiv+</li>
            <li>It sure seems pricey, but the vegan/vegetarian lifestyle can be pricey as I understand.</li>
            <li>This soap will be used more when our kids begin adolescent breakouts.</li>
            <li>have love Proactiv products since they were released over 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that you monitor the skin moisture</li>
            <li>I’m sure.  </li>
            <li>I am reviewing this for free, because I honestly would not have bought it out of pocket.  </li>
            <li>glad I</li>
            <li>These soap bars have not triggered that allergy, and though I use them only on my face,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with results.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I had the opportunity to do so.</li>
            <li>and I love the scrub I get.</li>
            <li>Either way I&#x27;m satisfied with the job it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably in your hand and have a good weight.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more affordable and being a teenager</li>
            <li>They lather up nicely and they just feel clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a good point to be aware of.</li>
            <li>The soap does not smell as good as the Noxzema, and actually has a bit too strong a scent for me when put on; but the light scent it leaves on my face is a pleasant soap scent that I like, and does not give me sinus headaches.  </li>
            <li>That’s the most important thing you are wondering about</li>
            <li>The Cleansing Body Bars have a nice fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It definitive helps to keep clean and healthy skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, good product, but the price is too high because of their marketing and spokespeople.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy that my kid is happy, but at the same time, there might be better, cheaper solutions in Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>a disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for reviewing it.</li>
            <li>I have Caucasian light skin that still can breakout at my age.  </li>
            <li>can only assume that the Proactiv+ cleansing body bar is doing a great job at cleaning my skin, without the need of the additional exfoliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Proactiv is synonymous with acne free skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent size, goes on nicely, and smells non-offensively.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel that this was effective: after two weeks, I have just as much body acne, or more, than I did before.  </li>
            <li>It works maybe slightly better but once again, a much higher price tag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smell clean and neutral</li>
            <li>but it got skin clean.  </li>
            <li>Still not bad, though.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean scent with the power of acne fighting medicine.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, pleasant and subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re effective at clearing pores, and they leave behind a pleasant, clean tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>I would much rather go with something that feels good and works, rather than something that just feels good but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well (especially at its current price).</li>
            <li>A light, fresh scent is the first thing you noticed before even taking the bar out of the box.</li>
            <li>While this bar seems to do a fine job cleaning and assuring the skin &amp;#34;sloughs&amp;#34; off I have not seen a real reduction in any of the acne.</li>
            <li>I still prefer using La Roche Posay Effaclar products for anti-acne, but these bars are worth a shot too.</li>
            <li>and I shower right after work and use two times a day.</li>
            <li>I love Proactiv in general and have used a variety of their products for years</li>
            <li>Be aware the cleansing bar is slightly abrasive, which helps remove dirt etc., but may not be pleasant if you don&#x27;t like things that are scratchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks, I noticed a remarkable improvement on the kid&#x27;s face, but what stuck out at me the most was the attitude change - no longer hidden behind acne, the kid seemed more confident and ready to take on the summer with cleaner skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent enough soap, I guess, but if I want a nice soap, I&#x27;ll go to L&#x27;Occitane.  </li>
            <li>but could be more bigger for the price!!</li>
            <li>I love the concept a total body cleansing soap from a leading company, Proactive.  </li>
            <li>;) my mom told me today I will order again can&#x27;t wait..;)</li>
            <li>Came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Overall we haven&#x27;t been totally satisfied with the reduction in acne.  </li>
            <li>And with a much higher price tag.  </li>
            <li>Can be used on the face or whole body!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The key with these bars, as well as most skin care.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I was really interested in trying this product for quite some time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it and ask my daughter to give it a try since her acne is more traditional teenage acne - perhaps it is better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than likely, though, I&#x27;ll save this very costly soap for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin, so I will watch closely to make sure this cleansing bar isn&#x27;t causing issues rather than helping to clear his skin.</li>
            <li>The bars have a slight but decent odor, and did a good job at cleaning the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Proactive, I use its Renewing cleanser for my face very often, I grabbed these bars because I wanted to try something different</li>
            <li>I usually use all natural soaps that are hand done (with ingredients I can pronounce and recognize) and have been pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li>I use bar soap pretty much exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only speak after a single use, but it has a pleasant, herbal  fragrance and rinses off well.</li>
            <li>The bars are a good size, about the same as a full size bar of soap, maybe a little bigger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These body bars have a nice scent to them and they have a little bit of grit, which seems to be for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of the early Proactiv products until I developed an allergy to them.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping to Canada.</li>
            <li>These Cleansing Body Bars really do the trick when it comes to clearing up pesky acne.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans the skin.  </li>
            <li>So it might have helped but it doesn&#x27;t seem too much like it effected the result.</li>
            <li>B00E4MNQ24 Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream 12 Oz (2 Pack)]], because of its cooling effect and terrific scent.  </li>
            <li>maybe in conjunction with the other Proactiv products, it would work better.</li>
            <li>This Proactiv bar soap is ideal for the shower (with careful instructions to keep it dry and last longer).</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>Pimples can appear in places other than the face, and the curved shape of the bar allows it to be more easily applied to other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>main drawback is the price.</li>
            <li>have mild body acne on my chest, shoulders, back, and clavicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure if I see much difference than the regular good ole soap.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price for two bars of soap is a bit high, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The bars are large, and promise to last quite a while, so I should see some real improvement with two bars.</li>
            <li>so I was eager to try out their new body bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far,  there&#x27;s no excess dryness, and I can see signs of clearing, particularly on my arms.  </li>
            <li>actually went back to the proactive sulfur mask which works fabulously</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re well past the target acne prone youths, but this definitely is a good product for aging dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The cost is worth it if it works long term.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are small microbeads or gritty things that I liked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s terrific as a face soap and of course for the price, the less you use in a shot, the better.  </li>
            <li>I can recommend this cleansing body bar as a daily treatment for large  pores and tightening of the body.</li>
            <li>This body bar is strong enough to clear up back acne yet gentle enough to use on your entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking to keep their skin fresh feeling and clean deep down below the surface.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have ever experienced with Proactiv is that it can sometime be harsh if used everyday.</li>
            <li>My fourteen year old son who used this as a body bar, used it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I use their complete line of products as a preventive&lt;br</li>
            <li>No irritation was noticed and skin felt tighter but not dried out.  </li>
            <li>So young and old can use these products with confidence that they do what they say.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t recommend washing sore and sensitive skin with it, because of the Salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>- my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using this soap to wash my face for a few weeks, and I like it, because it lathers well and rinse cleanly.</li>
            <li>Currently at $39.95 for two bars seems awfully high.</li>
            <li>guy won&#x27;t entirely solve my woes and others&#x27;, but it certainly help alleviate the symptoms and daily struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only used it two or three times so far, so there are no negative effects or anything, and that&#x27;s why I am rating it as such, but</li>
            <li>used Proactiv in the past so the brand was familiar.</li>
            <li>those interested in ingredients, the active ingredient is Salicylic Acid 1% and inactive ingredients</li>
            <li>I bought it to clear up my back acne I get since I sweat a lot at my job as a CNA</li>
            <li>One for me one for my 12 yr old fighting teen breakouts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but if my parents thought they were worth the investment 20 years ago, then I needed to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>son used this soap for about 2 weeks consistently and his skin was noticeably less oily and the acne</li>
            <li>It does leave you a bit dry, but that’s normal with this type of skin cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>In regards to other body usage, I may use it on my back since it&#x27;s so hot and humid in the summer.  </li>
            <li>left, because you need very little to clean your face.</li>
            <li>directions state to start off with once a day, gradually increasing to three times a day, due to the fact of possible dryness could occur with too much usage.</li>
            <li>My son is a young teen and suddenly his skin is having alot of bumps and also some acne on his back, legs and upper arms.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is they haven&#x27;t worked as well as some other options for actually clearing my skin.</li>
            <li>Following the Proactiv+ with the exfoliant, my skin feels much cleaner, and less responsive, to the exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it certainly does the job, at least on my son&#x27;s 16 year old face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A light, fresh scent is the first thing you noticed before even taking the bar out of the box.</li>
            <li> While this bar seems to do a fine job cleaning and assuring the skin &amp;#34;sloughs&amp;#34; off I have not seen a real reduction in any of the acne.</li>
            <li> I still prefer using La Roche Posay Effaclar products for anti-acne, but these bars are worth a shot too.</li>
            <li> and I shower right after work and use two times a day.</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv in general and have used a variety of their products for years</li>
            <li> Be aware the cleansing bar is slightly abrasive, which helps remove dirt etc., but may not be pleasant if you don&#x27;t like things that are scratchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks, I noticed a remarkable improvement on the kid&#x27;s face, but what stuck out at me the most was the attitude change - no longer hidden behind acne, the kid seemed more confident and ready to take on the summer with cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent enough soap, I guess, but if I want a nice soap, I&#x27;ll go to L&#x27;Occitane.  </li>
            <li> but could be more bigger for the price!!</li>
            <li> I love the concept a total body cleansing soap from a leading company, Proactive.  </li>
            <li> ;) my mom told me today I will order again can&#x27;t wait..;)</li>
            <li> Came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Overall we haven&#x27;t been totally satisfied with the reduction in acne.  </li>
            <li> And with a much higher price tag.  </li>
            <li> Can be used on the face or whole body!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The key with these bars, as well as most skin care.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in trying this product for quite some time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it and ask my daughter to give it a try since her acne is more traditional teenage acne - perhaps it is better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than likely, though, I&#x27;ll save this very costly soap for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin, so I will watch closely to make sure this cleansing bar isn&#x27;t causing issues rather than helping to clear his skin.</li>
            <li> The bars have a slight but decent odor, and did a good job at cleaning the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Proactive, I use its Renewing cleanser for my face very often, I grabbed these bars because I wanted to try something different</li>
            <li> I usually use all natural soaps that are hand done (with ingredients I can pronounce and recognize) and have been pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li> I use bar soap pretty much exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can only speak after a single use, but it has a pleasant, herbal  fragrance and rinses off well.</li>
            <li> The bars are a good size, about the same as a full size bar of soap, maybe a little bigger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These body bars have a nice scent to them and they have a little bit of grit, which seems to be for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the early Proactiv products until I developed an allergy to them.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping to Canada.</li>
            <li> These Cleansing Body Bars really do the trick when it comes to clearing up pesky acne.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans the skin.  </li>
            <li> So it might have helped but it doesn&#x27;t seem too much like it effected the result.</li>
            <li> B00E4MNQ24 Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream 12 Oz (2 Pack)]], because of its cooling effect and terrific scent.  </li>
            <li> maybe in conjunction with the other Proactiv products, it would work better.</li>
            <li> This Proactiv bar soap is ideal for the shower (with careful instructions to keep it dry and last longer).</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> Pimples can appear in places other than the face, and the curved shape of the bar allows it to be more easily applied to other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> main drawback is the price.</li>
            <li> have mild body acne on my chest, shoulders, back, and clavicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see much difference than the regular good ole soap.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The price for two bars of soap is a bit high, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The bars are large, and promise to last quite a while, so I should see some real improvement with two bars.</li>
            <li> so I was eager to try out their new body bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far,  there&#x27;s no excess dryness, and I can see signs of clearing, particularly on my arms.  </li>
            <li> actually went back to the proactive sulfur mask which works fabulously</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re well past the target acne prone youths, but this definitely is a good product for aging dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The cost is worth it if it works long term.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are small microbeads or gritty things that I liked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrific as a face soap and of course for the price, the less you use in a shot, the better.  </li>
            <li> I can recommend this cleansing body bar as a daily treatment for large  pores and tightening of the body.</li>
            <li> This body bar is strong enough to clear up back acne yet gentle enough to use on your entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking to keep their skin fresh feeling and clean deep down below the surface.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have ever experienced with Proactiv is that it can sometime be harsh if used everyday.</li>
            <li> My fourteen year old son who used this as a body bar, used it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I use their complete line of products as a preventive&lt;br</li>
            <li> No irritation was noticed and skin felt tighter but not dried out.  </li>
            <li> So young and old can use these products with confidence that they do what they say.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t recommend washing sore and sensitive skin with it, because of the Salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> - my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this soap to wash my face for a few weeks, and I like it, because it lathers well and rinse cleanly.</li>
            <li> Currently at $39.95 for two bars seems awfully high.</li>
            <li> guy won&#x27;t entirely solve my woes and others&#x27;, but it certainly help alleviate the symptoms and daily struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only used it two or three times so far, so there are no negative effects or anything, and that&#x27;s why I am rating it as such, but</li>
            <li> used Proactiv in the past so the brand was familiar.</li>
            <li> those interested in ingredients, the active ingredient is Salicylic Acid 1% and inactive ingredients</li>
            <li> I bought it to clear up my back acne I get since I sweat a lot at my job as a CNA</li>
            <li> One for me one for my 12 yr old fighting teen breakouts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but if my parents thought they were worth the investment 20 years ago, then I needed to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> son used this soap for about 2 weeks consistently and his skin was noticeably less oily and the acne</li>
            <li> It does leave you a bit dry, but that’s normal with this type of skin cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> In regards to other body usage, I may use it on my back since it&#x27;s so hot and humid in the summer.  </li>
            <li> left, because you need very little to clean your face.</li>
            <li> directions state to start off with once a day, gradually increasing to three times a day, due to the fact of possible dryness could occur with too much usage.</li>
            <li> My son is a young teen and suddenly his skin is having alot of bumps and also some acne on his back, legs and upper arms.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is they haven&#x27;t worked as well as some other options for actually clearing my skin.</li>
            <li> Following the Proactiv+ with the exfoliant, my skin feels much cleaner, and less responsive, to the exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it certainly does the job, at least on my son&#x27;s 16 year old face.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> soap works wonders and should last awhile if you don&#x27;t waste it or treat it like normal</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, we switched from daily to every-other-day use because his skin was getting way too dry.  </li>
            <li> I still think daily use might be a bit for some who do not have severe acne or very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> There was little to no soapy action</li>
            <li> Quality product doesn’t distinguish itself enough to warrant the above average price tag.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter uses the line of proactiv products &amp; we usually reorder from a kiosk at our local mall.</li>
            <li> I am very active so sweat a lot - while I don&#x27;t have regular acne except occasionally on my face</li>
            <li> Unless you have &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; or other such issues, I can&#x27;t imagine using this as a body bar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that after using them for a while, they do seem to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> The soap bars are well formulated, though the thought of having acne remnants on stale soap bars sitting idle in the bath is pretty gross.</li>
            <li> So far it had eliminating a few blemishes, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is from the actual product of just the exfoliation that the loofah provides.</li>
            <li> had to drop it to 5 stars only because it is a little pricey (found them online anywhere from $32 to $40 for the 2-bar pack).  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry out your skin, whether on your face or other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> Be careful of overuse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken a few weeks to notice a difference, but I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> But I expected that.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t tell my husband how much I spent.</li>
            <li> Not sure using these bars alone actually helps remove acne -</li>
            <li> I usually used Dove body soap, and I will probably go back to that.</li>
            <li> At that rate, a bar will last a long time and the high price isn&#x27;t that bad considering the soap&#x27;s long lifetime.  </li>
            <li> so I try to limit use to every other day or less.</li>
            <li> Seems like an average soap to me.  </li>
            <li> I still have lots of soap left and am using this at least a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as another reviewer pointed out, Neutrogena, who I adore, has acne wash with salicylic acid for a lot less than the soap, so I&#x27;d be tempted to try that in order to save money since $40 for 2 bars of soap can add up.</li>
            <li> less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I have not experienced this product being harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> In use though I haven&#x27;t really had results that are stellar or terrible.</li>
            <li> because that overnight product felt too heavy and sticky in the summer, I thought I would try this Proactiv+ soap instead.  </li>
            <li> My chest, neck, and upper back can be subject to bouts of acne that are unsightly and painful.</li>
            <li> It’s really just a matter of how bad your acne is</li>
            <li> this product in front my door its was past..</li>
            <li> Usually in the summer, I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m not sure what justifies the price of these bars.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t go overboard with this</li>
            <li> and if you have tried other less expensive options.</li>
            <li> boy those were awkward times) and now that I&#x27;m approaching 40</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been avoiding using this around my eyes to keep from drying out delicate skin there.  </li>
            <li> so it loses a star for price.  </li>
            <li> $40 for 2 bars of soap is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> But the price is pretty outrageous in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> They are expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try ProActive products, but they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t dry, and it does seem to help with those awful subcutaneous things that have sporadically sprung up all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave cruddy residue behind on your skin (remember that Dove commercial!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> still break out, just not as bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect product but could be more bigger for the price!!</li>
            <li> 2nd time i buy it. Works great all on types of skin. One for me one for my 12 yr old fighting teen breakouts</li>
            <li> A light, fresh scent is the first thing you noticed before even taking the bar out of the box. The bars are a good size, about the same as a full size bar of soap, maybe a little bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state to start off with once a day, gradually increasing to three times a day, due to the fact of possible dryness could occur with too much usage. This is a good point to be aware of. My fourteen year old son who used this as a body bar, used it twice a day. With using it twice a day there was some dryness which might have become irritable had he used it three times a day. Twice daily, he did see improvement in not only with breakouts but the acne he had starting clearing up. It’s not an overnight process but does show signs of improving the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback is the price. Currently at $39.95 for two bars seems awfully high. It’s really just a matter of how bad your acne is and if you have tried other less expensive options.</li>
            <li> my son loves this product..will be ordering again in th future.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, nice lather, refreshing tingle and brings a tightness to the face. I love the concept a total body cleansing soap from a leading company, Proactive.  Proactive products have always been a good and reliable product.  I use their complete line of products as a preventive&lt;br /&gt; skin care daily regiment routine.  I can recommend this cleansing body bar as a daily treatment for large  pores and tightening of the body.</li>
            <li> I have almost gone through both bars now with no improvement. Sadly I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I would order this product again! It met my expectations!</li>
            <li> These bars are 1% salicylic acid and similar to Oxygen bars when I was younger. They are expensive but I don&#x27;t suggest using these all over your body, just acne areas or your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap works wonders and should last awhile if you don&#x27;t waste it or treat it like normal soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Oh my God this product I order yesterday and today this product in front my door its was past..I&#x27;m so excited to use my mom happy too.;) my mom told me today I will order again can&#x27;t wait..;)</li>
            <li> The product actually works!</li>
            <li> The face isn&#x27;t the only place that has skin troubles.  So, I was delighted to find all the the good properties of Proactiv in a cleansing bar form.  So far,  there&#x27;s no excess dryness, and I can see signs of clearing, particularly on my arms.  The bars are large, and promise to last quite a while, so I should see some real improvement with two bars.</li>
            <li> After not being able to use [[ASIN:B00TI6TSHI Proactiv+ Skin Revitalizing Pads, 90 Count]], because that overnight product felt too heavy and sticky in the summer, I thought I would try this Proactiv+ soap instead.  It turned out to be a great alternative.  It&#x27;s a wonderful clarifying soap that leaves my face soft.  Usually in the summer, I use [[ASIN:B00E4MNQ24 Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream 12 Oz (2 Pack)]], because of its cooling effect and terrific scent.  It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out, like it did when I was a teenager. However, I think it does clog pores to a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I am going to alternate Noxzema with this Proactiv+ soap.  The soap does not smell as good as the Noxzema, and actually has a bit too strong a scent for me when put on; but the light scent it leaves on my face is a pleasant soap scent that I like, and does not give me sinus headaches.  In the winter, I&#x27;ll try the revitalizing pads again, although I figure I&#x27;ll still have plenty of Proactiv+ soap left, because you need very little to clean your face. In regards to other body usage, I may use it on my back since it&#x27;s so hot and humid in the summer.  More than likely, though, I&#x27;ll save this very costly soap for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/3/16:  I still have lots of soap left and am using this at least a few times a week.  It&#x27;s great for exfoliating my face.</li>
            <li> My son is a young teen and suddenly his skin is having alot of bumps and also some acne on his back, legs and upper arms. This Proactiv bar soap is ideal for the shower (with careful instructions to keep it dry and last longer). I can only speak after a single use, but it has a pleasant, herbal  fragrance and rinses off well. My son has sensitive skin, so I will watch closely to make sure this cleansing bar isn&#x27;t causing issues rather than helping to clear his skin. The cost is worth it if it works long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested in ingredients, the active ingredient is Salicylic Acid 1% and inactive ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;sodium cocoyl isethionate, fragrance, cocamidopropyl hydrosultaine, sodium chloride, galactoarabinan, polyethylene, disodium EDTA, pentasodium pentatate, titanium dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can call the manufacturer if you have any questions: 1-800950-4695</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing with these for about a week now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. They&#x27;re effective at clearing pores, and they leave behind a pleasant, clean tingling feeling. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The Cleansing Body Bars have a nice fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower. It definitely works. My chest and back cleared up within a couple of weeks of use. Be careful of overuse. My skin is pretty sensitive so I try to limit use to every other day or less. Other than that, the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping to Canada. Came exactly as advertised. Great product!</li>
            <li> Nice soap bars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for reviewing it. That being said, I&#x27;m not sure what justifies the price of these bars. It&#x27;s basically salicylic acid as an anti-acne ingredient inside a soap bar. The soap bars are well formulated, though the thought of having acne remnants on stale soap bars sitting idle in the bath is pretty gross. I still prefer using La Roche Posay Effaclar products for anti-acne, but these bars are worth a shot too. They:&lt;br /&gt;- Feel nice&lt;br /&gt;- Wash off nicely&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t leave cruddy residue behind on your skin (remember that Dove commercial!)&lt;br /&gt;- Smell clean and neutral</li>
            <li> I do like these Proactiv cleansing body bars. They don&#x27;t dry out your skin, whether on your face or other parts of your body. They suds up like soap even though there&#x27;s no soap in them, and they do leave your skin feeling relatively nice. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is they haven&#x27;t worked as well as some other options for actually clearing my skin. I would much rather go with something that feels good and works, rather than something that just feels good but doesn&#x27;t work quite as well (especially at its current price). Still not bad, though.</li>
            <li> Seems like an average soap to me.  Not sure if I see much difference than the regular good ole soap.  It has a nice, pleasant and subtle fragrance.  However, I really do see this as a great option for vegetarians and vegans out there and for that I have to give Proactiv+ some praise as this is the soap I can now recommend to those who are looking for an alternative to traditional soaps.  It sure seems pricey, but the vegan/vegetarian lifestyle can be pricey as I understand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just turned 82 and this is indeed a superior cleansing bar for those in my age group.  We&#x27;re well past the target acne prone youths, but this definitely is a good product for aging dry skin.  I don&#x27;t recommend daily use.  Once or twice weekly is ideal.  At that rate, a bar will last a long time and the high price isn&#x27;t that bad considering the soap&#x27;s long lifetime.  I do recommend this on all counts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel that this was effective: after two weeks, I have just as much body acne, or more, than I did before.  It&#x27;s a decent enough soap, I guess, but if I want a nice soap, I&#x27;ll go to L&#x27;Occitane.  I&#x27;m switching back to my regular benzoyl peroxide body wash.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Works well.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv as a acne-ridden teenager (boy those were awkward times) and now that I&#x27;m approaching 40, I don&#x27;t need them. However, the teenager does, and they&#x27;re fighting with acne. It&#x27;s not cheap, but if my parents thought they were worth the investment 20 years ago, then I needed to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, I noticed a remarkable improvement on the kid&#x27;s face, but what stuck out at me the most was the attitude change - no longer hidden behind acne, the kid seemed more confident and ready to take on the summer with cleaner skin. The bars have a slight but decent odor, and did a good job at cleaning the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as another reviewer pointed out, Neutrogena, who I adore, has acne wash with salicylic acid for a lot less than the soap, so I&#x27;d be tempted to try that in order to save money since $40 for 2 bars of soap can add up. Overall, I&#x27;m happy that my kid is happy, but at the same time, there might be better, cheaper solutions in Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> We tested these bars for three weeks on oily facial breakout areas and on one spot on our back.  There was little to no soapy action but it got skin clean.  No irritation was noticed and skin felt tighter but not dried out.  Breakout were controlled because the skin wasn&#x27;t as oily each day.  This soap will be used more when our kids begin adolescent breakouts.</li>
            <li> If you have &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; this is your product!  A lot of people don&#x27;t realize that salicylic acid is an anti-bacterial (although weaker than benzoyl peroxide) as well as an exfoliant.  This body bar is strong enough to clear up back acne yet gentle enough to use on your entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have love Proactiv products since they were released over 20 years ago.  When Proactiv+ was introduced, I was over the moon.  Here you have products that work both for acne AND aging skin.  So young and old can use these products with confidence that they do what they say.  The same with the body bars.  They work.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These Cleansing Body Bars really do the trick when it comes to clearing up pesky acne.  They lather up nicely and they just feel clean.  I&#x27;ve noticed that after using them for a while, they do seem to dry out my skin.  Unless you have &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; or other such issues, I can&#x27;t imagine using this as a body bar.  It&#x27;s terrific as a face soap and of course for the price, the less you use in a shot, the better.  Using this only as a face soap I still think daily use might be a bit for some who do not have severe acne or very dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been avoiding using this around my eyes to keep from drying out delicate skin there.  The price for two bars of soap is a bit high, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I feel grateful that Proactiv has put their acne cleansing potion on soap form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild body acne on my chest, shoulders, back, and clavicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guy won&#x27;t entirely solve my woes and others&#x27;, but it certainly help alleviate the symptoms and daily struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, cleansing, and recommended.</li>
            <li> These soap bars are excellent for treating acne-prone skin, but, as the header of my review suggests, too much of a good thing....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son used this soap for about 2 weeks consistently and his skin was noticeably less oily and the acne less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we switched from daily to every-other-day use because his skin was getting way too dry.  Just make sure that you monitor the skin moisture so you don&#x27;t go overboard with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to drop it to 5 stars only because it is a little pricey (found them online anywhere from $32 to $40 for the 2-bar pack).  But it certainly does the job, at least on my son&#x27;s 16 year old face.</li>
            <li> These body bars have a nice scent to them and they have a little bit of grit, which seems to be for exfoliation. Overall we haven&#x27;t been totally satisfied with the reduction in acne.  Not sure using these bars alone actually helps remove acne - maybe in conjunction with the other Proactiv products, it would work better.</li>
            <li> I bought it to clear up my back acne I get since I sweat a lot at my job as a CNA and it helps but acne is still an issue and I shower right after work and use two times a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try ProActive products, but they are so expensive.  This one in no exception so it loses a star for price.  Otherwise, my son and I had no problems with the bar soap.  It is a decent size, goes on nicely, and smells non-offensively.  There are small microbeads or gritty things that I liked.  I have Caucasian light skin that still can breakout at my age.  My son liked it too.  I think he was singing Adam Levine songs in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, good product, but the price is too high because of their marketing and spokespeople.</li>
            <li> Proactiv has made a name for themselves in the world of skincare.  I hear lots of good feedback on them so I was eager to try out their new body bar.&lt;br /&gt;It works.  That’s the most important thing you are wondering about I’m sure.  So thumbs up for them there.  It really cleans the skin.  It does leave you a bit dry, but that’s normal with this type of skin cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;How does it compare with Neutrogena’s cleansing wash?  To me it seems to work about the same.  And with a much higher price tag.  What about Clearasil?  It works maybe slightly better but once again, a much higher price tag.  Are you seeing a pattern here?&lt;br /&gt;The product is great and lasts for quite a while.  But the price is pretty outrageous in my opinion.  Are you paying for the bar or the name?  I am reviewing this for free, because I honestly would not have bought it out of pocket.  And after trying it I’m glad I didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Quality product doesn’t distinguish itself enough to warrant the above average price tag.  Stick with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Proactiv + Body Cleansing Bars (2 pack). These cleansing bars smell great! Fresh and clean scent with the power of acne fighting medicine. Can be used on the face or whole body! 5/5 stars</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this cleansing body bar on areas with stubborn acne issues, namely our faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also use an exfoliating scrub on our faces and, if I apply the Proactiv+ soap alone, it exfoliates the skin on my face. Following the Proactiv+ with the exfoliant, my skin feels much cleaner, and less responsive, to the exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only assume that the Proactiv+ cleansing body bar is doing a great job at cleaning my skin, without the need of the additional exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this cleansing bar and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking to keep their skin fresh feeling and clean deep down below the surface.</li>
            <li> I love Proactive, I use its Renewing cleanser for my face very often, I grabbed these bars because I wanted to try something different and I just do not like how my skin feels. I only used it two or three times so far, so there are no negative effects or anything, and that&#x27;s why I am rating it as such, but I do not like the after feel.</li>
            <li> still break out, just not as bad</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this soap to wash my face for a few weeks, and I like it, because it lathers well and rinse cleanly. It does have a really nice fragrance, and my skin feels refreshed, because it cleans and leaves the skin feeling reinvigorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works well to prevent, or treat razor bumps. However, I don&#x27;t recommend washing sore and sensitive skin with it, because of the Salicylic acid. Also, remember to apply a body moisturizer afterwards to keep the skin hydrated. It definitive helps to keep clean and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Product is the only thing that works!!</li>
            <li> Proactiv is synonymous with acne free skin.  I was a huge fan of the early Proactiv products until I developed an allergy to them.  These soap bars have not triggered that allergy, and though I use them only on my face,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with results.  The soap doesn&#x27;t dry, and it does seem to help with those awful subcutaneous things that have sporadically sprung up all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key with these bars, as well as most skin care. Is consistency and persistence.  It&#x27;s taken a few weeks to notice a difference, but I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. Seems to do a good job of cleaning my skin (and to have helped), and my skin feels nice after using it. Be aware the cleansing bar is slightly abrasive, which helps remove dirt etc., but may not be pleasant if you don&#x27;t like things that are scratchy. One of the nice things about the cleansing bar is its shape. Pimples can appear in places other than the face, and the curved shape of the bar allows it to be more easily applied to other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in trying this product for quite some time and I&#x27;m glad that I had the opportunity to do so. I love Proactiv in general and have used a variety of their products for years so I know they&#x27;re legit and always get the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar isn&#x27;t drying to my skin which is always a concern when you apply acne eliminating products to your skin. I purchased a loofah on a stick in order to use it in combination and I love the scrub I get. So far it had eliminating a few blemishes, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is from the actual product of just the exfoliation that the loofah provides. Either way I&#x27;m satisfied with the job it&#x27;s done. Proactiv never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv products for well over a decade, but I have never used the body soap. I have stuck strictly to the facial products such as toner and lotion. The only problem I have ever experienced with Proactiv is that it can sometime be harsh if used everyday. I use it every other day because I have sensitive skin. So far, I have not experienced this product being harsh on my face. Of course, it&#x27;s not scented, so it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. But I expected that. I usually used Dove body soap, and I will probably go back to that.</li>
            <li> I am very active so sweat a lot - while I don&#x27;t have regular acne except occasionally on my face my body is different. My chest, neck, and upper back can be subject to bouts of acne that are unsightly and painful. I usually use all natural soaps that are hand done (with ingredients I can pronounce and recognize) and have been pretty happy with them. However I have (as has my teen) used Proactiv in the past so the brand was familiar. I do not like cleansers - my skin is too sensitive. I use bar soap pretty much exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bars are a good size and have a pleasant smell. They are grainy so feel a bit like a loofah. They fit comfortably in your hand and have a good weight. Nothing to complain of in any of that. In use though I haven&#x27;t really had results that are stellar or terrible. They&#x27;ve been kind of meh. I&#x27;m training for a marathon and that means a lot of sweat and some acne in my areas that are prone to this. While this bar seems to do a fine job cleaning and assuring the skin &amp;#34;sloughs&amp;#34; off I have not seen a real reduction in any of the acne. It did go away, but it always does for me, and I didn&#x27;t find any acceleration to its leaving. So it might have helped but it doesn&#x27;t seem too much like it effected the result. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m on the fence. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and ask my daughter to give it a try since her acne is more traditional teenage acne - perhaps it is better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually went back to the proactive sulfur mask which works fabulously (cannot recommend it highly enough) as a spot treatment for acne.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter uses the line of proactiv products &amp; we usually reorder from a kiosk at our local mall. However, the soap cannot be bought their so I ordered from Amazon. She loves the fact this product works to control her acne, I do not like the cost at all. $40 for 2 bars of soap is absolutely ridiculous. I can&#x27;t believe I even buy it but haven&#x27;t found anything comparable yet that&#x27;s more affordable and being a teenager is alot of pressure when you have acne. I gave this product five stars because it does work. I just can&#x27;t tell my husband how much I spent. lol</li>
