            <li>Mauve Maven is a wonderful color if you like the mauve colors...as I do...not totally red</li>
            <li>like the package shows...but more Mauve.</li>
            <li>Love Sensationail and appreciate that this product was as describe and in new-unused condition.</li>
            <li>Sensationnail does a great job in providing a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and in good shape when received.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to put on.</li>
            <li>whereas for me if I go to a salon I can go 3-4 weeks easily.</li>
            <li>Product arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Mauve Maven is such a great color.</li>
            <li>This gel nail polish is great quality, easy to apply brush, color is rich, holds better the any other I used.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this brand that is also sold in Walmart would actually be any good</li>
            <li>Now on the other hand I gave it 3 stars because the colors are breathtaking and it leaves a beautiful shine and it does last longer than regular polish on my nails</li>
            <li>This is my favorite by far of all the Sensationail colors.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors don&#x27;t last as long on my nails, but this color is really beautiful.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very timely, in original packaging &amp; new condition.  </li>
            <li>To think of the time spent apply this product , only to have to spend more time to remove it all and start again!!  </li>
            <li>I feel its more brown then pink, but with these gel colors I find that the color doesn&#x27;t match the color on the box exactly.</li>
            <li>the whole polish off of certain nails.  </li>
            <li>I really like the color</li>
            <li>I really dislike throwing my money away.  </li>
            <li>Very neutral.</li>
            <li>Required led light to dry.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if looking for a neutral fall color.</li>
            <li>top coat of Sensationail that is wasted money.  </li>
            <li>but normally within 4 or 5 days I have to redo my nails.</li>
            <li>I often have to remove and reapply sooner than 2 weeks but only because my nails grow very fast.  </li>
            <li>After before applying the polish I apply 2 coats of clear, then 2 coats of polish and another of clear.  </li>
            <li>The color is good, polish is a little thin but stayed on well.</li>
            <li>It was a great color and it works just as perfectly as my other expensive gel polishes work!</li>

            <li> The color lasts as well as the other, darker colors of the SensatioNail line.</li>

            <li> a bit dull now that I&#x27;ve gotten into reds!</li>

            <li> Not really impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, disgusted and angry that I received a product like this.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish was awful!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> a bit dull now that I&#x27;ve gotten into reds!</li>
            <li> I really like the color and it was easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Mauve Maven is one of my favorite colors that SensatioNail has to offer. It lasts about two weeks just like the other sensationail gel polishes. I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous neutral color for darker olive skin tones. Product arrived safely and quickly. The color lasts as well as the other, darker colors of the SensatioNail line. The lighter colors don&#x27;t last as long on my nails, but this color is really beautiful. Perfect as a year-round color. Will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used this polish with the Sensationail base and top coat then tried it with Sally Hansen base and top coat.  Neither attempt lasted even 24 hours.  That&#x27;s 2 polishes and 1 base/top coat of Sensationail that is wasted money.  I really dislike throwing my money away.  The color is gorgeous, a medium mauve with brown tones, so I am very disappointed that it won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed.  I bought these to use alongside the Sally Henson gel mani kit.  It seems like this nail polish will chop within a day or two and in about 4 or 5 days I can peel&lt;br /&gt;Off the whole polish off of certain nails.  Now on the other hand I gave it 3 stars because the colors are breathtaking and it leaves a beautiful shine and it does last longer than regular polish on my nails but normally within 4 or 5 days I have to redo my nails.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite by far of all the Sensationail colors. I love the way it looks on my nails and I get lots of compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was awful!  It had grit in it like sand.  I was disappointed, disgusted and angry that I received a product like this.  To think of the time spent apply this product , only to have to spend more time to remove it all and start again!!  I bought one in another color for a gift for a friend, how embarrassing!</li>
            <li> It is a good nail polish  Required led light to dry. Good value for money I like it very much</li>
            <li> I have a gel nail set and do my own.  This shade is great for summer or winter.  Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> This gel nail polish is great quality, easy to apply brush, color is rich, holds better the any other I used. There are cheaper gel polishes out there but this one is truly the best.</li>
            <li> Mauve Maven is such a great color. Very neutral. I feel its more brown then pink, but with these gel colors I find that the color doesn&#x27;t match the color on the box exactly. Highly recommend if looking for a neutral fall color.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Sensationnail does a great job in providing a professional manicure. It doesn&#x27;t chip or crack. lasts a good 2-3 weeks though whereas for me if I go to a salon I can go 3-4 weeks easily.</li>
            <li> It was different, from what I expected in Mauve.</li>
            <li> Love the color and when worn get lots of compliments.  Will continue to order this color. The shipping was fast and in good shape when received.</li>
            <li> The color is good, polish is a little thin but stayed on well. My manicurist loves the brush. Beware though, the bottle is very small.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  After before applying the polish I apply 2 coats of clear, then 2 coats of polish and another of clear.  Stays on beautifully.  I often have to remove and reapply sooner than 2 weeks but only because my nails grow very fast.  Love Sensationail products!</li>
            <li> I love the Gel Polish period! Mauve Maven is a wonderful color if you like the mauve colors...as I do...not totally red like the package shows...but more Mauve.</li>
