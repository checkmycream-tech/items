            <li>Great for us young girls - 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Well... the jojoba oil is really light and no noticeable smell</li>
            <li>I purchased because oil was recommended becuase of being light and obsurbing</li>
            <li>This is really light and airy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>My entire family use this for our hair and works great.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my skin sometimes since it is so light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it on my face though, doesn&#x27;t feel as light.</li>
            <li>I picked this product based on the good reviews and the low price.</li>
            <li>this item arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>delivery was vry quick.</li>
            <li>It works very well for this purpose and is easy on skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It leave my skin soft and supple and I love it.</li>
            <li>I replaced my night cream with this, as I am a strong believer of natural product.</li>

            <li>I love this oil especially since it is 100 percent jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying this again :)</li>
            <li>really like it so ordered more but could not find larger size in this brand.</li>
            <li>If I see this brand become available in larger size and the price is right</li>
            <li>My lobes are super soft and plump.</li>
            <li>also decided to get only 2oz because it was the smallest size available.</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves this oil.</li>
            <li>We have no way of knowing what&#x27;s really in this bottle since it arrived without a seal.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high, but  Concocare</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>, my legs have become super dry from lack of moisture.</li>
            <li>We had to throw it out because we couldn&#x27;t trust an unknown substance on our babies&#x27; hair and skin, and the cost of going to the post office and shipping it back was more than the price of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel very soft and it also helped it look shiny without feeling greasy</li>
            <li>They are a  brand that has been around for a long time with many other products.</li>
            <li>I dip a qtip in the oil every morning, and dab a little bit on the bed of each nail - and my torn up cuticles have improved hugely.</li>
            <li>Since this pure oil is next in line to the natural oils that our hair produce, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>And it seems to be natural as it is an oil.</li>
            <li>I use this on my kinky hair and It feels soft and I have a shine afterwards.</li>
            <li>This oil works wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>so soft also helps with frizz and adds moisture.</li>
            <li>help skin be so soft.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it on my natural, 4B/4C hair.</li>
            <li>Seems a little watered down compared to others I&#x27;ve used, but I do really like the cap &amp; squeeze function so you can portion it out better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super lazy</li>
            <li>Other than I give the product a thumbs up for its very noticeable benefits.</li>
            <li>bottle but a little goes a long way, my bottle is still full and I use it to seal my ends often.</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair (3b)</li>
            <li>All Natural Jojoba Oil truly works wonders on my dry hair and skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this oil to massage my earlobes before putting in my plugs or tappers. This oil is very nice and conditions my skin nicely. very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I replaced my night cream with this, as I am a strong believer of natural product. And it seems to be natural as it is an oil. It hydrates my face and penetrates in my skin nicely. Know your skin before ordering.</li>
            <li> I love this oil especially since it is 100 percent jojoba oil. I use this on my kinky hair and It feels soft and I have a shine afterwards.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high, but  Concocare All Natural Jojoba Oil truly works wonders on my dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Since this pure oil is next in line to the natural oils that our hair produce, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ll let you know....It just came in today (11/06/13).</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great on my skin. I put this on at night alone or sometimes under my Avon Anew night cream. It blends great into my skin</li>
            <li> Excellent oil for the price and on par with the higher priced ones. Works excellently as a body/hair oil. Would definitely recommend, it is a quality that is always expected of Cococare. They are a  brand that has been around for a long time with many other products.</li>
            <li> Being that it&#x27;s winter and I&#x27;m super lazy, my legs have become super dry from lack of moisture. I used the Jojoba Oil once and they&#x27;re already softer. I also use it for my gauges. My lobes are super soft and plump.</li>
            <li> Use it for my hair (massage into my dry itchy scalp), nails, henna hair treatments, too keep my guaged lobes and organic wooden gauges nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> Seems a little watered down compared to others I&#x27;ve used, but I do really like the cap &amp; squeeze function so you can portion it out better</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair to help with dry scalp. It adds moisture and has a nice smell. My only complaint is that the bottle is a little small for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product, but i think it has cocoa butter in it..</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair (3b) and I was looking for something alittle lighter than olive oil which my hair loves but again it is so heavy. Well... the jojoba oil is really light and no noticeable smell but the bottle was so small.. I should have read the fine print:(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it almost every day. I mix a little in my lotion after i shower and use it on my face and a lite in my hair as well. Nice quality and a nice buy. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it daily as a skin moisturizer, and also on my hair as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle of Jojoba oil to take care of my cuticles. I dip a qtip in the oil every morning, and dab a little bit on the bed of each nail - and my torn up cuticles have improved hugely. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also decided to get only 2oz because it was the smallest size available. I&#x27;m very happy with this choice, because at this rate it&#x27;s still going to take me over a year to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil anyway, and I feel this brand is just as good as Desert Essence. I use it as an eyelash conditioner, and it works just as well as any other brand.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves this oil. It leave my skin soft and supple and I love it.</li>

            <li> This oil is great! I love how soft it makes my ears feel, and it&#x27;s great for lubricating plugs to get them in your ears. It arrived very quickly. The only issue I had was that a little had leaked out when I got it. So, the bottle and packaging it came in was greasy. Not much leaked out, so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. I&#x27;m glad that I bought it!</li>
            <li> I received this product in no time!&lt;br /&gt;Small bottle but a little goes a long way, my bottle is still full and I use it to seal my ends often. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Solid jojoba oil from a solid brand. Affordable price tag. What&#x27;s there not to like? My only complaint is that there&#x27;s not enough for a 1-month supply.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel very soft and it also helped it look shiny without feeling greasy</li>
            <li> this item arrived quickly and well packaged. i love the way it makes my hair feel...so soft also helps with frizz and adds moisture. i would definetely recommend this product to people with all kinds of hair. also great for skin. help skin be so soft. awesome product with lots of uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as a conditioner n my beard. It makes my beard more manageable and it puts a shine on my beard all day. I recommend using Jojoba oil in your beards.</li>
            <li> delivery was vry quick. Packaging was very secure. 2oz for the price was very good. I purchased because oil was recommended becuase of being light and obsurbing well it does both I use on my face and body. This has many uses I still need to try on my hair. I aslo use to remove my mascara which is water proof (much better than baby oil).I really like it so ordered more but could not find larger size in this brand. If I see this brand become available in larger size and the price is right I will order again</li>
            <li> This is really light and airy.  I use it on my hair and it&#x27;s keeps it wonderfully moisturized.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> my skin feels super soft and smooth and it gives my skin a nice and helthy glow which I love !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s light and does wonders on my hair. I will try on my face. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is a staple in my hair regimen. I make sure to use it appropriately.  It came in a timely manner and was secured. I will continue to use it on my natural, 4B/4C hair.</li>
            <li> Great for us young girls - 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Thicker viscosity than I expected.</li>
            <li> I picked this product based on the good reviews and the low price. However, what we received in the mail was an unsealed bottle of liquid with the lid taped down with scotch tape.

            <li> I use this to cut my fragrance oils, and a few of my essential oils to make them last longer. It works very well for this purpose and is easy on skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use when making my own perfume using oils.  This blends well without changing the scent of your oils and is an extender.</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is great and fits well into my hair care routine. I even use it on my skin sometimes since it is so light. I don&#x27;t like it on my face though, doesn&#x27;t feel as light. Other than I give the product a thumbs up for its very noticeable benefits.</li>
