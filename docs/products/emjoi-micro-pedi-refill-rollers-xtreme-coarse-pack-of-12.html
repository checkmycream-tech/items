            <li>I assume these were authentic refill rollers since they came in a nondescript package and the rollers didn&#x27;t have the plastic cases on them like the ones I got with my original Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Even if they aren&#x27;t they worked as well and the price was fantastic; plus now that I think about it</li>
            <li>Maybe because these are not the ORIGINAL manufacturer&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>it is good material, I&#x27;ve only used it once</li>
            <li>I should have listened to one of the other reviews, but thought Xtreme Coarse would be good and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>they are more earth friendly without the extra plastic covers.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly and, because it is coarser than the blue roller that came with the unit, it is much better for my rough, dry feet.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the regular rollers.</li>
            <li>Not any better than the blue one that came on my new product.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have any areas where I thinned too much.</li>
            <li>this is gift for my dad, he is very like it.</li>
            <li>They should mention this information straight out in the title  and description.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Emjoi.</li>
            <li>It keep it soft.</li>
            <li>Dry them and they can be used on hands since it is softened so much.</li>

            <li> They work fantastic if you have some very thick hard callouses and are using the Pedi for the first time.</li>
            <li> The blue is more like a polisher where the green extreme is for stubborn thick callouses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother ordering the other rollers that aren&#x27;t Xtreme Coarse ...</li>
            <li> After 20 uses, wash them carefully with soap and brushes.</li>

            <li> and i have spent so much money on useless creams, foot Sanders, socks and crap that just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Should be less expensive...</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase, but will use them....</li>

I can&#x27;t be sure.  Even if they aren&#x27;t they worked as well and the price was fantastic; plus now that I think about it they are more earth friendly without the extra plastic covers.</li>
            <li> Have used this and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Skip the Coarse and go straight to the Extreme, saves time and $.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother ordering the other rollers that aren&#x27;t Xtreme Coarse ... you can regulate ...  these will last the longest.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the other reviews, but thought Xtreme Coarse would be good and the price was great.  Maybe because these are not the ORIGINAL manufacturer&#x27;s product.  You get what you pay for I suppose.  Not any better than the blue one that came on my new product.  Not happy with this purchase, but will use them....what can I do?  : /</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Each green roller came in a plastic sleeve within another plastic bag. Fit perfectly and, because it is coarser than the blue roller that came with the unit, it is much better for my rough, dry feet.</li>
            <li> Great product great vendor</li>
            <li> I love using the micro pedi on my feet. It keep it soft. However, the roller can be expensive. I have decided to prolong the use of the rollers by doing the following. I purchased the harshest rollers and used them on my feet. After 20 uses, wash them carefully with soap and brushes. Dry them and they can be used on hands since it is softened so much. Hope this tip helps if you are looking to prolong the life of your rollers.</li>
            <li> They work fantastic if you have some very thick hard callouses and are using the Pedi for the first time. I read the instructions and was very careful so I didn&#x27;t have any areas where I thinned too much. I like using these in conjunction with the blue extra course. The blue is more like a polisher where the green extreme is for stubborn thick callouses. Work just as well as the brand name and an excellent value. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great addition to the micro pedi.</li>
            <li> these were packed in a plastic wrap....do not believe they are authentic emoji product. Should be less expensive... Each role lasts for maybe two pedis.</li>
            <li> great product, every woman or man needs an emjoi...</li>
            <li> nice product! this is gift for my dad, he is very like it.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the regular rollers.</li>
            <li> I have the worst feet and i have spent so much money on useless creams, foot Sanders, socks and crap that just don&#x27;t work.  While searching Amazon came across this gadget with these micro pedi refills and after only one use my feet are actually softer than a babies bottom.  I highly recommend Emjoi. Bits worth every dollar and my feet feel great. I&#x27;ve enclosed my nasty feet (I hope I don&#x27;t make anyone sick or grossed out but proof is in the pictures before and after.</li>
            <li> Love the refill rollaes</li>
            <li> it is good material, I&#x27;ve only used it once but i can tell the difference between this one and the one that came with the machine...</li>
            <li> These are NOT the actual EMJOI replacements-  they are imitation EMJOI rollers. They should mention this information straight out in the title  and description.</li>
            <li> great deal, FAST Ship</li>
            <li> Awesome! Best rollers for the Micro-Pedi!</li>
