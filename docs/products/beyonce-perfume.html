            <li>I so wanted to love this perfume, but I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>Heat Rush is more of a spring, summer and daytime fragrance, compared to it&#x27;s sister fragrance Heat which is a spicy evening wear.</li>
            <li>I love this sent.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Overall, a wonderful fragrance. :)</li>

            <li>I will get the Beyonce heat again but not this one, it&#x27;s ok though</li>
            <li>will recommend this perfume to every friend I have as well as order loads more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t even want a refund - i want to keep it as a reminder not to buy any more Celebrity perfumes - Beyonce should have a better perfume -</li>
            <li>I love the scent too</li>
            <li>i love the smell</li>
            <li>You have to love fruity gourmand perfumes to be able to like this.</li>
            <li>This perfume was ok, but it has more of an alcohol smell than the one I purchased at the department store.</li>
            <li>Came in a box and it smells lovely</li>
            <li>Just love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>My husband says it&#x27;s his favorite perfume on me.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and after it was discontinued at macy&#x27;s i looked for it in perfume stores</li>
            <li>and I think that babe will love it also :)</li>
            <li>Always get a lot of compliments when I wear it:)</li>
            <li>, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>feel so confident wearing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I tried this one because the reviews seem pretty good.</li>
            <li>It smells warm and summery; like sweet grapefruits.</li>
            <li>It not to strong but in a way is stay around for more time  </li>
            <li>Smells like a cheap floral perfume with a splash of orange soda thrown on top, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes and I was able to get a big bottle at a great price.</li>
            <li>All in all its a good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The scent is gorgeous, very floral and always get lots of compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li>I think it is much better than the original Heat.</li>
            <li>This smells awesome, as other reviewers have stated, but the strength does wear off.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick.  </li>
            <li>the scent is strong and began to annoy me.</li>
            <li>Smells very good and lasts long.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very potent, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>this product is a deal its the real thing the bigg botttle an very cheap compare to stores !</li>
            <li>smells sweet and fruity, also doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like most fragrances do</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell that it has</li>
            <li>I typically dislike celebrity fragrances but this fragrance is really impressive.  </li>
            <li>Its amazingly feminine with floral and fruit notes making it sweet, fun, and \\&quot;girlie\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>It has light notes of nectarine.</li>
            <li>another fantastic fragrance by beyonce summertime fragrance.</li>
            <li>But Heat Rush is so fantastic.</li>
            <li>love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li>It came at such a great price</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this fragrance its fun, sexy, girlie, delicous, almost candy</li>
            <li>Also, the orange color on the bottom gets rubbed off in my purse, and the nice metal piece under the spray piece came off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this great for date nights or laying in bed with significate other.</li>
            <li>but older ladies liked the scent.</li>
            <li>I sampled this, left the store and kept falling more in love, so jumped on Amazon and bought it!</li>
            <li>I have purchased 4 bottles since I first bought it :)</li>
            <li>One ounce at local retailers is more than what I paid for more than three ounces!</li>
            <li>this is my favorite fragrance it never fails to deliver time and time</li>
            <li>Such a comforting and warm smell too!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this perfume for my sister-in-law for Christmas, however I love the scent so much I decided to keep it!</li>
            <li>I received the original perfume with a super secure emballage..</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts for a very decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>If your a \\&quot;Fragrance Freak\\&quot; and love to collect you probably already have frrangrances that are very simiar and this wont amaze you.</li>
            <li>It is subtly sweet and fruity, but not at all an immature scent.</li>
            <li>I just do love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>The smell of this fragrance is so sweet.</li>
            <li>It is sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume sooo much.</li>
            <li>Bought this for the wife and it actually smells good like a mixture between fruit and baby powered</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and musky.</li>
            <li>thanks love it</li>
            <li>but seriously, if you&#x27;ve smelled it and already use it, you can find great savings here!</li>
            <li>It smells downright delectable, but, yes, it does fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly</li>
            <li>This particular smell does not match my chemistry, I&#x27;m sure someone in the world might like this.</li>
            <li>Produce quickly delivered and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have ordered a total of 4 bottles of it already &amp; love it soooo much!!!!</li>
            <li>and I normally spray 1 more time on lunch to give it a \\&quot;pick</li>
            <li>Smells really good but does not stay on for as long as i would like.</li>
            <li>when I first put it on I loved it, the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>The perfume is a very sensual scent!!</li>
            <li>On a plus side, I did receive this lightening fast!!</li>
            <li>Plus, I was given a coupon for 10% off a reorder of the same products, I love discounts!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not usually a celebrity perfume fan, only because I&#x27;m not a fan of these celebrities&#x27; music/work lol.</li>
            <li>It was a great deal especially since it was hard to find at a good price at stores in my area.</li>
            <li>the bottle is nice but the perfume itself  does not last!!!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for this perfume in a few places, so I was pleased to finally find it here and at a good price!</li>
            <li>Received it promptly, super fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and i bought it for my sister right away.</li>
            <li>It had just the right amount of spice but not over whelming.</li>
            <li>I went right to my desk, hopped on Amazon and bought it.  </li>
            <li>It has a great citrus scent, very mild, doesn&#x27;t last long (a sad fact) but it smells absolutely delicious!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and I am thinking of ordering several more.</li>
            <li>This is a Eau de Toilette so it does not last quite as long as hoped for and does NOT come as a Eau de Parfum (which I would really love more!).</li>
            <li>It was very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more in future! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I came on here looking for a better price and definitely found it.</li>
            <li>Will be buying again in the future! :)</li>
            <li>Next to Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy love this is my go to daytime perfume.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>but nope I started to dislike it more, especially when my boyfriend said I smell like the elderly people he transports at work (he is an emt)</li>
            <li>Beyonce you never failed me with this perfume 👏</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an EDT and does not come in EDP, which is unfortunate, as it is one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But be sure to get the ORANGE one, not the RED one&amp;#34; she said.  </li>
            <li>But if she smells like THIS, I&#x27;ve suddenly become her BIGGEST fan.  :-)</li>
            <li>Love it, definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fruity and clean, and doesn&#x27;t have an old lady smell to it.</li>
            <li>none of the cheap celebrity scents last, but I still like the smell very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really true what they say in the description that it comes alive on your skin and aura and is very sensual.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife after she was bombarded by a sales woman in a large store.</li>
            <li>Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the really heat fragrance</li>
            <li>The top notes(blood, orange, cherry, and passionfruit) linger longer then expected and really overpower the floral (orchid, mango blossom, orange hibiscus)</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells out of the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very musky on me.  </li>
            <li>Its very seductive.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable which is why I ended up buying it.</li>
            <li>and she really seemed to like it.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very fruity.</li>
            <li>cheap perfume - it does NOT last 10 mins</li>
            <li>Every time I smell it on my wife, I&#x27;m ready to test if she&#x27;s edible.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast too, I ordered this on a Friday and received it on a Tuesday.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, thumbs up 👌</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never cared much for Beyonce</li>
            <li>The real heat rush smells stronger and lasts longer</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I feel very sassy with it on.</li>
            <li>Other than that, i love it.</li>
            <li>me up.\\&quot; ll around the product doesn&#x27;t seem very orginal; the fragrance has simple note pattern citrus top note, floral middle, and then musky bottom.</li>
            <li>It is not stong smelling like perfume should be it is like body spray at the most , seems like it was watered down or something .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who likes fruity scents.</li>
            <li>If your looking for something fun and simple without strength I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>nobody wants a loud smell all the time.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume and it&#x27;s one that you can wear everyday if you choose.</li>
            <li>I own at least 4 of beyonce&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li>she did the same ran right out to get it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new perfume</li>
            <li>but I think that I found my new perfume to wear</li>
            <li>Very soft and sensual,  value for money.</li>
            <li>A few hours in and you can barely smell it unless you sniff your skin directly, so it&#x27;d be a great perfume for cozying up next to someone, but not necessarily for leaving a trail of freshness or leaving an impression when you walk into a room.</li>
            <li>Though it smells good for a few seconds, it isn&#x27;t worth the money spent in the long haul.</li>
            <li>Beyonce may be hot yet this fragrance will put your female companion on fire.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 2 stars because she thought it was funny.</li>
            <li>it is 20 and the exact same smell</li>
            <li>(WOW!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but for some reason the scent is a little of from the previous one bought.</li>
            <li>Smelled this perfume at a local department store and loved it - purchased it and discovered that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long (not even on clothes) but can&#x27;t expect much from perfume that costs less than $25!</li>
            <li>I thought when the price for this  was so low it might not be the real deal, it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>(so I don&#x27;t put on too much but just enough).</li>
            <li>It is too soft.</li>
            <li>I can nearly smell it.</li>
            <li>but he was completely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It transports you immediately in your mind to a wild, tropical setting.</li>
            <li>I was in an elevator at work, the door opened, a young girl walked in and BAM.  </li>
            <li>Beyonce has knocked it out of the ballpark.&lt;br /&gt;i gave it hands down a 5 because the smell is so sweet and yet soft and yet strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I apply a LOT of sprays of this to get it to last throughout the day, but it does die down in strength very quickly.</li>
            <li>The bottle shape is the same as its \\&quot;older sister\\&quot; Heat but is a softer orange color almost like a sunset.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have the same scent like the first bottle I bought, the scent didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fruity/sweet and it lasts a long time on me.</li>
            <li>but I would wear a blouse twice before washing it especially when new and the heat rush scent is everlasting</li>
            <li>Now I never openly ask strangers what they are wearing, especially 20 something girls (I am mid 40&#x27;s), but I couldn&#x27;t resist and asked at great risk of being labeled creepy.  </li>
            <li>but I gave this one a try out of general curiosity.</li>
            <li>so much sooner then expected.</li>
            <li>This barely lasts an hour.</li>
            <li>this is a very pretty smell, but i will say it smells a little generic...</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of Beyonce or celebrity perfumes generally,</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to buy it after reading other reviews saying that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>The only con is that it is a little too light of a fragrance, and I end up re-applying it a few times throughout the day.</li>

            <li> - I don&#x27;t even want a refund - i want to keep it as a reminder not to buy any more Celebrity perfumes - Beyonce should have a better perfume -</li>

            <li> You have to love fruity gourmand perfumes to be able to like this.</li>
            <li> This perfume was ok, but it has more of an alcohol smell than the one I purchased at the department store.</li>
            <li> Came in a box and it smells lovely</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of this perfume.</li>

            <li> It smells warm and summery; like sweet grapefruits.</li>
            <li> It not to strong but in a way is stay around for more time  </li>
            <li> Smells like a cheap floral perfume with a splash of orange soda thrown on top, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I was able to get a big bottle at a great price.</li>

            <li> I think it is much better than the original Heat.</li>
            <li> This smells awesome, as other reviewers have stated, but the strength does wear off.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick.  </li>
            <li> the scent is strong and began to annoy me.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and lasts long.</li>

            <li> I typically dislike celebrity fragrances but this fragrance is really impressive.  </li>

            <li> Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> It has light notes of nectarine.</li>

            <li> I really enjoy this fragrance its fun, sexy, girlie, delicous, almost candy</li>
            <li> Also, the orange color on the bottom gets rubbed off in my purse, and the nice metal piece under the spray piece came off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this great for date nights or laying in bed with significate other.</li>
            <li> but older ladies liked the scent.</li>
            <li> I sampled this, left the store and kept falling more in love, so jumped on Amazon and bought it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 bottles since I first bought it :)</li>
            <li> One ounce at local retailers is more than what I paid for more than three ounces!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite fragrance it never fails to deliver time and time</li>
            <li> Such a comforting and warm smell too!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this perfume for my sister-in-law for Christmas, however I love the scent so much I decided to keep it!</li>
            <li> I received the original perfume with a super secure emballage..</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts for a very decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> If your a \\&quot;Fragrance Freak\\&quot; and love to collect you probably already have frrangrances that are very simiar and this wont amaze you.</li>
            <li> It is subtly sweet and fruity, but not at all an immature scent.</li>
            <li> I just do love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is so sweet.</li>
            <li> It is sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume sooo much.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife and it actually smells good like a mixture between fruit and baby powered</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and musky.</li>
            <li> thanks love it</li>
            <li> but seriously, if you&#x27;ve smelled it and already use it, you can find great savings here!</li>
            <li> It smells downright delectable, but, yes, it does fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly</li>
            <li> This particular smell does not match my chemistry, I&#x27;m sure someone in the world might like this.</li>
            <li> Produce quickly delivered and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have ordered a total of 4 bottles of it already &amp; love it soooo much!!!!</li>
            <li> and I normally spray 1 more time on lunch to give it a \\&quot;pick</li>
            <li> Smells really good but does not stay on for as long as i would like.</li>
            <li> when I first put it on I loved it, the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The perfume is a very sensual scent!!</li>
            <li> On a plus side, I did receive this lightening fast!!</li>
            <li> Plus, I was given a coupon for 10% off a reorder of the same products, I love discounts!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not usually a celebrity perfume fan, only because I&#x27;m not a fan of these celebrities&#x27; music/work lol.</li>
            <li> It was a great deal especially since it was hard to find at a good price at stores in my area.</li>
            <li> the bottle is nice but the perfume itself  does not last!!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this perfume in a few places, so I was pleased to finally find it here and at a good price!</li>
            <li> Received it promptly, super fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and i bought it for my sister right away.</li>
            <li> It had just the right amount of spice but not over whelming.</li>
            <li> I went right to my desk, hopped on Amazon and bought it.  </li>
            <li> It has a great citrus scent, very mild, doesn&#x27;t last long (a sad fact) but it smells absolutely delicious!</li>
            <li> It came quickly and I am thinking of ordering several more.</li>
            <li> This is a Eau de Toilette so it does not last quite as long as hoped for and does NOT come as a Eau de Parfum (which I would really love more!).</li>
            <li> It was very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more in future! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I came on here looking for a better price and definitely found it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying again in the future! :)</li>
            <li> Next to Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy love this is my go to daytime perfume.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> but nope I started to dislike it more, especially when my boyfriend said I smell like the elderly people he transports at work (he is an emt)</li>
            <li> Beyonce you never failed me with this perfume 👏</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an EDT and does not come in EDP, which is unfortunate, as it is one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But be sure to get the ORANGE one, not the RED one&amp;#34; she said.  </li>
            <li> But if she smells like THIS, I&#x27;ve suddenly become her BIGGEST fan.  :-)</li>
            <li> Love it, definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fruity and clean, and doesn&#x27;t have an old lady smell to it.</li>
            <li> none of the cheap celebrity scents last, but I still like the smell very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really true what they say in the description that it comes alive on your skin and aura and is very sensual.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife after she was bombarded by a sales woman in a large store.</li>
            <li> Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the really heat fragrance</li>
            <li> The top notes(blood, orange, cherry, and passionfruit) linger longer then expected and really overpower the floral (orchid, mango blossom, orange hibiscus)</li>
            <li> I really like how it smells out of the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very musky on me.  </li>
            <li> Its very seductive.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable which is why I ended up buying it.</li>
            <li> and she really seemed to like it.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very fruity.</li>
            <li> cheap perfume - it does NOT last 10 mins</li>
            <li> Every time I smell it on my wife, I&#x27;m ready to test if she&#x27;s edible.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast too, I ordered this on a Friday and received it on a Tuesday.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, thumbs up 👌</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never cared much for Beyonce</li>
            <li> The real heat rush smells stronger and lasts longer</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I feel very sassy with it on.</li>
            <li> Other than that, i love it.</li>
            <li> me up.\\&quot; ll around the product doesn&#x27;t seem very orginal; the fragrance has simple note pattern citrus top note, floral middle, and then musky bottom.</li>
            <li> It is not stong smelling like perfume should be it is like body spray at the most , seems like it was watered down or something .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who likes fruity scents.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something fun and simple without strength I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> nobody wants a loud smell all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and it&#x27;s one that you can wear everyday if you choose.</li>
            <li> I own at least 4 of beyonce&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li> she did the same ran right out to get it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new perfume</li>
            <li> but I think that I found my new perfume to wear</li>
            <li> Very soft and sensual,  value for money.</li>
            <li> A few hours in and you can barely smell it unless you sniff your skin directly, so it&#x27;d be a great perfume for cozying up next to someone, but not necessarily for leaving a trail of freshness or leaving an impression when you walk into a room.</li>
            <li> Though it smells good for a few seconds, it isn&#x27;t worth the money spent in the long haul.</li>
            <li> Beyonce may be hot yet this fragrance will put your female companion on fire.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2 stars because she thought it was funny.</li>
            <li> it is 20 and the exact same smell</li>
            <li> (WOW!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but for some reason the scent is a little of from the previous one bought.</li>
            <li> Smelled this perfume at a local department store and loved it - purchased it and discovered that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long (not even on clothes) but can&#x27;t expect much from perfume that costs less than $25!</li>
            <li> I thought when the price for this  was so low it might not be the real deal, it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> (so I don&#x27;t put on too much but just enough).</li>
            <li> It is too soft.</li>
            <li> I can nearly smell it.</li>
            <li> but he was completely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It transports you immediately in your mind to a wild, tropical setting.</li>
            <li> I was in an elevator at work, the door opened, a young girl walked in and BAM.  </li>
            <li> Beyonce has knocked it out of the ballpark.&lt;br /&gt;i gave it hands down a 5 because the smell is so sweet and yet soft and yet strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I apply a LOT of sprays of this to get it to last throughout the day, but it does die down in strength very quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape is the same as its \\&quot;older sister\\&quot; Heat but is a softer orange color almost like a sunset.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the same scent like the first bottle I bought, the scent didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fruity/sweet and it lasts a long time on me.</li>
            <li> but I would wear a blouse twice before washing it especially when new and the heat rush scent is everlasting</li>
            <li> Now I never openly ask strangers what they are wearing, especially 20 something girls (I am mid 40&#x27;s), but I couldn&#x27;t resist and asked at great risk of being labeled creepy.  </li>
            <li> but I gave this one a try out of general curiosity.</li>
            <li> so much sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> This barely lasts an hour.</li>
            <li> this is a very pretty smell, but i will say it smells a little generic...</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of Beyonce or celebrity perfumes generally,</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to buy it after reading other reviews saying that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The only con is that it is a little too light of a fragrance, and I end up re-applying it a few times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If you want the smell to last longer buy the body lotion and spray this on after you put on the lotion, will last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long and to me this smell different than the one I tried in the store.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER I&#x27;m not entirely sure this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It smells divine, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The only fault I have is it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> but my wife says that it doesn&#x27;t last long !!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how amazing this smelled with the reviews that it had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so much of the bottle, even at the Amazon price, it is not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Not surprised as this sells at Walmart etc.and</li>
            <li> Its scent lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to re- up since my last bottle is down to its last drop</li>
            <li> Pity, like someone said before that it doesn&#x27;t last very long and you need to keep re-spraying probably</li>
            <li> Soft smell not strong.</li>
            <li> middle notes as well as the soft subtle musky (teak, honey, ambergris, white musks) bottom notes.</li>
            <li> I will buy this products and other Beyonc&amp;eacute;  perfumes in the future.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more citrus so this left me disappointed, but it&#x27;s definitely still wearable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying from this seller because I have a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> and it was the same price but can&#x27;t with 3 times less perfume</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of beyonce</li>
            <li> The base is too wide to hold and the top is too short to hold as well.</li>
            <li> I like this, however Beyonce&#x27;s other Heat smells better, but this one wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The 100ml bottle is very cumbersome to hold and spray and not particularly elegant or sleek in my opinion considering the big bucks behind it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a Christmas present so not sure how it smells</li>
            <li> The only thing that I was not pleased with was there was no tracking information for the shipment, other than that</li>
            <li> I would tell other about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to hold with one hand and spray at the same time.</li>
            <li> Quite cheap too, so you don&#x27;t have to feel bad</li>
            <li> The only two things I can say negatively about</li>
            <li> Well sometimes you get what you pay for but this was not worth anything.</li>
            <li> I have a good smell for scents and this one failed!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is watered down..</li>
            <li> The only thing that is annoying and worth mentioning is the shape of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle is just an odd shape.</li>
            <li> Smells a little watered down...</li>
            <li> it is an eu de toilette and therefore does not last as long as a perfume, and 2) the bottle is such a shape that it makes spraying it a little difficult!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me Beyonce Heat Rush in a little sample bottle</li>
            <li> I have to say that the scent is too weak and it does not last.</li>
            <li> the shape of it was horrible because it is very on comfortable to hold, it kept slipping out my hand.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I wore it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts all day and i&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments when wearing this one.</li>
            <li> Got it for half of the price it was listed for in the department store!  </li>
            <li> There is something in this perfume that keeps it from being disgusting sweet and generic smelling.</li>
            <li> , that doesnt mean you guys can sell watered down product</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t think I would receive the size indicated in the description because it&#x27;s cheaper than the  .5 oz bottle I used to buy in the stores, but was shocked that it is indeed the real deal.</li>
            <li> but if I spray just a small amount, I like it.</li>
            <li> my usual fragrance stays with me all day,  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle at Wal-Mart in a sample case writhe a small thing of lotion</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not a big problem for me since it is not too expensive, and I like re-applying it because I&#x27;m a smoker.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe the unbelievable carelessness put into making this perfume</li>
            <li> (unless my hands are just that small!)</li>
            <li> he wasn&#x27;t trying to be mean</li>
            <li> I find that a lot of scents today are similar but this was a shocking surprise.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy</li>
            <li> Personally, this fragrance is horrible.</li>
            <li> and I was a little disappointed when I got this as a christmas gift until i OPENED IT!</li>
            <li> Am I crazy?</li>
            <li> and she thought it stinks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this perfume!</li>
            <li> For me, Heat Rush is very mediocre.</li>
            <li> For those who have been disappointed by how short-lived the strength of this fragrance is, I am with you.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the smell the shape everything</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell of this one!</li>
            <li> I typically dislike celebrity fragrances but this fragrance is really impressive.  It has a strong spicy floral fragrance that is great for evenings. I really like how it smells out of the bottle but it smells very different when I apply it.  It&#x27;s very musky on me.  I know someone else who smokes who wore this... so she kind of ruined it for me... but if I spray just a small amount, I like it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is wonderful.  Got it for half of the price it was listed for in the department store!  I love it!</li>
            <li> when I first put it on I loved it, the smell doesn&#x27;t last. my usual fragrance stays with me all day,  I get told how good it smells. I thought when the price for this  was so low it might not be the real deal, it isn&#x27;t.  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> this is a very pretty smell, but i will say it smells a little generic...like i&#x27;ve smelled it before..it almost smells more like a fruit body spray..but a very good fruit body spray at that!</li>
            <li> smells sooo great and a really good size bottle</li>
            <li> smells amazing...I get so many compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li> it is a good product for this price</li>
            <li> i was reading cosmo and i smelt the sample and i bought it for my sister right away. she did the same ran right out to get it. love it always gonna get it.</li>
            <li> Great deal, awesome scent; delivered on time</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume!! It smells so good. Not really a fan of beyonce and I was a little disappointed when I got this as a christmas gift until i OPENED IT! I immediately fell in love. This is a great scent! Makes me feel and smell sexy and I can&#x27;t wait to re- up since my last bottle is down to its last drop</li>
            <li> Great price! Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and smells awesome and had to come here to purchase. Its very seductive. Love it when my girlfriend put it on.</li>
            <li> This is a very warm and fruity fragrance, and I absolutely love it. For those who have been disappointed by how short-lived the strength of this fragrance is, I am with you. This is because it is an eau de toilette version, which is always weaker than an eau de parfum version. If Heat Rush is ever offered in an eau de parfum mixture, I&#x27;ll be buying it by the gallon. It smells downright delectable, but, yes, it does fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  Long lasting.  Not too fruity, not too soapy, not too spicy.  Great fresh and exotic blend of everything.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very potent, this is the real deal. Bought this as a gift and she loved it. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife after she was bombarded by a sales woman in a large store. The smell is intoxicating. Talk about an instant turn on! Beyonce may be hot yet this fragrance will put your female companion on fire.</li>
            <li> Smells a little watered down... I dont care if its on sale, that doesnt mean you guys can sell watered down product</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and it&#x27;s one that you can wear everyday if you choose. I wore it almost everyday. It shipped on time and the size can last awhile. I&#x27;m a moderate user (so I don&#x27;t put on too much but just enough). Price was reasonable which is why I ended up buying it. Well, it was cheaper than in stores I found out. All in all its a good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A big bottle of perfume at a great price! Smells beautiful as well</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she really seemed to like it.  WEars it a lot.  It had just the right amount of spice but not over whelming.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smell I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my sister.  Received it promptly, super fast shipment! Could not he happier wih this purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this Beyonce Heat!!!! I have ordered a total of 4 bottles of it already &amp; love it soooo much!!!! Even some family got on here &amp; bought me some for Christmas! LOVE THEM ALL!! VERY quick delivery &amp; packaged very safely! Will definitely be ordering more in future! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The scent is gorgeous, very floral and always get lots of compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this perfume and I absolutely loved finding it at this price. Thank you! It was very fast shipping and it came so much sooner then expected. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> i gifted to my wife she loved it .  It not to strong but in a way is stay around for more time  I liked it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance. Nothing better than picking her up a nice large bottle at a great price! She&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my perfume and the  speedy services!</li>
            <li> This did not meet my expectations. It is too soft. I can nearly smell it.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this perfume, but I will not be purchasing it again. The scent disappeared within about 45 minutes after application. I&#x27;ve gone through so much of the bottle, even at the Amazon price, it is not worth the trouble. The scent is very nice, but what is the point if no one can smell it.</li>
            <li> If Beyonce&#x27;s Heat wasn&#x27;t your style, you&#x27;re in luck; Heat Rush will knock your socks off. Its amazingly feminine with floral and fruit notes making it sweet, fun, and \\&quot;girlie\\&quot;. Heat Rush is more of a spring, summer and daytime fragrance, compared to it&#x27;s sister fragrance Heat which is a spicy evening wear. The top notes(blood, orange, cherry, and passionfruit) linger longer then expected and really overpower the floral (orchid, mango blossom, orange hibiscus) middle notes as well as the soft subtle musky (teak, honey, ambergris, white musks) bottom notes. This is a Eau de Toilette so it does not last quite as long as hoped for and does NOT come as a Eau de Parfum (which I would really love more!). I personally wear this to work and use 3 sprays its last about 4 - 6 hours and I normally spray 1 more time on lunch to give it a \\&quot;pick me up.\\&quot; ll around the product doesn&#x27;t seem very orginal; the fragrance has simple note pattern citrus top note, floral middle, and then musky bottom. The bottle shape is the same as its \\&quot;older sister\\&quot; Heat but is a softer orange color almost like a sunset. Obviously the name Heat Rush....ehhh. I really enjoy this fragrance its fun, sexy, girlie, delicous, almost candy like. I get compliments all the time wearing it. If your a \\&quot;Fragrance Freak\\&quot; and love to collect you probably already have frrangrances that are very simiar and this wont amaze you. If your looking for something fun and simple without strength I highly recommend it. Overall I give Beyonce Heat Rush a A-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Bobbie</li>
            <li> I brought this perfume for my wife fo vslentines day.. she had no idea it was coming ...when it arrived i was the king of the world.. she loved the fragrance and she loved the suprise factor... item was just as described, and it makes her smell beautiful</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last....</li>
            <li> I smiles beautiful! This smiles like nothing I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love this sent. I find that a lot of scents today are similar but this was a shocking surprise.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the smell and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount of perfume you get. I bought a bottle at Wal-Mart in a sample case writhe a small thing of lotion and it was the same price but can&#x27;t with 3 times less perfume</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me Beyonce Heat Rush in a little sample bottle and I fell in love. It has a great citrus scent, very mild, doesn&#x27;t last long (a sad fact) but it smells absolutely delicious! I ordered the 3.4oz. and it arrived in record time. This scent is just so great!! Highly recommended for anyone who likes fruity scents. The only two things I can say negatively about the product are 1) it is an eu de toilette and therefore does not last as long as a perfume, and 2) the bottle is such a shape that it makes spraying it a little difficult! Can&#x27;t explain it unless you&#x27;re holding the bottle, but so what, you have to use two hands to apply it. (unless my hands are just that small!) Overall, a wonderful fragrance. :)</li>
            <li> Found this as a sample but every store I went to was out, so glad I found it here. :)</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and the price was the greatest</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price, great product, delivered quick!</li>
            <li> The perfume is a very sensual scent!! I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Suprised by how much I loved this scent. I was looking for tropical summer scent. I sampled this, left the store and kept falling more in love, so jumped on Amazon and bought it! Doesn&#x27;t last at all though. Not surprised as this sells at Walmart etc.and none of the cheap celebrity scents last, but I still like the smell very much. Quite cheap too, so you don&#x27;t have to feel bad re-applying it</li>
            <li> What an intoxicating scent! My boyfriend absolutely loves it. Great price for this size bottle as well! Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> i wish i could of found this size at this low price earlier. this perfume smells great, very soft and thats good nobody wants a loud smell all the time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 bottles since I first bought it :) that&#x27;s all I have to say! Yummyy smell!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome &amp; Great value......!!!</li>
            <li> I had the smaller bottle, which recently ran out. I came on here looking for a better price and definitely found it. The bottle I received was HUGE, lol. It will probably last for the next 2 years, as I switch was perfumes I wear on a day-to-day basis.</li>
            <li> THE best deal I have found on Amazon to date!! One ounce at local retailers is more than what I paid for more than three ounces! And of course it smells lovely, my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering another one!!!</li>
            <li> I think this was a excellent value, and it smells great. If you want the smell to last longer buy the body lotion and spray this on after you put on the lotion, will last twice as long.</li>
            <li> It is not stong smelling like perfume should be it is like body spray at the most , seems like it was watered down or something . I guess that explains the price , bummed out .</li>
            <li> Soft smell not strong. I get compliments all day when i wear it. It turns the men on when you wear it!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this fragrance to anyone...it is my favorite!!! It came quickly and I am thinking of ordering several more. My daughter and I just love it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! Very nice scent and not over powering..:</li>
            <li> this is my favorite fragrance it never fails to deliver time and time again i will always purchase this fragrance</li>
            <li> I always get lots of compliments when I wear this.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  The product was just as it should be.  The fragrance is fruity and clean, and doesn&#x27;t have an old lady smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! One of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> Given as a Christmas gift, great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells very good but my wife says that it doesn&#x27;t last long !!</li>
            <li> I do not like Beyonce&#x27;s fragrances but this one is out of sight.  If you like Halle Berry and Brittany Spears collections this one is a good compliment to any collection.</li>
            <li> smells sweet and fruity, also doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like most fragrances do</li>
            <li> my mother in law loved it! perfect buy!</li>
            <li> it smell great, great price, the smell stay all day!! i give it as a gift and she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is very fruity. I love the smell and it lasts for a very decent amount of time. Super fast shipping and authentic packaging at a very nice discounted price! Will be buying again in the future! :)</li>
            <li> My wife loved this perfume and i love it when my wife is happy. For the most part women will be happy with any name branded perfumes. Dont buy them at a truck stop and they will be happy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the perfume.  Shipping was very quick.  Dottie Indiana</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance... And  great purchase</li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing. I think it is much better than the original Heat. It is subtly sweet and fruity, but not at all an immature scent. It has light notes of nectarine. The only con is that it is a little too light of a fragrance, and I end up re-applying it a few times throughout the day. However, it&#x27;s not a big problem for me since it is not too expensive, and I like re-applying it because I&#x27;m a smoker. Also, the orange color on the bottom gets rubbed off in my purse, and the nice metal piece under the spray piece came off pretty quickly. These are just aesthetical issues, so I still think that it deserves a 4.5 or 5. The bottle arrived with no issues, in the box, plastic wrap unbroken. I highly recommend buying from this seller because I have a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Tatally i used to this perfume for3years butthis perfume is finished in korea. I just do love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li> I own at least 4 of beyonce&#x27;s perfumes. this one is probably one of my favorites. The fragrance lasts all day and i&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments when wearing this one.</li>
            <li> I love love love this scent. Next to Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy love this is my go to daytime perfume. And I&#x27;m not usually a celebrity perfume fan, only because I&#x27;m not a fan of these celebrities&#x27; music/work lol. It&#x27;s very fruity/sweet and it lasts a long time on me. The only thing that is annoying and worth mentioning is the shape of the bottle. It&#x27;s really hard to hold with one hand and spray at the same time. The base is too wide to hold and the top is too short to hold as well. Maybe it&#x27;s me and my hands are not big enough but I have to use both hands to use this perfume. Am I crazy? please tell me I&#x27;m not the only one with this problem... Anyways nice perfume, affordable too</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I have worn it for about 2 years and always receive compliments.</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is so sweet. I fall in love all over again every time I smell it. Its been almost 5 hours and I still can smell it! Great Job Beyonce! I love you for a reason.</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS HUGE!!! I bought two of them because I didn&#x27;t realize how big they would be. I think they sent me ones that were too big... and now I&#x27;ll have them for another 15 years!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a Christmas present so not sure how it smells or if she will like it. Came in a box so it wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I like this, however Beyonce&#x27;s other Heat smells better, but this one wasn&#x27;t bad. I will get the Beyonce heat again but not this one, it&#x27;s ok though</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love it! The bottle is just an odd shape.</li>
            <li> Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the really heat fragrance</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. We tried to buy it once in a trip and did not find it. Found now in Amazon. Have a good use of it.</li>
            <li> Beyonce has knocked it out of the ballpark.&lt;br /&gt;i gave it hands down a 5 because the smell is so sweet and yet soft and yet strong.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this perfume to every friend I have as well as order loads more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing perfume :)</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on how I smell when I wear this! I will most definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she thought it stinks. I only gave it 2 stars because she thought it was funny.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new perfume so I tried this one because the reviews seem pretty good. I was disappointed with the smell the shape everything, it wasn&#x27;t good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried wearing it a couple times thinking I would get use to it and start to like it but nope I started to dislike it more, especially when my boyfriend said I smell like the elderly people he transports at work (he is an emt) he wasn&#x27;t trying to be mean but he was completely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shape of it was horrible because it is very on comfortable to hold, it kept slipping out my hand. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume after having bought the spritz at CVS. I have to say that the scent is too weak and it does not last. Though it smells good for a few seconds, it isn&#x27;t worth the money spent in the long haul.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great love it !</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t think I would receive the size indicated in the description because it&#x27;s cheaper than the  .5 oz bottle I used to buy in the stores, but was shocked that it is indeed the real deal. I received it quickly and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Plus, of course it smells great.</li>
            <li> cheap perfume - it does NOT last 10 mins i can&#x27;t believe the unbelievable carelessness put into making this perfume - I don&#x27;t even want a refund - i want to keep it as a reminder not to buy any more Celebrity perfumes - Beyonce should have a better perfume -</li>
            <li> My girlfriends favorite!!! I love the scent too</li>
            <li> Smells very good and lasts long. Every time I smell it on my wife, I&#x27;m ready to test if she&#x27;s edible.</li>
            <li> My only problem is I wish it would last longer .</li>
            <li> got this perfume for my girlfriend. i love the smell</li>
            <li> Omg, this perfume is amazing.. At first I was hesitant to buy it after reading other reviews saying that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long but I would wear a blouse twice before washing it especially when new and the heat rush scent is everlasting lol.. Beyonce you never failed me with this perfume 👏</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and it went over well. Thought maybe it was a bit on the younger women side but older ladies liked the scent. (gift got passed around and some tried the scent).</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy and I am happy with it. It is sweet smelling. I smell oranges and I smell some musk or incense or amber. There is something in this perfume that keeps it from being disgusting sweet and generic smelling. For me this perfume is perfect for Spring and Summer. You have to love fruity gourmand perfumes to be able to like this. I need a back up bottle of this!</li>
            <li> love the smell of this great for date nights or laying in bed with significate other. very sexy!</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this .smells amazing !</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! awesome price!!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a very beautiful scent to too strong just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this perfume! It literally turns me on. I&#x27;ll be ordering a truck-delivery asap! Jk but seriously, if you&#x27;ve smelled it and already use it, you can find great savings here! Get yourself something you deserve!</li>
            <li> The order of perfume shipped on time. It smells great. I got it for an amazing price. Best buy of my life!</li>
            <li> This perfume was ok, but it has more of an alcohol smell than the one I purchased at the department store.</li>
            <li> another fantastic fragrance by beyonce summertime fragrance. it lights up any environment that you&#x27;re in people will stop just smell you</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!!! Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5th star is because the scent does not last all day while at work.</li>
            <li> Came in a box and it smells lovely</li>
            <li> There must be pheromones in here or something because this perfume just smells so seductively beautiful!  Such a comforting and warm smell too! And when you spray it on it will stay there for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume sooo much.</li>
            <li> Luv it!! Got it on time!!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the same scent like the first bottle I bought, the scent didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Beyonce Heat is one thing. But Heat Rush is so fantastic. Just love the smell of this perfume. Loved the price too.</li>
            <li> Smells really good but does not stay on for as long as i would like. Other than that, i love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I love the sweet smell that it has and I always get complements that I smell good. Shipping was really fast too, I ordered this on a Friday and received it on a Tuesday. I loved the price to... GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this perfume for my sister-in-law for Christmas, however I love the scent so much I decided to keep it! I ended up ordering a different Beyonce perfume for her. The scent lasts all day and I have received several compliments on it. My husband says it&#x27;s his favorite perfume on me.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and after it was discontinued at macy&#x27;s i looked for it in perfume stores but they were 60 and here it is 20 and the exact same smell</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I was shocked at how amazing this smelled with the reviews that it had but I think that I found my new perfume to wear and I think that babe will love it also :) Thank you Beyonce!</li>
            <li> Very soft and sensual,  value for money. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent!!  HOWEVER I&#x27;m not entirely sure this is the real deal.  The sample that i sprayed on myself in the department store lasted ALL DAY.  This barely lasts an hour. I do plan on repurchasing this, only at the department store!!  On a plus side, I did receive this lightening fast!!</li>
            <li> Great product,  quick service</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife and it actually smells good like a mixture between fruit and baby powered lol but when she puts it on at night for bed oooo weee</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li> Smelled this perfume at a local department store and loved it - purchased it and discovered that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long (not even on clothes) but can&#x27;t expect much from perfume that costs less than $25!</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of Beyonce or celebrity perfumes generally, but I gave this one a try out of general curiosity. I smelled it and bought it immediately afterwards. It smells a bit like J-Lo&#x27;s glow Miami I think? The scent is gorgeous. It&#x27;s sweet and musky. It&#x27;s really true what they say in the description that it comes alive on your skin and aura and is very sensual. It transports you immediately in your mind to a wild, tropical setting. I can&#x27;t stop smelling it. If I were a guy I would say it reminds me of sex. Pity, like someone said before that it doesn&#x27;t last very long and you need to keep re-spraying probably every two hours or so. Also, not too keen on the packaging. Comes across as very cheap. The 100ml bottle is very cumbersome to hold and spray and not particularly elegant or sleek in my opinion considering the big bucks behind it. Still, that didn&#x27;t stop me from ordering the shower gel and lotion gift set afterwards.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing.  It smells awesome and lasts all day!  The price for the quantity and quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> This smells awesome, as other reviewers have stated, but the strength does wear off. It&#x27;s an EDT and does not come in EDP, which is unfortunate, as it is one of the best smelling perfumes I&#x27;ve come across. It smells warm and summery; like sweet grapefruits. I apply a LOT of sprays of this to get it to last throughout the day, but it does die down in strength very quickly. A few hours in and you can barely smell it unless you sniff your skin directly, so it&#x27;d be a great perfume for cozying up next to someone, but not necessarily for leaving a trail of freshness or leaving an impression when you walk into a room.</li>
            <li> Beyonce heat-rush is my go to perfume for a night out on the town! Always get a lot of compliments when I wear it:)</li>
            <li> Great price and love the smell! Bottle almost gone and would buy again!! Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the fragrance! The only fault I have is it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She totally loves this perfume. She said it&#x27;s one of her favorites. I like it too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but for some reason the scent is a little of from the previous one bought.</li>
            <li> Good price, shipping ontime</li>
            <li> I love the price! I love this fragrance! This is the only fragrance on this line I like. It was a great deal especially since it was hard to find at a good price at stores in my area. The only thing that I was not pleased with was there was no tracking information for the shipment, other than that, I am pleased. Plus, I was given a coupon for 10% off a reorder of the same products, I love discounts!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this perfume in a few places, so I was pleased to finally find it here and at a good price! Its one of my daily perfumes! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I buy stuff from amazon for my mom sometimes. This was a good gift for her. She was happy with it</li>
            <li> The perfume smells very nice. I will buy this products and other Beyonc&amp;eacute;  perfumes in the future. The box was very secure for delivery.</li>
            <li> This particular smell does not match my chemistry, I&#x27;m sure someone in the world might like this. Too pungent</li>
            <li> I received the original perfume with a super secure emballage.. Fast shipping, thumbs up 👌</li>
            <li> second time buying it for my wife, she loves it</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long and to me this smell different than the one I tried in the store. I do like the fragrance but you do have to reapply it after an hour or two. I have never bought this fragrance before. I would tell other about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, not because of the bottle, the packaging or Beyonce, but because it smells so intoxicatingly GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True Story:  I was in an elevator at work, the door opened, a young girl walked in and BAM.  (WOW!  What IS that SMELL?!)  Now I never openly ask strangers what they are wearing, especially 20 something girls (I am mid 40&#x27;s), but I couldn&#x27;t resist and asked at great risk of being labeled creepy.  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Beyonce!  But be sure to get the ORANGE one, not the RED one&amp;#34; she said.  I went right to my desk, hopped on Amazon and bought it.  It smells even better on my wife and she loves it too!  Score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never cared much for Beyonce and I don&#x27;t know what she smells like.  But if she smells like THIS, I&#x27;ve suddenly become her BIGGEST fan.  :-)</li>
            <li> For me, Heat Rush is very mediocre. Nothing special at all. Smells like a cheap floral perfume with a splash of orange soda thrown on top, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I was hoping for more citrus so this left me disappointed, but it&#x27;s definitely still wearable.</li>
            <li> You smell like a chemistry lab when you wear this perfume. Mislead by the description and reviews. Will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Personally, this fragrance is horrible. I have a good smell for scents and this one failed!!!!! I put this out with the garbage to be picked up the next morning. Well sometimes you get what you pay for but this was not worth anything.</li>
            <li> This product is watered down.. The real heat rush smells stronger and lasts longer but hey You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to others and would definitely buy from seller again. Item was shipped quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It smells divine, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent.  I like this one over Beyonce Heat.  I definitely buy this scent again and again.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest bottle of Beyoncé I&#x27;ve owned. It came at such a great price I was shocked! I know where to buy it again at! Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I was able to get a big bottle at a great price. It came in its original box also!!! Absolutely Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> this product is a deal its the real thing the bigg botttle an very cheap compare to stores ! thanks love it</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff!!  Its scent lasts for a long time. I feel very sassy with it on. I love it.  this is my fourth bottle!!</li>
            <li> Amazing.....huge bottle, excellent price and arrived when they said it would.....</li>
            <li> the bottle is nice but the perfume itself  does not last!!!</li>
            <li> Produce quickly delivered and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love it, definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Personal taste thing- the scent is strong and began to annoy me. But the product itself was in great condition and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Heavenly perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered by seeing the reviews and it&#x27;s definitely true.i feel so confident wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies out there must try this.</li>
    </ol>
