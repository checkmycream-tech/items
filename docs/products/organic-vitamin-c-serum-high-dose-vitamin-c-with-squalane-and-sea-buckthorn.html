            <li>and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>(LOVE the powered sunblock too!)</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I make my own combination skin care cream and use this with shae butter and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>the oil is of great quality and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick</li>
            <li>The nice orange smell was my favorite part about this product before I spilled it.</li>
            <li>love love love, my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li>This liquid seems to be more of a moisturizer than a of rejuvination skin cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the C serum and have been using it for almost a year now.</li>
            <li>The thing I love the most about queen bee products are the ingredients.</li>
            <li>the C-Serum actually felt great!  </li>
            <li>I love all of Queen Bee&#x27;s products, but the C Serum is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>I have seen a substantial difference in the texture of my skin plus I love how it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my face feel, and the smell is so uplifting and healing.  </li>
            <li>and i love how this product smells.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and</li>
            <li>That being said, I have had nothing but wonderful results from using this product and I plan on using it in the future.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and the smell ..</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a velvety feel:)</li>
            <li>I use it at night and it seems to make my skin look better in the morning .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about this product is it smells good.</li>
            <li>Coupled with the Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum and a regular moisturizer, it is perfect!</li>
            <li>If I would have known this before I put an orange serum that came in a clear glass vial on my face it would have saved me a great deal of pain, frustration, and embarrassment</li>
            <li>It lasts forever, which was unexpected and really great.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh orangey scent of this oil!</li>
            <li>This goes on easily, and even though it is an oil, it soaks into your skin after an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C products MUST be stored in a container that does not allow exposure to light.</li>
            <li>my eyes, nose and throat experienced swelling after trying several nightly applications.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is supposed to be healthy for your skin, right?</li>
            <li>I plan to order more and consistently.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, which is a HUGE plus, but the real work is done when this serum makes skin softer and much more even-toned.</li>
            <li>and it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I have not found a product more pure than this.</li>
            <li>Love it so much that&#x27;s probably my 10th purchase</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave your face greasy.</li>
            <li>My face is soothed by this serum, and I will definitely want to get more :)</li>
            <li>They are organic and safe- even for my 3 year old son!</li>
            <li>My lips feel more plump and soft since I have been using this product.  </li>
            <li>Oil is easily absorbed without leaving skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients in this product, smells good, soft on the skin and seems to be working well in tandem with the Micro Needle Roller.</li>
            <li>It probably would have been wonderful -- the first few days it felt good on my skin, but being an oil in a small glass vial, on day 4 it slipped from my hands and broke all over the floor.  </li>
            <li>i love all natural products , that have no toxins.</li>
            <li>burn right up.</li>
            <li>and they are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely NOTHING for your skin at all!</li>
            <li>This product cost me a lot more than the initial price listed.</li>
            <li>It is always great after years of trying other peoples products and spending lots of money to finally find a product that works.</li>
            <li>First and foremost vitamin C is a very tricky vitamin to compound into skincare products.</li>
            <li>I use the Queen bee Tamanu Oil and the Shea Butter as well and they are both very soothing.</li>
            <li>After using this serum, much of that disappeared.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the ingredients listed, which seem to be a promising blend, are included and at what levels.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>all thanks to C serum.</li>
            <li>It s light enough to use all over my face.</li>
            <li>but it was really small.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is a Queen Bee problem, just not user friendly for me personally.</li>
            <li>I will need to use it a bit longer to be sure it has the results I want, but so far I can report that it healed my dry lips from a sun</li>
            <li>This product not only smells good, I&#x27;ve noticed less wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin which has normal skin on my cheeks and forehead, but very oily and acne prone on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>Especially on your face, I am glad I purchased it and will continue to buy it because I see a big difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them all.</li>
            <li>Ladies and gents I highly recommend this C Serum.</li>
            <li>but they have faded drastically and my skin is smoother and very clear now.  </li>
            <li>(The kind that makes your skin raw, red and peeling).  </li>
            <li>So I must give a huge thumbs down on this product.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box of items I ordered and found this tiny bottle I thought that it was a cute little sample.  </li>
            <li>After receiving my product and trying it for 2 days which resulted in a severe breakout which required a doctors visit and antibiotics to clear up</li>
            <li>I have been battling adult acne for four years</li>
            <li>It is a natural product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals - which is a MUST for me.</li>
            <li>I did not get any breakouts from applying this, but existing acne has not been fixed either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure that I will use it in only a few applications.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in four years I did not suffer a single break out!</li>
            <li>I am in the process of getting my skin back to normal after a chemical lotion treatment from my dermatologist..</li>
            <li>The bottle is relatively small, but as long as you notice the size and purchase anyway (as in my case), then it is okay as a moisture adding liquid.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C loses potency especially fast.</li>
            <li>The oiliness others report doesn&#x27;t bother me because I used it at night or early in the morning and only around the eyes and mouth, and now on the lips.</li>
            <li>I have dry areas on my face especially in the winter months and this really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I use it over RX retinol and it keeps my skin from being as irritated and dry as it normally would be.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Serum C since my trip and my skin has felt softer smoother  and has a glow that it had been lacking I live in Phoenix and skin takes a beating with our \\&quot;dry heat\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>If this really did have vitamin C in it, then it should be in a dark tinted vile.</li>
            <li>This product did not make my skin oily, but made it soft and balanced despite the acne meds I have to use that dry my nose</li>
            <li>I just used a little amount everyday but walahhh My acne scar slowly disperd and not many acne came back and my skin is more smooth and soft.</li>

            <li> I just used a little amount everyday but walahhh My acne scar slowly disperd and not many acne came back and my skin is more smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used many expensive skin care products from GM Colin, Jane Iredale Chanel and found that the Queen Bee line was superior to those expensive ones I had used in the past  </li>
            <li> To prevent nutrient loss to oxidation, this product should have been shipped in a dark vial, rather than clear.</li>
            <li> Because it is a product made from natural sources, I would advise you to test a small amount on your skin, but you should do that with anything you put on your skin.</li>
            <li> A darker bottle would be helpful, but if you put it in a dark cabinet it should last.</li>
            <li> Whenever I need moisture for dry skin, this is my go-to!</li>
            <li> (I work in the view of public and had to be seen with huge, painful cysts and boils all over my face).</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time since you only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I had expected</li>
            <li> Sea Buckthorn oil contains the nutrients vitamin C, E, and essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> I also love the Queen Bee&#x27;s Face Paste and Vitamin Serum and the Exfoliating Fig Wash, but seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of their products</li>
            <li> I have used other C Serum products like Perricone&#x27;s C and Queen Bee&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum blows away Perricone&#x27;s and other competitors products.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to visit Pagosa Springs Co this past August I was introduced to the Queen Bee product line after having a facial provided by the Queen Bee herself Lynne Killey .</li>
            <li> Other c serum products have a dropper that I was used to before.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying other products.</li>
            <li> After using a Korean towel in the shower to scrub away all the dead skin, I would dry off and apply the C Serum and Vitamin E oil (from gelcaps) nightly.</li>
            <li> One week later, the scars are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> After pregnancy I had some dark spots (chloasma) remaining.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works and will probably not e able to tell since there are only a couple of drops.  </li>
            <li> and I started using this 4 days before my typical breakouts.</li>
            <li> at first I was so disappointed because I though this is gonna be bigger</li>
            <li> A little sticky for a while.</li>
            <li> A little firmer.</li>
            <li> also I think My skin get a little bet whiter or brighter.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this because not much has helped with my age spots.  </li>

            <li> This liquid seems to be more of a moisturizer than a of rejuvination skin cream.  The bottle is relatively small, but as long as you notice the size and purchase anyway (as in my case), then it is okay as a moisture adding liquid.  A little sticky for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been using C-Serums for several years, but none compare to Queen Bee&#x27;s C-Serum. I picked up the product while visiting Pagosa Springs, Co. this August (2011).  I have been using it for one month now and I can see the difference in my skin.  My skin has been exposed to a lot of sun and this serum is helping my complexion by diminishing the brown spots. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face will look like two months from now. Please buy some and try it.  I promise you will love IT!!!! Plus it&#x27;s soooooo affordable!!</li>
            <li> I should have just rubbed water on my face. This does absolutely NOTHING for your skin at all! I mean NOTHING!</li>
            <li> I seem to notice a difference.  I believe one may need to use regularly.  I plan to order more and consistently.</li>
            <li> I love the C serum and have been using it for almost a year now. It lasts for a long time since you only have to use a small amount. I have dry areas on my face especially in the winter months and this really does the trick. It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave your face greasy. The thing I love the most about queen bee products are the ingredients. They are organic and safe- even for my 3 year old son! (LOVE the powered sunblock too!)</li>
            <li> This serum is really a great product. I am in the process of getting my skin back to normal after a chemical lotion treatment from my dermatologist.. (The kind that makes your skin raw, red and peeling).  I was hesitant to put anything on my face for fear it would burn.. but the C-Serum actually felt great!  No stinging on application, in the morning the redness had subsided quite a bit and my skin wasn&#x27;t as tender to he touch.  I use the Queen bee Tamanu Oil and the Shea Butter as well and they are both very soothing. I highly recommend them all. GREAT PRODUCTS!!!</li>
            <li> I love all of Queen Bee&#x27;s products, but the C Serum is one of my favorites. I put it on my lips, around my mouth and around my eye area every morning.  My lips feel more plump and soft since I have been using this product.  And it tastes great, too.  I also love the Queen Bee&#x27;s Face Paste and Vitamin Serum and the Exfoliating Fig Wash, but seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of their products and they are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box of items I ordered and found this tiny bottle I thought that it was a cute little sample.  It was the actual product in the tiniest bottle I have ever seen!  I am not sure if it works and will probably not e able to tell since there are only a couple of drops.  I am sure that I will use it in only a few applications.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, which is a HUGE plus, but the real work is done when this serum makes skin softer and much more even-toned. After pregnancy I had some dark spots (chloasma) remaining. After using this serum, much of that disappeared. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product. Oil is easily absorbed without leaving skin feeling oily.  Doesn&#x27;t cause pore to clog therefore no breakouts whatsoever from this product.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s packaging and content appear mom-pop shop, garage-basement quality, without quality control or safety and efficacy testing, possibly. I wonder if the ingredients listed, which seem to be a promising blend, are included and at what levels. I will finish the contents as a PM moisturizer and trust in the labelling and then update this review if necessary.</li>
            <li> For the price, the bottle is a bit small.&lt;br /&gt;But the oil is of great quality and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen Bee&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for a year now and I even have my husband using this product and we love it. I have seen a substantial difference in the texture of my skin plus I love how it makes my skin glow. I have used other C Serum products like Perricone&#x27;s C and Queen Bee&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum blows away Perricone&#x27;s and other competitors products. It is always great after years of trying other peoples products and spending lots of money to finally find a product that works. Ladies and gents I highly recommend this C Serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews from everyone else and it was totally worth it! I have been battling adult acne for four years and I started using this 4 days before my typical breakouts. This is the first time in four years I did not suffer a single break out! Coupled with the Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum and a regular moisturizer, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Not at all what I had expected</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel, and the smell is so uplifting and healing.  My face is soothed by this serum, and I will definitely want to get more :)</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels when i put this vitamin c serum on and i love how this product smells.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to visit Pagosa Springs Co this past August I was introduced to the Queen Bee product line after having a facial provided by the Queen Bee herself Lynne Killey . I have used many expensive skin care products from GM Colin, Jane Iredale Chanel and found that the Queen Bee line was superior to those expensive ones I had used in the past  I have been using the Serum C since my trip and my skin has felt softer smoother  and has a glow that it had been lacking I live in Phoenix and skin takes a beating with our \\&quot;dry heat\\&quot;  I love this product and the best part being it is affordable Try it you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> After receiving my product and trying it for 2 days which resulted in a severe breakout which required a doctors visit and antibiotics to clear up I began researching vitamin c products and what is involved in processing them. Vitamin C is supposed to be healthy for your skin, right? First and foremost vitamin C is a very tricky vitamin to compound into skincare products. Never buy or use a product that has taken on a yellow or orangish tint.  This is a sign that the vitamin C has oxidized which can cause adverse reactions which I unfortunately learned the hard way.  Also when considering purchasing a vitamin C skin care product, consider the packaging.  Vitamin C products MUST be stored in a container that does not allow exposure to light. This causes oxidation.  If I would have known this before I put an orange serum that came in a clear glass vial on my face it would have saved me a great deal of pain, frustration, and embarrassment (I work in the view of public and had to be seen with huge, painful cysts and boils all over my face). So I must give a huge thumbs down on this product. This product cost me a lot more than the initial price listed.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a friend...I immediately fell in love with it! It lasts forever, which was unexpected and really great. I have combination skin which has normal skin on my cheeks and forehead, but very oily and acne prone on my nose and chin. This product did not make my skin oily, but made it soft and balanced despite the acne meds I have to use that dry my nose/chin out severely. It is a natural product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals - which is a MUST for me. Because it is a product made from natural sources, I would advise you to test a small amount on your skin, but you should do that with anything you put on your skin. That being said, I have had nothing but wonderful results from using this product and I plan on using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it so much that&#x27;s probably my 10th purchase I simply can&#x27;t get enough.. Love the feel and the smell .. It gives my skin a velvety feel:)</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients in this product, smells good, soft on the skin and seems to be working well in tandem with the Micro Needle Roller.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this product is it smells good. If this really did have vitamin C in it, then it should be in a dark tinted vile.</li>
            <li> it is oily, which I should have known based on the description. Also, the packaging is not practical. I drop the bottle and spill the entire content. Other c serum products have a dropper that I was used to before. The nice orange smell was my favorite part about this product before I spilled it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 2 days now and I can already feel a difference. My skin looks brighter. I still have brown spots which I am hoping those will reduce over time. I did not get any breakouts from applying this, but existing acne has not been fixed either.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the price .vs. quantity. The bottle is TINY! I wish it came in a dropper bottle, since its so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li> It helped a tiny bit with moisturizing, but overall, I won&#x27;t be buying it again. It didn&#x27;t help in the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh orangey scent of this oil! Whenever I need moisture for dry skin, this is my go-to!</li>
            <li> This product has vitamin C and is good for the skin.  Especially on your face, I am glad I purchased it and will continue to buy it because I see a big difference in my face.  Makes me look youthful, come on ladies give it a try, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and it seems to make my skin look better in the morning . A little firmer.</li>
            <li> I had several scars on my chest from scratching mosquito bites. After using a Korean towel in the shower to scrub away all the dead skin, I would dry off and apply the C Serum and Vitamin E oil (from gelcaps) nightly. One week later, the scars are hardly noticeable. I will probably buy again to concoct this miracle worker!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this because not much has helped with my age spots.  It took a few weeks but they have faded drastically and my skin is smoother and very clear now.  It came with a $15 gift card for their website and I bought a bigger bottle and will continue to use this product.  Great find.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product.  I noticed a difference in my skin within a couple of days.  Even my doctor asked what I was using.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily, and even though it is an oil, it soaks into your skin after an hour or so.  It is very moisturizing and smoothing.  I use it over RX retinol and it keeps my skin from being as irritated and dry as it normally would be. I really like it.</li>
            <li> It probably would have been wonderful -- the first few days it felt good on my skin, but being an oil in a small glass vial, on day 4 it slipped from my hands and broke all over the floor.  I was very sad.  I can&#x27;t say this is a Queen Bee problem, just not user friendly for me personally.</li>
            <li> I wanted a verifiable vitamin c serum that is not made with corn (and therefore GMO based) so I decided to try this. I have used vitamin C serum for years as a spot treatment for developing wrinkles and sagging skin.  This is wonderful. I will need to use it a bit longer to be sure it has the results I want, but so far I can report that it healed my dry lips from a sun burn right up. Nothing else was working and I read you can put it on your lips I decided to try it. The oiliness others report doesn&#x27;t bother me because I used it at night or early in the morning and only around the eyes and mouth, and now on the lips. I doubt the gold color comes from oxidized C as all three ingredients are gold in color. A darker bottle would be helpful, but if you put it in a dark cabinet it should last. I have not found a product more pure than this. I am looking forward to trying other products.</li>
            <li> love love love, my skin is glowing! all thanks to C serum. i love all natural products , that have no toxins.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for your face!I really enjoyed this wonderful item and I am very pleased with the results and it smells great!!!! I would recommend this to EVERYONE!!!</li>
            <li> Used this stuff like forever &amp; i never noticed any difference &amp; i have pics.</li>
            <li> Sea Buckthorn oil contains the nutrients vitamin C, E, and essential fatty acids. To prevent nutrient loss to oxidation, this product should have been shipped in a dark vial, rather than clear. Vitamin C loses potency especially fast. At the very least, you should store vitamin C serums in your fridge. Sadly, this product caused my allergies to act up - my eyes, nose and throat experienced swelling after trying several nightly applications. If you are sensitive to herbs or fragrances, be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> I make my own combination skin care cream and use this with shae butter and coconut oil. I love it. Smells great. feels good</li>
            <li> This product not only smells good, I&#x27;ve noticed less wrinkles around my eyes. It s light enough to use all over my face.</li>
            <li> at first I was so disappointed because I though this is gonna be bigger but it was really small.&lt;br /&gt;so I just used a little amount everyday but walahhh My acne scar slowly disperd and not many acne came back and my skin is more smooth and soft. also I think My skin get a little bet whiter or brighter. I used at night before I sleep I don&#x27;t used at morning even if I put a SPF moisturizer.</li>
