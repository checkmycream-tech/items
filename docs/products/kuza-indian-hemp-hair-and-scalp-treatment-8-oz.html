            <li>The Indian Hemp scalp treatment is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great service</li>
            <li>Since using this I&#x27;ve seen my hair become thicker, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not the best product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>In addition the product smells good.</li>
            <li>and it is a good moisturizer and also helps my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Chi has a good hair sheen spray.     </li>
            <li>My hair is growing so good...</li>
            <li>The rest of the ingredients were quite good.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this grease and its the biggest and cheapest around PLUS</li>
            <li>Good for pressing though.</li>
            <li>Loved the product, will purchase it again</li>
            <li>It works great to keep my hair healthy with a nice shine and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>great styling tool and smells great perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with this produt</li>
            <li>However, one day on the pretense of trying to &amp;#34;be more legit whilst permitting my own hair,&amp;#34; (lol)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have this product!</li>
            <li>(warm oil for 30 minutes followed by dishwashing liquid followed by conditioner seems to be the solution).</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>However, it acts as a wonderful buffer to natural elements for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and pleasant, it would not interfere with a perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light.</li>
            <li>I have to mix it with coconut oil to make it more liquid-like before using it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best grease for for afro american hair</li>
            <li>(everything starts with the scalp when it comes to healthy hair).  </li>
            <li>I would give it more stars if I could</li>
            <li>seems to be better</li>
            <li>My nails, cuticles and hand skin have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Love it , the smell, it works and it is another buy for it.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair &amp; scalp smooth, healthy and itch free!</li>
            <li>Great product for all natural hair.  </li>
            <li>if you have fine hair, you may need something with a lighter consistency.</li>
            <li>Received item quickly with no problems!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Softee brand for a couple years, but I gotta say that Kuza is much better and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>smells and feels great large size lasts along time  used it to not my hair lock it up  thanks dan</li>
            <li>the so called &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; .... if used lightly.</li>
            <li>There is nothing light about this product.</li>
            <li>Indian Hemp is a great scalp conditioner and it is the only one I use.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product, have been using Indian Hemp for the past 6years with good results.</li>
            <li>Silicon Mix Intensive Leave in Hair Shine and Conditioner, and good deep conditioner:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near as firm as beeswax but for the purpose of locking dreads it works excellently and has a better smell than jams or beeswax.</li>
            <li>Super delivery.</li>
            <li>I started using this in conjunction with a hemp shampoo and I am dandruff free for the the first time ever in forever.</li>
            <li>I know most of you natural girls will probably scoff at the fact that I texturize my hair and wonder at me perming it myself.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed all over again with how well it covered and smoothly slathered on in thick quantities to protect my sensitive scalp from the harshness of the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It helps it to stay healthy, soft and will help in hair growth,.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it on its&#x27; own.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever I have 10 fingernails the same length and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>And you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I think that Kuza is best for very coarse dry hair &amp; scalp &amp; not for someone who has soft fine hair</li>
            <li>ONE RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER</li>
            <li>The product smells great ;but, is no more than hair grease.</li>
            <li>It just makes my head feel natural and healthy, holds very well and definitely worth it ,&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is a good look to use this when you are trying to rock a straitened hair look because it will weigh hair down and make it look greasy and unattractive.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even mind the wooden bits in the grease because most of them wash out as well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it combined it with mango-lime gel.</li>
            <li>&amp; I had long healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Despite the &#x27;100% Indian Hemp&#x27; advertising in large print on the container, and the product description on Amazon&#x27;s website (\\&quot;Kuza Indian Hemp is a feather light blend of Indian Hemp, jojoba, Avocado and other light botanical</li>
            <li>oils\\&quot;), this product contains many other ingredients (the first of which is petroleum, followed by paraffin wax), including Propyl Paraben and Isopropyl Palmitate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main ingredients are petrolatum and paraffin wax, not stuff you want to put in your hair!</li>
            <li>It is great for very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; really applies here.</li>
            <li>Rubbing about a dime sized amount through your scalp and hair is really all you need.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li>I had to use Dawn, and really work at washing it off my hands.</li>
            <li>Regarding the &#x27;may contain&#x27; caveat, are we really supposed to believe that a company doesn&#x27;t know, with certainty, what they are putting in their products?  </li>
            <li>I have a big head, one jar was enough to slather the about 160 dreadlocks on top of my head with more to spare for the next time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this hair and scalp oil.</li>
            <li>Texturizing my hair is my personal preference, I love natural hair</li>
            <li>But, all over the head or scalp is only ok if you are rocking a natural look, dreads, braids, or hair pulled up (esp.</li>
            <li>for scalp) that you wash out before styling or use in a small quantity to ends, edges, or fly aways to get extra protection and control over them.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is simply incredible, and with its extreme thick consistency, nothing can penetrate it once its on your scalp, it protects scalp from anything while simultaneously moisturizing it, melts out of your hair when you take a hot shower and penetrates, coats and conditions every strand in the process.  </li>
            <li>But, let me assure you, I have been doing it since I was 13, and my hair is waist length, thick, and very healthy</li>
            <li>Any more than that will just weigh your hair down and leave it looking greasy.</li>
            <li>So I just went back to Blue Magic &amp; Dax for winter&amp; my hair is thriving.</li>
            <li>think it is important to realize this is a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product (as the label indicates) that offers additional help for people who need to protect and moisturize their scalp for the overall health of their hair</li>
            <li>I have not used it on my hair or facial skin as the first two ingredients are Petroleum and Parrafin which would make my scalp, hair and face greasy.</li>
            <li>To me it is not really an every day product, but it is fine to use as a deep conditioning tool (esp.</li>
            <li>(my sister is natural), but I&#x27;m lazy, I live in a humid environment, its easier with the texturizer, and my hair holds up fine getting the kitty texturizer (just three times a year)</li>
            <li>Thought product was all natural.</li>
            <li>It works wonders in my daughters hair and makes it grow fast and keeps it moist constantly.</li>
            <li>I love this on my head it helps out alot especially for my dried scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm and solid enough to be used on its&#x27; own, just be sure to have the entire head blow dried (not with a hand blow dryer).</li>
            <li>A little is too little and a little more is much too much!!!     </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I use it to base my scalp before touching up my kitty texturizer-</li>
            <li>Still, I stubbornly continued to use the pink crap, and I kind of forgot about how much better Indian Hemp was at basing and protecting my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent the past 3 hours trying to get it out of my hair and am now sitting here with some warm oil in it after finding other horror stories on the internet where people say it messed up their hair for months</li>
            <li>I have curly, frizzy dry hair and this stuff makes it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>While this is OK, for me it is too much petroleum jelly and the little flakes of hemp can be a little odd when they dry and fall out.</li>
            <li>It is too thick &amp; heavy for my soft fine African American hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> smells and feels great large size lasts along time  used it to not my hair lock it up  thanks dan</li>
            <li> I use this product on my dry hair the second day after I have washed it. It smooths out all the frizzy ends giving my hair great shine. It is great for very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since february 2009. I could not get rid of the sporisis on my scalp even with the dermatologist prescription. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my scalp ist retored, NO MORE itchings. In addition the product smells good. The only set back is that it is not light and it makes hair look yellowish. I have to mix it with coconut oil to make it more liquid-like before using it. Nevertheless, I love it!!!!!  LoLo  Maryland</li>
            <li> The term \\&quot;A little goes a long way\\&quot; really applies here. Rubbing about a dime sized amount through your scalp and hair is really all you need. Any more than that will just weigh your hair down and leave it looking greasy. Since using this I&#x27;ve seen my hair become thicker, which is amazing!</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a product from native americans but realized that it was from India. Yet, the picture on the front is of Africa. It is false advertising because Indian people aren&#x27;t from Africa. The company is based in Connecticut?</li>
            <li> Shipped fast! Same quality like I expected from a retail store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  Now that my husband has tried it, he also loves it!  Leaves hair &amp; scalp smooth, healthy and itch free!</li>
            <li> This is the best grease for for afro american hair u can buy, great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy dry hair and this stuff makes it shiny and soft. Would recommend to anyone battling dryness... If you have fne hair,use very little, but either way, this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> great styling tool and smells great perfect for short hair. I am using it as a styling gel.</li>
            <li> I use this for scalp treatment before wrapping my hair at night. I do not distribute this through my entire hair because it is heavy and can make your hair sticky. I have very dry hair and it is a good moisturizer and also helps my itchy scalp. It has a great smell. Other products in my hair regimen: Argan Oil shampoo &amp; conditioner. Ojon hair detangler and Ojon restorative hair treatment. Chi has a good hair sheen spray.     For monthly or biweekly hair treatment: Great leave in conditioner: Silicon Mix Intensive Leave in Hair Shine and Conditioner, and good deep conditioner: \\&quot;HALKA BABA de CARACOL Intensive Treatment\\&quot;(used inDominican Hair shops- deep condition every 2 weeks and it works great).</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so good... all I know is you break you buy. Buy it now and it&#x27;s a must</li>
            <li> I have to agree with Yana Jaffe&#x27;s review. I got some of this by recommendation for protection against dry winter hair &amp; found it&#x27;s NOT for my hair !  It is too thick &amp; heavy for my soft fine African American hair. I only used a little &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t wash out of my hair. I had to mix baking soda with my WEN shampoo &amp; wash my hair twice, use Neutrogena clarifying shampoo twice, use Dax shampoo &amp; end with an apple cider vinegar rinse ONE RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER til I got that stuff out of my hair. I had to find out what on earth was in  Kuza that caused this problem because my hair doesn&#x27;t mind petrolatum, lanolin &amp; mineral oil ..the so called &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; .... if used lightly. My mom used products with those ingredients when I was a kid  &amp; I had long healthy hair. However,the second ingredient in this Kuza stuff is PARAFFIN WAX  !! That&#x27;s the same stuff they make candles with ! No wonder I couldn&#x27;t get it out. I&#x27;d never used anything with that ingredient. The rest of the ingredients were quite good. So I just went back to Blue Magic &amp; Dax for winter&amp; my hair is thriving.No paraffin wax in either of them.  I think that Kuza is best for very coarse dry hair &amp; scalp &amp; not for someone who has soft fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this on my head it helps out alot especially for my dried scalp. Received item quickly with no problems!</li>
            <li> Thought product was all natural. One of the products listed is petroleum. Not what I expected. The product smells great ;but, is no more than hair grease.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I use it to base my scalp before touching up my kitty texturizer- lol.  I know most of you natural girls will probably scoff at the fact that I texturize my hair and wonder at me perming it myself.  But, let me assure you, I have been doing it since I was 13, and my hair is waist length, thick, and very healthy (I&#x27;m careful and I  know what I&#x27;m doing).  Texturizing my hair is my personal preference, I love natural hair (my sister is natural), but I&#x27;m lazy, I live in a humid environment, its easier with the texturizer, and my hair holds up fine getting the kitty texturizer (just three times a year) so long as I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Indian Hemp when I saw it at the store one day.  I had my texturizer in my basket and needed a base for my scalp, so, I decided to give this product a go (best decision of my life).  I used it for years.  However, one day on the pretense of trying to &amp;#34;be more legit whilst permitting my own hair,&amp;#34; (lol) I switched from using Indian Hemp (for about a yrs. time) to using this thinner pink grease specifically labeled as a &amp;#34;protective base for scalp.&amp;#34;  BIG MISTAKE, After a while, I started to notice my scalp was not as healthy and that the base did not protect my scalp nearly as well as the Indian Hemp.  Still, I stubbornly continued to use the pink crap, and I kind of forgot about how much better Indian Hemp was at basing and protecting my scalp.  I puzzled over the lack of health and luster in my hair until I saw the forgotten Indian Hemp jar in my drawer and realized not using Indian Hemp might be my problem.  So, I switched back and as I started using Indian Hemp again, I wondered why I ever stopped using this product.  I was impressed all over again with how well it covered and smoothly slathered on in thick quantities to protect my sensitive scalp from the harshness of the chemicals.  I felt like it immediately transformation the health of my scalp and hair (everything starts with the scalp when it comes to healthy hair).  I will never try anything other than this to base or condition my scalp again.  This stuff is simply incredible, and with its extreme thick consistency, nothing can penetrate it once its on your scalp, it protects scalp from anything while simultaneously moisturizing it, melts out of your hair when you take a hot shower and penetrates, coats and conditions every strand in the process.  I don&#x27;t even mind the wooden bits in the grease because most of them wash out as well.  It also smells great (like coconuts).  It leaves my hair conditioned and shiny.  I even started using it under a heating cap occasionally for extra scalp conditioning.  I will never use anything else!!! Its a great product, esp. for the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is important to realize this is a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product (as the label indicates) that offers additional help for people who need to protect and moisturize their scalp for the overall health of their hair (everything starts with the scalp).  I don&#x27;t think it is a good look to use this when you are trying to rock a straitened hair look because it will weigh hair down and make it look greasy and unattractive.  To me it is not really an every day product, but it is fine to use as a deep conditioning tool (esp. for scalp) that you wash out before styling or use in a small quantity to ends, edges, or fly aways to get extra protection and control over them.  But, all over the head or scalp is only ok if you are rocking a natural look, dreads, braids, or hair pulled up (esp. in winter where you need extra protection from dryness).  It is very thick grease, so if you have fine hair, you may need something with a lighter consistency.</li>
            <li> The hair  meet my expectation with  the  quality along  with the smell of it. It  helps my hair to grow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have this product! I&#x27;ve been using the Softee brand for a couple years, but I gotta say that Kuza is much better and it shipped quickly. Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> This product is so greasy that it does not distribute evenly and if you use a lot then you&#x27;re totally greasy.  A little is too little and a little more is much too much!!!     I have curly dry hair and it does nothing for it... what a waste of money - PO!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this grease and its the biggest and cheapest around PLUS this product is HARD to find. It works wonders in my daughters hair and makes it grow fast and keeps it moist constantly. I would give it more stars if I could</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product, have been using Indian Hemp for the past 6years with good results.</li>
            <li> BEST VITAMIN FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> The description is misleading. There is nothing light about this product. It is a mix of petroleum jelly and wax. I had to use Dawn, and really work at washing it off my hands. Can&#x27;t imagine how you would get it out of your hair. 100% Disappointment!</li>
            <li> great product.  packaged well. works as stated.</li>
            <li> Despite the &#x27;100% Indian Hemp&#x27; advertising in large print on the container, and the product description on Amazon&#x27;s website (\\&quot;Kuza Indian Hemp is a feather light blend of Indian Hemp, jojoba, Avocado and other light botanical oils\\&quot;), this product contains many other ingredients (the first of which is petroleum, followed by paraffin wax), including Propyl Paraben and Isopropyl Palmitate.  It also lists under &#x27;may contain&#x27; the following: D&amp;C Yellow #11 (CI 47000), D&amp;C Red #17 (CI 26100), and D&amp;C Green #6 (CI61565).  Regarding the &#x27;may contain&#x27; caveat, are we really supposed to believe that a company doesn&#x27;t know, with certainty, what they are putting in their products?  Even when they are toxic dyes?</li>
            <li> It just makes my head feel natural and healthy, holds very well and definitely worth it ,&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Hemp(very natural)&lt;br /&gt;styles hair well&lt;br /&gt;Mood seems to be better</li>
            <li> This stuff is HORRIBLE. It&#x27;s main ingredients are petrolatum and paraffin wax, not stuff you want to put in your hair! Petrolatum is basically vaseline and what it does is coat the outside of your hair and make it sticky and stiff. If you want to see what that feels like, take some vaseline and put it on your hair and you&#x27;ll see - it&#x27;s not pleasant! I&#x27;ve spent the past 3 hours trying to get it out of my hair and am now sitting here with some warm oil in it after finding other horror stories on the internet where people say it messed up their hair for months (warm oil for 30 minutes followed by dishwashing liquid followed by conditioner seems to be the solution). So yeah, do NOT buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I&#x27;m very pleased with this produt&lt;br /&gt;two thumbs up I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product for all natural hair.  It helps it to stay healthy, soft and will help in hair growth,.</li>
            <li> At first touch it feels slightly slimy and greasy yet it can be firm. It&#x27;s nowhere near as firm as beeswax but for the purpose of locking dreads it works excellently and has a better smell than jams or beeswax. At least to me it does. The first time I used it combined it with mango-lime gel. The second time I used it on its&#x27; own. It&#x27;s firm and solid enough to be used on its&#x27; own, just be sure to have the entire head blow dried (not with a hand blow dryer). I have a big head, one jar was enough to slather the about 160 dreadlocks on top of my head with more to spare for the next time. I twist every two weeks, I can get away with buying two jars for one month and one jar for the next.</li>
            <li> I keep this next to my TV recliner. I rub it into my nails and the back of my hands. My nails, cuticles and hand skin have never looked better. I have very thin flat nails that always peel in layers and tear easily. Since rubbing this into my nails they are long and solid, no flaky layers, no tearing on the sides. For the first time ever I have 10 fingernails the same length and very healthy looking. I rub it into my cuticles and the skin on the back of my hands and now they are soft and supple After a shower where I have buffed my feet with a pedicure stone I rub this into my feet and put on a pair of thick peds for the night, in the morning my feet like a newborn baby&#x27;s. I have not used it on my hair or facial skin as the first two ingredients are Petroleum and Parrafin which would make my scalp, hair and face greasy. However, it acts as a wonderful buffer to natural elements for my hands and feet. I will be ordering this again- for hands &amp; feet. I cannot speak on scalp or hair treatment. The scent is mild and pleasant, it would not interfere with a perfume.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp, so I have tried numerous products to help with that problem. While this is OK, for me it is too much petroleum jelly and the little flakes of hemp can be a little odd when they dry and fall out. Not terrible but not the best product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Got this for $1.00 at a retail store. Good for pressing though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have battled dandruff using the typical brands for 20 years. I started using this in conjunction with a hemp shampoo and I am dandruff free for the the first time ever in forever.</li>
            <li> The Indian Hemp scalp treatment is a great product. It has a nice fragrant smell. And you get your moneys worth. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> makes the scalp feel that the hemp feels tingle and is working on my scalp.</li>
            <li> expensive but does help the hair</li>
            <li> Loved the product, will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years in my hair.  It works great to keep my hair healthy with a nice shine and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Super delivery. I absolutely adore this hair and scalp oil. It has different herbs and minerals in it, some of which you can see when you open the jar. It&#x27;s also very light. Indian Hemp is a great scalp conditioner and it is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> Love it , the smell, it works and it is another buy for it.</li>
            <li> not 100% hemp, artificial dyes and the whole nine</li>
            <li> Great product! Great service</li>
