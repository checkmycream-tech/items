            <li>Within days of posting my unsatisfactory review of the product I received a courteous reply from the management.</li>
            <li>The skin graft on my scalp is also healing nicely.</li>
            <li>The scar on my neck is supple and is fading nicely.  </li>
            <li>I liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best thing I have ever put on my face.</li>
            <li>It applies nicely and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE November 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this close to two years now, and it has kept my neck nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE November 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this close to two years now, and it has kept my neck nice.</li>
            <li>Actually, it kind of makes me want to eat it now.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I are both using it and loving it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no scent which is nice.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that Era Organics and their products have given me my life back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customer service is the best of all in my whole life, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best if your skin is that, to not put on too much.</li>
            <li>Soothes my skin when I rub it on, feels so nice, not like any lotion I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer,</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get the kind of result that the reviews are showing up here.</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like a whipped foundation primer.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on nicely</li>
            <li>I could give my honest thoughts on it.</li>
            <li>is that it kind of smells like clay play-doh.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product and for the money, you get a generous amount of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now going to sit on my desk as a hand moisturizer since it smells nice like chocolate.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m loving this tub of beauty.  </li>
            <li>I even got a compliment from a co-worker yesterday, that my skin looks really nice...</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>Texture is nice.</li>
            <li>I like putting a nice organic mixture on my face rather than all those chemicals out there.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>Really leaves your skin looking beautifully balanced and feeling refreshed!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have a product that gives you the moisture your skin needs without feeling like it&#x27;ll be</li>
            <li>Everything I hope to convey is under my own volition and in the desire</li>
            <li>And it smells nice , a bit like chocolate.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, great proactive - and friendly - communication from the seller.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product highly and am very happy with the company as well.  </li>
            <li>But this moisturizer is wonderful; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to issue a full refund.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to issue a full refund.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this is perfect!  </li>
            <li>I like the feel of this lotion, however it smells very strong-</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell the best in my opinion, and sadly so far it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized!</li>
            <li>Very nice cream that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Plus with all the great reviews, thought it was worth the shot.</li>
            <li>They used the best products that they could find and made natural remedies that worked for centuries.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m having great success with it</li>
            <li>This is the best face moisturizer for sensitive skin I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best cream I have ever used on my face!  </li>
            <li>Cream feels good on face and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is awesome!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good consistency and goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>…Era Organics has done their research combining the best, naturally occurring ingredients in one power-packed product.</li>
            <li>light, good quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is by far the best face moisturizer I have come across.</li>
            <li>and so far none have had any real great results.  </li>
            <li>Good quantity, good price, positive results.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin creasy!</li>
            <li>which is surprising because it&#x27;s a rich product.</li>
            <li>I love all the wonderful natural ingredients that it has.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can put my foundation on top of it and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>At first it seems great...</li>
            <li>Plus it was filled to the very top.</li>
            <li>The chocolate smell of this face cream, which is not bad; the texture is a bit creamy, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to report that this is not the case with e-raorganics complete face lotion!!!!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very light and does not cause problems with my hair.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and leaves a velvety texture.</li>
            <li>(she has eczema) and my face looks as if I drank jars of water and feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>so this is very important to me.</li>
            <li>It is also very light.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and leave a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate me at all, which is great, and the smell is just pleasant enough to be used at day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also a huge jug and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>sexy at all),</li>
            <li>So I dowithout make up most days...</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If anyone has comments, I would love to hear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do want to give it a shot, I&#x27;d love to hear how it works for you.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I tried it tonight as my night cream &amp; it feels lovely on my skin</li>
            <li>Once more, I want to note how responsive the company was when I asked questions about the cream.  </li>
            <li>So grateful to be able to use my hand.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I bought another type of moisturizer that had more (8 oz) and even had better reviews than this one</li>
            <li>but I like this one a lot more.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It has great ingredients and is a quality product, but it is not doing much for the eczema on my eyelid.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a bummer for me since it seems to be helping many others.</li>
            <li>So since my sleep is too precious to me</li>
            <li>and they love it</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Customer service was excellent and it felt more personal.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance on this cream...</li>

            <li>: Still love this stuff after 2 months of every day use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Era Organics and am excited to see more products from them!</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be so satisfied</li>
            <li>Maybe it will get better in time?</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but it has improved my complexion, skin tone, reduced the redness and has made my face look better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helping sooth my skin, keep it hydrated and is helping me not have as many pimples.</li>
            <li>most often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Go with either one, whichever is priced better or has a discount promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream has kept another flare away and the skin is able to heal some, even lighten up some.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>I only use it on my face because I use hemp seed oil on my body, but this stuff is great!</li>

            <li>I love the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>and I will definetly try more of their products.</li>
            <li>am a steadfast believer in it and want all their products!</li>
            <li>Holds most of its moisture through out the day.</li>
            <li>Cute packaging.</li>
            <li>It does wonders for my skin :)</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ll admit I need a better skin care system, I do not like feeling stuff on my face.</li>
            <li>Once the cream absorbs, you will not be able to feel anything</li>
            <li>I really love this one.</li>
            <li>My favorite is a drop or two Lemongrass.</li>
            <li>I mix it in with the top layer of the jar..</li>
            <li>I love putting it on before my makeup.</li>
            <li>Since I am into antiaging creams for the most part I don&#x27;t use this every day.  </li>
            <li>Would buy more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i I am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>but I feel completely safe using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the texture of this</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many lotions and potions (literally).</li>
            <li>I guess I will give it more time to see.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more product in the container when I received it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  The owner emailed me promptly after my OK review and provided a full-refund.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the concept and ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, my patchy skin is getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was not going to write this review because there are so many already</li>
            <li>Love that it has no odor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I received the moisturizer a week ago and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it for the Florida weather</li>
            <li>cream works a lot better for my scars than my acne.</li>
            <li>I still have a bit more, hopefully it will run out by the end of February.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this product</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have never before written a review, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most people who struggle with oily skin sometimes tend to over exfoliate or not moisturize like they should.</li>
            <li>This has happened to me so many times.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice texture and you can tell it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have this item especially since it is eco friendly!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>

            <li>It absorbs quickly and has a mild pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It seductively looks like a beautiful dessert or cream cheese, and it&#x27;s soft and glides on easily.</li>

            <li>Best cream I have found in a very long time!</li>

            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>I noticed its texture is very whip-like and does absorb very easily!</li>
            <li>most importantly-</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, acne prone and sensitive skin, and this has been great to my face.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT and thank you all so much for making such a wonderful and organic product and just being an overall great company!</li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>To my the cream smells like sunscreen (not the nice coconutty  kind), but it&#x27;s a smell I can easily live with.</li>
            <li>Great for those with sensitive skin and who can&#x27;t have strong scents/perfumes.</li>
            <li>I liked it right away.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product!</li>
            <li>I purchased this due to all the awesome reviews.</li>
            <li>My husband took the time to research other products and Era Organics had the best reviews, so he bought it for me.  </li>
            <li>So that along with the other list of healing ingredients makes this moisturizer one of the best we have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very, very mild scent, which I like.  </li>
            <li>It is a very mild cream</li>
            <li>The printing on the jar wears off too easily.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbs into skin without greasy residue.</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that it will come in a tube and not in a jar so it won&#x27;t get contaminated easily.</li>
            <li>Therefore I strongly recommend Era Organics&#x27; products to you if you are reading this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their skin in good repair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in love with this moisturizer and this is the deal right here!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very smooth and soaks in quickly .  </li>
            <li>This is great for sensitivities and the faint chocolate aroma and creamy texture are very successful moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer, so clean and light.</li>
            <li>but I just wiped it off &amp; it was fine.</li>
            <li>; product, I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
            <li>cause this one works fine.</li>
            <li>Hope this fine company comes out with a vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li>The fine print says &amp;#34;made with organic ingredients.&amp;#34; Titanium dioxide is NOT ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, but I can&#x27;t stand to put it on my face and smell like that</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use, I am seeing a difference in my skin, pores and fine lines seem</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li>Extraordinary!</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and has a lovely cocoa scent that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>This product has quickly become a go-to favorite.</li>
            <li>Looks like a great product I just have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So great to find good affordable products with only natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>We had a hard time finding a healthy alternative to the lotions out there loaded with chemicals and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>They did make a huge difference on my face.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I&#x27;m a huge fan of the ingredients used because they&#x27;re all organic--</li>
            <li>The container is huge</li>
            <li>It was out of a fresh batch and much better quality.</li>
            <li>Face is smooth  </li>
            <li>I actually miss the smell when I don&#x27;t use it, lol.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is light, blends in well.&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li>The price point is great and you get a whopping 4 oz which will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again only because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but there is a light cocoa butter smell that is comforting.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so smooth.</li>
            <li>It slides on smoothly and absorbs into my skin within 1 minute.</li>
            <li>At night, when I have more time, I warm it with my hands and gently massage it into my skin until absorbed--</li>
            <li>I think this moisturizer works great, and actually feels like it is helping improve my skin.</li>
            <li>Equally important, I do not experience the stinging.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li>This cream is doing great things for my complexion in only two days!</li>
            <li>Great customer service and personal treatment.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and not greasy, but well-moisturized.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>so the application of it on the skin goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>For pimples, I would recommend the Neutrgena Oil Free Acne Stress Control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using it on my face, and it works great for that, as well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Fabulous creme.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally find something that works for my daughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a couple of light fingertip taps of this cream, those lines disappeared.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the smell (like chocolate) but most of all, I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and</li>
            <li>No break outs, just baby smooth feeling when put on face.</li>
            <li>Before giving my feedback, I want to genuinely thank the manufacturers of Era Organics.</li>
            <li>This face cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>that it goes on smooth with no greasy or watery feel.</li>
            <li>Oh and I like that it&#x27;s made with organic ingredients and that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream was smooth and just melted into my skin.</li>
            <li>It is free of the chemicals and compounds you can&#x27;t pronounce and serve as preservatives for mass produced garbage clogging the shelves and your pores.</li>
            <li>It goes on feeling so light that you do not even feel it there.</li>
            <li>I have recently made some changes to my diet and skin care routine and this moisturizer has been a great addition.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I am now taking a holistic approach to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and quenched.</li>
            <li>I really just love this and now know that I won&#x27;t be able to be without it...</li>
            <li>I feel good using this  because of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin look more healthy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to know that it&#x27;s organic with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>So I see a lot of mixed reviews; mostly good which I&#x27;m glad to see because this cream has done wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>really hope more people try this stuff, so the company would be able to lower the price.</li>
            <li>I am very happy about my purchase and in fact it acts as a perfect base for my sunscreen too.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I feel good about using Era Organics because it&#x27;s natural and organic.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I ordered one and loved it so much I ordered another one right away.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t add much to what these other folks have said in their reviews, and I don&#x27;t know what people in Hollywood and Beverly Hills are using on their faces, but this stuff is both awesome and affordable to most .</li>
            <li>This is not the type of moisturizer that just stays on top of the skin; my skin seems to soak it right up.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in, not greasy at all, and even better, it isn&#x27;t perfumed.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both enjoy the rich light weight face cream.</li>
            <li>Accutane really messes your lips up!!!</li>
            <li>used this the first day I received it and said &amp;#34;NO WAY&#x27;&#x27; !!.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice moisturizer but did not cure my rosacea (red cheeks).</li>
            <li>It is definitely thicker than I thought, but it&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li>Very effective cream, will definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that it readily gets absorbed into my skin rather than leaving an oily or greasy-like residue that gets on my clothes!!</li>
            <li>After consistent use, my skin feels smooth, hydrated and in much better condition.</li>
            <li>The mild scent dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li>Looks like she found a  new favorite face cream!</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and the composition includes significant percentages of the important additives to really make good on their claims.</li>
            <li>Just amazing as it sinks right into your skin and no greasy or oily feeling, smells great too, definitely worth splurging on or a camu camu infused moisturizer after using their serum</li>
            <li>This is such a perfectly amazing product!</li>
            <li>Thank you ERA Organics for creating such an amazing moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure of it at first, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure years of using chemicals to treat my acne contributed to the problem.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, you&#x27;l be pleased.</li>
            <li>I felt the healthy difference in my skin after the first usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: been using this for almost 2 years now and still loving it!</li>
            <li>Non-greasy yet rich.</li>
            <li>I was able to see the difference since the first application.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what my diagnosis was.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product in July.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I literally just purchased and received this product and used for the first time today, so I am reviewing based on the immediate results (I will try and remember to post an updated review in a couple weeks).</li>
            <li>I am still using it though I haven&#x27;t seen significant result yet.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a cream, yes a rich mousse like cream.</li>
            <li>My skin on my face looks better the first day after I used it.  </li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the natural smell of the jar (which to me is fine by the way), then add your own scent.</li>
            <li>Btw, I use Apple cider vinegar as a toner, so anyone who wants to try that along with this moisturizer, I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, and my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my skin had a nice glow, one of my tests for a new night cream, it passed with flying colors.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer if you have dry, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Great for those who have dry faces but need something to moisturize their face without making it oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores are no longer clogged and I can walk free without foundation because my skin actually looks good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he will like the fact that is fragrance free and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It is so light and absorbs quickly with no sticky feel to it.</li>
            <li>To clean my hands</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better, is if your skin can tolerate it, you can add your own essential oil.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and evenly and absorbs quickly, but does not leave your skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>Its actually one of the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This cream hydrates the skin really well and is perfect for anyone with super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and is very hydrating and soothing on rough skin.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on then take it off with warm water and it leaves my skin very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The owner of this business is very nice, and clearly there are many customers who really like the product, so please know that this review reflects my own personal taste and my boyfriend&#x27;s, but might not represent yours.</li>
            <li>All natural and organic is a cherry on top !</li>
            <li>Nice, it makes my skin feel hydrated and soft without being greasy!</li>
            <li>Very smooth n dries reaaly fast</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it absorbs and I love that is made out of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girlie girl who&#x27;s bought a lot of creams in her life and this one is special.</li>
            <li>You just feel special putting it on.</li>
            <li>I broke out a tiny bit at first, but now my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>For beginners, it&#x27;s at a great price point, secondly, the cream is pretty dense</li>
            <li>and it seem that this has only good reviews..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work for others, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really want to thank all the staff at Era Organics for creating such a masterful product, it is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>So, if good customer service is a priority for you, definitely feel at ease with Era Oganics.</li>

            <li>it makes my skin feel cool.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face soft which is always nice.  </li>
            <li>I loved the results I received from the product like it evened out my skintone however it started to make me break out in these teeny tiny bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li>This one is really good and close to the type I use on a regular day...</li>
            <li>Not too soft like a liquid lotion kind of thing.</li>
            <li>I like this product, BUT my skin requires a more intense moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love how the cream really moisturizes without feeling caky or overbearing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all..</li>
            <li>Its not a really bad smell, but... it has a feeling of you know its there.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is super cool on my face; I like the ingredients and for a moisturizer Era Organics is a complete and effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>EWG.org rates it as a very low risk and most studies that show it as a risk are more talking about ingesting rather than applying to the skin.</li>

            <li>I bought this product, opened it, and quickly returned it.  </li>
            <li>The cream has a calming cocoa scent upon application that quickly dissipates so does not conflict with any fragrance you are wearing.  </li>
            <li>4oz goes quick at the beginning</li>
            <li>and I think the honey properties help you tremendously in healing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizer for an everyday kind of nice feeling product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so loyal to a moisturizer before, but this stuff is everything.</li>
            <li>and it has evened out some mild rosacea just in 3 days use.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin is clearer and feels more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love that it’s natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li>Feels creamy, but once applied it aborbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>foot surgery scars are quickly vanishing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and no greasy residue  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and mine had zero order  </li>
            <li>It feels luxurious going on, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is fragrance free and natural.  </li>
            <li>This product smells nutty and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>He likes it that much and his skin looks great (all kids skin does but considering all his medical and sensitivity issues we go through a lot from drying/redness/</li>
            <li>It was also a super quick fix for my boyfriend&#x27;s sunburns, heh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad for Amazon to provide multiple vendors for consumers who may have otherwise not been able to reach the masses.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and that aloe is the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>one last thing: there are waaaaaay to many ingredients, many of which I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>I love this cream and would highly recommend to all of my friends.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, feels right, last for hours, and I see a healthier look</li>
            <li>When I used this cream, my skin just absorbed it right away!  </li>
            <li>It sinks it quickly and leaves my skin feeling  AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Lovely, visible difference in my skin; moved from a wet climate to high desert and needed to change out my skin care products, this is an amazing face cream!  </li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate adult acne and this surprisingly did not cause my face to break out!</li>
            <li>it is very safe, being a low PH acidic</li>
            <li>it is very safe, being a low PH acidic</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with its (mostly) organic ingredients and it appears to be vegan other than the honey, which I can deal with but would prefer to do without.</li>
            <li>It seems to really moisturize my face without clogging pores or becoming too oily.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Although this product was not a good match for me, the purchase refund and sympathetic management has greatly enhanced my trust in this retailer.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, been using the normal store brands for years only to find nothing helps in the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s organic so keeping that in mind, it sure smells natural, but that&#x27;s definitely not a bad thing imo&lt;</li>
            <li>long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The friendliness and prompt communication from the company&#x27;s owner is also a refreshing change of pace from dealing with most vendors/larger companies.</li>
            <li>If you have back acne like I do, make sure you have a decent body wash or some kind of acne product body wash.</li>
            <li>Really excellent product, even better, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Really enjoying this moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li>My husband and my teen daughter tried this cream and they love it!</li>
            <li>The best facial product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m almost 30; the first time it hasn&#x27;t been an issue is since I started using this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li>I love all the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I was originally quite pleased yet sceptical due to having tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using this product because you will notice that your skin looks so much better!</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t any preservatives that we like because the more effective they are, the less we like them for the body (</li>
            <li>Great fluffy texture with a mild to almost non existent scent.  </li>
            <li>Very light on my face, no oily feeling even during the days I&#x27;m on direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth, not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer right here for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that I asked a question on another one of their products, and got several quick replies from real customers who all love their products too.</li>
            <li>Just the smell a little bit uncommon.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly on my face, but works great for the rest of your body (especially when it gets dry in the winter)!</li>
            <li>The combination of healthy organic ingredients, gentleness, many long term benefits at a very reasonable cost can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff, really.</li>
            <li>This could have been a great product if they didnt include a few ingredients that are known skin irritants.</li>
            <li>Have not received the jar yet but its great to know they have amazing customer service if something was wrong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to reorder Christina Moss Naturals Moisturizer which I got amazing results with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G0EJYFW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li>BTW the customer service is amazing and the way it used to be with companies - that no longer to seem to feel that is necessary; Era Organics does!</li>
            <li>, Geogard Ultra was found to be quite safe and is allowed to be used in natural and organic products.</li>

            <li>I love Natural Face Moisturizer Cream</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that it leaves my face baby soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying it, it&#x27;s worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Rarely have I dealt with a company who seems so concerned with customer service.</li>
            <li>Put a smile on my face when my husband brought the delivery in with the morning newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love how soft my face is after using this cream.</li>
            <li>So far I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Is it useful?</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s surely worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite thing so far though</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its nice, but I have found others in the same price range that I prefer and I will probably not order it again.</li>
            <li>It is certainly worth trying out.  </li>
            <li>This is a really, really nice facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Mostly on my forehead and around the brows near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the soft texture.</li>
            <li>It has no harsh exfoliating ingredients, and it&#x27;s thicker and creamier than most of the others, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true-hard fan of Korean cosmetics, but have decided to be more conscious about my make-up choices re: organic and/or non-harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>So far, I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>I love Doterra&#x27;s Clear Skin Foaming Cleanser and Spot Treatment, they&#x27;ve made a difference, but the acne persisted no matter what moisturizer I used, until now.  </li>
            <li>But in addition my nose was assailed by the smell---NOT a fresh scent like some people have claimed.</li>
            <li>smaller and skin tone is more smooth.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with the purchase and with the customer service.</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t notice it once the cream is absorbed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions for use are to apply a dime-sized amount and rub in until absorbed.</li>
            <li>and i love it so far.</li>
            <li>My skin was flawless as a child and even into my teens until stress and poor skin management set in.</li>
            <li>I have had success with coconut oil, honey masks, and oatmeal moisturizers but every 3 or 4 weeks the condition resurfaces.</li>
            <li>I have not given the product the test of time but thus far I love it.</li>
            <li>There is not a greasy feeling and the lotion is absorbed well.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is nice and white.</li>
            <li>E-raorganics complete has been a good product on my skin so far</li>
            <li>Received this yesterday and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much Era Organics!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d keep an eye out on which has a better price (with the discount, right now, it&#x27;s Era Organics, unless you buy the 8 oz jar by Wild Naturals, in which case you do get about 9 bucks o fa</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d keep an eye out on which has a better price (with the discount, right now, it&#x27;s Era Organics, unless you buy the 8 oz jar by Wild Naturals, in which case you do get about 9 bucks o fa</li>
            <li>which I recommend you to apply the cream right away if the wound is still fresh and you don&#x27;t want it to end up as a scar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin super oily.</li>
            <li>He tried the other jar and it felt really good on his skin.  </li>
            <li>non perfumed and seems to soak right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I might give it another shot on my face, but I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out right now.</li>
            <li>I  made the right choice.</li>
            <li>the price of this item is just right.</li>
            <li>It soaks right it and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>They did advertise about applying a dime size, which I do believe they are right.</li>
            <li>It just feels right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, and leaves your skin very silky smooth.</li>
            <li>To be fair, he also just started taking new Ayurvedic herbal supplements that help eczema (guduchi and amalaki), but it was the cream that brought instant relief and flexibility.</li>
            <li>That being said, this product is much better then the chemical ridden junk you find at swanky skin stores which charge you big money to rub large amounts of cheaply made chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li>the best part is I still have almost half a jar left.</li>
            <li>my skin looks and feels great night and day.for my Sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Era Organics cream (this and the eczema seem identical in smell, appearance, behavior, so I am reviewing both with the same time span/use) for about a month, and I can finally and honestly review it on how it worked on my latest eczema flare:&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients seem pretty stable, and the jar I opened a month ago is still fresh in look and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>moisturizer smells and feels great, not too heavy at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Era Organics is blessedly fragrance free which is good news for me because i&#x27;m allergic to some essential oils (especially lavender) that cause my skin and eyes to burn, swell, and turn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinda like smearing cool butter on my face haha.</li>
            <li>Looking for something organic, this stuff is great, goes on light and smooth, faint smell of honey which disappears after about 5 seconds on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they could add a nice pure essential oil to scent the product.</li>
            <li>The little bit of redness on my cheeks were no longer red, so I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Most lotion and cream just sits on top of your skin and makes you feel a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>I am very consistent on a certain moisturizer that I use and ALWAYS compare to that..</li>
            <li>But, what started happening is that instead of keeping my skin healthy and not dry, I basically get flakes all over my chin, mouth and nose...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>me, I actually love the smell - it smells like cocoa butter and fresh greek yogurt</li>
            <li>I really like the results so far, and if this is truly the one, I plan to give it as gifts to all my family and friends. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and my face isn&#x27;t getting dry, feels nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;The consistency, the lovely smell, the cost are all plus points as well, with the fact that it actually gets absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Non-GMO and organic as well.</li>
            <li>but, I can only image how great my entire body would feel using it.  </li>
            <li>It felt so good on my face and helped to soothe the dry spots that I was experiencing mainly around my eyes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, not heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that, much to my dismay, I can&#x27;t wear most sunblocks or I break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>It really does absorb quickly and keeps you hydrated.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment, placed the order on Wednesday and received it on Friday.  </li>
            <li>It is only the first night I know, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, you almost can&#x27;t apply too much, my face soaks up pretty quick any amount I throw on it.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, very much relieved.</li>
            <li>It has only quality products and makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very gentle</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>My wife is using the creme and she likes it very much</li>
            <li>Heals skin very very well.</li>
            <li>Did they use mass produced factory blends full of chemicals that make their skin feel a certain way or creates a certain smell?</li>
            <li>We both have sensitive skin and it has been fine.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t irritate my face in anyway and most importantly it doesn’t break me out like other creams with this consistency.</li>
            <li>After ten weeks of mostly daily use, my face is very soft and my complexion is as good as it can be, given that rosacea causes its own form of adult acne.</li>
            <li>The texture is rich, but it absorbs into your skin and makes it feel very soft.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is easily applied, quickly absorbed and creates a smooth supple quality to the skin not obtained from other products.</li>
            <li>It is a huge plus for me that this product is natural and unscented.</li>
            <li>Combination, mostly without problem, occasional bump once or twice a month&lt;</li>
            <li>First time user for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, my first concern is always the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that I know what the ingredients are, no scary sounding chemicals.</li>
            <li>It has this light soft texture to it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I decided to try their facial care products.  </li>
            <li>The product simply didn&#x27;t work for my skin but atleast it smells like chocolate! :)</li>
            <li>I love this cream and company, I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first</li>
            <li>In fact, I really dislike the sensation after using this Face Moisturizer - it creates a strange film that kind of pulls my skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>It is the first one I use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many rave reviews for this cream, but I can&#x27;t give the same testimonial.</li>
            <li>Light fluffy texture makes my skin feel soft, bright and radiant.</li>
            <li>It was an actual, personalized email from the seller, thanking me for my order with more info on the tracking.</li>
            <li>used it every 2 hours for the first couple weeks, then every 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Now, about a month later, my neck looks and feels much better</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know Tyler personally, but I&#x27;ve seen his comment replies here on Amazon, and he&#x27;s on top of customer complaints and</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know Tyler personally, but I&#x27;ve seen his comment replies here on Amazon, and he&#x27;s on top of customer complaints and</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream consistently in the mornings for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>My skin is more problematic now than when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it until it cleared up, and thought it would be ok to use after several days, but the same thing happened again, so I knew for sure</li>
            <li>My face actually looks more youthful.</li>
            <li>Feels like rubbing whipped butter on your face and keeps me very moisturized!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>That should give me several more months of using just one jar.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be buying more next</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it will do the same for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not want to go on prescription medication from the dermatologist and decided to try this cream first.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feel so soft and smooth  .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try one first and see.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a daily moisturizer! :)</li>
            <li>This is a lovely cream which absorbs deeply into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it, though, mixed with another more moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>The reason I continue to use it is that it does seem to help my problem with facial redness, which seems better since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.</li>
            <li>While using it my skin if anything got more irritated and red</li>
            <li>I also wanted to say that Era Organics has stellar customer service.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient is organic aloe, used for hundreds of years  to treat skin conditions and dryness.</li>
            <li>When I first got this, I enthusiastically smeared it all over my face and immediately gagged.</li>
            <li>I guess that technically can&#x27;t be organic, but it would be great to use the product if I plan on sitting in the sun for a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty neutral to</li>
            <li>We will most likely order again.</li>
            <li>After cycling through so many products (some that worked, others that didn&#x27;t), this actually did the job.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to, and I know I&#x27;m not putting a ton of chemicals into my body whenever I use it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing without being greasy!</li>
            <li>I have no idea what makes it feel so different, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I’m using all natural organic ingredients, free of main-stream cosmetic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I only need to put this on once a day, whereas the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past required 2 applications per day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not offensive, but it&#x27;s not what most people are accustomed to expect from personal care products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After three months of use, I still have some of my first jar left, and my acne is significantly better than before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and this product has helped me sooooooo much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the stuff I&#x27;ve been looking for my entire life.</li>
            <li>Thanks Era Organics!  </li>
            <li>It really did smell like chocolate!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li>it seems ok in helping with some facial redness.</li>
            <li>I have an occasional flare up around my monthly cycle, but a zinc supplement keeps that in check for the most part.</li>
            <li>Most organic moisturizers are this price or usually higher &amp; only come in a 2 oz container at the largest.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the product/ brand</li>
            <li>I usually find that moisturizers are either not moisturizing enough or make my foundation look to oily, however this has been perfect</li>
            <li>So glad to finally have found something that works!</li>
            <li>All in all, pretty bummed out.</li>
            <li>There was noticeable improvement on all areas within the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I have used many brand name facial creams but this is wonderful and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li>Who am I. African-American, light complexion, 62 years old, living in a city that has 4 seasons.</li>
            <li>Although, it works so much better on lighter scars and open wound;</li>
            <li>Its better than feeling a ton of pimples on my back.</li>
            <li>many times I applied the cream on a daily basis: 2-3</li>
            <li>;) .</li>
            <li>the cream isn&#x27;t greasy, feels good on the skin and per the labet there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super effective moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to write a rave review after reading all of the amazing ones here, however, I&#x27;m not so sure I can! :(</li>
            <li>My right arm, not so much...</li>
            <li>and although this product does not resemble la mer&#x27;s cream for me it satisfies what Im looking for in a cream, all natural organic ingredients is very important when you have sensitive skin like rosacea.</li>
            <li>so fine lines and anti-aging are a major concern.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for a moisturizer but it works great.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m seeing other products (am looking into Rose &amp; Pomegranate -</li>
            <li>It smells like cocoa and coconut but not as nice as I&#x27;ve smelt in other products.</li>
            <li>(I even tried straight, pure medical-grade Manuka honey, which was a sticky mess, but that stuff is good; and this cream contains some, which is good.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>My family who are used seeing my face flaky noticed the difference after a week of use, my face became soft, clear and more youthful, my in laws are now using it</li>
            <li>Not only has it replaced my current avocado night cream, but it feels so good, I&#x27;m using it during the day now too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>deep moisturizing and hydration--- a definite wise choice of products</li>
            <li>And mostly I LOVE that it&#x27;s made with only natural non-toxic ingredients!!!</li>
            <li>Really soaks right in fast and no oiliness.</li>
            <li>Sinks right in (if that&#x27;s what you like, you&#x27;ll love this),</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me because my skin still felt dry.</li>
            <li>First two days I use this item, the itch stop and my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, just love it.</li>
            <li>and after seeing all the positive reviews on this I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>i always keep it at bedroom wihout too hot and too much sunshine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got excessively sensitive skin and have literally tried more than 15 different varieties of facial moisturizers (including all the top brands).  </li>
            <li>again I used only these two products and it stalled the rash progression for the first two days, and over the next 3-4 days I could tell it was better!</li>
            <li>I have not used store brands in forever and refuse to go back to chemicals, but if even this highly rated pure and organic cream does not keep my skin healthy, what will?</li>
            <li>The smell is not pleasant, lol.</li>
            <li>Without a moisturizer, my skin is dry and crepey, but most moisturizers cause clogged pores, irritation or pimples (even at my age!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looked matte with a light glow but not dry or powdery at all.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin that leans more on the dry side towards the end of the night.</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my skin feel more dry, but I think a lot of these types of products tend to do so</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and COMPLETELY</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer dry and is more youthful.</li>
            <li>Not only is the scent very mild and comforting</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE July 2015:  I&#x27;ve been using this every single days, more than once a day, for six months already.</li>

            <li>Like any chemical reaction, this reaction requires certain conditions.</li>
            <li>Like any chemical reaction, this reaction requires certain conditions.</li>
            <li>I purchased this moisturizer because I have a fairly large skin graft on my scalp and it needs to be kept hydrated to facilitate healing and to minimize damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly try it.  </li>
            <li>As others have noted, the smell is a little unique, but not unpleasant and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and this cream is very soothing.</li>
            <li>but you will see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change I see are in the fine little cracks around my lips and on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>The texture was fine, but I definitely could not use it with the smell.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and my skin seems to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>There is emulsifying wax pretty high up on the ingredient list which causes my skin to get clogged.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good management.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to leave bad reviews, but I decided to do so, since the rest of the reviews seems way too appealing compared to what I experienced.  </li>
            <li>I review a lot of products, food, places, and whether good or bad I am always honest.</li>
            <li>They sent an email after I ordered, and another about a week later to ask if they could offer any assistance Must give them huge credit for taking care of their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never had huge zits, but had tiny bumps</li>
            <li>Once I put the cream on my face, it absorbed real quick and it won&#x27;t make my face greasy and heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know what to do anymore...</li>
            <li>so I tried gentle exfoliation thinking</li>
            <li>Politics and money dictate business so much and making money is the bottom line.</li>
            <li>Era Organics is very responsive with communication, does not evade the question, and promptly addresses issues.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really looked at the ingredients when I purchased it</li>
            <li>He then offered to not only refund my money, but asked if he could send me a jar for free.  </li>
            <li>My face used to look really oily as the day would go by</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a body lotion since it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make a difference I was still dreaming way too much and</li>
            <li>Oh, I should mention that I have very acne-prone combination skin.</li>
            <li>For my purposes, it didn&#x27;t work very well though.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I also really like using it on my dry/ cracked hands</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>it has really saved my skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too much to go around and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>They helped VERY little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>My neck is much, much, much improved.</li>
            <li>My neck is much, much, much improved.</li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight;</li>
            <li>so much so that I wondered if it would have any effect at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn’t take much at all to leave your face refreshed and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of this cream, not oily and really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>this moisturizers is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It calms and heals up my dermatitis really fast.</li>
            <li>The owner of the company is very involved &amp; will answer any questions.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like how it keeps my skin hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li>The smell really turned me off of this product.</li>
            <li>Expected more from this cream ( based on the reviews)</li>
            <li>the consistency helped blend my undereye foundation really well.</li>
            <li>and my face did not change much although it includes everything my skin need</li>
            <li>I bought this for her hoping it would be gentle on her skin</li>
            <li>and I were both very happ  with the product.</li>
            <li>I have very allergy prone skin</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very moist during the day and is not greasy</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely putrid.</li>
            <li>I really felt compelled to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This cream is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>HEALS AND CALMS MY VERY IRRITATED SKIN</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, and it isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>So I try lots of different lotions to see if any fit the criteria of keeping my hands moist</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Further, it is truly scent free,</li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks it up fast.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much brighter.</li>
            <li>(I have very oily skin)</li>
            <li>it keeps my face moisturized really well.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the face.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so much</li>
            <li>skin is so much</li>
            <li>stinging or burning the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Although the ingredients list is very challenging to read, Not sure all that is in it.</li>
            <li>This is a very think cream.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think the manuka ingredients in this product works very well for healing the skin.</li>
            <li>Now that it is the cold season, it&#x27;s the best time to test how well it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t really a fragrance to speak of, to my mind,  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like all the ingredients are very nourishing and hydrating.</li>
            <li>and I highly reccomend both of these products!</li>
            <li>It has a matte finish and an unusual texture</li>
            <li>Very waxy texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 5 mos now and my rosacea has really improved.</li>
            <li>It is gentle.</li>
            <li>Really feels nurturing .</li>
            <li>I just really dislike the fact that it&#x27;s so pasty.</li>
            <li>This face lotion works really well.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t help me much with the dryness issue.  </li>
            <li>My husband dislikes the smell intensely, would prefer I wear a scent</li>
            <li>Use as needed across your whole body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product, but after I am done with this tub I won&#x27;t be buying another one just because it doesn&#x27;t really do much for me aside from smelling of cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>ON ECZEMA: Eczema turned my boyfriend&#x27;s hand into leather, skin cracking off all over -- sometimes very reddish, looking like it was burnt.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is absolutely unbearable (it almost smells</li>
            <li>I have used straight aloe (from the plant) and manuka honey to try to correct my issues and was seeing some benefit.</li>
            <li>I have problems with eczema, and this really helps to sooth it.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t describe the smell unless you smell it for yourself.</li>
            <li>So I am very cautious in what ingredients are in the products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li>and there really isn&#x27;t any cons I can say about this product.</li>
            <li>I do really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Way better than I expected, moisturizes for hours.  </li>
            <li>I really want to like it--and I do, in some ways.</li>
            <li>My theory is that the thickness I spoke of earlier starts to suffocate my pores and they try to break free be producing geysers of sweat.</li>
            <li>In studies where mice have been fed a substantial diet of sodium benzoate, the data clearly indicate that their life expectancies were not shortened, nor was any notable health affect present at all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In studies where mice have been fed a substantial diet of sodium benzoate, the data clearly indicate that their life expectancies were not shortened, nor was any notable health affect present at all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice heavy moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or develop a rash.</li>
            <li>I am recently acne prone and most products ( even natural and/or organic ) irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used, to name a few products, SteriLid Cleaner, Aveno Eczema cream, Neosporin for Eczema, Organic Coconut oil, Organic Rose Hip seed oil, baby shampoo, and a prescription steroid cream</li>
            <li>The formula is super thick, but blends very easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has no strong scent is light, goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>As someone who wears makeup and is constantly testing out new products, this is seriously my favorite new moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I even used it right over my (extremely sensitive) eye area, which I would never do with a department store cream.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for a few days,  I am very fortunate that I do not have acne, dry or oily skin, and have a good complexion .  </li>
            <li>How can such rich cream still not moisturize and protect my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I used the entire 4 oz and did not notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I must say, after being an Amazon Prime member for several years, I have never purchased a product and then received a personalized, friendly email from the seller.</li>
            <li>There are many things I cannot use or eat due to my severe sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Much more than the other creams and homeopathic stuff</li>
            <li>I like it more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - including Aveda.</li>
            <li>So many lotions have been ruined due to manufacturers making their product creamy and to perserve it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the cream is thick, it feels very light when applied, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s natural and has no smell - I&#x27;m funny about smells and some really bother me.</li>
            <li>you get good amount for your money considering other brands which charge alot more for a lot less and still cause my back and face to break out .</li>
            <li>I received the new jar the very NEXT day and it was odor free.  </li>
            <li>Better than some perfume smell right under my nose, which usually triggers off my allergy.  </li>
            <li>the clay is very wet and musty, or mixed with a different kind of dirt or a bit spoiled or some kind of similar smell.</li>
            <li>It has been far better for my dry skin than another high-end night cream that I was using for years.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easy (it&#x27;s quite thick)</li>
            <li>I have THE most sensitive and dry skin on the planet</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a good amount because I only need less than a pea size for my face.</li>
            <li>I typically break out with many moisturizers but after 2 weeks of using this my acne has actually seen a significant decrease</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a huge plus that the ingredients are natural and it&#x27;s gentle enough to go around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I believe what I have is &#x27;minor ezcema&#x27; which resemble a light rash that you would get as if you were allergic to something.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Proof I liked it: I ordered 3 jars that arrived this past week, using the promo code here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>for a few persistent eczema patches  LOVE the fresh natural scent.  </li>
            <li>He also refunded the full purchase price of the product with no return necessary.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied this moisturizer I didn&#x27;t see any difference, but by the end of the day I noticed that my skin tone had evened out, which was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li>I was in the process of completely eliminating the toxic items in my health and beauty regime elements and this was the first moisturizer I found that lived up to and even exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not bad - just different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and silky, has a soft natural cocoa smell that dissipates, and is so nice and thick that you feel like you&#x27;ll never have to put on lotion again.</li>
            <li>Light but really moisturizers my very dry skin</li>
            <li>Live this cream!  </li>
            <li>This is my new staple face moisturizer!</li>
            <li>VERY good cream for sensitive and fussy skin--very calming and soothing and softening without the weird ingredients of steroid creams.</li>
            <li>VERY good cream for sensitive and fussy skin--very calming and soothing and softening without the weird ingredients of steroid creams.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed, unscented (unlike so many other natural/organic products) and simply glides on and m-e-l-t-s into your skin.  </li>
            <li>And not sure if the dissatisfied reviewers got a different batch, but the consistency of the cream I received is very smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>Here is a quick side note; once you have been using the cream, it becomes easier and easier to clean and the new application is gone in less then a minute.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I swear I have noticed a difference in the quality of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it: softer, less prominent wrinkles, improvement in texture.</li>
            <li>My condition looks much better and in less than 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I received my jar of cream today, after having ordered it early Friday morning, I really appreciate the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I would probably try it again once my skin clears up as I do think it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>from that, it smells decent.</li>
            <li>Though it is very dense as I said above, it permeates the skin real fast and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>The cream is a decent moisturizer and is non greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely only use this product from here on out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it mainly on my hands, arms and legs.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt better and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this moisturizer earlier on in life!  </li>
            <li>I have searched for nearly 6 years for the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; and spent too many dollars to admit---</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers are the same, especially since I am allergic to lanolin.</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered a second jar to try on my psoriosis.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and I love the light coconut scent from the coconut oil that&#x27;s in the product.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this is a very natural product</li>
            <li>It has a definite softening effect to the face, but I&#x27;m over 60 and need a little more moisture than most, so it didn&#x27;t work as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The owner was very friendly and helpful, and offered a refund and sent me a new tub when I put up my original review, thinking that it might have spoiled in transit due to the warehouse not being temperature controlled, but the second tub was the same as the first.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product and even now, considering buying another cream,  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and Era Organics.</li>
            <li>product is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a highly allergic type person, since childhood.</li>
            <li>will note that the owner, Tyler, seems to be highly responsive to customer issues.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>even high end ones, til era organics came into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to acne sufferers who like to wear make up.</li>
            <li>My cousins 3 month old baby had craddle cap and after testing a bit on the back of his arm to make sure he was not allergic, she gently washed a dime sized amount into his scalp and left it in while he was in the bath.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>highly anticipated jar arrived today and as soon as I opened it my heart sank.</li>
            <li>and she speaks highly of this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended for who are suffering from acne and oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream because of the high reviews.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended on purchasing from this company.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or weighted down.</li>
            <li>After the first day of trying this product, it helped me eliminated oil on my face significantly, and it claim down my acne a lot.</li>
            <li>This little 4 oz jar has so many uses.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>My sister has a little more oily skin and she can use it without getting break outs as well.</li>
            <li>this by far is the winner!!</li>
            <li>I used on him as well as the dry room conditions really effect and affect him tremendously.</li>
            <li>In fact my whole chin area now seems old and bumpy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the Ingredients that make up what could have been a great product; Aloe, shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, hemp seed oil, all sorts of vitamins and minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it lists some of the weird stuff like; Methyl Sufonyl Methane, Glycerine, Capric Triglyceride, Saccharomyces/Copper Ferment, Saccharomyces/Magnesium Ferment Hydrolysate, Saccharomyces/Potassium Ferment Hydrolysate, Adenosine Triphosphate and the list goes on and one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The face lotion I was using worked great but was too expensive.</li>
            <li>you could see where all the cradle cap was and how much the Complete helped remove.</li>
            <li>The manuka honey is a natural antibacterial and is very healing.  </li>
            <li>Prompt, professional and really knows the product.  </li>
            <li>far as the tendency for the cream to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; as it dries, I noticed that too when I was using too much of it at once.</li>
            <li>It has done the trick and kept these calloused rough hands moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s all natural too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cautious about what I use on my face because I have sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It dried out my skin more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed the scars fading faster than normal.</li>
            <li>It feels normal to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all normal and has been for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all normal and has been for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire teenage life and at 27 I really wanted to find a more natural alternative to achieve clear</li>
            <li>Within a month my jar is pretty much just white - all the ink rubbed off on my hands.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;ll thank you later; I feel fresh and moisturized</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using various moisturizers these past 7-8 months, and most of them are okay, but none of them equal this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like lotions and cream to actually gets absorbed into your skin like water.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many things over the years and have wasted a lot of money.</li>
            <li>and I normally need lots of lotion</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY creams since developing rosacea a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I was expecting same size for the price, but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li>Most face products usually make me break out because I have a very acne prone skin, but ever since I started using this product I never broke out</li>
            <li>Wow, the first time I tried it my face felt so soft and cured my chronic dryness.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reaction to the ingredients, which sometimes I normally do</li>
            <li>I notice I don&#x27;t break out as much as I usually normally do.</li>
            <li>I had new fresh wounds on my face due to my acne and I applied the cream on it right away</li>
            <li>Both my boyfriend and I very strongly dislike the smell of this cream, which is strong enough for us both to smell it even when the cream is already spread out thinly on my face.</li>
            <li>This product really surprised me with how quickly it handled my dry hands and also didn&#x27;t wear off quickly as most other products I have tried seem to do.</li>
            <li>This particular reaction is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>This particular reaction is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I live high in the mountains (8,200 ft) in a ski resort.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial moisturizer in a long time!</li>
            <li>kids are super sensitive to products (as am I) especially my ds.</li>
            <li>issue:&lt;br /&gt;After starting to use, I felt it was greasy, but it went right into my skin.</li>
            <li>want to send it right back, like 10 minutes ago.</li>
            <li>right and left</li>
            <li>soothing and no strong smell :)</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t get around to writing reviews, but I must say as someone who has tried a gazillion different moisturizers (from Khiel&#x27;s, Elizabeth Arden, Creme de la Mer to Aveeno) expensive and cheap, Era is by far the best value.</li>
            <li>I like that my hands don&#x27;t feel all sticky after I rub it in like with other cheap creams.</li>
            <li>I dab on a little more in the spots that are patchy and it has completely remedied my problem spots.</li>
            <li>As of right now I do plan to repurchase when I finish this jar and am also interested in trying other Era Organics products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new night cream and decided to try Era Organics.</li>
            <li>After traveling to New Zealand and seeing all of the hype around Manuka honey</li>
            <li>I tried a new product already complimented my new radiance and skin improvement.</li>
            <li>AND I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li>This is my new staple for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>oh well... off to a new product then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, side effects associated with excess sodium benzoate are only linked to HUGE consumption internally in foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, side effects associated with excess sodium benzoate are only linked to HUGE consumption internally in foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually would give it 4.5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF, and I&#x27;m not really used to creams (I have mostly used lotions)</li>
            <li>My hands are too!&lt;br /&gt;I find the aroma and consistency of the product very agreeable; puzzled my folks who don&#x27;t, especially since the aroma is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell was subtle and nice.  </li>
            <li>Jar lasted pretty long for the price (I would say about almost 2 months depending how much you use it-</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and this product does not cause me any difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that has not been irritated at all.</li>
            <li>Having I used high end products up until this point, I can tell the quality difference immediately when applied to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and it worked well for that,</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone, Rosacea skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, Rosacea and psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>This cream leaves my hands feeling very soft, and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturiser that is neither too mild nor too thick with full absorption.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my oily sensitive skin, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent and has a smooth creamy, thick feel to it (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even seeing my acne start to clear up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s helping to clear up my blemishes as well!</li>
            <li>This cream is a miracle for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I buy complete for my 25-yr-old daughter and she loves it!  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft!  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft not oilly!</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, vibrant... And surprisingly less acne.</li>
            <li>Everything else in my skincare regimen is exactly the same but</li>
            <li>, I agreed to this when I applied it on my face for the first time, but then I got used to it and actually like the smell of it now and dont have any problems with it.</li>
            <li>There was a very short, tingling/burning sensation at first</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first dealing with this company and I look forward to ordering again when this jar runs low.</li>
            <li>After only a short period of time I have noticed a significant softening of my skin and with sun damage and 66 years of age</li>
            <li>At first there were tiny dots of lymph I had to blot off my skin, but</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I applied it to the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually soft for once and can now bend normally.</li>
            <li>I truly hope their are some hair products on the way because natural hair needs lots of it!</li>
            <li>but it has eliminated the irritation in that time and brought instant relief to the itchy stinging sensations after the first use.</li>
            <li>First came back and said it was &#x27;SUPPRESSED&#x27; for some reason.  </li>
            <li>That says a lot for my sensitive, oily and acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive, dry, acne and blackhead prone.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and clean, moisturizes my face, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling wet or greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many very expensive creams for my aging skin (I&#x27;m 55), but most also cause me a reaction--no matter how hypoallergenic or high end--so I end up using Lubriderm sensitive and</li>
            <li>I have never really used any anti-aging skin care because I haven&#x27;t really needed it till now, but I&#x27;m starting to get some roughness and increased fine lines with certain facial expressions.  </li>
            <li>I did the same for my ds and around troublesome areas usually like his nose or top of the forehead where it can become super dry in certain conditions (like hospitals)</li>
            <li>really recommend this, after the first day i noticed much better less dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s smooth and the marks are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s smooth and the marks are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have peri-oral dermatitis and this has been thr first product I found that didnt aggravate my rash and actually helped it clear up.</li>
            <li>and I easily get sensitivity reactions after a few minutes using a product</li>
            <li>I have added a couple other staples to my regimen ( Vitamin C Serum ) and phytoceramides and am excited by the results so far.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so this jar should last me a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that I have had positive results with.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see just how small dabs will be sufficient to get smooth soft hands, your skin will be very moisturized and glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often hesitant to try new creams for fear they won&#x27;t be gentle enough.  </li>
            <li>It is half the price and double the size of the stuff I was getting before and works even better.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more emollient, was looking for something like the la mer moisturizing cream which is super expensive</li>
            <li>So personally for me it was clogging my pores, but for people with more dry skin it might work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason why I gave only 3 stars to the product is it took forever to absorb to my skin.</li>
            <li>Using less and spreading it further over my face, neck, and upper chest resolved that issue nicely.</li>
            <li>It has an odd smell, not a bad smell, but not one you would be familiar with as other skin care products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick and dries within a few minutes leaving your skin feeling super soft, moisturized, but not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I actually added Frank to it to make it a little better for my skin</li>
            <li>Due to the non-greasy characteristic of this cream I am able to use it on my scalp without having problems with my hair.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my dry hands moisture for a significant period of time, but just isn&#x27;t quit enough.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this clear of skin since I was a pre-teen.</li>
            <li>This cream not only moisturizes very well, but my skin is so soft as well.  </li>
            <li>I really have to be careful not to use too much of this product because it can clog my pours.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but its definitely not for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tyler of Era Organics deserves credit for following up very well with customer service.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it melts into the skin and keeps it soft all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scent sensitive</li>
            <li>It helped clear a lot of my acne so far</li>
            <li>With such an offer, I decided I really was not taking any risk and made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is still early in my use of it</li>
            <li>The site on my leg from which the skin graft was taken is also fading and the skin remains soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>So far I have nothing but praise for this product.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a luxurious consistency that immediately absorbs into your skin, leaving it soft and supple, not one bit of greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Where to begin, I bought this product because of its natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>After much trial and error and internet research I found out I was experiencing the classical side effects of MSM.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin, and this has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin that I have been trying to control for years now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance, just the sent of the natural ingredients that are used to make it.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a product for sensitive, acne prone skin---this is what you need to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This, the facial one, the eczema (all the same really) work very well.</li>
            <li>This, the facial one, the eczema (all the same really) work very well.</li>
            <li>Its so light weight and fluffy, you will never want to use anything else, I promise.</li>
            <li>You can tell by the feel of the cream and the smell that the ingredients are natural and organic.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because of all the natural ingredients that are in it.</li>
            <li>I bragged about these products to my 25 year old daughter and now she is hooked on the products as well.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>If you put too much on, it won&#x27;t absorb properly, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>This one seemed like the ingredients were all natural</li>
            <li>Natural, Organic, Healing, Parabens Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe it is because it gives your skin the natural boost it needs to hydrate itself and maintain the oils you develop naturally.</li>
            <li>Leaves her skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It smelled like old vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cursed with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although I am a fan of all natural products, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne that flares up</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try natural products.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have used this organic moisturizer for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>that this is natural.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and rashes from some health conditions that this cream completely takes it away.</li>
            <li>Natural organic not greasy cream.</li>
            <li>It has kept away the bit of redness I get around my nose, and it has begun to heal some of my old acne scars.  </li>
            <li>It is lush, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>so I added some Wild Orange doTerra oil and problem solved.</li>
            <li>It is all natural, there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li>Not with Complete by Era-Organics.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and breaks out from almost anything but after wearing the Era Organics moisturizer cream my skin has completely cleared.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>I like it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>have cystic adult acne, and have tried *everything* to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a first in a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far it has not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and so far this product works well</li>
            <li>My husband has psoriasis and is sensitive to a lot of lotions that I</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s organic, the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>but instead you feel supple and soft.</li>
            <li>After three days of using Complete, the Rosacea was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>The cream is moisturizing but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin so soft...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>always use moisturizer and this has by far exceeded all my expectation and has become my fave</li>
            <li>(and that&#x27;s a lot of years of comparison and getting me to switch from my old trusty</li>
            <li>That has to be my number on complaint of most lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face feels really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>I am 77years old and</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, especially when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to stop the oiliness completely because its not how it works.</li>
            <li>moisturizer does have a lil bit of chocolaty smell to it so those who are sensitive to smell might consider that.</li>
            <li>I have annoyingly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>which is a naturally occurring sulfur compound that aids in the production of collagen and keratin (bear with me, I&#x27;m a bit of a nerd) as well as detoxification.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week only at night because I have oily skin and use an oil absorbing moisturizer in the mornings.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost used one jar, and my skin is unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think perhaps I am just so used to chemically laden aromas that I have lost some appreciation for natural smells that aren&#x27;t floral.</li>
            <li>Since I prefer natural products, I was looking for a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; to make using the two of them when I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li>I still have acne on my back, but they are not as much as before.</li>
            <li>so far is the texture of the cream.</li>
            <li>I buy unscented products frequently</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but the reviews were good and the ingredients didn&#x27;t seem to be problematic (although I worried about the algae component, as I am sensitive to iodine and seafood of all kinds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is thick and lovely.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to EVERYTHING, so finding a good, and affordable, moisturizer is a difficult task.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I left this review, the company contacted me and explained it was probably a left over jar that didn&#x27;t get sold right away</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, especially people with sensitive skin !</li>
            <li>Used pretty much every single over-the-counter cream/lotion/treatments across different brands and had eventually settled with an Aveno product.</li>
            <li>I also went to the ERA Organics website and love that ERA is a small family based business!  </li>
            <li>In this short time, I&#x27;ve already been able to eliminate all other serums/creams/moisturizers from my daily skincare routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the cream for three days in a row, his fingers are nearly back to normal!</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it very quickly, unlike some creams which seem to sit there like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for about 6 months and this was the first winter that I didn&#x27;t have any issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks and much like the other 3 star reviewers, it just isn&#x27;t as much of a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>I have facial eczema and it has really helped calm it down.</li>
            <li>After a few applications the dry area on my face improved and my dried hands felt great just after one application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product overall.  </li>
            <li>It does have a light &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; effect, so while I use it on my face when I&#x27;m at home, I&#x27;m less likely to use it under makeup, where the cream can pill a bit if you rub in foundation, cream blush, etc.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, very dry facial and neck skin and lead an active life with many outdoor activities - gardening, dog walking, bicycling.  </li>
            <li>My rosy chapped cheeks are healed and my face feels supple keeping me ready for long days in the sun.</li>
            <li>No scales, no pustules, not dark striations.</li>
            <li>No scales, no pustules, not dark striations.</li>
            <li>At first, the cream even helped the rosacea redness, but as the weather has warmed up I&#x27;m constantly pink again.</li>
            <li>When I started using this, I noticed that when I woke up the next morning, my face was not as oily as it normally would be.</li>
            <li>my skin is mostly back to normal.</li>
            <li>It does have a little smell which dissipates really quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy the mud mask and cleanser and hope you continue to come out with new beauty products in the future (specifically a shampoo and conditioner product!).</li>
            <li>and I live deep in the desert, which seems to amplify the condition.  </li>
            <li>It also is not oily nor greasy - I live in South Florida and just walking outside creates a sweat bonanza</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as much as I&#x27;d like around some of my really dry areas but</li>
            <li>After years of trying different moisturizers finally found the one that really works.</li>
            <li>This is a thicker cream (but not heavy feeling), so I do have to be careful not to use too much when applying it in my t zone as it can make it a bit oily.</li>
            <li>The company told me that this has similar ingredients to their Relief cream, which is really convenient and a big reason why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected it to be super soft and feel moist but although it doesn&#x27;t dry it out, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t fully moisturize like it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to use it entirely to make the money that I spent worth it.</li>
            <li>Better than the expensive creams that have fillers and actually don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I have mild breakouts all the time and a few acne scars.</li>
            <li>I took a whim and ordered this lotion on Amazon and it healed my skin tremendously in a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry for being late to leave a really great review on this product!</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive and itchy  skin, I only use Vaseline</li>
            <li>It actually made my face feel more tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfect when I got a really bad sunburn!  </li>
            <li>In order for this reaction to move at a noticeable rate, it needs heat and oxygen, in the absence of sugars and many common cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>In order for this reaction to move at a noticeable rate, it needs heat and oxygen, in the absence of sugars and many common cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can tell a major difference because it is lighter on my face than chemical moisturizers.</li>
            <li>There are several creams on Amazon with the exact same ingredient list and price, but sold under different brands.</li>
            <li>It is the first moisturizer I have used that has actually helped heal my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it is generally normal to dry, but no problems.  </li>
            <li>Usually, I have dry skin that gets oily once in a while, but this mask keeps my face surely balanced.</li>
            <li>Now, while I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, I will say I have no new break outs and noticed a difference in my skin the first day.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy, but absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave the face feeling oily!</li>
            <li>(ph balanced without any sulfate a, alcohols, etc) and follow up with a spray mixture of pure, organic hemp seed oil (Zero on comedogenic scale) pure vitamin e oil (bought online; store vitamin e has additive ingredients) unscented alcohol-free witch hazel, some filtered water, and recently added niacinamide (vitamin b3) and green tea in powder form from a site that sells bulk ingredients to make at-home skin</li>

            <li>it is always super dry, but then I have to be careful applying oily lotions.</li>
            <li>Unlike Khiel&#x27;s facial fuel which you had to use a lot of only to get a decent amount of moisture, Era requires a fingerful at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but unfortunately, I noticed the top ingredient in the cream is coconut oil which is highly comedogenic (</li>

            <li>I have wasted so much money on creams and lotions that do not even compare to the high quality of this face cream.  </li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t smooth and the areas around my cheek were red and a little bumpy, but not pimple-bumpy where you could see individual bumps.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never ever been this clear in ten years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never ever been this clear in ten years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within the week of using this product so far, I can actually SEE a difference.</li>
            <li>scent barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>After following the lovevitamin blog, I&#x27;ve switched into an all natural skincare routine and was introduced into the benefits of mms and manuka honey, hence my excitement when I found this product.</li>
            <li>This has no smell, nothing to irritate your skin, only natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only used this as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>No, not really, but how can one really tell without anything to compare it to?  </li>
            <li>Thank you Era Organics for finally giving me a natural product that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>My face feels extra soft and maybe even ...</li>
            <li>The relief cream seems to hydrate through several layers of skin so as to keep it soft and from drying out.</li>
            <li>and now there is barely even a noticeable scar there.</li>
            <li>I barely notice it now.</li>
            <li>Works for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin and just as well for my sensitive skinned teen.</li>
            <li>only thing I am scared about is finally finding a product and a company doing what they normally do and &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to acne and this lotion has helped my acne rather than made it worse as most lotions do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for: natural cream without all the harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>But, when I use a thin layer at night - I love it. . .</li>
            <li>Its thick, smooth, and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a large tub and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I actually used on his chese in a certain area due to what was taking place and it kept his skin soft and supple and helped I think to keep it from inflammation and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t checked to see if the acne scars on my back are lighten; I don&#x27;t expect it to be because the scars on my back are super dark.</li>
            <li>I have my new jars in the fridge, since I don&#x27;t know how well they will last outside of refrigeration.</li>
            <li>I am 30 with normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy like many other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>very faint, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>A little background first: I have dry and sensitive skin that overcompensates resulting in oily skin throughout the day, resulting in frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>Other products that I have used have been petroleum based and made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li>I live in the west, where it&#x27;s really dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the price is high, you only need to apply a small amount to notice the positive effects.</li>
            <li>It has made my face and neck look ten years younger so far...</li>
            <li>The only lasting impact is that your skin will feel extremely soft (almost like silk) and definitely not dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter has incredibly sensitive skin and these products have only soothed her skin and it is no longer red or itchy.  </li>
            <li>Not dry, just firmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that is really heavy while still being quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted and plan to get more of this brand simply for that reason.</li>
            <li>These areas are not a dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I really like it - the texture is good, it moisturizes without being greasy, I even like the smell of cocoa that some people seem to hate.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>and my daughter has very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>In a week and a half of using this cream, I have not had one new blemish pop up, and the old blemishes are healing well or gone!  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little funny</li>
            <li>Smells a little funny</li>
            <li>At first it smells like clay, but as I smell it a little longer, it smells to me like</li>
            <li>product is a little thick, not oily, smooth to apply, and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>but I barely could notice it and since my skin didn&#x27;t turn red</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and have no regrets, will purchase and recommend to product to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Sometimes at night if I feel I need an extra moisturizer due to dryness, I&#x27;ll use this cream on top of the other 3 things and it works to seal in the other ingredients and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or over moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not taking anything for my skin issues anymore, and I rarely get even a small spot that causes me problems.  </li>
            <li>Although it feels heavy when you first put it on your skin, it immediately absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>The first thing I ever tried from this company was their grapefruit scented Dead Sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich, creamy and luxurious, it has every ingredient you need for terrific skin.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;In fact extremely large amounts of Sodium Benzoate would need to be ingested in order to produce even slight toxic consequences for the body.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;In fact extremely large amounts of Sodium Benzoate would need to be ingested in order to produce even slight toxic consequences for the body.</li>
            <li>But I also have very sensitive skin, allergic to sulfates and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, but still easily absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I noticed when I put it on my bare, dry skin (long after washing) it didn&#x27;t absorb as well, which is unfortunately normal because the face wash</li>
            <li>The price seemed a bit high, but the jar is a very generous 4 ounces compared to the others who have only 2 ounces for the same price, and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But just a small amount of cream gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li>I had stopped using the steroid cream for about 4 days and the rash was returning as usual right when these products came in the mail.</li>
            <li>I have not used it for a very long time yet (not even a week yet), but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference so far.</li>
            <li>But my skin is clear now and not as dry as before.</li>
            <li>This cream completely solved my dry, peeling winter skin on my face.</li>
            <li>The dry patches have shrunken considerably.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also moisturizes dry and over worked hands, I scrubbed out pots and pans after this past Thanksgiving dinner last week, if you&#x27;ve used abrasive cleansers and brillo pads and you&#x27;ve spent 1/2  hour or more in water</li>
            <li>So coming from someone who has struggled with life long rough skin and acne, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 75 different moisturizers in the past few years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tyler of Era Organics deserves credit for following up very well with customer service.they are, the less we like them for the body (</li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight film leftover if I apply too much of the product, but scaling back the amount applied resolved that issue immediately.</li>
            <li>It even works on my eyelids, which are very dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin.</li>
            <li>A little really does go a</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, but very thick.  </li>
            <li>and I know for sure that it will help with anyone who suffers from a skin condition or has sensitive skin like I do.</li>

            <li> /&gt;UPDATE November 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this close to two years now, and it has kept my neck nice.</li>
            <li> Actually, it kind of makes me want to eat it now.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are both using it and loving it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent which is nice.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that Era Organics and their products have given me my life back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Customer service is the best of all in my whole life, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best if your skin is that, to not put on too much.</li>
            <li> Soothes my skin when I rub it on, feels so nice, not like any lotion I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer,</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get the kind of result that the reviews are showing up here.</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like a whipped foundation primer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on nicely</li>
            <li> I could give my honest thoughts on it.</li>
            <li> is that it kind of smells like clay play-doh.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product and for the money, you get a generous amount of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now going to sit on my desk as a hand moisturizer since it smells nice like chocolate.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m loving this tub of beauty.  </li>
            <li> I even got a compliment from a co-worker yesterday, that my skin looks really nice...</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Texture is nice.</li>
            <li> I like putting a nice organic mixture on my face rather than all those chemicals out there.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Really leaves your skin looking beautifully balanced and feeling refreshed!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have a product that gives you the moisture your skin needs without feeling like it&#x27;ll be</li>
            <li> Everything I hope to convey is under my own volition and in the desire</li>
            <li> And it smells nice , a bit like chocolate.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, great proactive - and friendly - communication from the seller.  </li>

            <li> But this moisturizer is wonderful; I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is perfect!  </li>
            <li> I like the feel of this lotion, however it smells very strong-</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell the best in my opinion, and sadly so far it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Plus with all the great reviews, thought it was worth the shot.</li>
            <li> They used the best products that they could find and made natural remedies that worked for centuries.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having great success with it</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer for sensitive skin I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream I have ever used on my face!  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good consistency and goes on so smoothly.</li>

            <li> This stuff is by far the best face moisturizer I have come across.</li>

            <li> I love all the wonderful natural ingredients that it has.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can put my foundation on top of it and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> At first it seems great...</li>
            <li> Plus it was filled to the very top.</li>
            <li> The chocolate smell of this face cream, which is not bad; the texture is a bit creamy, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to report that this is not the case with e-raorganics complete face lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very light and does not cause problems with my hair.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and leaves a velvety texture.</li>
            <li> (she has eczema) and my face looks as if I drank jars of water and feels very smooth.</li>
            <li> so this is very important to me.</li>
            <li> It is also very light.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily and leave a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate me at all, which is great, and the smell is just pleasant enough to be used at day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also a huge jug and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> sexy at all),</li>

            <li> I tried it tonight as my night cream &amp; it feels lovely on my skin</li>
            <li> Once more, I want to note how responsive the company was when I asked questions about the cream.  </li>
            <li> So grateful to be able to use my hand.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I bought another type of moisturizer that had more (8 oz) and even had better reviews than this one</li>
            <li> but I like this one a lot more.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It has great ingredients and is a quality product, but it is not doing much for the eczema on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a bummer for me since it seems to be helping many others.</li>
            <li> So since my sleep is too precious to me</li>
            <li> and they love it</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Customer service was excellent and it felt more personal.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance on this cream...</li>

            <li> Maybe it will get better in time?</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but it has improved my complexion, skin tone, reduced the redness and has made my face look better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping sooth my skin, keep it hydrated and is helping me not have as many pimples.</li>
            <li> most often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go with either one, whichever is priced better or has a discount promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream has kept another flare away and the skin is able to heal some, even lighten up some.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I have had the hardest time finding a face moisturizer that i love</li>
            <li> but I really think this moisturizer has more to do with that because ever since I started using it my face feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to be fully gone in one more week.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent has grown on me with time.  </li>

            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my face because I use hemp seed oil on my body, but this stuff is great!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face creams and this is my fave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for more than 10 year now.</li>
            <li> it helped it get a bit better?</li>
            <li> This product is a favorite.  </li>
            <li> I just think they should do a better job helping people understand all the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> What better reason could you need???</li>
            <li> No medication, lotion, diet change, hydration, etc has been more helpful or as quick-acting as this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving the country for a while, so I immediately ordered another 4oz jar of this lovely face</li>
            <li> I was pleased</li>
            <li> I want to make sure before I write any review.</li>

            <li> am a steadfast believer in it and want all their products!</li>
            <li> Holds most of its moisture through out the day.</li>
            <li> Cute packaging.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my skin :)</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll admit I need a better skin care system, I do not like feeling stuff on my face.</li>
            <li> Once the cream absorbs, you will not be able to feel anything</li>
            <li> I really love this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite is a drop or two Lemongrass.</li>
            <li> I mix it in with the top layer of the jar..</li>
            <li> I love putting it on before my makeup.</li>
            <li> Since I am into antiaging creams for the most part I don&#x27;t use this every day.  </li>
            <li> Would buy more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and i I am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> but I feel completely safe using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the texture of this</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many lotions and potions (literally).</li>
            <li> I guess I will give it more time to see.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more product in the container when I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  The owner emailed me promptly after my OK review and provided a full-refund.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the concept and ingredients in this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this product</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never before written a review, but I love this product.</li>
            <li> Most people who struggle with oily skin sometimes tend to over exfoliate or not moisturize like they should.</li>
            <li> This has happened to me so many times.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice texture and you can tell it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have this item especially since it is eco friendly!</li>

            <li> Leaves my 60 year old face with a smooth wonderful fresh non-greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> A wonderfully light and refreshing cream.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s recommended product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT and thank you all so much for making such a wonderful and organic product and just being an overall great company!</li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> To my the cream smells like sunscreen (not the nice coconutty  kind), but it&#x27;s a smell I can easily live with.</li>
            <li> Great for those with sensitive skin and who can&#x27;t have strong scents/perfumes.</li>
            <li> I liked it right away.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this due to all the awesome reviews.</li>
            <li> My husband took the time to research other products and Era Organics had the best reviews, so he bought it for me.  </li>
            <li> So that along with the other list of healing ingredients makes this moisturizer one of the best we have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very, very mild scent, which I like.  </li>
            <li> It is a very mild cream</li>
            <li> The printing on the jar wears off too easily.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbs into skin without greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The cream is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that it will come in a tube and not in a jar so it won&#x27;t get contaminated easily.</li>
            <li> Therefore I strongly recommend Era Organics&#x27; products to you if you are reading this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their skin in good repair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in love with this moisturizer and this is the deal right here!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very smooth and soaks in quickly .  </li>
            <li> This is great for sensitivities and the faint chocolate aroma and creamy texture are very successful moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer, so clean and light.</li>
            <li> but I just wiped it off &amp; it was fine.</li>
            <li> ; product, I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
            <li> cause this one works fine.</li>
            <li> Hope this fine company comes out with a vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li> The fine print says &amp;#34;made with organic ingredients.&amp;#34; Titanium dioxide is NOT ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, but I can&#x27;t stand to put it on my face and smell like that</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, I am seeing a difference in my skin, pores and fine lines seem</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary!</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and has a lovely cocoa scent that disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> This product has quickly become a go-to favorite.</li>
            <li> Looks like a great product I just have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So great to find good affordable products with only natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> We had a hard time finding a healthy alternative to the lotions out there loaded with chemicals and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> They did make a huge difference on my face.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I&#x27;m a huge fan of the ingredients used because they&#x27;re all organic--</li>
            <li> The container is huge</li>
            <li> It was out of a fresh batch and much better quality.</li>
            <li> Face is smooth  </li>
            <li> I actually miss the smell when I don&#x27;t use it, lol.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is light, blends in well.&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li> The price point is great and you get a whopping 4 oz which will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again only because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but there is a light cocoa butter smell that is comforting.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so smooth.</li>
            <li> It slides on smoothly and absorbs into my skin within 1 minute.</li>
            <li> At night, when I have more time, I warm it with my hands and gently massage it into my skin until absorbed--</li>
            <li> I think this moisturizer works great, and actually feels like it is helping improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Equally important, I do not experience the stinging.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li> This cream is doing great things for my complexion in only two days!</li>
            <li> Great customer service and personal treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and not greasy, but well-moisturized.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> so the application of it on the skin goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> For pimples, I would recommend the Neutrgena Oil Free Acne Stress Control.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using it on my face, and it works great for that, as well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Fabulous creme.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally find something that works for my daughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a couple of light fingertip taps of this cream, those lines disappeared.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the smell (like chocolate) but most of all, I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and</li>
            <li> No break outs, just baby smooth feeling when put on face.</li>
            <li> Before giving my feedback, I want to genuinely thank the manufacturers of Era Organics.</li>
            <li> This face cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> that it goes on smooth with no greasy or watery feel.</li>
            <li> Oh and I like that it&#x27;s made with organic ingredients and that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream was smooth and just melted into my skin.</li>
            <li> It is free of the chemicals and compounds you can&#x27;t pronounce and serve as preservatives for mass produced garbage clogging the shelves and your pores.</li>
            <li> It goes on feeling so light that you do not even feel it there.</li>
            <li> I have recently made some changes to my diet and skin care routine and this moisturizer has been a great addition.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I am now taking a holistic approach to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and quenched.</li>
            <li> I really just love this and now know that I won&#x27;t be able to be without it...</li>
            <li> I feel good using this  because of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin look more healthy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good to know that it&#x27;s organic with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> So I see a lot of mixed reviews; mostly good which I&#x27;m glad to see because this cream has done wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> really hope more people try this stuff, so the company would be able to lower the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy about my purchase and in fact it acts as a perfect base for my sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I feel good about using Era Organics because it&#x27;s natural and organic.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one and loved it so much I ordered another one right away.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t add much to what these other folks have said in their reviews, and I don&#x27;t know what people in Hollywood and Beverly Hills are using on their faces, but this stuff is both awesome and affordable to most .</li>
            <li> This is not the type of moisturizer that just stays on top of the skin; my skin seems to soak it right up.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in, not greasy at all, and even better, it isn&#x27;t perfumed.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both enjoy the rich light weight face cream.</li>
            <li> Accutane really messes your lips up!!!</li>
            <li> used this the first day I received it and said &amp;#34;NO WAY&#x27;&#x27; !!.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer but did not cure my rosacea (red cheeks).</li>
            <li> It is definitely thicker than I thought, but it&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very effective cream, will definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that it readily gets absorbed into my skin rather than leaving an oily or greasy-like residue that gets on my clothes!!</li>
            <li> After consistent use, my skin feels smooth, hydrated and in much better condition.</li>
            <li> The mild scent dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li> Looks like she found a  new favorite face cream!</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and the composition includes significant percentages of the important additives to really make good on their claims.</li>
            <li> Just amazing as it sinks right into your skin and no greasy or oily feeling, smells great too, definitely worth splurging on or a camu camu infused moisturizer after using their serum</li>
            <li> This is such a perfectly amazing product!</li>
            <li> Thank you ERA Organics for creating such an amazing moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of it at first, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure years of using chemicals to treat my acne contributed to the problem.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, you&#x27;l be pleased.</li>
            <li> I felt the healthy difference in my skin after the first usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: been using this for almost 2 years now and still loving it!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy yet rich.</li>
            <li> I was able to see the difference since the first application.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what my diagnosis was.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product in July.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I literally just purchased and received this product and used for the first time today, so I am reviewing based on the immediate results (I will try and remember to post an updated review in a couple weeks).</li>
            <li> I am still using it though I haven&#x27;t seen significant result yet.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a cream, yes a rich mousse like cream.</li>
            <li> My skin on my face looks better the first day after I used it.  </li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the natural smell of the jar (which to me is fine by the way), then add your own scent.</li>
            <li> Btw, I use Apple cider vinegar as a toner, so anyone who wants to try that along with this moisturizer, I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my skin had a nice glow, one of my tests for a new night cream, it passed with flying colors.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer if you have dry, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Great for those who have dry faces but need something to moisturize their face without making it oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores are no longer clogged and I can walk free without foundation because my skin actually looks good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he will like the fact that is fragrance free and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It is so light and absorbs quickly with no sticky feel to it.</li>
            <li> To clean my hands</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better, is if your skin can tolerate it, you can add your own essential oil.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and evenly and absorbs quickly, but does not leave your skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> Its actually one of the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This cream hydrates the skin really well and is perfect for anyone with super dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is very hydrating and soothing on rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on then take it off with warm water and it leaves my skin very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The owner of this business is very nice, and clearly there are many customers who really like the product, so please know that this review reflects my own personal taste and my boyfriend&#x27;s, but might not represent yours.</li>
            <li> All natural and organic is a cherry on top !</li>
            <li> Nice, it makes my skin feel hydrated and soft without being greasy!</li>
            <li> Very smooth n dries reaaly fast</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it absorbs and I love that is made out of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girlie girl who&#x27;s bought a lot of creams in her life and this one is special.</li>
            <li> You just feel special putting it on.</li>
            <li> I broke out a tiny bit at first, but now my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> For beginners, it&#x27;s at a great price point, secondly, the cream is pretty dense</li>
            <li> and it seem that this has only good reviews..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work for others, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really want to thank all the staff at Era Organics for creating such a masterful product, it is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> So, if good customer service is a priority for you, definitely feel at ease with Era Oganics.</li>

            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> My skin feels cool and hydrated after applying the product.</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased  with this cream as it did not irritate my skin yet moisturized very well.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel cool.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face soft which is always nice.  </li>
            <li> I loved the results I received from the product like it evened out my skintone however it started to make me break out in these teeny tiny bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> This one is really good and close to the type I use on a regular day...</li>
            <li> Not too soft like a liquid lotion kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I like this product, BUT my skin requires a more intense moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Love how the cream really moisturizes without feeling caky or overbearing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all..</li>
            <li> Its not a really bad smell, but... it has a feeling of you know its there.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is super cool on my face; I like the ingredients and for a moisturizer Era Organics is a complete and effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> EWG.org rates it as a very low risk and most studies that show it as a risk are more talking about ingesting rather than applying to the skin.</li>
            <li> EWG.org rates it as a very low risk and most studies that show it as a risk are more talking about ingesting rather than applying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, opened it, and quickly returned it.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a calming cocoa scent upon application that quickly dissipates so does not conflict with any fragrance you are wearing.  </li>
            <li> 4oz goes quick at the beginning</li>
            <li> and I think the honey properties help you tremendously in healing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for an everyday kind of nice feeling product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so loyal to a moisturizer before, but this stuff is everything.</li>
            <li> and it has evened out some mild rosacea just in 3 days use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin is clearer and feels more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I love that it’s natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li> Feels creamy, but once applied it aborbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> foot surgery scars are quickly vanishing.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and no greasy residue  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and mine had zero order  </li>
            <li> It feels luxurious going on, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is fragrance free and natural.  </li>
            <li> This product smells nutty and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> He likes it that much and his skin looks great (all kids skin does but considering all his medical and sensitivity issues we go through a lot from drying/redness/</li>
            <li> It was also a super quick fix for my boyfriend&#x27;s sunburns, heh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad for Amazon to provide multiple vendors for consumers who may have otherwise not been able to reach the masses.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and that aloe is the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> one last thing: there are waaaaaay to many ingredients, many of which I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I love this cream and would highly recommend to all of my friends.  </li>
            <li> Feels good, feels right, last for hours, and I see a healthier look</li>
            <li> When I used this cream, my skin just absorbed it right away!  </li>
            <li> It sinks it quickly and leaves my skin feeling  AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Lovely, visible difference in my skin; moved from a wet climate to high desert and needed to change out my skin care products, this is an amazing face cream!  </li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate adult acne and this surprisingly did not cause my face to break out!</li>
            <li> it is very safe, being a low PH acidic</li>
            <li> it is very safe, being a low PH acidic</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with its (mostly) organic ingredients and it appears to be vegan other than the honey, which I can deal with but would prefer to do without.</li>
            <li> It seems to really moisturize my face without clogging pores or becoming too oily.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although this product was not a good match for me, the purchase refund and sympathetic management has greatly enhanced my trust in this retailer.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, been using the normal store brands for years only to find nothing helps in the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s organic so keeping that in mind, it sure smells natural, but that&#x27;s definitely not a bad thing imo&lt;</li>
            <li> long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The friendliness and prompt communication from the company&#x27;s owner is also a refreshing change of pace from dealing with most vendors/larger companies.</li>
            <li> If you have back acne like I do, make sure you have a decent body wash or some kind of acne product body wash.</li>
            <li> Really excellent product, even better, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li> My husband and my teen daughter tried this cream and they love it!</li>
            <li> The best facial product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost 30; the first time it hasn&#x27;t been an issue is since I started using this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I was originally quite pleased yet sceptical due to having tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using this product because you will notice that your skin looks so much better!</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any preservatives that we like because the more effective they are, the less we like them for the body (</li>
            <li> Great fluffy texture with a mild to almost non existent scent.  </li>
            <li> Very light on my face, no oily feeling even during the days I&#x27;m on direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very smooth, not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer right here for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that I asked a question on another one of their products, and got several quick replies from real customers who all love their products too.</li>
            <li> Just the smell a little bit uncommon.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my face, but works great for the rest of your body (especially when it gets dry in the winter)!</li>
            <li> The combination of healthy organic ingredients, gentleness, many long term benefits at a very reasonable cost can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff, really.</li>
            <li> This could have been a great product if they didnt include a few ingredients that are known skin irritants.</li>
            <li> Have not received the jar yet but its great to know they have amazing customer service if something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to reorder Christina Moss Naturals Moisturizer which I got amazing results with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G0EJYFW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> BTW the customer service is amazing and the way it used to be with companies - that no longer to seem to feel that is necessary; Era Organics does!</li>
            <li> , Geogard Ultra was found to be quite safe and is allowed to be used in natural and organic products.</li>

            <li> I love Natural Face Moisturizer Cream</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that it leaves my face baby soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying it, it&#x27;s worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Rarely have I dealt with a company who seems so concerned with customer service.</li>
            <li> Put a smile on my face when my husband brought the delivery in with the morning newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love how soft my face is after using this cream.</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Is it useful?</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s surely worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite thing so far though</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its nice, but I have found others in the same price range that I prefer and I will probably not order it again.</li>
            <li> It is certainly worth trying out.  </li>
            <li> This is a really, really nice facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Mostly on my forehead and around the brows near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the soft texture.</li>
            <li> It has no harsh exfoliating ingredients, and it&#x27;s thicker and creamier than most of the others, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true-hard fan of Korean cosmetics, but have decided to be more conscious about my make-up choices re: organic and/or non-harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> So far, I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> I love Doterra&#x27;s Clear Skin Foaming Cleanser and Spot Treatment, they&#x27;ve made a difference, but the acne persisted no matter what moisturizer I used, until now.  </li>
            <li> But in addition my nose was assailed by the smell---NOT a fresh scent like some people have claimed.</li>
            <li> smaller and skin tone is more smooth.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the purchase and with the customer service.</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t notice it once the cream is absorbed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions for use are to apply a dime-sized amount and rub in until absorbed.</li>
            <li> and i love it so far.</li>
            <li> My skin was flawless as a child and even into my teens until stress and poor skin management set in.</li>
            <li> I have had success with coconut oil, honey masks, and oatmeal moisturizers but every 3 or 4 weeks the condition resurfaces.</li>
            <li> I have not given the product the test of time but thus far I love it.</li>
            <li> There is not a greasy feeling and the lotion is absorbed well.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is nice and white.</li>
            <li> E-raorganics complete has been a good product on my skin so far</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much Era Organics!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d keep an eye out on which has a better price (with the discount, right now, it&#x27;s Era Organics, unless you buy the 8 oz jar by Wild Naturals, in which case you do get about 9 bucks o fa</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d keep an eye out on which has a better price (with the discount, right now, it&#x27;s Era Organics, unless you buy the 8 oz jar by Wild Naturals, in which case you do get about 9 bucks o fa</li>
            <li> which I recommend you to apply the cream right away if the wound is still fresh and you don&#x27;t want it to end up as a scar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin super oily.</li>
            <li> He tried the other jar and it felt really good on his skin.  </li>
            <li> non perfumed and seems to soak right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I might give it another shot on my face, but I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out right now.</li>
            <li> I  made the right choice.</li>
            <li> the price of this item is just right.</li>
            <li> It soaks right it and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> They did advertise about applying a dime size, which I do believe they are right.</li>
            <li> It just feels right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, and leaves your skin very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> To be fair, he also just started taking new Ayurvedic herbal supplements that help eczema (guduchi and amalaki), but it was the cream that brought instant relief and flexibility.</li>
            <li> That being said, this product is much better then the chemical ridden junk you find at swanky skin stores which charge you big money to rub large amounts of cheaply made chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> the best part is I still have almost half a jar left.</li>
            <li> my skin looks and feels great night and day.for my Sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Era Organics cream (this and the eczema seem identical in smell, appearance, behavior, so I am reviewing both with the same time span/use) for about a month, and I can finally and honestly review it on how it worked on my latest eczema flare:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem pretty stable, and the jar I opened a month ago is still fresh in look and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> moisturizer smells and feels great, not too heavy at all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Era Organics is blessedly fragrance free which is good news for me because i&#x27;m allergic to some essential oils (especially lavender) that cause my skin and eyes to burn, swell, and turn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kinda like smearing cool butter on my face haha.</li>
            <li> Looking for something organic, this stuff is great, goes on light and smooth, faint smell of honey which disappears after about 5 seconds on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they could add a nice pure essential oil to scent the product.</li>
            <li> The little bit of redness on my cheeks were no longer red, so I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Most lotion and cream just sits on top of your skin and makes you feel a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am very consistent on a certain moisturizer that I use and ALWAYS compare to that..</li>
            <li> But, what started happening is that instead of keeping my skin healthy and not dry, I basically get flakes all over my chin, mouth and nose...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> me, I actually love the smell - it smells like cocoa butter and fresh greek yogurt</li>
            <li> I really like the results so far, and if this is truly the one, I plan to give it as gifts to all my family and friends. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and my face isn&#x27;t getting dry, feels nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;The consistency, the lovely smell, the cost are all plus points as well, with the fact that it actually gets absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Non-GMO and organic as well.</li>
            <li> but, I can only image how great my entire body would feel using it.  </li>
            <li> It felt so good on my face and helped to soothe the dry spots that I was experiencing mainly around my eyes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, not heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that, much to my dismay, I can&#x27;t wear most sunblocks or I break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> It really does absorb quickly and keeps you hydrated.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment, placed the order on Wednesday and received it on Friday.  </li>
            <li> It is only the first night I know, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, you almost can&#x27;t apply too much, my face soaks up pretty quick any amount I throw on it.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, very much relieved.</li>
            <li> It has only quality products and makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very gentle</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> My wife is using the creme and she likes it very much</li>
            <li> Heals skin very very well.</li>
            <li> Did they use mass produced factory blends full of chemicals that make their skin feel a certain way or creates a certain smell?</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive skin and it has been fine.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t irritate my face in anyway and most importantly it doesn’t break me out like other creams with this consistency.</li>
            <li> After ten weeks of mostly daily use, my face is very soft and my complexion is as good as it can be, given that rosacea causes its own form of adult acne.</li>
            <li> The texture is rich, but it absorbs into your skin and makes it feel very soft.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is easily applied, quickly absorbed and creates a smooth supple quality to the skin not obtained from other products.</li>
            <li> It is a huge plus for me that this product is natural and unscented.</li>
            <li> Combination, mostly without problem, occasional bump once or twice a month&lt;</li>
            <li> First time user for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, my first concern is always the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that I know what the ingredients are, no scary sounding chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has this light soft texture to it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I decided to try their facial care products.  </li>
            <li> The product simply didn&#x27;t work for my skin but atleast it smells like chocolate! :)</li>
            <li> I love this cream and company, I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first</li>
            <li> In fact, I really dislike the sensation after using this Face Moisturizer - it creates a strange film that kind of pulls my skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> It is the first one I use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many rave reviews for this cream, but I can&#x27;t give the same testimonial.</li>
            <li> Light fluffy texture makes my skin feel soft, bright and radiant.</li>
            <li> It was an actual, personalized email from the seller, thanking me for my order with more info on the tracking.</li>
            <li> used it every 2 hours for the first couple weeks, then every 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Now, about a month later, my neck looks and feels much better</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know Tyler personally, but I&#x27;ve seen his comment replies here on Amazon, and he&#x27;s on top of customer complaints and</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know Tyler personally, but I&#x27;ve seen his comment replies here on Amazon, and he&#x27;s on top of customer complaints and</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream consistently in the mornings for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> My skin is more problematic now than when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it until it cleared up, and thought it would be ok to use after several days, but the same thing happened again, so I knew for sure</li>
            <li> My face actually looks more youthful.</li>
            <li> Feels like rubbing whipped butter on your face and keeps me very moisturized!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> That should give me several more months of using just one jar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be buying more next</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it will do the same for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not want to go on prescription medication from the dermatologist and decided to try this cream first.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feel so soft and smooth  .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try one first and see.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a daily moisturizer! :)</li>
            <li> This is a lovely cream which absorbs deeply into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it, though, mixed with another more moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> The reason I continue to use it is that it does seem to help my problem with facial redness, which seems better since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.</li>
            <li> While using it my skin if anything got more irritated and red</li>
            <li> I also wanted to say that Era Organics has stellar customer service.  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient is organic aloe, used for hundreds of years  to treat skin conditions and dryness.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I enthusiastically smeared it all over my face and immediately gagged.</li>
            <li> I guess that technically can&#x27;t be organic, but it would be great to use the product if I plan on sitting in the sun for a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty neutral to</li>
            <li> We will most likely order again.</li>
            <li> After cycling through so many products (some that worked, others that didn&#x27;t), this actually did the job.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to, and I know I&#x27;m not putting a ton of chemicals into my body whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing without being greasy!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what makes it feel so different, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I’m using all natural organic ingredients, free of main-stream cosmetic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I only need to put this on once a day, whereas the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past required 2 applications per day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not offensive, but it&#x27;s not what most people are accustomed to expect from personal care products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After three months of use, I still have some of my first jar left, and my acne is significantly better than before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and this product has helped me sooooooo much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the stuff I&#x27;ve been looking for my entire life.</li>
            <li> Thanks Era Organics!  </li>
            <li> It really did smell like chocolate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> it seems ok in helping with some facial redness.</li>
            <li> I have an occasional flare up around my monthly cycle, but a zinc supplement keeps that in check for the most part.</li>
            <li> Most organic moisturizers are this price or usually higher &amp; only come in a 2 oz container at the largest.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the product/ brand</li>
            <li> I usually find that moisturizers are either not moisturizing enough or make my foundation look to oily, however this has been perfect</li>
            <li> So glad to finally have found something that works!</li>
            <li> All in all, pretty bummed out.</li>
            <li> There was noticeable improvement on all areas within the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have used many brand name facial creams but this is wonderful and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Who am I. African-American, light complexion, 62 years old, living in a city that has 4 seasons.</li>
            <li> Although, it works so much better on lighter scars and open wound;</li>
            <li> Its better than feeling a ton of pimples on my back.</li>
            <li> many times I applied the cream on a daily basis: 2-3</li>
            <li> ;) .</li>
            <li> the cream isn&#x27;t greasy, feels good on the skin and per the labet there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super effective moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to write a rave review after reading all of the amazing ones here, however, I&#x27;m not so sure I can! :(</li>
            <li> My right arm, not so much...</li>
            <li> and although this product does not resemble la mer&#x27;s cream for me it satisfies what Im looking for in a cream, all natural organic ingredients is very important when you have sensitive skin like rosacea.</li>
            <li> so fine lines and anti-aging are a major concern.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for a moisturizer but it works great.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m seeing other products (am looking into Rose &amp; Pomegranate -</li>
            <li> It smells like cocoa and coconut but not as nice as I&#x27;ve smelt in other products.</li>
            <li> (I even tried straight, pure medical-grade Manuka honey, which was a sticky mess, but that stuff is good; and this cream contains some, which is good.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My family who are used seeing my face flaky noticed the difference after a week of use, my face became soft, clear and more youthful, my in laws are now using it</li>
            <li> Not only has it replaced my current avocado night cream, but it feels so good, I&#x27;m using it during the day now too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> deep moisturizing and hydration--- a definite wise choice of products</li>
            <li> And mostly I LOVE that it&#x27;s made with only natural non-toxic ingredients!!!</li>
            <li> Really soaks right in fast and no oiliness.</li>
            <li> Sinks right in (if that&#x27;s what you like, you&#x27;ll love this),</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me because my skin still felt dry.</li>
            <li> First two days I use this item, the itch stop and my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, just love it.</li>
            <li> and after seeing all the positive reviews on this I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> i always keep it at bedroom wihout too hot and too much sunshine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got excessively sensitive skin and have literally tried more than 15 different varieties of facial moisturizers (including all the top brands).  </li>
            <li> again I used only these two products and it stalled the rash progression for the first two days, and over the next 3-4 days I could tell it was better!</li>
            <li> I have not used store brands in forever and refuse to go back to chemicals, but if even this highly rated pure and organic cream does not keep my skin healthy, what will?</li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant, lol.</li>
            <li> Without a moisturizer, my skin is dry and crepey, but most moisturizers cause clogged pores, irritation or pimples (even at my age!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looked matte with a light glow but not dry or powdery at all.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin that leans more on the dry side towards the end of the night.</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my skin feel more dry, but I think a lot of these types of products tend to do so</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry and is more youthful.</li>
            <li> Not only is the scent very mild and comforting</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE July 2015:  I&#x27;ve been using this every single days, more than once a day, for six months already.</li>

            <li> Like any chemical reaction, this reaction requires certain conditions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer because I have a fairly large skin graft on my scalp and it needs to be kept hydrated to facilitate healing and to minimize damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly try it.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, the smell is a little unique, but not unpleasant and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and this cream is very soothing.</li>
            <li> but you will see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change I see are in the fine little cracks around my lips and on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> The texture was fine, but I definitely could not use it with the smell.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and my skin seems to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> There is emulsifying wax pretty high up on the ingredient list which causes my skin to get clogged.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good management.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to leave bad reviews, but I decided to do so, since the rest of the reviews seems way too appealing compared to what I experienced.  </li>
            <li> I review a lot of products, food, places, and whether good or bad I am always honest.</li>
            <li> They sent an email after I ordered, and another about a week later to ask if they could offer any assistance Must give them huge credit for taking care of their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never had huge zits, but had tiny bumps</li>
            <li> Once I put the cream on my face, it absorbed real quick and it won&#x27;t make my face greasy and heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know what to do anymore...</li>
            <li> so I tried gentle exfoliation thinking</li>
            <li> Politics and money dictate business so much and making money is the bottom line.</li>
            <li> Era Organics is very responsive with communication, does not evade the question, and promptly addresses issues.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really looked at the ingredients when I purchased it</li>
            <li> He then offered to not only refund my money, but asked if he could send me a jar for free.  </li>
            <li> My face used to look really oily as the day would go by</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a body lotion since it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference I was still dreaming way too much and</li>
            <li> Oh, I should mention that I have very acne-prone combination skin.</li>
            <li> For my purposes, it didn&#x27;t work very well though.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this face cream.  </li>
            <li> I also really like using it on my dry/ cracked hands</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> it has really saved my skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take too much to go around and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> They helped VERY little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> My neck is much, much, much improved.</li>
            <li> My neck is much, much, much improved.</li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight;</li>
            <li> so much so that I wondered if it would have any effect at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn’t take much at all to leave your face refreshed and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this cream, not oily and really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> this moisturizers is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It calms and heals up my dermatitis really fast.</li>
            <li> The owner of the company is very involved &amp; will answer any questions.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like how it keeps my skin hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> The smell really turned me off of this product.</li>
            <li> Expected more from this cream ( based on the reviews)</li>
            <li> the consistency helped blend my undereye foundation really well.</li>
            <li> and my face did not change much although it includes everything my skin need</li>
            <li> I bought this for her hoping it would be gentle on her skin</li>
            <li> and I were both very happ  with the product.</li>
            <li> I have very allergy prone skin</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very moist during the day and is not greasy</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely putrid.</li>
            <li> I really felt compelled to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This cream is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> HEALS AND CALMS MY VERY IRRITATED SKIN</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, and it isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li> So I try lots of different lotions to see if any fit the criteria of keeping my hands moist</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Further, it is truly scent free,</li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks it up fast.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much brighter.</li>
            <li> (I have very oily skin)</li>
            <li> it keeps my face moisturized really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the face.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m so much</li>
            <li> skin is so much</li>
            <li> stinging or burning the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Although the ingredients list is very challenging to read, Not sure all that is in it.</li>
            <li> This is a very think cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think the manuka ingredients in this product works very well for healing the skin.</li>
            <li> Now that it is the cold season, it&#x27;s the best time to test how well it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t really a fragrance to speak of, to my mind,  </li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like all the ingredients are very nourishing and hydrating.</li>
            <li> and I highly reccomend both of these products!</li>
            <li> It has a matte finish and an unusual texture</li>
            <li> Very waxy texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 5 mos now and my rosacea has really improved.</li>
            <li> It is gentle.</li>
            <li> Really feels nurturing .</li>
            <li> I just really dislike the fact that it&#x27;s so pasty.</li>
            <li> This face lotion works really well.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t help me much with the dryness issue.  </li>
            <li> My husband dislikes the smell intensely, would prefer I wear a scent</li>
            <li> Use as needed across your whole body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but after I am done with this tub I won&#x27;t be buying another one just because it doesn&#x27;t really do much for me aside from smelling of cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> ON ECZEMA: Eczema turned my boyfriend&#x27;s hand into leather, skin cracking off all over -- sometimes very reddish, looking like it was burnt.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is absolutely unbearable (it almost smells</li>
            <li> I have used straight aloe (from the plant) and manuka honey to try to correct my issues and was seeing some benefit.</li>
            <li> I have problems with eczema, and this really helps to sooth it.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t describe the smell unless you smell it for yourself.</li>
            <li> So I am very cautious in what ingredients are in the products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li> and there really isn&#x27;t any cons I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I do really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Way better than I expected, moisturizes for hours.  </li>
            <li> I really want to like it--and I do, in some ways.</li>
            <li> My theory is that the thickness I spoke of earlier starts to suffocate my pores and they try to break free be producing geysers of sweat.</li>
            <li> In studies where mice have been fed a substantial diet of sodium benzoate, the data clearly indicate that their life expectancies were not shortened, nor was any notable health affect present at all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In studies where mice have been fed a substantial diet of sodium benzoate, the data clearly indicate that their life expectancies were not shortened, nor was any notable health affect present at all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice heavy moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or develop a rash.</li>
            <li> I am recently acne prone and most products ( even natural and/or organic ) irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used, to name a few products, SteriLid Cleaner, Aveno Eczema cream, Neosporin for Eczema, Organic Coconut oil, Organic Rose Hip seed oil, baby shampoo, and a prescription steroid cream</li>
            <li> The formula is super thick, but blends very easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has no strong scent is light, goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> As someone who wears makeup and is constantly testing out new products, this is seriously my favorite new moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I even used it right over my (extremely sensitive) eye area, which I would never do with a department store cream.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few days,  I am very fortunate that I do not have acne, dry or oily skin, and have a good complexion .  </li>
            <li> How can such rich cream still not moisturize and protect my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I used the entire 4 oz and did not notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I must say, after being an Amazon Prime member for several years, I have never purchased a product and then received a personalized, friendly email from the seller.</li>
            <li> There are many things I cannot use or eat due to my severe sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Much more than the other creams and homeopathic stuff</li>
            <li> I like it more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - including Aveda.</li>
            <li> So many lotions have been ruined due to manufacturers making their product creamy and to perserve it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the cream is thick, it feels very light when applied, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s natural and has no smell - I&#x27;m funny about smells and some really bother me.</li>
            <li> you get good amount for your money considering other brands which charge alot more for a lot less and still cause my back and face to break out .</li>
            <li> I received the new jar the very NEXT day and it was odor free.  </li>
            <li> Better than some perfume smell right under my nose, which usually triggers off my allergy.  </li>
            <li> the clay is very wet and musty, or mixed with a different kind of dirt or a bit spoiled or some kind of similar smell.</li>
            <li> It has been far better for my dry skin than another high-end night cream that I was using for years.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and easy (it&#x27;s quite thick)</li>
            <li> I have THE most sensitive and dry skin on the planet</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a good amount because I only need less than a pea size for my face.</li>
            <li> I typically break out with many moisturizers but after 2 weeks of using this my acne has actually seen a significant decrease</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a huge plus that the ingredients are natural and it&#x27;s gentle enough to go around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I believe what I have is &#x27;minor ezcema&#x27; which resemble a light rash that you would get as if you were allergic to something.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Proof I liked it: I ordered 3 jars that arrived this past week, using the promo code here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> for a few persistent eczema patches  LOVE the fresh natural scent.  </li>
            <li> He also refunded the full purchase price of the product with no return necessary.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied this moisturizer I didn&#x27;t see any difference, but by the end of the day I noticed that my skin tone had evened out, which was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li> I was in the process of completely eliminating the toxic items in my health and beauty regime elements and this was the first moisturizer I found that lived up to and even exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not bad - just different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and silky, has a soft natural cocoa smell that dissipates, and is so nice and thick that you feel like you&#x27;ll never have to put on lotion again.</li>
            <li> Light but really moisturizers my very dry skin</li>
            <li> Live this cream!  </li>
            <li> This is my new staple face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> VERY good cream for sensitive and fussy skin--very calming and soothing and softening without the weird ingredients of steroid creams.</li>
            <li> VERY good cream for sensitive and fussy skin--very calming and soothing and softening without the weird ingredients of steroid creams.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed, unscented (unlike so many other natural/organic products) and simply glides on and m-e-l-t-s into your skin.  </li>
            <li> And not sure if the dissatisfied reviewers got a different batch, but the consistency of the cream I received is very smooth and light.  </li>
            <li> Here is a quick side note; once you have been using the cream, it becomes easier and easier to clean and the new application is gone in less then a minute.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I swear I have noticed a difference in the quality of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it: softer, less prominent wrinkles, improvement in texture.</li>
            <li> My condition looks much better and in less than 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I received my jar of cream today, after having ordered it early Friday morning, I really appreciate the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I would probably try it again once my skin clears up as I do think it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> from that, it smells decent.</li>
            <li> Though it is very dense as I said above, it permeates the skin real fast and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> The cream is a decent moisturizer and is non greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely only use this product from here on out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it mainly on my hands, arms and legs.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked or felt better and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this moisturizer earlier on in life!  </li>
            <li> I have searched for nearly 6 years for the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; and spent too many dollars to admit---</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers are the same, especially since I am allergic to lanolin.</li>
            <li> I quickly ordered a second jar to try on my psoriosis.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and I love the light coconut scent from the coconut oil that&#x27;s in the product.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this is a very natural product</li>
            <li> It has a definite softening effect to the face, but I&#x27;m over 60 and need a little more moisture than most, so it didn&#x27;t work as a facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The owner was very friendly and helpful, and offered a refund and sent me a new tub when I put up my original review, thinking that it might have spoiled in transit due to the warehouse not being temperature controlled, but the second tub was the same as the first.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and even now, considering buying another cream,  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and Era Organics.</li>
            <li> product is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a highly allergic type person, since childhood.</li>
            <li> will note that the owner, Tyler, seems to be highly responsive to customer issues.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> even high end ones, til era organics came into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to acne sufferers who like to wear make up.</li>
            <li> My cousins 3 month old baby had craddle cap and after testing a bit on the back of his arm to make sure he was not allergic, she gently washed a dime sized amount into his scalp and left it in while he was in the bath.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> highly anticipated jar arrived today and as soon as I opened it my heart sank.</li>
            <li> and she speaks highly of this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for who are suffering from acne and oily skin like myself.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream because of the high reviews.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended on purchasing from this company.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or weighted down.</li>
            <li> After the first day of trying this product, it helped me eliminated oil on my face significantly, and it claim down my acne a lot.</li>
            <li> This little 4 oz jar has so many uses.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li> My sister has a little more oily skin and she can use it without getting break outs as well.</li>
            <li> this by far is the winner!!</li>
            <li> I used on him as well as the dry room conditions really effect and affect him tremendously.</li>
            <li> In fact my whole chin area now seems old and bumpy...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the Ingredients that make up what could have been a great product; Aloe, shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, hemp seed oil, all sorts of vitamins and minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it lists some of the weird stuff like; Methyl Sufonyl Methane, Glycerine, Capric Triglyceride, Saccharomyces/Copper Ferment, Saccharomyces/Magnesium Ferment Hydrolysate, Saccharomyces/Potassium Ferment Hydrolysate, Adenosine Triphosphate and the list goes on and one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The face lotion I was using worked great but was too expensive.</li>
            <li> you could see where all the cradle cap was and how much the Complete helped remove.</li>
            <li> The manuka honey is a natural antibacterial and is very healing.  </li>
            <li> Prompt, professional and really knows the product.  </li>
            <li> far as the tendency for the cream to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; as it dries, I noticed that too when I was using too much of it at once.</li>
            <li> It has done the trick and kept these calloused rough hands moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s all natural too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious about what I use on my face because I have sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed the scars fading faster than normal.</li>
            <li> It feels normal to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all normal and has been for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all normal and has been for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire teenage life and at 27 I really wanted to find a more natural alternative to achieve clear</li>
            <li> Within a month my jar is pretty much just white - all the ink rubbed off on my hands.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll thank you later; I feel fresh and moisturized</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various moisturizers these past 7-8 months, and most of them are okay, but none of them equal this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like lotions and cream to actually gets absorbed into your skin like water.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many things over the years and have wasted a lot of money.</li>
            <li> and I normally need lots of lotion</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY creams since developing rosacea a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I was expecting same size for the price, but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> Most face products usually make me break out because I have a very acne prone skin, but ever since I started using this product I never broke out</li>
            <li> Wow, the first time I tried it my face felt so soft and cured my chronic dryness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reaction to the ingredients, which sometimes I normally do</li>
            <li> I notice I don&#x27;t break out as much as I usually normally do.</li>
            <li> I had new fresh wounds on my face due to my acne and I applied the cream on it right away</li>
            <li> Both my boyfriend and I very strongly dislike the smell of this cream, which is strong enough for us both to smell it even when the cream is already spread out thinly on my face.</li>
            <li> This product really surprised me with how quickly it handled my dry hands and also didn&#x27;t wear off quickly as most other products I have tried seem to do.</li>
            <li> This particular reaction is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> This particular reaction is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I live high in the mountains (8,200 ft) in a ski resort.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer in a long time!</li>
            <li> kids are super sensitive to products (as am I) especially my ds.</li>
            <li> issue:&lt;br /&gt;After starting to use, I felt it was greasy, but it went right into my skin.</li>
            <li> want to send it right back, like 10 minutes ago.</li>
            <li> right and left</li>
            <li> soothing and no strong smell :)</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t get around to writing reviews, but I must say as someone who has tried a gazillion different moisturizers (from Khiel&#x27;s, Elizabeth Arden, Creme de la Mer to Aveeno) expensive and cheap, Era is by far the best value.</li>
            <li> I like that my hands don&#x27;t feel all sticky after I rub it in like with other cheap creams.</li>
            <li> I dab on a little more in the spots that are patchy and it has completely remedied my problem spots.</li>
            <li> As of right now I do plan to repurchase when I finish this jar and am also interested in trying other Era Organics products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new night cream and decided to try Era Organics.</li>
            <li> After traveling to New Zealand and seeing all of the hype around Manuka honey</li>
            <li> I tried a new product already complimented my new radiance and skin improvement.</li>
            <li> AND I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li> This is my new staple for my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> oh well... off to a new product then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, side effects associated with excess sodium benzoate are only linked to HUGE consumption internally in foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, side effects associated with excess sodium benzoate are only linked to HUGE consumption internally in foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually would give it 4.5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF, and I&#x27;m not really used to creams (I have mostly used lotions)</li>
            <li> My hands are too!&lt;br /&gt;I find the aroma and consistency of the product very agreeable; puzzled my folks who don&#x27;t, especially since the aroma is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell was subtle and nice.  </li>
            <li> Jar lasted pretty long for the price (I would say about almost 2 months depending how much you use it-</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to odors and this product does not cause me any difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that has not been irritated at all.</li>
            <li> Having I used high end products up until this point, I can tell the quality difference immediately when applied to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and it worked well for that,</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone, Rosacea skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, Rosacea and psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> This cream leaves my hands feeling very soft, and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturiser that is neither too mild nor too thick with full absorption.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my oily sensitive skin, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent and has a smooth creamy, thick feel to it (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even seeing my acne start to clear up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s helping to clear up my blemishes as well!</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I buy complete for my 25-yr-old daughter and she loves it!  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft!  </li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft not oilly!</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft, vibrant... And surprisingly less acne.</li>
            <li> Everything else in my skincare regimen is exactly the same but</li>
            <li> , I agreed to this when I applied it on my face for the first time, but then I got used to it and actually like the smell of it now and dont have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> There was a very short, tingling/burning sensation at first</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first dealing with this company and I look forward to ordering again when this jar runs low.</li>
            <li> After only a short period of time I have noticed a significant softening of my skin and with sun damage and 66 years of age</li>
            <li> At first there were tiny dots of lymph I had to blot off my skin, but</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I applied it to the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually soft for once and can now bend normally.</li>
            <li> I truly hope their are some hair products on the way because natural hair needs lots of it!</li>
            <li> but it has eliminated the irritation in that time and brought instant relief to the itchy stinging sensations after the first use.</li>
            <li> First came back and said it was &#x27;SUPPRESSED&#x27; for some reason.  </li>
            <li> That says a lot for my sensitive, oily and acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive, dry, acne and blackhead prone.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and clean, moisturizes my face, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling wet or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many very expensive creams for my aging skin (I&#x27;m 55), but most also cause me a reaction--no matter how hypoallergenic or high end--so I end up using Lubriderm sensitive and</li>
            <li> I have never really used any anti-aging skin care because I haven&#x27;t really needed it till now, but I&#x27;m starting to get some roughness and increased fine lines with certain facial expressions.  </li>
            <li> I did the same for my ds and around troublesome areas usually like his nose or top of the forehead where it can become super dry in certain conditions (like hospitals)</li>
            <li> really recommend this, after the first day i noticed much better less dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s smooth and the marks are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s smooth and the marks are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have peri-oral dermatitis and this has been thr first product I found that didnt aggravate my rash and actually helped it clear up.</li>
            <li> and I easily get sensitivity reactions after a few minutes using a product</li>
            <li> I have added a couple other staples to my regimen ( Vitamin C Serum ) and phytoceramides and am excited by the results so far.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so this jar should last me a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that I have had positive results with.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see just how small dabs will be sufficient to get smooth soft hands, your skin will be very moisturized and glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often hesitant to try new creams for fear they won&#x27;t be gentle enough.  </li>
            <li> It is half the price and double the size of the stuff I was getting before and works even better.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more emollient, was looking for something like the la mer moisturizing cream which is super expensive</li>
            <li> So personally for me it was clogging my pores, but for people with more dry skin it might work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason why I gave only 3 stars to the product is it took forever to absorb to my skin.</li>
            <li> Using less and spreading it further over my face, neck, and upper chest resolved that issue nicely.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell, not a bad smell, but not one you would be familiar with as other skin care products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick and dries within a few minutes leaving your skin feeling super soft, moisturized, but not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I actually added Frank to it to make it a little better for my skin</li>
            <li> Due to the non-greasy characteristic of this cream I am able to use it on my scalp without having problems with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my dry hands moisture for a significant period of time, but just isn&#x27;t quit enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this clear of skin since I was a pre-teen.</li>
            <li> This cream not only moisturizes very well, but my skin is so soft as well.  </li>
            <li> I really have to be careful not to use too much of this product because it can clog my pours.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but its definitely not for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tyler of Era Organics deserves credit for following up very well with customer service.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it melts into the skin and keeps it soft all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scent sensitive</li>
            <li> It helped clear a lot of my acne so far</li>
            <li> With such an offer, I decided I really was not taking any risk and made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is still early in my use of it</li>
            <li> The site on my leg from which the skin graft was taken is also fading and the skin remains soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> So far I have nothing but praise for this product.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a luxurious consistency that immediately absorbs into your skin, leaving it soft and supple, not one bit of greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Where to begin, I bought this product because of its natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> After much trial and error and internet research I found out I was experiencing the classical side effects of MSM.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin, and this has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin that I have been trying to control for years now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance, just the sent of the natural ingredients that are used to make it.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a product for sensitive, acne prone skin---this is what you need to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This, the facial one, the eczema (all the same really) work very well.</li>
            <li> This, the facial one, the eczema (all the same really) work very well.</li>
            <li> Its so light weight and fluffy, you will never want to use anything else, I promise.</li>
            <li> You can tell by the feel of the cream and the smell that the ingredients are natural and organic.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because of all the natural ingredients that are in it.</li>
            <li> I bragged about these products to my 25 year old daughter and now she is hooked on the products as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> If you put too much on, it won&#x27;t absorb properly, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This one seemed like the ingredients were all natural</li>
            <li> Natural, Organic, Healing, Parabens Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe it is because it gives your skin the natural boost it needs to hydrate itself and maintain the oils you develop naturally.</li>
            <li> Leaves her skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It smelled like old vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although I am a fan of all natural products, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne that flares up</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try natural products.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have used this organic moisturizer for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> that this is natural.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and rashes from some health conditions that this cream completely takes it away.</li>
            <li> Natural organic not greasy cream.</li>
            <li> It has kept away the bit of redness I get around my nose, and it has begun to heal some of my old acne scars.  </li>
            <li> It is lush, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> so I added some Wild Orange doTerra oil and problem solved.</li>
            <li> It is all natural, there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li> Not with Complete by Era-Organics.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and breaks out from almost anything but after wearing the Era Organics moisturizer cream my skin has completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> I like it for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> have cystic adult acne, and have tried *everything* to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a first in a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far it has not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and so far this product works well</li>
            <li> My husband has psoriasis and is sensitive to a lot of lotions that I</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s organic, the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> but instead you feel supple and soft.</li>
            <li> After three days of using Complete, the Rosacea was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> The cream is moisturizing but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin so soft...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> always use moisturizer and this has by far exceeded all my expectation and has become my fave</li>
            <li> (and that&#x27;s a lot of years of comparison and getting me to switch from my old trusty</li>
            <li> That has to be my number on complaint of most lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face feels really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> I am 77years old and</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, especially when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to stop the oiliness completely because its not how it works.</li>
            <li> moisturizer does have a lil bit of chocolaty smell to it so those who are sensitive to smell might consider that.</li>
            <li> I have annoyingly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> which is a naturally occurring sulfur compound that aids in the production of collagen and keratin (bear with me, I&#x27;m a bit of a nerd) as well as detoxification.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week only at night because I have oily skin and use an oil absorbing moisturizer in the mornings.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost used one jar, and my skin is unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think perhaps I am just so used to chemically laden aromas that I have lost some appreciation for natural smells that aren&#x27;t floral.</li>
            <li> Since I prefer natural products, I was looking for a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; to make using the two of them when I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> I still have acne on my back, but they are not as much as before.</li>
            <li> so far is the texture of the cream.</li>
            <li> I buy unscented products frequently</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the reviews were good and the ingredients didn&#x27;t seem to be problematic (although I worried about the algae component, as I am sensitive to iodine and seafood of all kinds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is thick and lovely.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to EVERYTHING, so finding a good, and affordable, moisturizer is a difficult task.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I left this review, the company contacted me and explained it was probably a left over jar that didn&#x27;t get sold right away</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, especially people with sensitive skin !</li>
            <li> Used pretty much every single over-the-counter cream/lotion/treatments across different brands and had eventually settled with an Aveno product.</li>
            <li> I also went to the ERA Organics website and love that ERA is a small family based business!  </li>
            <li> In this short time, I&#x27;ve already been able to eliminate all other serums/creams/moisturizers from my daily skincare routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the cream for three days in a row, his fingers are nearly back to normal!</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it very quickly, unlike some creams which seem to sit there like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 6 months and this was the first winter that I didn&#x27;t have any issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and much like the other 3 star reviewers, it just isn&#x27;t as much of a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> I have facial eczema and it has really helped calm it down.</li>
            <li> After a few applications the dry area on my face improved and my dried hands felt great just after one application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product overall.  </li>
            <li> It does have a light &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; effect, so while I use it on my face when I&#x27;m at home, I&#x27;m less likely to use it under makeup, where the cream can pill a bit if you rub in foundation, cream blush, etc.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, very dry facial and neck skin and lead an active life with many outdoor activities - gardening, dog walking, bicycling.  </li>
            <li> My rosy chapped cheeks are healed and my face feels supple keeping me ready for long days in the sun.</li>
            <li> No scales, no pustules, not dark striations.</li>
            <li> No scales, no pustules, not dark striations.</li>
            <li> At first, the cream even helped the rosacea redness, but as the weather has warmed up I&#x27;m constantly pink again.</li>
            <li> When I started using this, I noticed that when I woke up the next morning, my face was not as oily as it normally would be.</li>
            <li> my skin is mostly back to normal.</li>
            <li> It does have a little smell which dissipates really quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy the mud mask and cleanser and hope you continue to come out with new beauty products in the future (specifically a shampoo and conditioner product!).</li>
            <li> and I live deep in the desert, which seems to amplify the condition.  </li>
            <li> It also is not oily nor greasy - I live in South Florida and just walking outside creates a sweat bonanza</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as much as I&#x27;d like around some of my really dry areas but</li>
            <li> After years of trying different moisturizers finally found the one that really works.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker cream (but not heavy feeling), so I do have to be careful not to use too much when applying it in my t zone as it can make it a bit oily.</li>
            <li> The company told me that this has similar ingredients to their Relief cream, which is really convenient and a big reason why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it to be super soft and feel moist but although it doesn&#x27;t dry it out, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t fully moisturize like it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to use it entirely to make the money that I spent worth it.</li>
            <li> Better than the expensive creams that have fillers and actually don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I have mild breakouts all the time and a few acne scars.</li>
            <li> I took a whim and ordered this lotion on Amazon and it healed my skin tremendously in a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for being late to leave a really great review on this product!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive and itchy  skin, I only use Vaseline</li>
            <li> It actually made my face feel more tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfect when I got a really bad sunburn!  </li>
            <li> In order for this reaction to move at a noticeable rate, it needs heat and oxygen, in the absence of sugars and many common cosmetic ingredients.</li>

            <li> I can tell a major difference because it is lighter on my face than chemical moisturizers.</li>
            <li> There are several creams on Amazon with the exact same ingredient list and price, but sold under different brands.</li>
            <li> It is the first moisturizer I have used that has actually helped heal my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it is generally normal to dry, but no problems.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I have dry skin that gets oily once in a while, but this mask keeps my face surely balanced.</li>
            <li> Now, while I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, I will say I have no new break outs and noticed a difference in my skin the first day.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, but absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave the face feeling oily!</li>
            <li> (ph balanced without any sulfate a, alcohols, etc) and follow up with a spray mixture of pure, organic hemp seed oil (Zero on comedogenic scale) pure vitamin e oil (bought online; store vitamin e has additive ingredients) unscented alcohol-free witch hazel, some filtered water, and recently added niacinamide (vitamin b3) and green tea in powder form from a site that sells bulk ingredients to make at-home skin</li>

            <li> it is always super dry, but then I have to be careful applying oily lotions.</li>
            <li> Unlike Khiel&#x27;s facial fuel which you had to use a lot of only to get a decent amount of moisture, Era requires a fingerful at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I noticed the top ingredient in the cream is coconut oil which is highly comedogenic (</li>

            <li> I have wasted so much money on creams and lotions that do not even compare to the high quality of this face cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t smooth and the areas around my cheek were red and a little bumpy, but not pimple-bumpy where you could see individual bumps.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never ever been this clear in ten years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has never ever been this clear in ten years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within the week of using this product so far, I can actually SEE a difference.</li>
            <li> scent barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After following the lovevitamin blog, I&#x27;ve switched into an all natural skincare routine and was introduced into the benefits of mms and manuka honey, hence my excitement when I found this product.</li>
            <li> This has no smell, nothing to irritate your skin, only natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only used this as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> No, not really, but how can one really tell without anything to compare it to?  </li>
            <li> Thank you Era Organics for finally giving me a natural product that does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> My face feels extra soft and maybe even ...</li>
            <li> The relief cream seems to hydrate through several layers of skin so as to keep it soft and from drying out.</li>
            <li> and now there is barely even a noticeable scar there.</li>
            <li> I barely notice it now.</li>
            <li> Works for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin and just as well for my sensitive skinned teen.</li>
            <li> only thing I am scared about is finally finding a product and a company doing what they normally do and &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to acne and this lotion has helped my acne rather than made it worse as most lotions do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for: natural cream without all the harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> But, when I use a thin layer at night - I love it. . .</li>
            <li> Its thick, smooth, and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a large tub and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I actually used on his chese in a certain area due to what was taking place and it kept his skin soft and supple and helped I think to keep it from inflammation and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked to see if the acne scars on my back are lighten; I don&#x27;t expect it to be because the scars on my back are super dark.</li>
            <li> I have my new jars in the fridge, since I don&#x27;t know how well they will last outside of refrigeration.</li>
            <li> I am 30 with normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy like many other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> very faint, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> A little background first: I have dry and sensitive skin that overcompensates resulting in oily skin throughout the day, resulting in frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have used have been petroleum based and made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li> I live in the west, where it&#x27;s really dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the price is high, you only need to apply a small amount to notice the positive effects.</li>
            <li> It has made my face and neck look ten years younger so far...</li>
            <li> The only lasting impact is that your skin will feel extremely soft (almost like silk) and definitely not dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has incredibly sensitive skin and these products have only soothed her skin and it is no longer red or itchy.  </li>
            <li> Not dry, just firmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that is really heavy while still being quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and plan to get more of this brand simply for that reason.</li>
            <li> These areas are not a dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I really like it - the texture is good, it moisturizes without being greasy, I even like the smell of cocoa that some people seem to hate.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> and my daughter has very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> In a week and a half of using this cream, I have not had one new blemish pop up, and the old blemishes are healing well or gone!  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little funny</li>
            <li> Smells a little funny</li>
            <li> At first it smells like clay, but as I smell it a little longer, it smells to me like</li>
            <li> product is a little thick, not oily, smooth to apply, and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> but I barely could notice it and since my skin didn&#x27;t turn red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and have no regrets, will purchase and recommend to product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Sometimes at night if I feel I need an extra moisturizer due to dryness, I&#x27;ll use this cream on top of the other 3 things and it works to seal in the other ingredients and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or over moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not taking anything for my skin issues anymore, and I rarely get even a small spot that causes me problems.  </li>
            <li> Although it feels heavy when you first put it on your skin, it immediately absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> The first thing I ever tried from this company was their grapefruit scented Dead Sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich, creamy and luxurious, it has every ingredient you need for terrific skin.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;In fact extremely large amounts of Sodium Benzoate would need to be ingested in order to produce even slight toxic consequences for the body.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;In fact extremely large amounts of Sodium Benzoate would need to be ingested in order to produce even slight toxic consequences for the body.</li>
            <li> But I also have very sensitive skin, allergic to sulfates and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, but still easily absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed when I put it on my bare, dry skin (long after washing) it didn&#x27;t absorb as well, which is unfortunately normal because the face wash</li>
            <li> The price seemed a bit high, but the jar is a very generous 4 ounces compared to the others who have only 2 ounces for the same price, and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But just a small amount of cream gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li> I had stopped using the steroid cream for about 4 days and the rash was returning as usual right when these products came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for a very long time yet (not even a week yet), but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference so far.</li>
            <li> But my skin is clear now and not as dry as before.</li>
            <li> This cream completely solved my dry, peeling winter skin on my face.</li>
            <li> The dry patches have shrunken considerably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also moisturizes dry and over worked hands, I scrubbed out pots and pans after this past Thanksgiving dinner last week, if you&#x27;ve used abrasive cleansers and brillo pads and you&#x27;ve spent 1/2  hour or more in water</li>
            <li> So coming from someone who has struggled with life long rough skin and acne, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 75 different moisturizers in the past few years and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tyler of Era Organics deserves credit for following up very well with customer service.they are, the less we like them for the body (</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight film leftover if I apply too much of the product, but scaling back the amount applied resolved that issue immediately.</li>
            <li> It even works on my eyelids, which are very dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, but very thick.  </li>
            <li> and I know for sure that it will help with anyone who suffers from a skin condition or has sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> I had eczema when I was very young and as I got older found I had allergic reactions to ingredients like aluminum in common products such as deodorant.</li>
            <li> It has been on my skin for over half an hour now and what normally would be extremely oily after any other moisturizer, my skin is still just as moisturized and non-oily as when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> Also this lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a film across your skin -- it soaks into your skin right away and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling thick and gooey, like how fancy name-brand lotions affect me.</li>
            <li> Only one has worked over the years, Nivea for men sensitive skin formula, and that particular lotion leaves an oily sheen on my face but at least it didn&#x27;t cause irritations like all the others.</li>
            <li> I only got one pimple so far using this product, but it keeps the other pimples at bay from what I notice</li>
            <li> Not only has it not broken me out, a little goes a long way and there&#x27;s no oily finish.  </li>
            <li> The cream is really moisturizing, a little does go a long way, I can tell it&#x27;ll last for a while</li>
            <li> I do take spirnolactone but other than that these products have given me relatively clear</li>
            <li> Gave some to my friend who has dark circles/baggy eyes, and WOW!</li>
            <li> Other products are making me break out including my natural lotion I make</li>
            <li> This is A LOT of progress that other natural lotions never came close to.</li>
            <li> My nose turned a little red but that is normal for me.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist gave me a prescription cream that did nothing for me except make my skin feel very tight, dry and hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy working mom with an active family and household, and I find myself washing my hands often throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Obviously not a big deal since your bigger concern presumably would be to get the redness off your face (since you did stumble upon this product).  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time organic make-up and skin care consumer and have tried various companies prior.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would even take occasional clogged pore or pimple if only I did not have these dry patches afterwards...</li>
            <li> The knuckles on my left hand got so dry, they were crusty and starting to crack.</li>
            <li> not really sure what causes acne, but my face is very oily when I woke up</li>
            <li> It really made a whole lot of difference, but now I still got little specs (dot-like) of scars there, but the dark scar patches are a little bit gone.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need too much to cover a small area on your body or where ever you apply the product on.</li>
            <li> I do like the product, and one jar should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It might have been acne or regular pimples or a minor allergy to my surroundings, etc.  </li>
            <li> it is suppose to help with your acne, but apparently, not for me.</li>
            <li> I had very dry patches on my face and red  irritated marks above my eyebrows (probably from rubbing and scratching).  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for about a week, and except for one place on my hand (which was particularly inflamed and raw)</li>
            <li> these dry patches have become daily occurrence with this cream...</li>
            <li> white dry patches...</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Only thing is my skin is a combination of oily and dry</li>
            <li> two applications healed persistent, red, dry, and flaky patches of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years (decades rather as I am 50yo) for a facial moisturizer that neither clogs pores nor leaves my skin still dry and flaky after washing.  </li>
            <li> With winter time approaching, my skin get dry...</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit odd, as this is an unscented cream, so I guess what I&#x27;m smelling is the natural smells of lanolin and oils.  </li>
            <li> I ordered with Amazon Prime and the 4oz cream actually came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and I currently don&#x27;t have a single breakout.  </li>
            <li> , seems to be the same formula as the other Era Organics cream that comes in the same type jar (the one for eczema).</li>
            <li> , seems to be the same formula as the other Era Organics cream that comes in the same type jar (the one for eczema).</li>
            <li> I use it daily and double up and put on thicker coats after home glycolic peels or other harsher face treatments.  </li>
            <li> I had to apply a few layers since my skin is dry, but it never felt heavy and absorbed quite well.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple drugstore night creams and still had very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My face gets very dry after washing and at the same time I can&#x27;t use oily moisturizers because of acne problems and the non-oily moisturizers</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and plan on using year round!!!</li>
            <li> the cream gets all lumpy (cream starts to roll into a ball/lump, idk how to describe it) because its having a hard time absorbing into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I live on the water where it is very windy most days and get dry patches so bad!!</li>
            <li> It almost looks like I have dried milk on me, and make up cannot cover this, not even the natural mineral powders.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturize her skin after long practices.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this gem after searching for an organic product, after using Murad for so long.</li>
            <li> This is strange...</li>
            <li> (and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else mention it), but once the lotion sinks in, in about a minute, my skin actually feels a bit tighter.</li>
            <li> witch hazel toner have give me the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I MENTION; THIS STUFF GOES A LONG WAY?</li>
            <li> Goes a long way, not watery.  </li>
            <li> it was a long shot</li>
            <li> so I feel like I will be using this for a long time without running out.</li>
            <li> and I believe has helped my minor chin breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> I know it works, but, I don&#x27;t understand why they have to use those long names on the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Also, I had been looking for a LONG time for a face moisturizer that worked well under my makeup/foundation</li>
            <li> It works really very well especially in combination with aloe vera gel for me smoothing skin and diminishing the appearance of scars noticed after a few days, using for a few weeks .</li>
            <li> Redness and bumps calmed down after second application and the irritation has totally subsided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead with pale freckled skin.</li>
            <li> The dry mountain air has really made my face look dry and  dull.</li>
            <li> I am very particular in my skin regime and from past few months I have been purchasing only organic products.</li>
            <li> I also had dark patches due to scratching and picking on my acne at the side of my face and neck and these were old scars already</li>
            <li> If I only use this, and nothing else, not Cetaphil or any other &amp;</li>
            <li> and then every other day and still seeing the same results.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in September 2014 due to starting Accutane treatment for some acne problems.</li>
            <li> Probably go back to my other moisturizer products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products this Era Organics releases in the future.</li>
            <li> It has no offensive smell, you get double the amount for the money compared to other organic creams.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to applying it to my face which is a little above and beyond what I expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels moisturized all day long, even after a workout and sweating!</li>
            <li> and you only need a tiny little bit each time you use it.</li>
            <li> Guessing due to because I apply the cream on my face twice daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the cold NYC winter, hot high desert in CA and coastal San Diego climate...and</li>
            <li> Very strange smell as well.</li>
            <li> As a woman of color, I have used raw shea butter and heavier natural oils just to keep my skin hydrated</li>
            <li> I like that this one is made mostly with organic products and at the same time does not clog pores and helps with acne and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is dry I often reapply this a couple of times in the morning/at night because my skin just drinks it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any dry patches or flaking skin.</li>
            <li> my skin has become dry in some places and oily in others.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and during the day if my skin feels dry after washing it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Results were not immediate, but with each use, the dry areas continue to improve.</li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism which causes my skin to be really dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin, and it still feels dry after using this cream.  </li>
            <li> It feels like there is a dry film coating my skin.</li>
            <li> My hands get really, really dry during winters, and they eventually start cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I am yet to have my husband trying it on his dry hands.</li>
            <li> I searched all over the internet for an organic face cream that would help heal the dry patches on my face from this relentless winter weather.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as it&#x27;s wintertime and with gas heat, we get extremely dry in our home.</li>
            <li> It was basically dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My faceNEVER feels dry.</li>
            <li> After I tried the department store foundation, my skin became dry and patchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Helped my chronically dry and calloused hands.</li>
            <li> Too dry or too humid.</li>
            <li> Noxzema helps my acne disappears, but makes my face dry and sometimes flaky.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of using this cream, I am starting to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only con, the container is a lot smaller than the dead sea mask.  </li>
            <li> I will never live without this.</li>
            <li> Unless you are single and wearing this to bed alone, you may find a distance between you and your partner.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream religiously, or with combination of other less greasy gel, no matter what I do, the day I use this cream, I immediately notice the gross dry patches.</li>
            <li> so just using a little goes a long way therefore lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin due to Accutane and other moisturizers would not last long.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and am past menopause.  </li>
            <li> Complete, works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> Ended up using a thin layer of organic coconut oil first, than a layer of this.  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared at first when I saw how thick the cream was</li>
            <li> Especially since you only need very little.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and beginning to age (yikes!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for week and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost half way done and that only because I&#x27;ve been trying to not to use it all.</li>
            <li> My son has a rough patch on his arm and consistently putting this on the patch, it has decreased in size dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I hesitate to make reviews on facial products as I have been disappointed so many times.  </li>
            <li> ALSO I have noticed that I had slight premature lines on my forehead, o my noticeable to myself while looking close in the mirror, but era organics has actually helped that too.</li>
            <li> I’m about half way done with my jar and will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with African Black soap and</li>
            <li> I only take a couple of dabs from the jar and it covers half my forehead.</li>
            <li> Nextly, I like to put it on my face post-washing, and this produces an.... odd effect.</li>
            <li> It has a faint yeasty scent that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I started using Era Organics and within 2 weeks of appliance, my eczema not only got worse, but developed additional rashness in other areas (neck, back, and</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that even peels and</li>
            <li> My issue was very dry skin.</li>
            <li> But in the -10 winters here, my face gets very dry.</li>
            <li> As a result, my hands tend to get very dry</li>
            <li> Unlike the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried that only contained simple ingredients like Raw Shea Butter, Coconut oil and</li>
            <li> face moisturizers that left my skin looking tight and radiant.</li>
            <li> I use a facial cleanser that makes my skin feel really tight, so I needed a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but because of this my skin feels dry and stiff shortly afterwards.  </li>
            <li> so it has a little extra moisture to work with.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick, but soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and lately its been very dry probably due to winter</li>
            <li> stuff is kind of expensive but very very thick</li>
            <li> Its just constantly one pimple after the other, but the cream help reduce that by half, I would say.</li>
            <li> but when it dries it leaves my hands feeling dry and tight, not soft &amp; moisturized at all.</li>
            <li> Some lotions can be so greasy the makeup will crease and smear, or drying lotions that just accentuate bad skin when putting makeup on top.</li>
            <li> I had a huge eczema flare up on my shoulders and felt desperate.</li>
            <li> Now in my late 20s, I am learning to read labels and review products before applying them to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, my husband thought it smells like wet rags(not</li>
            <li> , I like the frosting like texture, it is just thick enough &amp; sinks in immediately but still gave me a deeply moisturized feeling.</li>
            <li> Wash hands well with soap before dipping fingers inside and keep tightly closed between uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having eczema problems in the facial area for a few months now.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, my skin stays moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the results after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> Namely, beads of perspiration take over my face for about 15 minutes, or until it sinks in I suppose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a 20 year old reviewer, 20 is not in my review mirror,  it&#x27;s up around the bend behind a big boulder where you can&#x27;t see it, if you catch my drift .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because my skin would dry out and start to peel after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> This cream is no good for my sensitive, dry face.</li>
            <li> I usually have some dry areas on my face, especially around my nose  but since using this</li>
            <li> The creams I have used in the past have either left my skin greasy or dry and irratatted.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin with some rosacea and usually have to settle for some bland cream with no anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry due probably to the water in a deployed environment.  </li>
            <li> but I believe it is helping the healing of my graft and is it certainly not causing problems with my hair.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to it but that doesn&#x27;t linger long at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and have slightly sensitive/ slightly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and the texture allows for a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it melts into my skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this moisturizer when using it for the face.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin after washing my face or showering and it gets tight, but this moisturizer made my skin feel supple and hydrated and not greasy.</li>
            <li> A lot of products out there don&#x27;t moisturize at all; they leave my face feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil will work for some types of skin and will clog pores for other.</li>
            <li> I usually do crossfit at an outside gym</li>
            <li> I tried a couple other organic creams...</li>
            <li> one of them caused my face to break out (had to return) and the other one was discontinued and I was wondering what I was going to do.</li>
            <li> I have figured out my rosacea is caused due to my H pylori infection.</li>
            <li> I also have an AI condition that makes me prone to pains and skin issues--dryness due to the hypothyroid and eczema due to the AI and dermatitis due to the allergies.</li>
            <li> I have used it as an undereyes/crows-feet area cream, since I can&#x27;t use anything there other than Lubriderm (for 15 years, due to hypersensitivity).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear foundation anymore due to allergies, so I just slather this on my face instead</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear foundation anymore due to allergies, so I just slather this on my face instead</li>
            <li> I tried shea butter and other lotions, but it wasn&#x27;t improving.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying out their other products as this will be a keeper.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m dealing with GI problems and some other side effects I&#x27;m hoping will eventually go away.</li>
            <li> No funny smells to it</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> other areas</li>
            <li> I usually switch products after I finish one because skin doesn&#x27;t respond as well if the same product is being used over and over again.</li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other creams with spf.  </li>
            <li> I did not even want to leave my house at times but this product, along with other products from Era Organics, have all renewed my skin and gave me the confidence I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks regularly , replacing my usual moisturizer .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using any of the other moisturizer because I have found the one that works.</li>
            <li> Feels unlike any other cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Another drawback is that hair and particles get stuck to the moisturizer sometimes and its kinda not appealing, but that&#x27;s not a big deal either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily like all other lotions I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> , my face doesn&#x27;t tighten up like it always does with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try other moisture and Oil Control face</li>
            <li> I am trying to avoid blemishes to avoid another staph infection and am having one blemish after the other and am fighting infection.  </li>
            <li> No need for any other moisturizers for my face or hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to try the other items on their product line.</li>
            <li> I got this because through a mis-use of RetinA, microderm, and other peels etc</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Though it has a thicker consistency due to the company not adding synthetic fillers, it absorbs immediately for me.</li>
            <li> At age 45 I still deal with acne prone skin due to a health condition.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t used it for the past two days and the effects are still lasting.</li>
            <li> I probably will not order again due to the scent.</li>
            <li> skin is a 3 out of 5 on sensitivity (with a 5 being someone with psoriasis or extreme allergies)</li>
            <li> It does not moisturize my face, probably due to because my face doesn&#x27;t need any moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say extremely though.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing a little bit of dry skin</li>
            <li> and somehow I feel it leaves my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> And on top of that, these dry patches cover up my pores and what happens is that I get terribly painful small ingrown acne bumps underneath...</li>
            <li> That was unexpected and because I don&#x27;t use a lot of chemicals or expensive facial products, I&#x27;ve never had this reaction before.</li>
            <li> I wanted a moisturizer that is organic with out all the harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of oil based pumas cleaners which destroy my skin and really dry it out.</li>
            <li> jar was dirty, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me because all I cared about was if this product really works or not.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and will last a very long time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so my face was super dry and peeling really bad.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I hoped and left my face looking dull.</li>
            <li> I was so embarrassed by the scaliness and hyperpigmentation that was so dark it looked like dirt.</li>
            <li> I was so embarrassed by the scaliness and hyperpigmentation that was so dark it looked like dirt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I do agree that the product is on the expensive side for whole body use</li>
            <li> This stuff will last me at least 4 months</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but I did see improvements in my skin</li>
            <li> This seemingly small couple of ounces goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work outside 6 out of 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, and my skin takes a beating to say the least.</li>
            <li> and it reduced the dark patches.</li>
            <li> preservatives kill are potentially far worse than preservatives.</li>
            <li> It seems like I&#x27;ve been breaking out worse than before I started using the complete</li>
            <li> , the physical/smell of the cream: It&#x27;s a thick, white cream (almost like a paste).</li>
            <li> It does feel thick but my skin totally eats it up.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling satin soft &amp; hydrated in a way I&#x27;ve never experienced before using this product.</li>
            <li> It smells like I made a thick paste with white bread!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The swelling went down</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying Era Organics other products!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the mask and some of the other products!</li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t know why there are so few reviews on it) without Geogard Ultra and other preservatives.</li>
            <li> few other reviewers have commented on the scent of the cream</li>
            <li> However, if you are like me, prone to oily skin, you should only use a very, very small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The harsh exfoliating chemicals in the other creams  made my face burn.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin!</li>
            <li> The redness began to reduce in less than a week, the itching lessened.</li>
            <li> I previously didn&#x27;t have any eczema symptoms).</li>
            <li> and she has less blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for a week and a half, and will try to update after I&#x27;ve used it longer.  </li>
            <li> My face is less oily when I use this</li>
            <li> cream does have an odd smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> It also smells odd..</li>
            <li> Like one of the other viewers have said, it smells like plain yogurt.  </li>
            <li> So, basically, I&amp;#34;m a mess.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is the sent is not good</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m a little less oily midday too.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I did notice that some of my redness calmed down.</li>
            <li> I was battling with horrible acne for awhile, I cried so hard because it was so frustrating for me to find a good face product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The skin around my neck has been particularly dry lately</li>
            <li> within just the past three days I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is brighter, my dark marks are fading, and my previous bouts of acne are going away faster than using the black soap by itself.</li>
            <li> little edition to my review.....</li>
            <li> I swear I saw my cheeks get a little plump after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out a little bit after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> a little mislead.</li>
            <li> and my skin is getting a little oily in my T zone</li>
            <li> , I know once it&#x27;s gone, ( that will be awhile since so little is needed).  </li>
            <li> For the past few years, my acne developed to severe acne, I tired tons of skin care products, and I even paid a fortune by going to a dermatologist which didn&#x27;t cure my acne.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like cream (which I like).</li>
            <li> You can tell by a little difference.</li>
            <li> Made me break out a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that I have to apply several applications because my face is still a bit dry after applying.</li>
            <li> I also use it everyday instead of foundation, just put a little bit of powder on over it</li>
            <li> It has a very thick consistency, reminiscent of whipped shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick layer of skin between my thumb and forefinger which applying regular lotion does not cut.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Along with an uneven complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Era Organics Face Moisturizer for a few weeks now and it has done wonders to my complexion.  </li>
            <li> , so it feels a bit heavy on my skin before it absorbs.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re missing out.</li>
            <li> but you have to let it set for a few minutes before applying makeup or else</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning before putting on my makeup (goes on well under make up) and at the end of the day after I use the Era Organics Dead Sea Mud mask.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer kept my face from flaking dead skin all over the place.</li>
            <li> My breakout from makeup and uneven Tone.</li>
            <li> want to post a picture of my face from just a few weeks ago at the beginning of my deployment and now after using this stuff</li>
            <li> Up until now, each and every moisturizer dried my skin, burned or a combination of both.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a few hours</li>
            <li> Also purchased the Dead Sea mask</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face which I have a few times now.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer actually dried my face out.  </li>
            <li> It is soothing, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> in healing it I dried out my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> For a organic product I was not impressed by that get rid of that ingredient and put in another thing for coloring natural.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m using this product everyday.</li>
            <li> my complete horrendous random rash that&#x27;s been lingering for a month is almost gone.</li>
            <li> I consulted a dermatologist who simply prescribed a ketoconazole cream which made my situation worse.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had rash or trouble.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> 2 can be harsh.</li>
            <li> I use the moisturizer everyday</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> (Use for face everyday 2 times [In the morning &amp; before bed])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent however.</li>
            <li> Most face lotions leave my skin feeling greasy or dirty or coated with lotion or still dry, even very expensive lotions, this lotion does none of that.</li>
            <li> way less blackheads too!</li>
            <li> The texture and consistency is thick, but you only need a very small amount for your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I opened the package and just like all the other reviews say, it was quite thick.</li>
            <li> I know too less or too much exfoliation are bad...</li>
            <li> My shin is starting to get really dry now that it is getting cold out.</li>
            <li> I only use natural and organic products, and hate chemicals.  </li>
            <li> texture of the cream I recieved is very similar to other cold creams I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This cream is a little thick</li>
            <li> the sort that a chef makes by hand with substance but very little weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use moisturizers but out here, you have to.  </li>
            <li> After using I started noticing I was having a lot more dreams than before, itching, and the worst one of all insomnia.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as small as I feared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using organic jojoba oil for the past couple weeks and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry if my hands gross you out...</li>
            <li> I could not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable seller, product and delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker moisturizer than I usually use but it seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a make up containing SOME spf</li>
            <li> I bought few for my friends also!</li>
            <li> Usually after I apply it I have to apply it again throughout the day because my skin will start drying out from this cream.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, some products (usually scented ones) would cause me to break out, producing a rash.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this product when I was suffering through this past winter season.  </li>
            <li> Nobody like to feel like an oil slick after they&#x27;ve applied a product.</li>
            <li> I usually use face moisturizer along with the tinted moisturizer as I have  sensitive/dry skin, but the tinted moisturizer didn&#x27;t blend in when I applied it over this cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this or a combination of a cleanser that I got</li>
            <li> But not sure if I can.  </li>
            <li> like it normally usually do.</li>
            <li> The color is a very pale peach but doesn&#x27;t cause there to be any added coloring to the skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the scent is a little unpleasant, it goes away after drying</li>
            <li> However, I do not care for the scent, it has a &amp;#34;yogurt scent&amp;#34; and not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It takes this cream  a little while to absorb and is very thick.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find anything that doesn&#x27;t have some sort of smell to it...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It could be just my sensitive skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t want someone to try something like this on a baby that might have a bad reaction to it or worsen the situation.</li>
            <li> Some people says it works, but I completely broke out so bad that I didn&#x27;t buy the product ever again.</li>
            <li> I still recommend at least trying it, just don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li> All 25 reviews are 5-star, not one complaint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i still need the moisturizer but at least my face isn&#x27;t stripped and hurting before i put it</li>
            <li> I receive this cream, but when I open the package, jar is dirty and cream was came out.</li>
            <li> This product has not bothered or irritated him in the least.</li>
            <li> I am an electrician and work with dirty, oily, stuff on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Finding a product that doesn&#x27;t bother at least one or all of these problem areas is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy, didn&#x27;t become lumpy or separated.</li>
            <li> And dried out... Not attractive.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slowly begun replacing some of my cosmetics with products like e-raorganics.</li>
            <li> My skin has never done well with thick creams</li>
            <li> Thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is thick, goes on without any problems and dries within minutes.</li>
            <li> apply a thick coating of the cream&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I mean, it has all the keywords you want to see.</li>
            <li> Transformed my skin into no acne, small pores and luminous complexion!</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some other reviewers have hated the smell, I&#x27;m assuming either every batch is different or their smell sensors are off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be stupid like me and buy a bunch just because the rating is high.</li>
            <li> I could not figure out why I was breaking out so badly until I read that coconut oil, cocoa butter, and a few other ingredients cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little weird, but it smell disappears in seconds.</li>
            <li> This year it flared so bad that topical steroids weren&#x27;t controlling it at all, so I had to start taking oral steroids and even had to get a couple of shots.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this specific cream.  </li>
            <li> It actually smells so bad</li>
            <li> and when I went to the beauty salon last month, I kept hearing shocked reactions to my age (56).</li>

            <li> It looked awful and the only thing that helped was steroid cream from a doctor, but every time I stopped using it the rash would come back worse.</li>
            <li> It has a strange unpleasant smell and it goes on the skin like honey.</li>
            <li> I would even use my microderm machine and even still, after 3 days my skin felt gross, every single pore on my face was clogged and of course, makeup looks bad on bad skin..</li>

            <li> journey has taken me down the natural/organic and simple route for my skin and it has improved INSANELY.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and luxurious.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is very thick.</li>
            <li> The formula is non-greasy and I mean non-greasy!</li>
            <li> They are a little dirty (HEHE ^-^ )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick cream, so I recommend applying it in a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> Since I am trying InstaNatural Vitamin C, I wondered if I was causing an incompatible pairing that was unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I had never experienced any.</li>
            <li> even my husband who doesn&#x27;t like moisturizers became addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> figure if you have a rash/eczema/etc and are tired of the skin damaging steroids--</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted to these products.. as a problem with a lot of women over the age of 40</li>
            <li> This is a family owned company, and they stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Not great for the face.  </li>
            <li> , I doubt it was actually irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Not great quality for adults.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out after using this on my face.  </li>
            <li> Even applying a thin layer to my face keeps it hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> As someone who has combination skin, finding the right moisturizer is a terribly daunting, and expensive, task.</li>
            <li> It is a useless ingredient and not good for you.</li>
            <li> The product smelled weird, not sure if I got a bad item or not.</li>
            <li> This cream proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now obsessed with the products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cna&#x27;t use expensive creams (allergic),</li>
            <li> I cna&#x27;t use expensive creams (allergic),</li>
            <li> it will mix in a weird way and change the color of your product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to give it up, sorry Era.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to give it up, sorry Era.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can not use any products with fake fragrances; this cream has not caused any allergic reaction and it has been a pleasure to wear it.</li>
            <li> Plus if I reapply it on my hands too often if builds up and feels uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I saw there were some concerns about fake reviews.</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;d call this a unisex fragrance since it&#x27;s so faint</li>
            <li> I am not impressed though of this company using titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving my skin very raw, with an awful uneven skin tone and &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; look it to.</li>
            <li> With my skin sensitivity, it is difficult to find products that work.  </li>
            <li> Smells faintly of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says a lot since I sweat twelve hours at a time and in a filthy warehouse that such a combination breeds disastrous break outs.</li>
            <li> Before I even bought this cream, the acne on my back was horrible.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be odorless, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the moisturizing element, but it does smell a bit weird.</li>
            <li> otherwise I look very tired.</li>
            <li> Too bad Amazon&#x27;s storage does no good to preservatives-free products like this one.</li>
            <li> I tried a very expensive face cream, it worked but it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really cold out now,</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve never had anything disappointing to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everyone here seemed to say it helped their acne, but mine now seems to be angry :(</li>
            <li> My face is now clearer than it has ever been and you won&#x27;t be sorry if you splurge and get the set!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to find a product my face agrees with, so thank you.  </li>
            <li> I have posted bad review for another company and all I have received was harassment from the management accusing me of being a con for another company.  </li>
            <li> I am searching for bad review here</li>
            <li> and I thought it smelled really bad.  </li>
            <li> my arms, neck, and torso itched so bad.  </li>
            <li> combined with a charcoal bad face wash and Thayer &#x27; s</li>
            <li> Its not so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to keep using it though!</li>
            <li> I bought this face moisturizer based on the review comments from Amazon, but quite disappointed with the product, In summer this makes me to sweat a lot</li>
            <li> : (I do this before I apply Era Organic Complete)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter smell dissipates, so I don&#x27;t find it annoying at all.</li>
            <li> But if you hate the scent of cocoa butter, you will not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I also hate chemical names.</li>
            <li> and I hate that.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

            <li> If any of you have been on accutane then you know it horribly dries your skin out.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that I know there aren&#x27;t nasty chemicals being put on my face.</li>
            <li> Awful smell to it...</li>
            <li> (I know I was awful)</li>

            <li> Two summers ago, my husband and I were on vacation when my face broke out into a horrible rash that led to my face swelling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This review is favorably edited upon receiving simply great customer service. Within days of posting my unsatisfactory review of the product I received a courteous reply from the management. I review a lot of products, food, places, and whether good or bad I am always honest. Although this product was not a good match for me, the purchase refund and sympathetic management has greatly enhanced my trust in this retailer. It is hard to find a good management. I have posted bad review for another company and all I have received was harassment from the management accusing me of being a con for another company.  So Kudos to Era Organics for paying attention and remedying customer&#x27;s unhappiness...Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really know what to do anymore...I had high hopes for this product and even now, considering buying another cream,  I am searching for bad review here and it seem that this has only good reviews..maybe I am anomaly? I did read that coconut oil breaks some people out..&lt;br /&gt;My skin: Combination, mostly without problem, occasional bump once or twice a month&lt;br /&gt;The issue:&lt;br /&gt;After starting to use, I felt it was greasy, but it went right into my skin. Also, my husband thought it smells like wet rags(not sexy at all), but I like organic everything, so gave it a chance. But, what started happening is that instead of keeping my skin healthy and not dry, I basically get flakes all over my chin, mouth and nose...these dry patches have become daily occurrence with this cream...And on top of that, these dry patches cover up my pores and what happens is that I get terribly painful small ingrown acne bumps underneath...In fact my whole chin area now seems old and bumpy...I tried this cream religiously, or with combination of other less greasy gel, no matter what I do, the day I use this cream, I immediately notice the gross dry patches. It almost looks like I have dried milk on me, and make up cannot cover this, not even the natural mineral powders. So I dowithout make up most days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that I know about skincare...I know too less or too much exfoliation are bad...so I tried gentle exfoliation thinking this is only winter talking...but literally one day after exfoliation after putting this moisturizer...white dry patches...if I don&#x27;t exfoliate at all, thinking my skin needs rest, it is the same...even if I put loads of this on me at night, my skin around my lips dries and even cracks a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would even take occasional clogged pore or pimple if only I did not have these dry patches afterwards...but having both is not acceptable...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there one moisturizer out there for me? I have not used store brands in forever and refuse to go back to chemicals, but if even this highly rated pure and organic cream does not keep my skin healthy, what will? How can such rich cream still not moisturize and protect my skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To naysayers, I drink enough water and take fish oil, vitamin D, enzymes and such...</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very smooth and soaks in quickly .  The only thing I do not care for is the smell.</li>
            <li> First time user for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in very good condition. Thick and creamy, didn&#x27;t become lumpy or separated. But, my first concern is always the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a little thick, not oily, smooth to apply, and absorbs very well. I like it a lot but I&#x27;m seeing other products (am looking into Rose &amp; Pomegranate - though I don&#x27;t know why there are so few reviews on it) without Geogard Ultra and other preservatives. As for the comment in the response below about EWG, I appreciate the reference, but I&#x27;m so jaded with some organizations (not Era Organics) because I wonder sometimes who is paid to say what anymore. Politics and money dictate business so much and making money is the bottom line. I don&#x27;t hold this against Era Organics at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact. Era Organics is very responsive with communication, does not evade the question, and promptly addresses issues. Excellent customer service. They sent an email after I ordered, and another about a week later to ask if they could offer any assistance Must give them huge credit for taking care of their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for week and a half. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched Geogard Ultra (after buying!) and wrote to Era Organics about it. Reason was that I found out Geogard Ultra when paired with Vitamin C can be carcinogenic. Since I am trying InstaNatural Vitamin C, I wondered if I was causing an incompatible pairing that was unhealthy. I wrote to Era Organics and below is their reply. If anyone has comments, I would love to hear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Geogard Ultra is used as a preservative in our products. We found it to be the best combination of safety and workability. There is no \\&quot;perfect preservative\\&quot; and we wish we didn&#x27;t have to use a preservative at all, but the mold, bacteria, etc. preservatives kill are potentially far worse than preservatives. There aren&#x27;t any preservatives that we like because the more effective they are, the less we like them for the body (the worst being parabens). So we had to go with the happy balance of it being proven to be the most effective while being shown to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, Geogard Ultra was found to be quite safe and is allowed to be used in natural and organic products. EWG.org rates it as a very low risk and most studies that show it as a risk are more talking about ingesting rather than applying to the skin. Plus, there are very low levels in our products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also seen the study on Vitamin C and Sodium Benzoate. Like any chemical reaction, this reaction requires certain conditions. This particular reaction is very sensitive. In order for this reaction to move at a noticeable rate, it needs heat and oxygen, in the absence of sugars and many common cosmetic ingredients. Cosmetic products just don&#x27;t provide the proper condition for benzene formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the study \\&quot;In fact extremely large amounts of Sodium Benzoate would need to be ingested in order to produce even slight toxic consequences for the body. In studies where mice have been fed a substantial diet of sodium benzoate, the data clearly indicate that their life expectancies were not shortened, nor was any notable health affect present at all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, side effects associated with excess sodium benzoate are only linked to HUGE consumption internally in foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our formulation it is very safe, being a low PH acidic formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I want all customers to be 100% happy so if you have any doubts about using it, just let me know and I&#x27;m happy to issue a full refund. If you do want to give it a shot, I&#x27;d love to hear how it works for you.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyler of Era Organics deserves credit for following up very well with customer service.they are, the less we like them for the body (the worst being parabens).

            <li> I received my jar of cream today, after having ordered it early Friday morning, I really appreciate the fast delivery. My jar was leaking just the tiniest bit but I just wiped it off &amp; it was fine. I tried it tonight as my night cream &amp; it feels lovely on my skin, I like the frosting like texture, it is just thick enough &amp; sinks in immediately but still gave me a deeply moisturized feeling. My skin feels really good. It is only the first night I know, but so far, so good. Seems to be a great product &amp; the customer service is great. Thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;A little edition to my review.....when I got up this morning my skin had a nice glow, one of my tests for a new night cream, it passed with flying colors. I also like the fact that I know what the ingredients are, no scary sounding chemicals. I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is super cool on my face; I like the ingredients and for a moisturizer Era Organics is a complete and effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am highly impressed with this product. I have very dry skin that even peels and this product makes my skin feel amazing. It is the first moisturizer I have used that has actually helped heal my dry skin. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy. It has this light soft texture to it. Doesn&#x27;t work as well under makeup as I would like so I use it as a night cream before bed.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter who is a swimmer. This cream moisturize her skin after long practices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a moisturizer that clears my skin. I have mild breakouts all the time and a few acne scars. Along with an uneven complexion. Within the week of using this product so far, I can actually SEE a difference. This has never happened for me ever. I haven&#x27;t had this clear of skin since I was a pre-teen. I love Natural Face Moisturizer Cream so I&#x27;m glad I decided to try their facial care products.  I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am scared about is finally finding a product and a company doing what they normally do and &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; the product that already works so well. Please don&#x27;t ever change your products or how they are produced!!</li>
            <li> It did the opposite of the reviews I read prior to purchase. It dried out my skin more. I have severe eczema and skin patches on my face. It didn&#x27;t work for me, but hopefully it&#x27;ll work for others. The product simply didn&#x27;t work for my skin but atleast it smells like chocolate! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product couple month ago and used it every day. I have oily skin. I didn&#x27;t really looked at the ingredients when I purchased it so I didn’t see that this product contains Coconut oil. Coconut oil will work for some types of skin and will clog pores for other. The coconut oil on the comedogenic rating list (or acne causing ingredient list) is rated 4 out of 5. So personally for me it was clogging my pores, but for people with more dry skin it might work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason why I gave only 3 stars to the product is it took forever to absorb to my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both enjoy the rich light weight face cream. And smells delish!</li>
            <li> Since receiving this moisturizer several weeks ago. I have been using it as a daily moisturizer.  I have experienced excellent results and have been thrilled to have found a daytime moisturizer that is organic.  I am so pleased that it leaves my face baby soft and it does not leave a shine under my face powder.  It is not greasy and it melts into the skin and keeps it soft all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so very pleased to have found this excellent moisturizer and would recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle for sensitive skin!  I&#x27;ve been using Era Organics Face Moisturizer for a few weeks now and it has done wonders to my complexion.  Not only has it not broken me out, a little goes a long way and there&#x27;s no oily finish.  It&#x27;s also a huge plus that the ingredients are natural and it&#x27;s gentle enough to go around the eye area.  I love this cream and company, I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> First of all, I had the best customer service experience of my life with this company.  I bought this product, opened it, and quickly returned it.  I&#x27;m scent sensitive and I thought it smelled really bad.  As soon as I requested my return, somebody from Era Organics called me and said that it shouldn&#x27;t smell.  He then offered to not only refund my money, but asked if he could send me a jar for free.  I received the new jar the very NEXT day and it was odor free.  Now for the best part---it&#x27;s LIFE CHANGING.  Truly, truly life changing.  I thought I was going to lose my mind b/c my arms, neck, and torso itched so bad.  This year it flared so bad that topical steroids weren&#x27;t controlling it at all, so I had to start taking oral steroids and even had to get a couple of shots.  I was pretty miserable!!!  I don&#x27;t know why or how this works, I just know it does.  I&#x27;m not taking anything for my skin issues anymore, and I rarely get even a small spot that causes me problems.  If I only use this, and nothing else, not Cetaphil or any other &amp;#34;skin friendly&amp;#34; product, I&#x27;m fine.  My mom is now using it and she says the same thing.  I just bought my 2nd jar!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for a moisturizer but it works great. It helped clear a lot of my acne so far and I&#x27;ve noticed the scars fading faster than normal. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but now I like it for some reason. The only thing is I have really dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as much as I&#x27;d like around some of my really dry areas but every moisturizer I use is like that. My face used to look really oily as the day would go by but now it doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I&#x27;d recommend trying it, it&#x27;s worth the price in my opinion. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product; great company.  I buy complete for my 25-yr-old daughter and she loves it!  Beauty is a gift; spend it wisely.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells like I am you&#x27;ll appreciate it. I have really dry skin after washing my face or showering and it gets tight, but this moisturizer made my skin feel supple and hydrated and not greasy. It is also a huge jug and lasts forever! I&#x27;m very happy to have this item especially since it is eco friendly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer because I have a fairly large skin graft on my scalp and it needs to be kept hydrated to facilitate healing and to minimize damage. Other products that I have used have been petroleum based and made my hair very greasy.  This moisturizer is very light and does not cause problems with my hair. I am also using it on a scar on my neck and on the site from which the graft was harvested.  I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other reviewers have commented on the scent of the cream but I have not found this to be a problem.  I am very sensitive to odors and this product does not cause me any difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now been using this for about a month.  The scar on my neck is fading very nicely as is  the scar on my leg from which my skin graft was taken.  The skin graft on my scalp is also healing nicely. The fact that this cream is non-greasy allows me to use it without having issues with my hair.  I read&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read earlier reviews regarding the responsiveness of the company (Era Organics) and I echo those sentiments 100%.  When I contacted Era Organics via email I received a reply the same day. Tyler answered my questions and assured me that if I tried the cream and it did not work they would refund my purchase price.  With such an offer, I decided I really was not taking any risk and made the purchase.  I am delighted with this product. It is still early in my use of it but I believe it is helping the healing of my graft and is it certainly not causing problems with my hair.  ( NOTE: I  cleared the idea of using some type of moisturizer with my health care provider before I began this treatment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly and am very happy with the company as well.  I will update within a week or two to let you know if it is indeed facilitating healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :  I have now been using this cream for about a month.  The scar on my neck is supple and is fading nicely.  The site on my leg from which the skin graft was taken is also fading and the skin remains soft and hydrated.  Due to the non-greasy characteristic of this cream I am able to use it on my scalp without having problems with my hair.  Although I cannot prove it, I believe this cream is adding to my healing process.  So far I have nothing but praise for this product.  Once more, I want to note how responsive the company was when I asked questions about the cream.  Rarely have I dealt with a company who seems so concerned with customer service.</li>
            <li> This cream is no good for my sensitive, dry face. In fact, I really dislike the sensation after using this Face Moisturizer - it creates a strange film that kind of pulls my skin. Really odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a body lotion since it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks since I was refunded for the jar I wasn&#x27;t happy with and got myself a new jar. It was out of a fresh batch and much better quality. Too bad Amazon&#x27;s storage does no good to preservatives-free products like this one.</li>
            <li> Update:  I recently reordered this fab cream.  It arrived on Sunday, even before I got out of bed.  Now that is customer service!  Put a smile on my face when my husband brought the delivery in with the morning newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post:  Uh la la!  Era Organics Face Moisturizer Cream is the latest - and one of the best - additions to my beauty regimen.  I have sensitive, very dry facial and neck skin and lead an active life with many outdoor activities - gardening, dog walking, bicycling.  This moisturizer has a luxurious consistency that immediately absorbs into your skin, leaving it soft and supple, not one bit of greasiness.  I use it both day and night; fabulous by itself and under makeup, also wonderful to use as an eye area moisturizer. A great healing agent for sunburned or irritated skin.  The cream has a calming cocoa scent upon application that quickly dissipates so does not conflict with any fragrance you are wearing.  A must have in my beauty regimen.  As a bonus, great proactive - and friendly - communication from the seller.  Highly recommend this product and Era Organics.</li>
            <li> Lovely, visible difference in my skin; moved from a wet climate to high desert and needed to change out my skin care products, this is an amazing face cream!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really great product. Hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts on my face, and the BIG bonus is it has dramatically helped with my hand eczema when NOTHING else has! So grateful to be able to use my hand. I will definitely be buying more of this product. A little goes a LONG way too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best around.  Face is smooth  Love it</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry due probably to the water in a deployed environment.  It is the first one I use.  I usually don&#x27;t use moisturizers but out here, you have to.  I liked it a lot.  My legs were like alligator skin.  After a week of using it on my entire body, I could see the difference.  I was using it twice a day.  After a week, I went to once a week and then every other day and still seeing the same results.  I am using it daily on my face.  4oz goes quick at the beginning but it is definitely a great product. I still have plenty and I have used the same container for a month and a week.  I even had some scratches and I think the honey properties help you tremendously in healing. I usually do crossfit at an outside gym and you get scratches all over so it has helped a lot.  I bought another type of moisturizer that had more (8 oz) and even had better reviews than this one but I like this one a lot more.  It is more expensive but I got used to the nice smell and it absorbs quickly into your skin.  I actually miss the smell when I don&#x27;t use it, lol.  I think I am done looking, I found a good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many rave reviews for this cream, but I can&#x27;t give the same testimonial. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and it&#x27;s ok. It has great ingredients and is a quality product, but it is not doing much for the eczema on my eyelid. That&#x27;s a bummer for me since it seems to be helping many others. I still recommend at least trying it, just don&#x27;t expect perfection.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how this cream is helping with healing scar tissue from surgery.</li>
            <li> Where to begin, I bought this product because of its natural and organic ingredients. I have been experiencing a little bit of dry skin so I said why not. After using I started noticing I was having a lot more dreams than before, itching, and the worst one of all insomnia. After much trial and error and internet research I found out I was experiencing the classical side effects of MSM. I did not want to give up so I tried giving it another shot and hopeful build some tolerance by not using it morning and night but just in the mornings. Didn&#x27;t make a difference I was still dreaming way too much and insomnia was the last straw. So since my sleep is too precious to me I decided to just return. Might work for some but not for me. The smell wasn&#x27;t the greatest either.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin. I have seborrheic dermatitis and I easily get sensitivity reactions after a few minutes using a product but this one (been using it for a week now) I had never experienced any. Very light on my face, no oily feeling even during the days I&#x27;m on direct sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after 1 month of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had seborrheic break outs the entire time I&#x27;m using it, it works wonders..After years of trying different moisturizers finally found the one that really works. My family who are used seeing my face flaky noticed the difference after a week of use, my face became soft, clear and more youthful, my in laws are now using it and they love it even my husband who doesn&#x27;t like moisturizers became addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is already a MUST in our daily routine. Thank you ERA Organics!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so hydrated and smooth.  I have been very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I like it. I love the ingredients. Customer service was excellent and it felt more personal. However, I used the entire 4 oz and did not notice a significant difference in my skin. Oh, I should mention that I have very acne-prone combination skin. I&#x27;m sure it would work for others, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me. I would probably try it again once my skin clears up as I do think it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer. For my purposes, it didn&#x27;t work very well though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super effective moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  I also have extremely sensitive skin, and this has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this face cream.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and have slightly sensitive/ slightly dry skin.  I have never really used any anti-aging skin care because I haven&#x27;t really needed it till now, but I&#x27;m starting to get some roughness and increased fine lines with certain facial expressions.  I also can&#x27;t use eye cream because all the ones I have tried make my eyes feel like they are burning.  This cream is great because I can slather it all over my eyes with no irritation.  I also really like using it on my dry/ cracked hands (I wash my hands something like 20 times a day) because it doesn&#x27;t sting and it moisturizes well.  I actually would give it 4.5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF, and I&#x27;m not really used to creams (I have mostly used lotions), so it feels a bit heavy on my skin before it absorbs.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Evened out my skills n tone and makes my skin feel great. Perfectly balanced, non greasy. Just turned my mom and aunt on to this as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted it, I received it!  I was looking for a moisturizer for an everyday kind of nice feeling product and I found it!  I LOVE this!  I gave my Mom&lt;br /&gt;my jar when I was visiting for Mother&#x27;s Day because she loved it!  I just ordered my second jar!  A little goes a long way.  It is light, blends in well.&lt;br /&gt;Light scent barely noticeable.  It works, it soaks in and removes all sense of dryness immediately!  I&#x27;m keeping this one around!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I just absolutely love how soft my face is after using this cream. I swear I saw my cheeks get a little plump after using it. I tried a couple other organic creams...one of them caused my face to break out (had to return) and the other one was discontinued and I was wondering what I was going to do. I am so glad I took a chance on this cream... I am in love. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My issue was very dry skin. This cream not only moisturizes very well, but my skin is so soft as well.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It took about three days of applications and then I could tell a big difference. No more dry skin!</li>
            <li> So far I love this stuff. It has been far better for my dry skin than another high-end night cream that I was using for years. I have very dry skin, and my skin seems to love this stuff. However, I think it would work quite well for all skin types. Since my skin is dry I often reapply this a couple of times in the morning/at night because my skin just drinks it up. Also, it smells like pure unsweetened cocoa which I think is delicious. The price point is great and you get a whopping 4 oz which will last quite a while. As of right now I do plan to repurchase when I finish this jar and am also interested in trying other Era Organics products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/15/15: Still love this stuff after 2 months of every day use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 3/3/16: Received a discount code for the month and am repurchasing. This will be my third tub of this miracle cream. I&#x27;ve never been so loyal to a moisturizer before, but this stuff is everything. I really love it! I recently ordered the face wash from Era Organics as well. I love Era Organics and am excited to see more products from them!</li>
            <li> The absolute best thing I have ever put on my face. Light fluffy texture makes my skin feel soft, bright and radiant. I never thought I&#x27;d be so satisfied and I also never thought my damaged skin could look good again. This cream proved me wrong. Buy it! If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re missing out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great . . . soothing and no strong smell :)</li>
            <li> This moisturizer isn&#x27;t anything like what I read in the reviews. Sits on my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb, then irritates around my nose. I&#x27;ve used different organic moisturizers and this one doesn&#x27;t fill my needs.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer but did not cure my rosacea (red cheeks). I have figured out my rosacea is caused due to my H pylori infection. After taking antibiotics for H pylori my redness in my face is 85% gone. This moisturizer is very nice. The smell is a little funny but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I will purchase this again only because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It&#x27;s not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to write a rave review after reading all of the amazing ones here, however, I&#x27;m not so sure I can! :( I have sensitive acne prone skin that I have been trying to control for years now. After following the lovevitamin blog, I&#x27;ve switched into an all natural skincare routine and was introduced into the benefits of mms and manuka honey, hence my excitement when I found this product. It seems like I&#x27;ve been breaking out worse than before I started using the complete and I can&#x27;t figure out why. Everyone here seemed to say it helped their acne, but mine now seems to be angry :( if anyone has any advice id love to hear it! Maybe it will get better in time? I&#x27;m almost afraid to keep using it though!</li>
            <li> The best product for my dry skin it has healed my skin omg I can&#x27;t live without this it has really saved my skin</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had used this product for a while before reviewing.  I had very dry patches on my face and red  irritated marks above my eyebrows (probably from rubbing and scratching).  After ten days, everything has cleared up and itching and flaking have disappeared.  I used the cream about three times a day.  It is non oily (which I appreciate), non perfumed and seems to soak right into the skin.  Before I decided to purchase this product, I had used several different creams (well known brands) to no avail.  This is a product I will recommend to family and friends as well as to fellow Amazon shoppers.  Thank you Era Organics!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  I wasn&#x27;t sure of it at first, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  The skin around my neck has been particularly dry lately and I use it on my face and neck - definitely helps.  It also has a very, very mild scent, which I like.  I would definitely consider ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. Found my skin to stay hydrated all day without feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  My skin is very sensitive and this is perfect!  Great people too!  Era Organics, I want to say Thank You!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  My skin loves this moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way.  This is not the type of moisturizer that just stays on top of the skin; my skin seems to soak it right up. I apply it to my face, neck and chest. I&#x27;ve only used it for about two weeks, apply it twice a day, and the deep wrinkles on my face seem to be getting a bit smaller.  Just in case that&#x27;s wishful thinking, I&#x27;m committed to using it for three months to see if there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it on my arms to help soften my KP and it does help a lot with that. It doesn&#x27;t help to diminish the KP but that isn&#x27;t what it is marketed for anyways. It goes on very smoothly and leaves a velvety texture. It doesn&#x27;t take too much to go around and lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance, just the sent of the natural ingredients that are used to make it. The color is a very pale peach but doesn&#x27;t cause there to be any added coloring to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is such a perfectly amazing product! I&#x27;ve got excessively sensitive skin and have literally tried more than 15 different varieties of facial moisturizers (including all the top brands).  Only one has worked over the years, Nivea for men sensitive skin formula, and that particular lotion leaves an oily sheen on my face but at least it didn&#x27;t cause irritations like all the others. Well, now Nivea has added perfume to this lotion and I already know that any fragrance will inevitably cause some irritation. I use Jason aloe moisturizer (84%) at night (using Jason aloe 84% during the day causes irritations) so I searched for something aloe-based and stumbled upon Era organics. Not only does this product not leave me with a shiny face but it has improved my complexion, skin tone, reduced the redness and has made my face look better than it ever has. Extraordinary! No break outs or irritation- most importantly- and the texture allows for a little to go a long way. I really want to thank all the staff at Era Organics for creating such a masterful product, it is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> BEST MOISTURIZER EVER. I stumbled across this gem after searching for an organic product, after using Murad for so long. My skin is super sensitive, dry, acne and blackhead prone. I travel a lot and wear make up every day. I ordered the product and was looking forward to trying it. But then I get an email from the seller. I thought it was automated but after reading it, it wasn&#x27;t! It was an actual, personalized email from the seller, thanking me for my order with more info on the tracking. I was blown away! I replied, thanking him for his message and he actually wrote back too. I must say, after being an Amazon Prime member for several years, I have never purchased a product and then received a personalized, friendly email from the seller. Talk about customer service! I was won over on the product before I even had it in my hands. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a month now and am just so delighted. It&#x27;s helping sooth my skin, keep it hydrated and is helping me not have as many pimples. I use it morning and night, after cleansing. I&#x27;ve used it in the cold NYC winter, hot high desert in CA and coastal San Diego climate...and no matter what I go, the cream does it&#x27;s job and protects my skin. It isn&#x27;t scented with a fragrance but there is a light cocoa butter smell that is comforting. I really just love this and now know that I won&#x27;t be able to be without it...ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product for sensitive, acne prone skin---this is what you need to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ended up buying the face cleanser and mud mask and I&#x27;m now obsessed with the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Era Organics!</li>
            <li> The product smelled weird, not sure if I got a bad item or not. Suffice to say, I did not want to apply this on my face. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Era Organics cream (this and the eczema seem identical in smell, appearance, behavior, so I am reviewing both with the same time span/use) for about a month, and I can finally and honestly review it on how it worked on my latest eczema flare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background. I&#x27;m a highly allergic type person, since childhood. There are many things I cannot use or eat due to my severe sensitivities. I also have an AI condition that makes me prone to pains and skin issues--dryness due to the hypothyroid and eczema due to the AI and dermatitis due to the allergies. So, basically, I&amp;#34;m a mess. I&#x27;ve tried many very expensive creams for my aging skin (I&#x27;m 55), but most also cause me a reaction--no matter how hypoallergenic or high end--so I end up using Lubriderm sensitive and Eucerin Calming most often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had an eczema flare on my neck/upper chest (started in 2012, and calms/flares periodically). I did NOT want to resort to prescription steroid or even OTC cortisone creams. So, I bought 4 different ones at the health food store. They helped VERY little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this one. I was skeptical, but the reviews were good and the ingredients didn&#x27;t seem to be problematic (although I worried about the algae component, as I am sensitive to iodine and seafood of all kinds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it every 2 hours for the first couple weeks, then every 4 hours. Now, I apply 2 or 3 times a day as maintenance. The result: incredible softening of skin and soothing of it. The redness began to reduce in less than a week, the itching lessened. After two weeks, very much relieved. Now, about a month later, my neck looks and feels much better and I haven&#x27;t scratched or burned for over two weeks. It feels normal to the touch. I do have hyperpigmentation from recurrent flares, and this cream can&#x27;t fix that, but having the rash/itch/redness gone is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, is this a miracle cream? No. Is it useful? YES! It did not affect a hypersensitive person such as I am, which is saying a lot. It helped a lot. Much more than the other creams and homeopathic stuff I tried. (I even tried straight, pure medical-grade Manuka honey, which was a sticky mess, but that stuff is good; and this cream contains some, which is good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure if you have a rash/eczema/etc and are tired of the skin damaging steroids--and I used them for years and years--try this. If it doesn&#x27;t work, just use it as a moisturizer. But it&#x27;s surely worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proof I liked it: I ordered 3 jars that arrived this past week, using the promo code here on Amazon. I&#x27;ll take any savings I can get! My sister also has eczema and dermatitis issues, so I&#x27;m gonna gift her a jar and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the physical/smell of the cream: It&#x27;s a thick, white cream (almost like a paste). It smells like cocoa butter. It applies nicely and is not sticky. It does have a light &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; effect, so while I use it on my face when I&#x27;m at home, I&#x27;m less likely to use it under makeup, where the cream can pill a bit if you rub in foundation, cream blush, etc. I have used it as an undereyes/crows-feet area cream, since I can&#x27;t use anything there other than Lubriderm (for 15 years, due to hypersensitivity). This one has not given me any dermatitis/reaction. None. Just soothing. The cocoa butter smell dissipates, so I don&#x27;t find it annoying at all. But if you hate the scent of cocoa butter, you will not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a jar, so you need to use hygiene techniques: Wash hands well with soap before dipping fingers inside and keep tightly closed between uses. I have my new jars in the fridge, since I don&#x27;t know how well they will last outside of refrigeration. The ingredients seem pretty stable, and the jar I opened a month ago is still fresh in look and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: There is another product on Amazon that&#x27;s an eczema cream with identical ingredients, smell, and look. I bought it along with the Era Organics one and they seem to be the same (similarly priced, too). I&#x27;d keep an eye out on which has a better price (with the discount, right now, it&#x27;s Era Organics, unless you buy the 8 oz jar by Wild Naturals, in which case you do get about 9 bucks o fa savings.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems to be the same formula as the other Era Organics cream that comes in the same type jar (the one for eczema). Go with either one, whichever is priced better or has a discount promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A VERY good cream for sensitive and fussy skin--very calming and soothing and softening without the weird ingredients of steroid creams. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that the owner, Tyler, seems to be highly responsive to customer issues. So, if good customer service is a priority for you, definitely feel at ease with Era Oganics. And I don&#x27;t know Tyler personally, but I&#x27;ve seen his comment replies here on Amazon, and he&#x27;s on top of customer complaints and issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 2015:  I&#x27;ve been using this every single days, more than once a day, for six months already. My neck is much, much, much improved. This cream has kept another flare away and the skin is able to heal some, even lighten up some. I was so embarrassed by the scaliness and hyperpigmentation that was so dark it looked like dirt. Well, it&#x27;s smooth and the marks are much less noticeable. I plan to continue to use this as my regular neck cream morning and evening to keep the dermatitis/eczema away.  Love it. I do notice that there are other creams now on Amazon besides this and the other brand I tried, with the exact same ingredients list. so I will be keeping an eye on prices as competition heats up. But I stil recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE November 2016: I&#x27;ve been using this close to two years now, and it has kept my neck nice. It&#x27;s all normal and has been for a while. No scales, no pustules, not dark striations. I am happy to show it off again with low-cut tops. :D  I even recommended it to family and I carry it around with me some days when I&#x27;m gone from home all day to reapply as needed. This, the facial one, the eczema (all the same really) work very well. I can&#x27;t wear foundation anymore due to allergies, so I just slather this on my face instead and when I went to the beauty salon last month, I kept hearing shocked reactions to my age (56). So, it&#x27;s just as well I cna&#x27;t use expensive creams (allergic), cause this one works fine.ra Organics one and they seem to be the same (similarly priced, too). I&#x27;d keep an eye out on which has a better price (with the discount, right now, it&#x27;s Era Organics, unless you buy the 8 oz jar by Wild Naturals, in which case you do get about 9 bucks o fa savings.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems to be the same formula as the other Era Organics cream that comes in the same type jar (the one for eczema). Go with either one, whichever is priced better or has a discount promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A VERY good cream for sensitive and fussy skin--very calming and soothing and softening without the weird ingredients of steroid creams. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that the owner, Tyler, seems to be highly responsive to customer issues. So, if good customer service is a priority for you, definitely feel at ease with Era Oganics.

            <li> I love this product it helps my skin and my face so much .i will order this product over and over again cuz it deserves and also it has a lot of good staff in it I will recommend everyone to try it .am happy customer 😬😬</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this creamy whipped cream. It leaves my face so smooth. I love that this cream has manuka honey in it which is very good for skin. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I loooovvveee this, its  magic in a jar. Its so light weight and fluffy, you will never want to use anything else, I promise. Finally something that goes well with my face and doesnt break me out!!!! Proactiv who?</li>
            <li> Awesome product! This does wonders for my skin and has been helping with my acne. The customer service brought by Era Organics is above and beyond. Definitely give this product a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing! It has a very thick consistency, reminiscent of whipped shea butter. You can tell by the feel of the cream and the smell that the ingredients are natural and organic. It slides on smoothly and absorbs into my skin within 1 minute. I usually have some dry areas on my face, especially around my nose  but since using this moisturized I&#x27;ve not had any dry patches or flaking skin. It is a very mild cream and I have not experienced any irritation whatsoever. I have been using this cream consistently in the mornings for about 2 months. My cheeks and forehead are noticeably softer and smoother. Really excellent product, even better, a little goes a long way so I know this jar will last for several months.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and am past menopause.  My skin is more problematic now than when I was younger.  Without a moisturizer, my skin is dry and crepey, but most moisturizers cause clogged pores, irritation or pimples (even at my age!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has been a pleasant surprise.  It feels very lightweight; so much so that I wondered if it would have any effect at all.  But just a small amount of cream gives my skin just the right amount of moisture without clogging my pores.  It even works on my eyelids, which are very dry and sensitive.  My skin absorbs it very quickly, unlike some creams which seem to sit there like an oil slick.  The cream also has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is strange...with all of the raving reviews.  I had an allergic reaction to my skin.  I have sensitive skin, and it is generally normal to dry, but no problems.  I tried it for couple of days, but my face started itching with redness, and the cream feels like a filmy coating over my face.  I stopped using it until it cleared up, and thought it would be ok to use after several days, but the same thing happened again, so I knew for sure I had a bad reaction to this specific cream.  I don&#x27;t like to leave bad reviews, but I decided to do so, since the rest of the reviews seems way too appealing compared to what I experienced.  It could be just my sensitive skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t want someone to try something like this on a baby that might have a bad reaction to it or worsen the situation.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new night cream and decided to try Era Organics. Not only has it replaced my current avocado night cream, but it feels so good, I&#x27;m using it during the day now too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I actually love the smell - it smells like cocoa butter and fresh greek yogurt (yum!), and it has evened out some mild rosacea just in 3 days use. My favorite thing so far though (and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else mention it), but once the lotion sinks in, in about a minute, my skin actually feels a bit tighter. Not dry, just firmer. That was unexpected and because I don&#x27;t use a lot of chemicals or expensive facial products, I&#x27;ve never had this reaction before. It&#x27;s wonderful! My face actually looks more youthful. THANK YOU! : )</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Leaves my skin very soft.  I feel good using this  because of the natural ingredients, I will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! Feels like rubbing whipped butter on your face and keeps me very moisturized!</li>
            <li> I have never had this problem before. The knuckles on my left hand got so dry, they were crusty and starting to crack. I knew they were close to bleeding. I&#x27;m a gardener and was worried as my hands are in the dirt alot. I tried shea butter and other lotions, but it wasn&#x27;t improving. I&#x27;d heard great things about coconut oil, so I tried this. I actually don&#x27;t know if it was the coconut oil or the aloe vera (there are many ingredients in this creme), but my knuckles recovered. Now, I use it as a facial moisturizer too. I live in the west, where it&#x27;s really dry. I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels amazing. I love it. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> Great cream! Loved it!</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer I have ever used</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this lotion, however it smells very strong- maybe its the honey, but I can&#x27;t place it. It rubs in well but you have to let it set for a few minutes before applying makeup or else it will mix in a weird way and change the color of your product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its nice, but I have found others in the same price range that I prefer and I will probably not order it again.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  The texture and consistency is thick, but you only need a very small amount for your face and neck.  It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or weighted down. I use this in the morning before putting on my makeup (goes on well under make up) and at the end of the day after I use the Era Organics Dead Sea Mud mask.  The combination of these two products alone has made my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin is clearer and feels more vibrant. The only thing I would say is the sent is not good but it&#x27;s not bad. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had the hardest time finding a face moisturizer that i love but this is it! I have only used it for a week but already can tell a difference. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I have very sensitive skin that has not been irritated at all. I also use it on my body after i shave and it is AMAZING. I look forward to trying out their other products as this will be a keeper.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful. It&#x27;s non greasy and really moisturizes. It smells like shea butter. I just wish it came in a larger container. I&#x27;m almost half way done and that only because I&#x27;ve been trying to not to use it all. Otherwise I would&#x27;ve finished it a while ago! But otherwise it&#x27;s great! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft!  Not moisty, nor oily.  Smells a little funny but that&#x27;s because of all the natural ingredients that are in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I ordered it three times and will order it again. It really makes my skin look more healthy</li>
            <li> I purchased this in September 2014 due to starting Accutane treatment for some acne problems. If any of you have been on accutane then you know it horribly dries your skin out. This moisturizer kept my face from flaking dead skin all over the place. Can&#x27;t say it worked for my lips but then again I never applied it on them. Accutane really messes your lips up!!! I found a lip balm made by Neosporin that works well for severely chapped lips. Well I stopped the accutane 2 months after using it because I could no longer tolerate the side effects. I would not recommend taking that stuff. It&#x27;s not worth it. Now I&#x27;m dealing with GI problems and some other side effects I&#x27;m hoping will eventually go away. On the bright side my acne has gotten a lot better but I really think this moisturizer has more to do with that because ever since I started using it my face feels and looks great. No funny smells to it and it&#x27;s one of the only moisturizers I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy all day after applying it. It&#x27;s also good to know that it&#x27;s organic with no harsh chemicals. I&#x27;m pretty sure years of using chemicals to treat my acne contributed to the problem. Now I only wash my face with water and some salt from my neti-pot kit and apply this moisturizer afterwards. I can tell it&#x27;s making a difference and the best part is I still have almost half a jar left. That should give me several more months of using just one jar. A little bit goes a long way! I&#x27;m definitely sold on this stuff and don&#x27;t need to look for anything else to keep my face moisturized. This stuff keeps my face from feeling oily or greasy even after sweating at the gym. Will recommend to everyone I know!!!</li>
            <li> Not worked at all in my case. I&#x27;ve been having eczema problems in the facial area for a few months now. Used pretty much every single over-the-counter cream/lotion/treatments across different brands and had eventually settled with an Aveno product. Been using the Aveno eczema therapy cream for a while then found this product in Amazon and decided to give it a thought. I didn&#x27;t like the oily after-feeling of the Aveno product and was looking for something lighter, which led me to this product. Plus with all the great reviews, thought it was worth the shot. I started using Era Organics and within 2 weeks of appliance, my eczema not only got worse, but developed additional rashness in other areas (neck, back, and other areas I previously didn&#x27;t have any eczema symptoms). I stopped using this cream now. Probably go back to my other moisturizer products.</li>
            <li> Era Organics Face Moisturizer is an outstanding product and I am very happy that I found it.  My skin is dry and beginning to age (yikes!) When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me because my skin still felt dry. However, I hung in there and used it both day and night. At night, when I have more time, I warm it with my hands and gently massage it into my skin until absorbed--I do this a couple of times. After consistent use, my skin feels smooth, hydrated and in much better condition. My hands are too!&lt;br /&gt;I find the aroma and consistency of the product very agreeable; puzzled my folks who don&#x27;t, especially since the aroma is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you give this product a try and give it a bit of time to work. With consistent use, you&#x27;l be pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the face wash after battling an under eye dermatitis reaction to another &amp;#34;organic botanical&amp;#34; product purchased here on Amazon. I had been battling this rash on my delicate under eye skin for 3 months! It looked awful and the only thing that helped was steroid cream from a doctor, but every time I stopped using it the rash would come back worse. I was having a viscous steroid rebound cycle! I had stopped using the steroid cream for about 4 days and the rash was returning as usual right when these products came in the mail. Instead of starting the steroid cream again I used only these two products and it stalled the rash progression for the first two days, and over the next 3-4 days I could tell it was better! It&#x27;s been a week and I expect it to be fully gone in one more week. I&#x27;ll update in another 1-2 weeks on if it is still helping. I also have sporadic jawline acne that I&#x27;m hoping it helps as well.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this moisturizer so far! I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire teenage life and at 27 I really wanted to find a more natural alternative to achieve clear skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combined with a charcoal bad face wash and Thayer &#x27; s witch hazel toner have give me the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s perfect but it&#x27;s much better than its even been, and that&#x27;s using prescription medication! I do take spirnolactone but other than that these products have given me relatively clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer smells and feels great, not too heavy at all! Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I like the moisturizer.  It is definitely thicker than I thought, but it&#x27;s very nice.  It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and has a pleasant scent. My son has a rough patch on his arm and consistently putting this on the patch, it has decreased in size dramatically.  It is certainly worth trying out.  I remember it as having great, organic ingredients - though this leads me to the reason I took a star off. The printing on the jar wears off too easily.  Within a month my jar is pretty much just white - all the ink rubbed off on my hands.  While it doesn&#x27;t change the product, if I want to recheck the ingredients I can&#x27;t anymore.  It&#x27;s all worn away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted to these products.. as a problem with a lot of women over the age of 40 my skin has become dry in some places and oily in others. The creams I have used in the past have either left my skin greasy or dry and irratatted. This product has transformed my skin.I bragged about these products to my 25 year old daughter and now she is hooked on the products as well.</li>
            <li> This is a really, really nice facial moisturizer. I love that it’s natural and paraben free. It doesn’t take much at all to leave your face refreshed and hydrated all day. I have no problem using it around my eyes even. My skin is really sensitive so I’ve been looking for something just like this. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin creasy!</li>
            <li> A little background first: I have dry and sensitive skin that overcompensates resulting in oily skin throughout the day, resulting in frequent breakouts. I usually switch products after I finish one because skin doesn&#x27;t respond as well if the same product is being used over and over again. I&#x27;ve used Kiehl&#x27;s, Chanel, Mizon, The Face Shop, Nature Republic, Cerave and Sisley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Era&#x27;s face moisturizer for almost 2 weeks, 2x a day. I broke out a tiny bit at first, but now my skin looks great. I had to apply a few layers since my skin is dry, but it never felt heavy and absorbed quite well. I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m a little less oily midday too. I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first (I think it&#x27;s the cocoa butter because Era doesn&#x27;t add perfumes), but you get used to it. Actually, it kind of makes me want to eat it now. So coming from someone who has struggled with life long rough skin and acne, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!  After traveling to New Zealand and seeing all of the hype around Manuka honey and it&#x27;s benefits I was looking around for a night cream and after seeing all the positive reviews on this I thought I would give it a try.  I love this cream. It&#x27;s nice and thick and dries within a few minutes leaving your skin feeling super soft, moisturized, but not oily at all.  Nice light scent has grown on me with time.  I typically break out with many moisturizers but after 2 weeks of using this my acne has actually seen a significant decrease and I currently don&#x27;t have a single breakout.  I also went to the ERA Organics website and love that ERA is a small family based business!  I love this cream and would highly recommend to all of my friends.  I can&#x27;t wait to buy the mud mask and cleanser and hope you continue to come out with new beauty products in the future (specifically a shampoo and conditioner product!).</li>
            <li> This product was as advertised and delivered promptly. It goes on smooth and easy (it&#x27;s quite thick) and you only need a small amount. If you put too much on, it won&#x27;t absorb properly, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing though, I don&#x27;t know. I do like the product, and one jar should last quite a long time. I have very sensitive, dry skin and it&#x27;s great for me - no problems.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave my oily face more oily and shiny. It absorbs easily and leave a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for one day and overnight. I felt the healthy difference in my skin after the first usage. Although there are so many moisturizing properties, it leaves a matte look. Your skin soaks it up like it&#x27;s been longing for this so you can reapply. My boyfriend who doesn&#x27;t know I tried a new product already complimented my new radiance and skin improvement. My breakout from makeup and uneven Tone. Thank you for making this affordable for the quantity. It&#x27;s not as small as I feared.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are both using it and loving it.  Good quantity, good price, positive results.  We both have sensitive skin and it has been fine.  Smells a little weird, but it smell disappears in seconds.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 6 months and this was the first winter that I didn&#x27;t have any issues with dry skin. I love how quickly it absorbs and I love that is made out of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this cream, not oily and really moisturize my skin. However, I do not care for the scent, it has a &amp;#34;yogurt scent&amp;#34; and not very pleasant. I always use another scent of lotion to cover that scent. My skin broke out a little bit after using it for a week. But my skin is clear now and not as dry as before. Overall, this is a good product!</li>
            <li> Best cream for my baby rush, mosquito bite, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so once I wash my face it is always super dry, but then I have to be careful applying oily lotions. This one seemed like the ingredients were all natural so I&#x27;d give it a try and hope I didn&#x27;t break out. It smells like chocolate, which is great for those who like chocolate, but I don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s not going to stop me from using it, though. I think this moisturizer works great, and actually feels like it is helping improve my skin. However, if you are like me, prone to oily skin, you should only use a very, very small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper. Feels good going on and lasts through the day. Has done a good job on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Really, really, really awesome product!! :) Totally assists with inflammation and I love that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; products for our family and myself and I think I might&#x27;ve found &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34; I have only used it for a couple of days, but I see that the patchy spots on my baby are starting to go away (she has eczema) and my face looks as if I drank jars of water and feels very smooth. I really like the results so far, and if this is truly the one, I plan to give it as gifts to all my family and friends. :)</li>
            <li> this moisturizers is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily. There&#x27;s no scent which is nice. I love the size of the container. It will last for a while at this size. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and my new go to moisturizer. It&#x27;s creamy, makes my skin feel amazing, and you get a TON of lotion in the container. I just wish it had sunscreen in it, and then it would be perfect for my daily routine.</li>
            <li> *** Update: 8/4/15&lt;br /&gt;My acne flareups after giving this product another try finally subsided. I&#x27;ve been using organic jojoba oil for the past couple weeks and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update: 7/21/15&lt;br /&gt;I gave this another try and yep, started breaking out. Mostly on my forehead and around the brows near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Original Review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt a little mislead. I mean, it has all the keywords you want to see. Natural, Organic, Healing, Parabens Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the Ingredients that make up what could have been a great product; Aloe, shea butter, coconut oil, cocoa butter, hemp seed oil, all sorts of vitamins and minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, it lists some of the weird stuff like; Methyl Sufonyl Methane, Glycerine, Capric Triglyceride, Saccharomyces/Copper Ferment, Saccharomyces/Magnesium Ferment Hydrolysate, Saccharomyces/Potassium Ferment Hydrolysate, Adenosine Triphosphate and the list goes on and one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my face break out. Unlike the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried that only contained simple ingredients like Raw Shea Butter, Coconut oil and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t use it on my face, I&#x27;m just using it on my body. I might give it another shot on my face, but I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out right now.</li>
            <li> So I see a lot of mixed reviews; mostly good which I&#x27;m glad to see because this cream has done wonders on my skin. Absolutely satisfied with both product and customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to post a picture of my face from just a few weeks ago at the beginning of my deployment and now after using this stuff but that wouldn&#x27;t be wise I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS FOR YOUR MAN IF HE&#x27;S IN THE DESERT. He&#x27;ll thank you later; I feel fresh and moisturized like I just left the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase all their products on their line for myself and my wife. AND FOR ALL YOU ANTI-ORGANIC/ON THE FENCE FOLKS just remember; what did your ancestors use on their bodies? Did they use mass produced factory blends full of chemicals that make their skin feel a certain way or creates a certain smell? NO. They used the best products that they could find and made natural remedies that worked for centuries. So for the fair price I&#x27;ll stick to the good stuff and so should everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID I MENTION; THIS STUFF GOES A LONG WAY? I believe it is because it gives your skin the natural boost it needs to hydrate itself and maintain the oils you develop naturally. I&#x27;ve been using in for about two weeks two to three times daily and it&#x27;s still at the top of the jar. My rosy chapped cheeks are healed and my face feels supple keeping me ready for long days in the sun. I know I&#x27;ll be buying more next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Sorry if my hands gross you out...They are a little dirty (HEHE ^-^ )</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for problematic skin. It calms and heals up my dermatitis really fast. I use this stuff head to toe. I never want to be without it. Tyler has been so great at communication when ever I have a question. Great owners with an awesome product. Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great feel and absorption! Great for those with sensitive skin and who can&#x27;t have strong scents/perfumes.</li>
            <li> Feels creamy, but once applied it aborbs quickly and leaves no oily residue. I have rosacea, acne prone and sensitive skin, and this has been great to my face. I use this at night, and during the day if my skin feels dry after washing it in the morning. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: been using this for almost 2 years now and still loving it! My skins redness has drastically reduced and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbs into skin without greasy residue. Perfectly hydrates your skin without clogging pores (very important for acne prone skin). The owner of the company is very involved &amp; will answer any questions. Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products this Era Organics releases in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream.  Goes a long way, not watery.  Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other creams with spf.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Love it. My face look great, no acne spots and sun damage. It looks resplandecent. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter with dry/ eczema prone skin. So far so good! Leaves her skin soft and silky. The only complain she had was the honey like smell but besides that  - works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 75 different moisturizers in the past few years and this is my favorite. It&#x27;s the only one that is really heavy while still being quickly absorbed. The fragrance is mild cocoa butter. Customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> This product is honestly the best thing I have ever used for my skin. It works wonders for my skin and I know for sure that it will help with anyone who suffers from a skin condition or has sensitive skin like I do. I will never have to look for another product again because this is the solution to my problem. I&#x27;m sure that it will do the same for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Insecurity was my biggest issue because of my skin. I did not even want to leave my house at times but this product, along with other products from Era Organics, have all renewed my skin and gave me the confidence I was looking for. I can honestly say that Era Organics and their products have given me my life back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Therefore I strongly recommend Era Organics&#x27; products to you if you are reading this. Tell everyone about it because I know for a fact that the world needs to know about it. It does not matter what type of skin you have because Era Organics and their products will definitely change your life... They have changed mine.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the smell. It smelled like old vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend smelled it also.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service, had to returned it though.</li>
            <li> I want to give Era Organics my sincerest thanks for the wonderful products and stellar customer service. Customer service is the best of all in my whole life, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few months ago, I ordered this face cream...loved it, so I ordered era organics face wash. They did make a huge difference on my face. I was battling with horrible acne for awhile, I cried so hard because it was so frustrating for me to find a good face product for sensitive skin. I literally lost my hope in face products even high end ones, til era organics came into my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached my face pics. Big difference. Still healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting makeup on before going out of the house every time anymore. You have no idea how happy I am. I am a loyal customer right here for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturiser! Non-greasy yet rich. Results after two months of use are admirable.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer my skin feels wonderful. I really like how it keeps my skin hydrated for hours. I&#x27;ve shared samples of this cream with family and friends who like it too and will be putting their orders in. You won&#x27;t regret trying this cream also very good on elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to make reviews on facial products as I have been disappointed so many times.  My skin is definitely smoother; and the redness in my neck reduced.  I look forward to trying Era Organics other products!</li>
            <li> If I could leave 10 stars, I would. Unbelievable seller, product and delivery. Immediate response to email regarding their product line. I&#x27;ve been cursed with extremely sensitive skin. Up until now, each and every moisturizer dried my skin, burned or a combination of both. Results were not immediate, but with each use, the dry areas continue to improve. Equally important, I do not experience the stinging. My next review will be their luxurious face wash. I highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed. This is a family owned company, and they stand behind their products. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I had an outbreak of dermatitis on my face and several different drugstore creams exacerbated the rash. I did not want to go on prescription medication from the dermatologist and decided to try this cream first. Redness and bumps calmed down after second application and the irritation has totally subsided. This cream is incredibly soothing to the skin. I apply it both am and pm. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with zinc soap. Thrilled with the results! So happy I decided to try this cream before applying prescription strength, toxic creams.</li>
            <li> I ended up using this on my hands instead of my face, so it is ok.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Only thing is my skin is a combination of oily and dry so it&#x27;s best if your skin is that, to not put on too much.</li>
            <li> Although I am a fan of all natural products, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell on my face.  It made me gag and I will have to return for that reason.  I wish they could add a nice pure essential oil to scent the product.</li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism which causes my skin to be really dry. The skin around my mouth and chin is often flaking off and chapped. Since using this product for a week I no longer have these issues. My skin feels cool and hydrated after applying the product. The product is very thick and will last a very long time as a little goes a long way. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the scent is a little unpleasant, it goes away after drying so it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I only use it on my face because I use hemp seed oil on my body, but this stuff is great! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dry. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive and itchy  skin, I only use Vaseline but it&#x27;s oily looking when in public. First two days I use this item, the itch stop and my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, just love it. I use under make up and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch any more. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> The owner of this business is very nice, and clearly there are many customers who really like the product, so please know that this review reflects my own personal taste and my boyfriend&#x27;s, but might not represent yours. Both my boyfriend and I very strongly dislike the smell of this cream, which is strong enough for us both to smell it even when the cream is already spread out thinly on my face. At first it smells like clay, but as I smell it a little longer, it smells to me like the clay is very wet and musty, or mixed with a different kind of dirt or a bit spoiled or some kind of similar smell. The owner was very friendly and helpful, and offered a refund and sent me a new tub when I put up my original review, thinking that it might have spoiled in transit due to the warehouse not being temperature controlled, but the second tub was the same as the first. The texture was fine, but I definitely could not use it with the smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from using moisturizers with a lot of chemicals. For awhile, I was using Obagi products, but I am trying to get away from it. I have adult acne that flares up and I wanted to try natural products.  So far, I have used this organic moisturizer for about 2 weeks. I place it on my face prior to putting makeup (granted, I also use organic makeup). I can tell a major difference because it is lighter on my face than chemical moisturizers. It does have a &#x27;nutty&#x27; smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. My face is softer and the flare ups are not as severe as before. I would highly recommend this product to acne sufferers who like to wear make up.</li>
            <li> I was allergic and couldn&#x27;t use on my face.</li>
            <li> moisturizers well and non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Great cream! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Most face lotions leave my skin feeling greasy or dirty or coated with lotion or still dry, even very expensive lotions, this lotion does none of that. It feels natural and clean, moisturizes my face, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling wet or greasy. Soothes my skin when I rub it on, feels so nice, not like any lotion I&#x27;ve used before. My skin is prone to acne and this lotion has helped my acne rather than made it worse as most lotions do.</li>
            <li> At first it seems great...but then when you put it on it &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; up.  It feels sticky and lumpy.</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t work for me. It has a strange unpleasant smell and it goes on the skin like honey. It feels a little sticky and doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is doing great things for my complexion in only two days! My husband tried it and I ordered a jar for him at his request. My skin looks radiant and I can&#x27;t believe the difference I see in just two days of using it. It&#x27;s absorbed quickly and is not greasy. You need to try it! I promise you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> The smell really turned me off of this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service and product!!</li>
            <li> Face Moisturizer By Era. I tried several  creams  but this one  actually prefer to use this lotion over the face and skin. It leaves my skin feel so soft and smooth  .&lt;br /&gt;love that this is natural. Great ingredients. my skin looks and feels great night and day.for my Sensitive and dry skin&lt;br /&gt;smell good and does not feel greasy when applied .I Will be buying more again</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent company. I have extremely sensitive skin and rashes from some health conditions that this cream completely takes it away. It truly heals my skin. I ordered one and loved it so much I ordered another one right away. Great customer service and personal treatment. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I had to try this for a couple of months before I posted a review. I am really happy with this and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good face moisturizer that has minimal chemicals. It has made my face and neck look ten years younger so far...</li>
            <li> Just amazing as it sinks right into your skin and no greasy or oily feeling, smells great too, definitely worth splurging on or a camu camu infused moisturizer after using their serum that&#x27;s also amazeballs...</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer if you have dry, acne prone skin. The formula is super thick, but blends very easily into the skin. I use this mostly on my face, but works great for the rest of your body (especially when it gets dry in the winter)!</li>
            <li> Best lotion Ever!&lt;br /&gt;My foot surgery scars are quickly vanishing. I was able to see the difference since the first application. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my entire body. My husband and my teen daughter tried this cream and they love it!</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this cream-I am always looking for the best ingredients for my  skin when reviewing moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream plumps my skin with moisture that lasts  all day.  And the vitamins it contains are recognized as beneficial for repairing skin damage.</li>
            <li> This product gives me acne and I never got acne before. Don&#x27;t be stupid like me and buy a bunch just because the rating is high. Try one first and see.</li>
            <li> Loved this moisturizer!  Worked perfect when I got a really bad sunburn!  After applying this daily, my sunburn did not peel, it simply faded.  I also use it as a daily moisturizer! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this face moisturizer based on the review comments from Amazon, but quite disappointed with the product, In summer this makes me to sweat a lot and I didn&#x27;t get the kind of result that the reviews are showing up here. It doesn&#x27;t stay throughout the day, I had to re-apply the cream in the afternoon otherwise I look very tired. Expected more from this cream ( based on the reviews)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different than any lotion or creme I&#x27;ve used.. I noticed its texture is very whip-like and does absorb very easily! It kind of feels like a whipped foundation primer. My skin feels smooth and not greasy, but well-moisturized.&lt;br /&gt; I like to apply it soon after misting my face with my witch hazel &amp; aloe toner (after washing my face) so it has a little extra moisture to work with. I noticed when I put it on my bare, dry skin (long after washing) it didn&#x27;t absorb as well, which is unfortunately normal because the face wash I&#x27;m currently using isn&#x27;t helping my ph :(&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it smells decent. Not bad. Obviously it won&#x27;t smell like vanilla or lavender (thankfully!!) because it&#x27;s organic so keeping that in mind, it sure smells natural, but that&#x27;s definitely not a bad thing imo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, works great to moisturize the skin around my eyes too :) the consistency helped blend my undereye foundation really well. Some lotions can be so greasy the makeup will crease and smear, or drying lotions that just accentuate bad skin when putting makeup on top. EEK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So, today I washed my face and lotioned everything with this creme, eyes &amp; neck too, and I used a powder brush to blend some powder mineral foundation for a light/medium coverage. This lotion is a GREAT for powder foundation (which most of the time makes women look.... Powdery! And dried out... Not attractive.) the makeup glided on my skin And blended beautifully! My skin looked matte with a light glow but not dry or powdery at all. it&#x27;s been a few hours and my skin is getting a little oily in my T zone but that&#x27;s normal for me. My face feels great! I have no irritations and I don&#x27;t feel like I have something yucky on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that my eye shadow still looks really good with no creasing (which greasy products do)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I did use the creme on my eyelids also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for more products Era!!! Keep up the brilliant work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanya in Northern California&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2: The face wash is great but unfortunately, I noticed the top ingredient in the cream is coconut oil which is highly comedogenic (aka clogs pores) and that it did.. I didn&#x27;t understand why! I would even use my microderm machine and even still, after 3 days my skin felt gross, every single pore on my face was clogged and of course, makeup looks bad on bad skin.. I had to give it up, sorry Era.&lt;br /&gt;This journey has taken me down the natural/organic and simple route for my skin and it has improved INSANELY. I use a face wash similar to Era (ph balanced without any sulfate a, alcohols, etc) and follow up with a spray mixture of pure, organic hemp seed oil (Zero on comedogenic scale) pure vitamin e oil (bought online; store vitamin e has additive ingredients) unscented alcohol-free witch hazel, some filtered water, and recently added niacinamide (vitamin b3) and green tea in powder form from a site that sells bulk ingredients to make at-home skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Blown away. My skin has never ever been this clear in ten years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gotta say thank you for introducing me to the organic skin care life. This product may have no worked for me but thankfully I found something that did AND many many people are finding satisfaction in this product. I think it&#x27;s great! Just not for my face .rn California&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2: The face wash is great but unfortunately, I noticed the top ingredient in the cream is coconut oil which is highly comedogenic (aka clogs pores) and that it did..

            <li> Love this cream.  Absorbs quickly and no greasy residue  I love all the wonderful natural ingredients that it has.  I have purchased the manuka honey to eat and wished someone would put it in skincare.  Also purchased the Dead Sea mask and it is a very good mask.  Dries quickly and mine had zero order  I got the I scented.  Hope this fine company comes out with a vitamin c serum.  I&#x27;ll certainly try it.  Very happy I found this family owned company !!!</li>
            <li> I am on accutane so my face was super dry and peeling really bad. The face lotion I was using worked great but was too expensive. I bought this thinking it was a long shot but I needed to try something... and it works great! I was skeptical at first because my skin would dry out and start to peel after only a few hours. After only a few days, my skin stays moisturized all day. This stuff feels great and I love the smell of the cocoa butter. It is half the price and double the size of the stuff I was getting before and works even better. I will definitely be buying this for now on!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely cream which absorbs deeply into the skin.  It has a definite softening effect to the face, but I&#x27;m over 60 and need a little more moisture than most, so it didn&#x27;t work as a facial moisturizer.  It works brilliantly for me as a body cream and I&#x27;m having great success with it for a few persistent eczema patches  LOVE the fresh natural scent.  Great product, price and producer!</li>
            <li> Love this face moisturizer.  It has only quality products and makes my skin feel very smooth. I Have recently switched to all organic moisturizing products for my face and body...all of which are in this moisturizer.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. Natural organic not greasy cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I use it in the morning and at night. My skin is soft not oilly! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin. It heals faster from acne and feels great. The best facial product I&#x27;ve bought in a long time!</li>
            <li> This face moisturizing cream is not moisturizing enough for my skin.  I do have dry skin, and it still feels dry after using this cream.  I have been using it, though, mixed with another more moisturizing cream.  The reason I continue to use it is that it does seem to help my problem with facial redness, which seems better since I&#x27;ve started using this cream.</li>
            <li> Smells great! A bit like cocoa and cream.  It does feel thick but my skin totally eats it up. Love this moisturizer- and the customer service is top notch.  I have combination oily/dry skin and my skin totally agrees with this one.</li>
            <li> it is a great night moisturizer. It is thick and lovely. My skin feels great putting it on and in the am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product! But i think im allergic to something in it. While using it my skin if anything got more irritated and red so im probably allergic to an ingredient. But from reading the reviews im sure its a great product! It just didnt work for me</li>
            <li> Amazing face cream!  and the Customer Service is outstanding.  Thank you Era Organics!</li>
            <li> its oil texture. and skin will absorb it eventually without the feeling of oil. but it start to produce acid smell. i dont know why. i always keep it at bedroom wihout too hot and too much sunshine。 and my face did not change much although it includes everything my skin need</li>
            <li> I love the soft texture. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent however. It smells like cocoa and coconut but not as nice as I&#x27;ve smelt in other products. But overall I like and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother and she loves it. It&#x27;s all natural, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, and leaves your skin very silky smooth. My mother has an aide living with her and she also started borrowing it. I bought this for her hoping it would be gentle on her skin and she  and I were both very happ  with the product. Looks like she found a  new favorite face cream!</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer for sensitive skin I have ever used.  It has kept away the bit of redness I get around my nose, and it has begun to heal some of my old acne scars.  It&#x27;s a very thick cream, so I recommend applying it in a thin layer.  The great thing is that it isn&#x27;t greasy or shiny when you put it on your face; it even works great with a serum underneath, and it still doesn&#x27;t make you shiny.  I have very allergy prone skin and I can not use any products with fake fragrances; this cream has not caused any allergic reaction and it has been a pleasure to wear it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on nicely but when it dries it leaves my hands feeling dry and tight, not soft &amp; moisturized at all. It feels like there is a dry film coating my skin. I purchased this due to all the awesome reviews. So bummed it didn&#x27;t work for me. Going back to my Ology Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion for now. Hope this helps:)  I also wanted to say that Era Organics has stellar customer service.  Tyler reached out to me after reading my review to offer help with this moisturizer.  He also refunded the full purchase price of the product with no return necessary.  This is one of the best companies with the greatest customer service on the internet bar none.  Thanks so much Era Organics!!!</li>
            <li> This is the moisturizer you have been searching for! Thick and rich, creamy and luxurious, it has every ingredient you need for terrific skin. The first ingredient is organic aloe, used for hundreds of years  to treat skin conditions and dryness. I live high in the mountains (8,200 ft) in a ski resort. The dry mountain air has really made my face look dry and  dull. After only a few days of using this cream, I am starting to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried almost everything on the market (organic) and I am sold on the ingredients in this. The harsh exfoliating chemicals in the other creams  made my face burn. This has no smell, nothing to irritate your skin, only natural moisturizers. The price seemed a bit high, but the jar is a very generous 4 ounces compared to the others who have only 2 ounces for the same price, and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recap: The best things about this are the excellent line up of natural ingredients. It has no offensive smell, you get double the amount for the money compared to other organic creams. It has no harsh exfoliating ingredients, and it&#x27;s thicker and creamier than most of the others, I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Leaves my skin very moist during the day and is not greasy</li>
            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer in a long time! I have been using this for about a month now and can definitely see a difference in my complexion! Smooth, soft, vibrant... And surprisingly less acne. I never had huge zits, but had tiny bumps and they are actually gone now. I think it was inflamed hair follicles after doing research and nothing seemed to work. THIS product has helped hydrate, without making my face oily! ALSO I have noticed that I had slight premature lines on my forehead, o my noticeable to myself while looking close in the mirror, but era organics has actually helped that too. I have it about a month, and do love the product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Stuff is amazing ,,Love it the best Moist i ever got</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for: natural cream without all the harsh ingredients. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream I have ever used on my face!  It is lush, but not greasy.  It has no scent that I can detect (a BIG plus!).  I swear I have noticed a difference in the quality of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it: softer, less prominent wrinkles, improvement in texture. Just the best!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice texture and you can tell it is very moisturizing. The smell isn&#x27;t great.... so I added some Wild Orange doTerra oil and problem solved. It&#x27;s a very nice cream.</li>
            <li> Really love the face cream. And knowing it was not made with any animal by-products makes it even better.</li>
            <li> This is my second ERA Organics product. I am very happy with this product line. It is all natural, there is no smell at all. and it works! I have been using this for 2 weeks regularly , replacing my usual moisturizer . I have to say I am impressed. My skin is plump and hydrated. I have also found that this moisturizer seems to have a cooling effect on my skin after a day in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test and try this product in my home. I would have no hesitation recommending this moisturizer to anyone. I plan to purchase this product once my sample is done.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this cream from Era Organics.  This cream is very thick and luxurious. It does have a cocoa butter smell to it .  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy when it absorbs.  I think I may stick to using this on my neck and chest area because they need the most moisture.  It takes this cream  a little while to absorb and is very thick.  This cream hydrates the skin really well and is perfect for anyone with super dry skin.  I am really impressed.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Will not suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I enthusiastically smeared it all over my face and immediately gagged. It smells absolutely putrid. It actually smells so bad I can&#x27;t even tolerate it as a body lotion. Tossed it in the trash. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t get around to writing reviews, but I must say as someone who has tried a gazillion different moisturizers (from Khiel&#x27;s, Elizabeth Arden, Creme de la Mer to Aveeno) expensive and cheap, Era is by far the best value. I really felt compelled to give this product 5 stars. For beginners, it&#x27;s at a great price point, secondly, the cream is pretty dense so just using a little goes a long way therefore lasting a long time. Unlike Khiel&#x27;s facial fuel which you had to use a lot of only to get a decent amount of moisture, Era requires a fingerful at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I love the texture of the cream and how it feels in my skin. Though it is very dense as I said above, it permeates the skin real fast and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. The only lasting impact is that your skin will feel extremely soft (almost like silk) and definitely not dry. Lastly, I&#x27;m a huge fan of the ingredients used because they&#x27;re all organic--shea butter and coconut oil are very good for the skin and have healing properties. Chemicals? Aint&#x27; nobody got time for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only tip to Era is perhaps consider expanding this moisturizer to include SPF. I guess that technically can&#x27;t be organic, but it would be great to use the product if I plan on sitting in the sun for a long time.</li>
            <li> Transformed my skin into no acne, small pores and luminous complexion! Within days!!!</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing. I like it more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used - including Aveda. It leaves my skin feeling satin soft &amp; hydrated in a way I&#x27;ve never experienced before using this product. Used in combination with the cleanser I&#x27;m even seeing my acne start to clear up!</li>
            <li> This cream is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed skin and wear it in the morning and at night. I do not find it too greasy at all for my type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks a lot better: way less blackheads too! The smell is pretty neutral to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid arrived cracked so we were reimbursed. We will most likely order again. So great to find good affordable products with only natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff, really. Feels good, feels right, last for hours, and I see a healthier look the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONE that replaces all the others!</li>
            <li> Very effective cream, will definitely purchase again.  It has a pleasant smell and is very hydrating.  The customer service is excellent as well, very quick to respond to any inquiries.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it and my face isn&#x27;t getting dry, feels nice and I like the fact that I know there aren&#x27;t nasty chemicals being put on my face. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and I&#x27;m so pleased to have found one that I like and feels great on my skin.  It is non greasy so the application of it on the skin goes on smoothly.  I&#x27;m not using any of the other moisturizer because I have found the one that works.</li>
            <li> HEALS AND CALMS MY VERY IRRITATED SKIN</li>
            <li> Having I used high end products up until this point, I can tell the quality difference immediately when applied to my sensitive skin. Not as moisturizing as I hoped and left my face looking dull. You get what you pay for I guess, going back to my $60+ face moisturizers that left my skin looking tight and radiant. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin with some rosacea and usually have to settle for some bland cream with no anti-aging benefits. I was extremely pleased  with this cream as it did not irritate my skin yet moisturized very well. The combination of healthy organic ingredients, gentleness, many long term benefits at a very reasonable cost can&#x27;t be beat. I eagerly look forward to additional products from this excellent company!</li>
            <li> the cream isn&#x27;t greasy, feels good on the skin and per the labet there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals. I used for my face and my feet. I&#x27;m from Florida and have been traveling in the dryer California climate and this was perfect</li>
            <li> Only Cream that doesnt cause my back to break out with acne , it actually helps reduce acne on my back . I am returning customer and will keep buying this product . you get good amount for your money considering other brands which charge alot more for a lot less and still cause my back and face to break out . All natural and organic is a cherry on top !</li>
            <li> NOT ORGANIC! The mfg is Era Organics. The product comes up under &amp;#34;organic face moisturizer.&amp;#34; But, it&#x27;s not. The fine print says &amp;#34;made with organic ingredients.&amp;#34; Titanium dioxide is NOT ORGANIC. The advertising is misleading and I do not like that. I don&#x27;t care if titanium dioxide is an inert dye or a carcinogen (it is debatable). I don&#x27;t want it in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Your product is a God sent for me!  I have psoriasis and I live deep in the desert, which seems to amplify the condition.  The dermatologist gave me a prescription cream that did nothing for me except make my skin feel very tight, dry and hot.  My husband took the time to research other products and Era Organics had the best reviews, so he bought it for me.  OMG what a difference!!!  It cleared my skin, it moisturized my skin and best of all it makes my skin feel cool.  You have got yourself a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much,Di Lucas</li>
            <li> Love this product as no smell and love the texture and how it goes on plus is it all organic. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first applied this moisturizer I didn&#x27;t see any difference, but by the end of the day I noticed that my skin tone had evened out, which was an unexpected surprise.  My skin looked healthier.  The little bit of redness on my cheeks were no longer red, so I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Probably the best face moisturizer that I’ve tried in recent years! I have waited a couple of months before reviewing so I could give my honest thoughts on it. I have combo skin that leans more on the dry side towards the end of the night. This is a thicker cream (but not heavy feeling), so I do have to be careful not to use too much when applying it in my t zone as it can make it a bit oily. It doesn’t irritate my face in anyway and most importantly it doesn’t break me out like other creams with this consistency. I’m about half way done with my jar and will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great cream, nice smell but not to over powering.  I use it to keep my tattoos moisturized and skin healthy looking.  I like that my hands don&#x27;t feel all sticky after I rub it in like with other cheap creams.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, excellent product.  After cycling through so many products (some that worked, others that didn&#x27;t), this actually did the job.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what my diagnosis was.  It might have been acne or regular pimples or a minor allergy to my surroundings, etc.  I believe what I have is &#x27;minor ezcema&#x27; which resemble a light rash that you would get as if you were allergic to something.  My skin wasn&#x27;t smooth and the areas around my cheek were red and a little bumpy, but not pimple-bumpy where you could see individual bumps.  If you have that condition, I would recommend this.  For pimples, I would recommend the Neutrgena Oil Free Acne Stress Control.  For everything else, this is great.  It absorbs fast, and it isn&#x27;t oily.  Great for those who have dry faces but need something to moisturize their face without making it oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Only con I have is that it kind of smells like clay play-doh.  Obviously not a big deal since your bigger concern presumably would be to get the redness off your face (since you did stumble upon this product).  Otherwise, no cons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who constantly has to have hand lotion on their hands.  So I try lots of different lotions to see if any fit the criteria of keeping my hands moist and I&#x27;m happy to say this one does!  Not only that but it&#x27;s natural and has no smell - I&#x27;m funny about smells and some really bother me.</li>
            <li> I love all Era-Organic products and the HR team there is just wonderful! Not only does my skin feel like a babies bottom, but it looks newer and refreshed. And that is not all it is good for! My cousins 3 month old baby had craddle cap and after testing a bit on the back of his arm to make sure he was not allergic, she gently washed a dime sized amount into his scalp and left it in while he was in the bath. After she rinsed it and got him out you could see where all the cradle cap was and how much the Complete helped remove. I have always heard to use baby oil but it leaves you feeling oily. Not with Complete by Era-Organics. This little 4 oz jar has so many uses. I am so thankful that I was able to find this product for review. I will forever keep a jar of this in my refrigerator.</li>
            <li> There are several creams on Amazon with the exact same ingredient list and price, but sold under different brands. I would assume they&#x27;re all made by the same company. The cream is a decent moisturizer and is non greasy. I just find it a bit dubious that the same cream gets different labels affixed to jars and sold under multiple brands.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Not greasy and a little goes a long way.  My skin already looks and feels better.  Love that it is organic.  Definitely recommend!  Must try!!</li>
            <li> As someone who wears makeup and is constantly testing out new products, this is seriously my favorite new moisturizer.  My skin is extremely sensitive and breaks out from almost anything but after wearing the Era Organics moisturizer cream my skin has completely cleared.  I do not have oily skin anymore like I do when I wear store-bought moisturizers.  My pores are no longer clogged and I can walk free without foundation because my skin actually looks good.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, especially people with sensitive skin ! Great product !</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing!! I LOVE it. I have super sensitive skin, and this cream is very soothing. The texture is rich, but it absorbs into your skin and makes it feel very soft. No irritation whatsoever. I even used it right over my (extremely sensitive) eye area, which I would never do with a department store cream. I&#x27;ve always had to buy separate eye cream. No more! I&#x27;ll be saving money on that. Very glad I found this product, I&#x27;ll be continuing to buy this.</li>
            <li> I am really delighted with e.raorganics as a skin product. I actually look forward to applying it to my face which is a little above and beyond what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency, the lovely smell, the cost are all plus points as well, with the fact that it actually gets absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Non-GMO and organic as well. An excellent product. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> My shin is starting to get really dry now that it is getting cold out. This product worked great and lasted. No greasy after feel either.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best face cream ever. I wear under my make up and it makes my skin look flawless. No breakouts either. This is my one and only cream now!</li>
            <li> Please see my 5 star review posted with the Facial Cleanser.  I love this product.  My daughter is having teenage acne and using the cleanser and moisturizer her skin is clearer, the acne is healing and she has less blackheads.  I believe this is because her face is not having to produce oils after she has stripped it with a cleanser that does not match the skin&#x27;s actual ph level.  My daughter has incredibly sensitive skin and these products have only soothed her skin and it is no longer red or itchy.  The manuka honey is a natural antibacterial and is very healing.  So that along with the other list of healing ingredients makes this moisturizer one of the best we have ever used.  I use this moisturizer as an eye cream as well and it works great!</li>
            <li> The product is not greasy, no perfume smell!! Ah, what a relief.  works great under make.  I have very sensitive skin, and it worked well for that, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick, but soaks in very well. It keeps my dry hands moisture for a significant period of time, but just isn&#x27;t quit enough. Plus if I reapply it on my hands too often if builds up and feels uncomfortable. It makes an excelent leg lotion. I have not used it on the face. To my the cream smells like sunscreen (not the nice coconutty  kind), but it&#x27;s a smell I can easily live with. Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite moisturizers of all time. I&#x27;m a true-hard fan of Korean cosmetics, but have decided to be more conscious about my make-up choices re: organic and/or non-harmful ingredients. I&#x27;ve slowly begun replacing some of my cosmetics with products like e-raorganics. So far, I absolutely love this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this moisturizer during the day. Although it feels heavy when you first put it on your skin, it immediately absorbs into your skin. I never rub my moisturizer into my face - I pat it into my face for absorption. It leaves my face feeling soft and radiant. I&#x27;ve already gotten remarks on how much better my skin has gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful that eraorganics will have something lighter for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very smooth n dries reaaly fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various moisturizers these past 7-8 months, and most of them are okay, but none of them equal this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you almost can&#x27;t apply too much, my face soaks up pretty quick any amount I throw on it. And, this cream does just glide on, almost flows actually. Further, it is truly scent free, totally neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you get 4 oz, for about what 2 oz. cost for lesser quality products elsewhere. They seem like real nice folks as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t add much to what these other folks have said in their reviews, and I don&#x27;t know what people in Hollywood and Beverly Hills are using on their faces, but this stuff is both awesome and affordable to most .</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with acne and I&#x27;m almost 30; the first time it hasn&#x27;t been an issue is since I started using this moisturizer! Everything else in my skincare regimen is exactly the same but the moisturizer and it&#x27;s a miracle cream in my opinion. I&#x27;m thrilled with its (mostly) organic ingredients and it appears to be vegan other than the honey, which I can deal with but would prefer to do without. I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Over 2 years later and I&#x27;m still loving this stuff! I saw there were some concerns about fake reviews. I don&#x27;t know how to prove it but I&#x27;m just a joe schmoe who loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I don&#x27;t even use lotion, but once I came across this product I became a daily lotion user! My hands get really, really dry during winters, and they eventually start cracking and bleeding. But I found that whenever I applied this product to those areas when it was in that state, I&#x27;d get instant relief and my hands would be in a completely different state by the next morning. Also this lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a film across your skin -- it soaks into your skin right away and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling thick and gooey, like how fancy name-brand lotions affect me. Literally my hands feel like baby powder whenever I use it. I&#x27;ve recently started using it on my face, and it works great for that, as well. I also love how it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Plus it&#x27;s organic!!! I&#x27;ll most likely only use this product from here on out. It does exactly what I need it to, and I know I&#x27;m not putting a ton of chemicals into my body whenever I use it. I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face which I have a few times now. I love the way it smells and feels. Very creamy. My skin drinks it up fast. There is no greasy feeling at all. I&#x27;ve been using it mainly on my hands, arms and legs. Twice a day.</li>
            <li> This could have been a great product if they didnt include a few ingredients that are known skin irritants. I should have researched more fully before I bought it. So many lotions have been ruined due to manufacturers making their product creamy and to perserve it. Its a shame. That being said, this product is much better then the chemical ridden junk you find at swanky skin stores which charge you big money to rub large amounts of cheaply made chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product in July.  I was in the process of completely eliminating the toxic items in my health and beauty regime elements and this was the first moisturizer I found that lived up to and even exceeded my expectations.  I love the natural ingredients and the composition includes significant percentages of the important additives to really make good on their claims. The product absorbs very well and provides great moisture. It also is not oily nor greasy - I live in South Florida and just walking outside creates a sweat bonanza so this is very important to me. I use it daily and double up and put on thicker coats after home glycolic peels or other harsher face treatments.  It is wonderfully soothing and has made my skin noticeably better.  Recommended then and continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and for the money, you get a generous amount of it.  I like the fact that it has no strong scent is light, goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy.  I am especially happy to find an organic product that meets all my needs.  I know I will buy more of this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girlie girl who&#x27;s bought a lot of creams in her life and this one is special. Really soaks right in fast and no oiliness. Face is looking plumper and younger! That&#x27;s what we like --- a baby face.  Asti</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet and love it.(I know it says face) But it works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy marks on the sheets.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Very moisturizing without being greasy! Finally! A little goes a long way too. So happy I got it!</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth, quickly absorbing and non-irritating skin cream.  I like it for my sensitive skin.  Not working any miracles for my rosacea but it is a great cream and base for makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the way it glides on and that it&#x27;s unscented. Has a luxurious feeling to it. Makes my skin happy! Love the great ingredients. This is a totally good investment in your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my 60 year old face with a smooth wonderful fresh non-greasy feeling.  Feels unlike any other cream I&#x27;ve used.  I have no idea what makes it feel so different, but that&#x27;s ok.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Makeup goes on evenly on top.  Love this stuff, please don&#x27;t stop making it.  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Light but really moisturizers my very dry skin</li>
            <li> This also arrived in good condition.  The cream is easy to apply.  It is also very light.  I think it is also firming up my skin.  My skin looks much brighter.</li>
            <li> It is so good I wanna eat it!!! I am in love with this moisturizer and this is the deal right here! it stays on your face for hour.. literally hours. And it doesn&#x27;t come off when you wash your face with water which is incredible. When I use it, my face doesn&#x27;t get oily at all (I have very oily skin) it keeps my face moisturized really well. And I also like that I can use it around my eyes to reduce puffiness. Some people dont like the smell of it, I agreed to this when I applied it on my face for the first time, but then I got used to it and actually like the smell of it now and dont have any problems with it. Another drawback is that hair and particles get stuck to the moisturizer sometimes and its kinda not appealing, but that&#x27;s not a big deal either. I prefer this design over dispenser&#x27;s and because you get to use every bit of the cream.This isn&#x27;t a sponsored review and you should definitely try it</li>
            <li> Awful smell to it... Sort of like rotten eggs. It worked fine, but I can&#x27;t stand to put it on my face and smell like that till it is all absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After I left this review, the company contacted me and explained it was probably a left over jar that didn&#x27;t get sold right away which started separating. That was the cause of the smell. They had great customer service and even sent out a new jar so I can see the difference. Have not received the jar yet but its great to know they have amazing customer service if something was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product overall.  Good for the hands.  Not great for the face.  There is emulsifying wax pretty high up on the ingredient list which causes my skin to get clogged.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin</li>
            <li> I waited to review this purchase for the purpose of seeing how it performed. I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised!! I live on the water where it is very windy most days and get dry patches so bad!! This has been a Godsend. I dab on a little more in the spots that are patchy and it has completely remedied my problem spots. I also love that I can put my foundation on top of it and blends nicely. It&#x27;s going into my permanent routine, for sure.</li>
            <li> A wonderfully light and refreshing cream. I like the feel of the cream on my face and I know I’m using all natural organic ingredients, free of main-stream cosmetic chemicals. This cream is great!</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer/skin care product I have tried that actually REPAIRS skin, and doesn&#x27;t just keep it hydrated. I only need to put this on once a day, whereas the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried in the past required 2 applications per day. Gave some to my friend who has dark circles/baggy eyes, and WOW! they disappeared within a week! FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Product works great! I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitivities and the faint chocolate aroma and creamy texture are very successful moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this cream, it&#x27;s not runny like many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  After I applied it on my face I liked it right away. After a few applications the dry area on my face improved and my dried hands felt great just after one application. I am yet to have my husband trying it on his dry hands. I&#x27;m sure he will like the fact that is fragrance free and it absorbs fast. Era Organics is a brand I would like to see more products from. They definitely have my support.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but I dont like the smell</li>
            <li> good cream for wrinkles and i use it for my neck.This cream is a little thick i added a couple of drops of water to make it more thinner.This cream didnt clog my pores love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Great product from a great product line</li>
            <li> Live this cream!  It is so light and absorbs quickly with no sticky feel to it. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for a week and a half, and will try to update after I&#x27;ve used it longer.  Here are my thoughts so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cream I recieved is very similar to other cold creams I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, but very thick.  A little bit goes a long way, and it melts into my skin.  It feels luxurious going on, and absorbs quickly.  My face is less oily when I use this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just two applications healed persistent, red, dry, and flaky patches of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cystic adult acne, and have tried *everything* to clear up my skin.  I love Doterra&#x27;s Clear Skin Foaming Cleanser and Spot Treatment, they&#x27;ve made a difference, but the acne persisted no matter what moisturizer I used, until now.  In a week and a half of using this cream, I have not had one new blemish pop up, and the old blemishes are healing well or gone!  I&#x27;m hoping the results will continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream does have an odd smell.  I would say it&#x27;s reminiscent of ricotta and honey.  It&#x27;s not offensive, but it&#x27;s not what most people are accustomed to expect from personal care products.  The smell goes away in 10 or 15 minutes for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months of use, I still have some of my first jar left, and my acne is significantly better than before I started using this product.  When I do get blemishes, they are generally smaller and heal faster.  It&#x27;s also been wonderful on my dry hands in the winter!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and this product has helped me sooooooo much! I put it on in the morning and at night when I&#x27;m done with work and my hands are smooth as a baby&#x27;s buns!</li>
            <li> Really amazing moisturizing cream. I love the cocoa butter smell and how it feels once applied to my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my wife and she absolutely loves it. We had a hard time finding a healthy alternative to the lotions out there loaded with chemicals and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love all the natural ingredients! I have very sensitive skin, and lately its been very dry probably due to winter and I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a week now on my face and I&#x27;m liking the results. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily like all other lotions I&#x27;ve tried and I feel like it evens my skin tone so I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation anymore.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the stuff I&#x27;ve been looking for my entire life.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer actually dried my face out.  I am 30 with normal to dry skin.  But in the -10 winters here, my face gets very dry. This lotion did not help it at all.  It actually made my face feel more tight and dry.  It&#x27;s now going to sit on my desk as a hand moisturizer since it smells nice like chocolate.  I&#x27;m actually going to reorder Christina Moss Naturals Moisturizer which I got amazing results with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G0EJYFW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> This cream completely solved my dry, peeling winter skin on my face. I tried multiple drugstore night creams and still had very dry skin. It is soothing, but not too heavy.  My sister has a little more oily skin and she can use it without getting break outs as well. The jar is a pretty good size for the price compared to the night creams from the top beauty brands at drugstores. Definitely worth it and plan on using year round!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the perfect reviews and the excellent ingredients list. All 25 reviews are 5-star, not one complaint. Is this for real?&lt;br /&gt;My highly anticipated jar arrived today and as soon as I opened it my heart sank. It looks like ricotta cheese, nothing like in the picture. I know, marketing pictures are not always representative. But in addition my nose was assailed by the smell---NOT a fresh scent like some people have claimed. It smells like I made a thick paste with white bread!&lt;br /&gt;I want to send it right back, like 10 minutes ago. If anyone can change my mind, please do so as soon as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[edit: as my experience was personal, I&#x27;m adding one star for excellent customer outreach.]</li>
            <li> I LOVE that Era Organics moisturizer is unscented! I LOVE that it readily gets absorbed into my skin rather than leaving an oily or greasy-like residue that gets on my clothes!! And mostly I LOVE that it&#x27;s made with only natural non-toxic ingredients!!! Thank you for this superior product.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few days,  I am very fortunate that I do not have acne, dry or oily skin, and have a good complexion .  I wanted a moisturizer that is organic with out all the harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry. I am totally in LOVE with this moisturizer, it is everything that Era Organics claims it to be. My face feels moisturized all day long, even after a workout and sweating! I had my husband try it and he says &amp;#34;This stuff is Miracle Lotion&amp;#34; ! We can&#x27;t wait to try more of Era Organics products and refer our family and friends.  I do agree that the product is on the expensive side for whole body use but, I can only image how great my entire body would feel using it.  I might have to give my body a moisturizing treat!  Thank you Era Organic for a terrific product that is not harmful!</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my face.  It makes your face soft which is always nice.  I am a person who likes to try different products and I could see myself buying this again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this.  This time I&#x27;m giving it to my son.  He tried the other jar and it felt really good on his skin.  Thanks Era Organics!  Great for eczema!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another jar.  It&#x27;s very very gentle and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I searched all over the internet for an organic face cream that would help heal the dry patches on my face from this relentless winter weather. I have been using this product for about a week and already there is a noticeable improvement in my skin texture. The dry patches have shrunken considerably. My skin feels smooth and moisturized. Even my makeup goes on more evenly. I put it on before bed and also under my makeup during the daytime. I like the smell- it&#x27;s a light shea butter/honey smell, which I find to be quite nice. The container is huge so I feel like I will be using this for a long time without running out. The owner of the company emailed me personally to tell me about his company and his product, so I know he cares about what he is making and what his customers think about the product. Great company- I will definitely buy this cream again.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell the best in my opinion, and sadly so far it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized! I feel like it makes my skin feel more dry, but I think a lot of these types of products tend to do so (or so I am now finding out!) I am still going to keep trying it here and there and hopefully it works for some out there, but for me I am going to stick to using it NOT on my face and just my arms and legs. I just don&#x27;t think this works that well when applied to the face.</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on creams and lotions that do not even compare to the high quality of this face cream.  It felt so good on my face and helped to soothe the dry spots that I was experiencing mainly around my eyes and eyebrows.  A little bit goes a long way, so this jar should last me a good amount of time.  I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered this product and plan on using it for years to come!</li>
            <li> I got one for my gf and she speaks highly of this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this face cream! I&#x27;m on my second jar of it and use it morning and night and sometimes in between. I also use it on my hands and neck. It sinks it quickly and leaves my skin feeling  AMAZING! It has helped improve my texture, firmness and I believe has helped my minor chin breakouts as well. I have been a long time organic make-up and skin care consumer and have tried various companies prior. This moisturizer takes the cake! I will definitely be using this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is thick and creamy, but absorbs quickly into the skin and does not leave the face feeling oily! I have mild to moderate adult acne and this surprisingly did not cause my face to break out! After 3 weeks of use, I am seeing a difference in my skin, pores and fine lines seem smaller and skin tone is more smooth. I have tried numerous moisturizers and essential oils and this by far is the winner!! The price is very reasonable. It comes in a 4 oz tub but it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover the face. Would highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I literally just purchased and received this product and used for the first time today, so I am reviewing based on the immediate results (I will try and remember to post an updated review in a couple weeks). I opened the package and just like all the other reviews say, it was quite thick. My skin has never done well with thick creams but I put it on my skin and it immediately soaked in without any greasy residue (yay!). I have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone, Rosacea skin and it turns red with the slightest touch of anything I put on my skin, except with this. My nose turned a little red but that is normal for me. There was a very short, tingling/burning sensation at first but I barely could notice it and since my skin didn&#x27;t turn red, I doubt it was actually irritating my skin. It really did smell like chocolate! I&#x27;m not sure why some other reviewers have hated the smell, I&#x27;m assuming either every batch is different or their smell sensors are off. Either way, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all and went away within seconds of applying. It has been on my skin for over half an hour now and what normally would be extremely oily after any other moisturizer, my skin is still just as moisturized and non-oily as when I first applied it. I can&#x27;t WAIT to see the results and knowing I&#x27;m not putting gross toxins in my skin every day! Btw, I use Apple cider vinegar as a toner, so anyone who wants to try that along with this moisturizer, I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Creamy but not oily.</li>
            <li> i just received the cleanser with the moisturizer and i really love these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not just like, but love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i switched from using Alba Botanica to Era Organics and i&#x27;m so much happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is so much happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Era Organics is blessedly fragrance free which is good news for me because i&#x27;m allergic to some essential oils (especially lavender) that cause my skin and eyes to burn, swell, and turn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like having cleanser and moisturizer that are made from the same company because skincare works at the cellular level and i don&#x27;t want the formulas to clash.  sometimes even this doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thankfully, Era Organics loves my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no stinging or burning the whole day.  that&#x27;s a first in a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after i use the cleanser, my face doesn&#x27;t tighten up like it always does with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i still need the moisturizer but at least my face isn&#x27;t stripped and hurting before i put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you Era Organics!</li>
            <li> Fabulous creme.  Smells wonderful and is very hydrating and soothing on rough skin.  I&#x27;ve reordered this 3 times already!  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> 01/24/2015. I use this cream about 3 month，Why do I suffer from acne after use？&lt;br /&gt;(I only use kiehl&#x27;s cleanser and this cream everyday)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what causes acne, but my face is very oily when I woke up now.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll try other moisture and Oil Control face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/25/2014. My cheek was peeled before, I apply morning and night after cleansing with this cream。&lt;br /&gt;Skin better now. Also the costumer service is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/22/2014. I receive this cream, but when I open the package, jar is dirty and cream was came out.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is non-greasy, not heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  I slather it on my face, neck and chest at night and my skin feels amazing in the morning.  I also use it everyday instead of foundation, just put a little bit of powder on over it and I am not greasy or oily at all but I do feel like my skin is being moisturized.  My skin has never looked or felt better and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this moisturizer earlier on in life!  It&#x27;s also organic, which I LOVE!  I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is an great moisturizer. My skin loves it!!!!! Although the ingredients list is very challenging to read, Not sure all that is in it.</li>
            <li> This is a very think cream. I have oily skin so I use this to remove my makeup. I just put it on then take it off with warm water and it leaves my skin very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Not great quality for adults. I use it for my daughter because it is supposed not to have chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> so far it has not irritate my skin. it&#x27;s very light and not greasy. I am still using it though I haven&#x27;t seen significant result yet. I just notice that after using it for at more than 1 week, my face is not as shiny as it used to be. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see what happens after a month or so.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream but it makes my face breakout. I could not figure out why I was breaking out so badly until I read that coconut oil, cocoa butter, and a few other ingredients cause breakouts.  I needed a healing cream because I had an infection on my face that started in a blemish. in healing it I dried out my face.  I am trying to avoid blemishes to avoid another staph infection and am having one blemish after the other and am fighting infection.  I wish I would have saved my money.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker moisturizer than I usually use but it seems to be doing the trick. Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Cream feels good on face and is fragrance free.  I am hoping that it will come in a tube and not in a jar so it won&#x27;t get contaminated easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered with Amazon Prime and the 4oz cream actually came earlier than expected. I really like the moisturizer. I use it in combination with African Black soap and within just the past three days I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is brighter, my dark marks are fading, and my previous bouts of acne are going away faster than using the black soap by itself. The cream is really moisturizing, a little does go a long way, I can tell it&#x27;ll last for a while and I love that it&#x27;s all organic. This is my new staple face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Nice, it makes my skin feel hydrated and soft without being greasy! I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is awesome! My face feels &amp;#34;nourished&amp;#34; after applying this cream.</li>
            <li> I love the products. It&#x27;s organic, has a great smell and every time I apply it to my face, I want to eat it. Even my cats will meow and want to lick my face after I use it. I have very sensitive skin and so far this product works well, it&#x27;s not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t give me any breakout. I tried it on my hand because I have cracked skin and it healed my hand. I&#x27;ve tried another honey skin product before and it didn&#x27;t heal my hand. I think the manuka ingredients in this product works very well for healing the skin. So far it&#x27;s recommended product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  The smell was subtle and nice.  I actually added Frank to it to make it a little better for my skin but I&#x27;m loving this tub of beauty.  I&#x27;ll be reordering soon!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t broken out after using this on my face.  I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now.  I didn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis when I first got it.  Now that it is the cold season, it&#x27;s the best time to test how well it moisturizes.  I love the fact that it is fragrance free and natural.  It does have a little smell which dissipates really quickly.  Like one of the other viewers have said, it smells like plain yogurt.  Better than some perfume smell right under my nose, which usually triggers off my allergy.  But the smell does go away shortly after you apply it.  Great product for your face, does absorb into  your skin and so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a coating of lotion sitting on your face.  That is a plus for me.  I like lotions and cream to actually gets absorbed into your skin like water.  Most lotion and cream just sits on top of your skin and makes you feel a little greasy.  This one goes into your skin and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer for severe eczema! Have tried many things over the years and have wasted a lot of money. I&#x27;m so happy to finally find something that works for my daughter. You can&#x27;t put a price on bringing relief to your child&#x27;s itchy, irritated skin. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years (decades rather as I am 50yo) for a facial moisturizer that neither clogs pores nor leaves my skin still dry and flaky after washing.  My search is over.  This cream simply works.  And not sure if the dissatisfied reviewers got a different batch, but the consistency of the cream I received is very smooth and light.  Absolutely love it.  This is my first dealing with this company and I look forward to ordering again when this jar runs low.</li>
            <li> I have THE most sensitive and dry skin on the planet AND I live in the desert.  This cream is literally drenching my skin in much-needed moisture WITHOUT causing redness, irritation, or breakouts.  I have searched for nearly 6 years for the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; and spent too many dollars to admit---but in this cream by Era Organics I do believe that I have found the cure.  It is easily absorbed, unscented (unlike so many other natural/organic products) and simply glides on and m-e-l-t-s into your skin.  Additionally, the customer service department is unbelievable; so willing to help, answer questions, and make suggestions.  Prompt, professional and really knows the product.  I urge anyone, problem skin or not, to switch from your current cream to this one.  Worth it!</li>
            <li> After only a short period of time I have noticed a significant softening of my skin and with sun damage and 66 years of age that is quite a feat</li>
            <li> The results will speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;I used this the first day I received it and said &amp;#34;NO WAY&#x27;&#x27; !!. I had, key word &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; those parenthesis or marionette lines on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of light fingertip taps of this cream, those lines disappeared. I&#x27;m not a 20 year old reviewer, 20 is not in my review mirror,  it&#x27;s up around the bend behind a big boulder where you can&#x27;t see it, if you catch my drift .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also moisturizes dry and over worked hands, I scrubbed out pots and pans after this past Thanksgiving dinner last week, if you&#x27;ve used abrasive cleansers and brillo pads and you&#x27;ve spent 1/2  hour or more in water you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really cold out now, and I normally need lots of lotion and/or hand creams not with this. You&#x27;ll see just how small dabs will be sufficient to get smooth soft hands, your skin will be very moisturized and glow. I wish it was spf 30 .  I usually wear a make up containing SOME spf so I guess you can&#x27;t have it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cream, yes a rich mousse like cream. It absorbs quickly and COMPLETELY and it&#x27;s not tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t really a fragrance to speak of, to my mind,  once rubbed in it smells sort of like HONEY, which it contains so no surprise there I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d call this a unisex fragrance since it&#x27;s so faint any guy&#x27;s wondering if they should purchase this for themselves I say GO FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat this, I know once it&#x27;s gone, ( that will be awhile since so little is needed).  I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy more, it&#x27;s a no brainer.  I&#x27;m TOTALLY pleased and in love with this product.  No need for any other moisturizers for my face or hand lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has exceeded my expectations , I see there are several creams that are similar or claim to be, here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;However, for my money I KNOW I  made the right choice. If, this has helped, click yes below. Thank you.</li>
            <li> great product-great price</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing! It&#x27;s not too drying, but it&#x27;s also not greasy. As someone who has combination skin, finding the right moisturizer is a terribly daunting, and expensive, task. But this moisturizer is wonderful; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I use a facial cleanser that makes my skin feel really tight, so I needed a moisturizer. I went through a couple non-organic ones until I came to this. It is a huge plus for me that this product is natural and unscented. And after coming home from a 9 hour day at work, my face still feels moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the price is high, you only need to apply a small amount to notice the positive effects. This stuff will last me at least 4 months (I&#x27;ll update if I&#x27;m wrong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope more people try this stuff, so the company would be able to lower the price. I know everyone would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 1 month in and I&#x27;m not even 1/4 of the way done. I only use on face once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different types of products from all over the world. Nothing has worked as well as this product has. I&#x27;ve gone the dermatologists used the best products you can buy from the best makers of skin creams. Nothing has worked better than this! I&#x27;ve only been using it two weeks and the results are fantastic! It&#x27;s cleared up by rosacea and helped with the blemishes that I have on my face. I do highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice cream that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It&#x27;s also not just good for the face. the label says face and body</li>
            <li> This product is great for my oily sensitive skin, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent and has a smooth creamy, thick feel to it (a little goes a long way). My skin feels moisturized but not overly oily which is surprising because it&#x27;s a rich product. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and have no regrets, will purchase and recommend to product to friends and family. I&#x27;m also going to try the other items on their product line.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I am on my 2nd jar and my face looks great! My pores are smaller, I&#x27;m not breaking out...love this cream!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this. I&#x27;m allergic to most skincare products, but this is something I can use safely. After ten weeks of mostly daily use, my face is very soft and my complexion is as good as it can be, given that rosacea causes its own form of adult acne. At first, the cream even helped the rosacea redness, but as the weather has warmed up I&#x27;m constantly pink again. Also, with rosacea the nose tends to swell, especially if you eat food triggers. This cream has stopped that. At first there were tiny dots of lymph I had to blot off my skin, but over time that has stopped entirely and my nose doesn&#x27;t swell anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the tendency for the cream to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; as it dries, I noticed that too when I was using too much of it at once. Using less and spreading it further over my face, neck, and upper chest resolved that issue nicely.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as it&#x27;s wintertime and with gas heat, we get extremely dry in our home. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavily perfumed. My husband has psoriasis and is sensitive to a lot of lotions that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face and it felt okay, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Because it&#x27;s organic, the ingredients are natural. It feels great for my feet and legs, and I will use it as a lotion instead of a face cream. I&#x27;m glad I got the chance to try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this product.  It absorbs well and my skin is not allergic to it.  My face is very sensitive.  I have nerve inflammation at times from shingles on my face from years ago.  Your moisturizer immediately calmed the nerves in my face.  It is very difficult for me to find a product my face agrees with, so thank you.  My face feels calmer and it looks better too.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the smell (like chocolate) but most of all, I love the natural ingredients. The company&#x27;s customer service is top notch and they create a personable relationship with each customer to ensure you are happy with their product. I have already purchased several of these as gifts for friends and family, and I will continue to use this cream myself. Thank you ERA Organics for creating such an amazing moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Definitely going to continue ordering this item.  My face is so smooth and the price of this item is just right.</li>
            <li> My 1st amazon review....that&#x27;s how amazing this stuff is. Full of healthy ingredients,  texture is superb.  I&#x27;ve tried many face creams and this is my fave. No break outs, just baby smooth feeling when put on face. I&#x27;m addicted and plan to get more of this brand simply for that reason. Great price for generous size.</li>
            <li> Before giving my feedback, I want to genuinely thank the manufacturers of Era Organics. I am very particular in my skin regime and from past few months I have been purchasing only organic products. I was looking for a moisturiser that is neither too mild nor too thick with full absorption. I am very happy about my purchase and in fact it acts as a perfect base for my sunscreen too. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasy but instead you feel supple and soft. I will definitely recommend this to all types of skin and would be purchasing my next bottle for my mom.</li>
            <li> I really have to be careful not to use too much of this product because it can clog my pours.  But, when I use a thin layer at night - I love it. . .</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for who are suffering from acne and oily skin like myself. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for more than 10 year now. For the past few years, my acne developed to severe acne, I tired tons of skin care products, and I even paid a fortune by going to a dermatologist which didn&#x27;t cure my acne. After the first day of trying this product, it helped me eliminated oil on my face significantly, and it claim down my acne a lot. Now, I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month. I have to say this product is the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried. My acne is almost gone except for the scars.</li>
            <li> it seems ok in helping with some facial redness. I am not impressed though of this company using titanium dioxide. It is a useless ingredient and not good for you. For a organic product I was not impressed by that get rid of that ingredient and put in another thing for coloring natural.</li>
            <li> I got this because through a mis-use of RetinA, microderm, and other peels etc (I know I was awful) I ended up leaving my skin very raw, with an awful uneven skin tone and &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; look it to. It was basically dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this helped it heal overnight? No!&lt;br /&gt;Has it helped it get a bit better? Yes it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like all the ingredients are very nourishing and hydrating. It does not irritate me at all, which is great, and the smell is just pleasant enough to be used at day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used this as a moisturizer and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, Rosacea and psoriasis.  I will be 50 this year so fine lines and anti-aging are a major concern.  After three days of using Complete, the Rosacea was almost completely gone.  My skin looked brighter and smoother.  My face did not feel irritated. The cream is moisturizing but not heavy.  It works great under makeup. I am amazed at the results after only a few days.  With my skin sensitivity, it is difficult to find products that work.  I feel like I have won the lottery!</li>
            <li> Incredible! I can&#x27;t leave the house without having this on. It doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin like a lot of moisturizers. It soaks right it and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy. I use the Era Organics wash as well and I highly reccomend both of these products! My face is now clearer than it has ever been and you won&#x27;t be sorry if you splurge and get the set!</li>
            <li> This product is a favorite.  Smooths,feels great and has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> deep moisturizing and hydration--- a definite wise choice of products</li>
            <li> I only use natural and organic products, and hate chemicals.  I also hate chemical names. I ordered this cream because of the high reviews.  To my surprise, the product worked great and was as described.  My skin on my face looks better the first day after I used it.  I just think they should do a better job helping people understand all the ingredients.  I know it works, but, I don&#x27;t understand why they have to use those long names on the ingredients.  Make it simple!</li>
            <li> I am about to celebrate my 5th anniversary of my 29th birthday. I have never stuck to a face cream before despite my age and need to use it. Why? 1 reason, I have oily skin! And so using a face cream means my skin will be 12 times as oily an hour after I leave the house. I am so happy to report that this is not the case with e-raorganics complete face lotion!!!! What better reason could you need???</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but its definitely not for mature skin.  Sinks right in (if that&#x27;s what you like, you&#x27;ll love this), but because of this my skin feels dry and stiff shortly afterwards.  I like the dewy moisturizers at this stage in my life (54yo).</li>
            <li> Smells great. It has a matte finish and an unusual texture so it wasnt what I was expecting. I have peri-oral dermatitis and this has been thr first product I found that didnt aggravate my rash and actually helped it clear up. I use it in conjuction with Era Organics face and body cleanser. I will not be using anything else.</li>
            <li> I loved the results I received from the product like it evened out my skintone however it started to make me break out in these teeny tiny bumps all over my face. Quit using and started using Simple moisturizer for a while &amp; it went away.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more emollient, was looking for something like the la mer moisturizing cream which is super expensive and although this product does not resemble la mer&#x27;s cream for me it satisfies what Im looking for in a cream, all natural organic ingredients is very important when you have sensitive skin like rosacea. This product smells nutty and absorbs quickly. Would buy again but at the price I purchased it for which is the sale price.</li>
            <li> Very waxy texture. Not at all what I was expecting. Very strange smell as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. No medication, lotion, diet change, hydration, etc has been more helpful or as quick-acting as this cream. Total life saver. I had a huge eczema flare up on my shoulders and felt desperate. I took a whim and ordered this lotion on Amazon and it healed my skin tremendously in a matter of a few days. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This face cream is fantastic. I have oily/dry combination skin with rosacea. It&#x27;s a nightmare. I have only used this cream for about a week now, but I have already noticed a difference. I have tried SO MANY creams since developing rosacea a few years ago. This is the only one that I have had positive results with. Not even the sulfatecetamide prescribed by my doctor worked. As a bonus, this cream is not greasy and there is almost no scent at all. It smells a little like cream (which I like). I&#x27;m leaving the country for a while, so I immediately ordered another 4oz jar of this lovely face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 5 mos now and my rosacea has really improved. I have an occasional flare up around my monthly cycle, but a zinc supplement keeps that in check for the most part. Just ordered another jar. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother with this lotion. It is gentle. It has a faint yeasty scent that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.. I am very consistent on a certain moisturizer that I use and ALWAYS compare to that.. This one is really good and close to the type I use on a regular day... I was pleased</li>
            <li> Great cream!  Makes skin so soft...</li>
            <li> best lotion i have used</li>
            <li> I want to make sure before I write any review. So, I&#x27;m using this product everyday. With winter time approaching, my skin get dry...but I&#x27;m amaze, my skin still moist. And this product doesn&#x27;t leave greasy feeling...so far so good.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this cream for about a week as an evening facial moisturizer.  I have sensitive, oily skin and my daughter has very sensitive, dry skin. Neither of us have had any issues or reactions to the product, which is wonderful. A little goes a long way and I love the light coconut scent from the coconut oil that&#x27;s in the product. Looking forward to trying other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I am dude, what can I say. I bought this a week and a half ago. My girlfriend likes the earthy scent and I like that it goes on smooth with no greasy or watery feel. I even got a compliment from a co-worker yesterday, that my skin looks really nice...Oh and I like that it&#x27;s made with organic ingredients and that it&#x27;s paraben free.</li>
            <li> Great fluffy texture with a mild to almost non existent scent.  I like to use this after doing a mask or a peel.  Just the right amount of moisture in a wonderful organic cream.  I also like to use it on my body and as a hand cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer!  Creamy but not greasy. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Omg what is this! Miracle cream I tell you! I have terrible allergies and can&#x27;t keep this rash forming around my nose away. Other products are making me break out including my natural lotion I make so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s almost gone! I put this cream on about eight hours ago and my complete horrendous random rash that&#x27;s been lingering for a month is almost gone. I felt like I couldn&#x27;t go out in public. Nothing has worked until now. It&#x27;s so light and dainty. You just feel special putting it on. I will never live without this.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a natural redhead with pale freckled skin. My skin is so sensitive that, much to my dismay, I can&#x27;t wear most sunblocks or I break out in a rash. Most moisturizers are the same, especially since I am allergic to lanolin. This is a nice heavy moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or develop a rash. Smells faintly of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars - will buy again.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I did notice that some of my redness calmed down. The moisturizer itself is very thick. Kinda like smearing cool butter on my face haha. The only complaint I have is that I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but I did see improvements in my skin so I give it 5 stars :-)</li>
            <li> After only a week of using this product, I can already see a noticeable improvement in my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to EVERYTHING, so finding a good, and affordable, moisturizer is a difficult task. In this short time, I&#x27;ve already been able to eliminate all other serums/creams/moisturizers from my daily skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the cream is thick, it feels very light when applied, and absorbs quickly. The mild scent dissipates very quickly. I have noticed a slight film leftover if I apply too much of the product, but scaling back the amount applied resolved that issue immediately. A little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The friendliness and prompt communication from the company&#x27;s owner is also a refreshing change of pace from dealing with most vendors/larger companies. If you have any hesitations or doubts about this product, it really is as good as described.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal. Most organic moisturizers are this price or usually higher &amp; only come in a 2 oz container at the largest. This is a large tub and will last a very long time. Especially since you only need very little. Though it has a thicker consistency due to the company not adding synthetic fillers, it absorbs immediately for me. The ingredients are wonderful, and the customer service is exceptional &amp; so helpful. They even check in with you to be sure everything&#x27;s great. I can tell my skin loves this.</li>
            <li> Texture is nice. Really feels nurturing . Just the smell a little bit uncommon. Maybe it&#x27;s just be not being used to not-perfumed product. Nevertheless happy with the ratio price-value.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this is a very natural product I just really dislike the fact that it&#x27;s so pasty.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this product. It feelsl so nice and clean on my face. I have facial eczema and it has really helped calm it down. The only bad thing about this product is that I have to apply several applications because my face is still a bit dry after applying. I use the face wash also and love it! I can&#x27;t wait to try the grapefruit mud mask!</li>
            <li> This face lotion works really well. It&#x27;s not greasy,  doesn&#x27;t cause you to break out (I am prone to breakouts), and it smells good (very light smell). It leaves my face feeling hydrated and skin looking great. This was my first experience with the product/ brand and I will definetly try more of their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for being late to leave a really great review on this product! We&#x27;ve had some family medical going on - but to that note, this product came in handy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product day one it arrived - that night! I used the following am and pm / rinse and repeat. When something came up / happened to my ds I used on him as well as the dry room conditions really effect and affect him tremendously. (I can&#x27;t wait to try the eczema product btw) anyway - this was a lifesaver for my ds, myself and even my dd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use moisturizer and this has by far exceeded all my expectation and has become my fave (and that&#x27;s a lot of years of comparison and getting me to switch from my old trusty [insert well known name here]) and I&#x27;ve always used on my face/neck. I did the same for my ds and around troublesome areas usually like his nose or top of the forehead where it can become super dry in certain conditions (like hospitals) there ended up not being any issues this time (same for dd and myself). I actually used on his chese in a certain area due to what was taking place and it kept his skin soft and supple and helped I think to keep it from inflammation and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids are super sensitive to products (as am I) especially my ds. This product has not bothered or irritated him in the least. Since being home he asks me if I am going to use before he turns in. He likes it that much and his skin looks great (all kids skin does but considering all his medical and sensitivity issues we go through a lot from drying/redness/outbreaks - you name it). We&#x27;ve never had anything disappointing to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a steadfast believer in it and want all their products! BTW the customer service is amazing and the way it used to be with companies - that no longer to seem to feel that is necessary; Era Organics does! I will continue to buy from them for that reason along with the exceptional quality of the product we&#x27;ve received and how it has helped us out! LOVE IT and thank you all so much for making such a wonderful and organic product and just being an overall great company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I tried this cream!  I&#x27;m a busy working mom with an active family and household, and I find myself washing my hands often throughout the day.  As a result, my hands tend to get very dry and sometimes they will even crack and bleed a bit.  I&#x27;m often hesitant to try new creams for fear they won&#x27;t be gentle enough.  When I used this cream, my skin just absorbed it right away!  There was no irritation at all, and in fact it was the opposite - my skin felt wonderful!  This cream leaves my hands feeling very soft, and not greasy at all.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a month now and have no complaints. The moisturizer is easily applied, quickly absorbed and creates a smooth supple quality to the skin not obtained from other products. My skin is no longer dry and is more youthful. Here is a quick side note; once you have been using the cream, it becomes easier and easier to clean and the new application is gone in less then a minute. Have fun!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have dry skin due to Accutane and other moisturizers would not last long. This product lasts for hours. It also leaves your skin looking smooth and healthy. I would definitely recommend anyone using this product.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I bought few for my friends also!</li>
            <li> I am an electrician and work with dirty, oily, stuff on a regular basis. To clean my hands I use a lot of oil based pumas cleaners which destroy my skin and really dry it out. This product really surprised me with how quickly it handled my dry hands and also didn&#x27;t wear off quickly as most other products I have tried seem to do. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their skin in good repair.&lt;br /&gt;Edited: 10.30.14 I&#x27;ve now been using this product for the last 2 months. I was originally quite pleased yet sceptical due to having tried many products over the years. I have now come to the decision that I have found the one for me. This stuff kicks ass. It has done the trick and kept these calloused rough hands moisturized and smooth. I have now changed my rating to the 5 star range, for good reason.</li>
            <li> I bought the moisturizer just a week ago and I have been using it every day after washing my face.  My face gets very dry after washing and at the same time I can&#x27;t use oily moisturizers because of acne problems and the non-oily moisturizers doesn&#x27;t help me much with the dryness issue.  I like that this one is made mostly with organic products and at the same time does not clog pores and helps with acne and does not smell bad. So far I am satisfied with the purchase and with the customer service. They send me emails to ask if I am happy with their product or if I have any complains they can work on.</li>
            <li> I like putting a nice organic mixture on my face rather than all those chemicals out there.  Do I see some big difference? No, not really, but how can one really tell without anything to compare it to?  The scent is a bit odd, as this is an unscented cream, so I guess what I&#x27;m smelling is the natural smells of lanolin and oils.  My husband dislikes the smell intensely, would prefer I wear a scent but I&#x27;m allergic to scents and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is kind of expensive but very very thick and you only need a tiny little bit each time you use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Smells nice.  It does what it says it does.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty good. I use it as part of my morning daily beauty regimine. Holds most of its moisture through out the day. could have some spf in it though... Cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, been using the normal store brands for years only to find nothing helps in the winter. Not to mention the harmful parabens and agents in regular creams. Looking for something organic, this stuff is great, goes on light and smooth, faint smell of honey which disappears after about 5 seconds on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this, after the first day i noticed much better less dry facial skin. Excellent product</li>
            <li> This is my new staple for my skin care routine. I am thrilled with this product and will continue to buy it. It does wonders for my skin :)</li>
            <li> Really leaves your skin looking beautifully balanced and feeling refreshed!  I will use this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con, the container is a lot smaller than the dead sea mask.  I was expecting same size for the price, but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll admit I need a better skin care system, I do not like feeling stuff on my face. That has to be my number on complaint of most lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a tub of the Era Organics Face Moisturizer in the mail and have been using it for about three weeks. The first time I tried it, I applied it to the back of my hand. Whew, my hand soaked it up and was begging for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream was smooth and just melted into my skin. There is a slight scent to it but that doesn&#x27;t linger long at all. Perhaps the scent is the aloe but you won&#x27;t notice it once the cream is absorbed. I now apply it in the mornings and I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there! Once the cream absorbs, you will not be able to feel anything but you will see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change I see are in the fine little cracks around my lips and on my cheekbones. These areas are not a dry and flaky. Thumbs up from me on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for use are to apply a dime-sized amount and rub in until absorbed. Use as needed across your whole body. Yeah, where can I order a bucket of this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use as a facial moisturizer. It absorbs well and has a lovely cocoa scent that disappears quickly. I quickly ordered a second jar to try on my psoriosis. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face moisturizers over the years. I really love this one. I feel good about using Era Organics because it&#x27;s natural and organic. It&#x27;s a good consistency and goes on so smoothly. My face feels really soft and moisturized. A lot of products out there don&#x27;t moisturize at all; they leave my face feeling tight and dry. This one moisturizes perfectly for me.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but after I am done with this tub I won&#x27;t be buying another one just because it doesn&#x27;t really do much for me aside from smelling of cocoa butter.  Usually after I apply it I have to apply it again throughout the day because my skin will start drying out from this cream.  Also I&#x27;m not a big fan of the &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> At age 45 I still deal with acne prone skin due to a health condition. But I also have very sensitive skin, allergic to sulfates and have very dry skin. Finding a product that doesn&#x27;t bother at least one or all of these problem areas is a nightmare. Now, while I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, I will say I have no new break outs and noticed a difference in my skin the first day. What&#x27;s even better, is if your skin can tolerate it, you can add your own essential oil. If you don&#x27;t like the natural smell of the jar (which to me is fine by the way), then add your own scent. My favorite is a drop or two Lemongrass. I mix it in with the top layer of the jar.. It&#x27;s light and refreshing and smells wonderful. Thank you Era Organics for finally giving me a natural product that does what it says it will do. I don&#x27;t have to fight with my skin anymore. What&#x27;s even better is that I asked a question on another one of their products, and got several quick replies from real customers who all love their products too. That&#x27;s the best advertisement for any company. Keep up the good work E-ra!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer along with the face wash for about a week and i love it so far. It seems to really moisturize my face without clogging pores or becoming too oily. Also, I had been looking for a LONG time for a face moisturizer that worked well under my makeup/foundation and this is it! I usually find that moisturizers are either not moisturizing enough or make my foundation look to oily, however this has been perfect so far- I love putting it on before my makeup. So glad to finally have found something that works!</li>
            <li> This cream is very nice.  It absorbs quickly and has a mild pleasant smell.  I got it as an all around basic face moisturizer and based on the fact that I get these plugged pores sometimes.  I figured when I had these pore issues I&#x27;d use this cream at night to try and help get rid of them.  Since I am into antiaging creams for the most part I don&#x27;t use this every day.  I put about 3 different products on my face every night (vit c, peptide cream, &amp; retinol cream).  In the am I use the same stuff except instead of retinol, I use sunscreen.  Sometimes at night if I feel I need an extra moisturizer due to dryness, I&#x27;ll use this cream on top of the other 3 things and it works to seal in the other ingredients and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or over moisturized.  I really like that it&#x27;s all natural too.  Would buy more. Also, I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> I just want you to know that this is the BEST face cream I have ever used. My faceNEVER feels dry. I found it by accident and I will never use anything else. I love it. I am 77years old and and i I am so glad I found this. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin super oily. I have very oily skin, especially when I wake up in the morning. When I started using this, I noticed that when I woke up the next morning, my face was not as oily as it normally would be. I don&#x27;t expect it to stop the oiliness completely because its not how it works. Hehe. As a moisturizer tho, it works perfectly either used for the face or the whole body! Most face products usually make me break out because I have a very acne prone skin, but ever since I started using this product I never broke out once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer does have a lil bit of chocolaty smell to it so those who are sensitive to smell might consider that. I don&#x27;t find it bothering tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the fact thag this is organic makes it perfect!</li>
            <li> Literally a miracle in a bottle. Usually, I have dry skin that gets oily once in a while, but this mask keeps my face surely balanced. My face feels extra soft and maybe even ...plumper? I have annoyingly sensitive skin but I feel completely safe using this product. No break outs! Finally, I&#x27;m beginning to actually like my skin. It was also a super quick fix for my boyfriend&#x27;s sunburns, heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a good amount because I only need less than a pea size for my face. It seductively looks like a beautiful dessert or cream cheese, and it&#x27;s soft and glides on easily. Definitely not greasy at all. It absorbs into my skin very nicely. I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the texture of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFECTS ON ECZEMA: Eczema turned my boyfriend&#x27;s hand into leather, skin cracking off all over -- sometimes very reddish, looking like it was burnt. The pain was the worst part. We&#x27;ve tried many lotions and potions (literally). The company told me that this has similar ingredients to their Relief cream, which is really convenient and a big reason why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the cream for three days in a row, his fingers are nearly back to normal! They&#x27;re actually soft for once and can now bend normally. And he hasn&#x27;t felt the itch either. This is A LOT of progress that other natural lotions never came close to. He hasn&#x27;t used it for the past two days and the effects are still lasting. To be fair, he also just started taking new Ayurvedic herbal supplements that help eczema (guduchi and amalaki), but it was the cream that brought instant relief and flexibility.</li>
            <li> Since childhood, I have struggled with issues relating to my skin. I had eczema when I was very young and as I got older found I had allergic reactions to ingredients like aluminum in common products such as deodorant. Sometimes, some products (usually scented ones) would cause me to break out, producing a rash. My skin was flawless as a child and even into my teens until stress and poor skin management set in. Two summers ago, my husband and I were on vacation when my face broke out into a horrible rash that led to my face swelling. I consulted a dermatologist who simply prescribed a ketoconazole cream which made my situation worse. The swelling went down but then I had horrible dryness and peeling in the midst of a humid summer! It was awful. Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t go back. Now in my late 20s, I am learning to read labels and review products before applying them to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I requested to try Relief by Era Organics and was amazed at the results. Not only is the scent very mild and comforting but the ingredients are natural. I was especially pleased to find MSM included in their product which is a naturally occurring sulfur compound that aids in the production of collagen and keratin (bear with me, I&#x27;m a bit of a nerd) as well as detoxification. Sulfur is an antioxidant and aids in maintaing cell turnover as the cells on the surface  of the skin die daily and need to be sloughed off. ALL THAT TO SAY…Era Organics has done their research combining the best, naturally occurring ingredients in one power-packed product. Even after washing my hands several times after applying the product, for instance, my skin still felt hydrated. I have a very thick layer of skin between my thumb and forefinger which applying regular lotion does not cut. The relief cream seems to hydrate through several layers of skin so as to keep it soft and from drying out. I wish I had this product when I was suffering through this past winter season.  The formula is non-greasy and I mean non-greasy! Nobody like to feel like an oil slick after they&#x27;ve applied a product. My arms, legs and rest of my body feel so hydrated and nourished. Even applying a thin layer to my face keeps it hydrated for hours. It really does absorb quickly and keeps you hydrated. I shower, rub the cream on all over and I don&#x27;t have to apply it again until I&#x27;ve had another shower. As a woman of color, I have used raw shea butter and heavier natural oils just to keep my skin hydrated but it&#x27;s nice to have a product that gives you the moisture your skin needs without feeling like it&#x27;ll be 2 hours before it absorbs into the skin. I can&#x27;t wait to try the mask and some of the other products! I truly hope their are some hair products on the way because natural hair needs lots of it!</li>
            <li> I liked the texture and the smell a lot! It&#x27;s great as night cream, didn&#x27;t work as well as a day cream. I usually use face moisturizer along with the tinted moisturizer as I have  sensitive/dry skin, but the tinted moisturizer didn&#x27;t blend in when I applied it over this cream. I&#x27;m going to use it at night only as it seems to keep my redness in check.</li>
            <li> One of the best face lotions I have purchased. Will purchase again; great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks and somehow I feel it leaves my skin a little dry. I expected it to be super soft and feel moist but although it doesn&#x27;t dry it out, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t fully moisturize like it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this or a combination of a cleanser that I got but I feel like my face has been breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face might still be getting used to it? I guess I will give it more time to see.</li>
            <li> I really like it - the texture is good, it moisturizes without being greasy, I even like the smell of cocoa that some people seem to hate. It&#x27;s not a miracle but a very pleasant facial cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using this for a week only at night because I have oily skin and use an oil absorbing moisturizer in the mornings. My skin looks smoother and feels great! I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s helping to clear up my blemishes as well! I just wish there was more product in the container when I received it.</li>
            <li> Stings my face. I stopped using. Looks like a great product I just have super sensitive skin so got scared.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but when I use this I NEVER feel oily. I was a little scared at first when I saw how thick the cream was but since I&#x27;ve tried them all I figured I should give this one a try, and WOW. Im acutally ordering my second one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and much like the other 3 star reviewers, it just isn&#x27;t as much of a moisturizer like I need/hope. I have pretty dry skin and it is leaving me flaky. I want to use it entirely to make the money that I spent worth it. But not sure if I can.  It also smells odd.. Almost like plastic. All in all, pretty bummed out. It&#x27;s ok, not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE:  The owner emailed me promptly after my OK review and provided a full-refund.  You can tell this owner truly cares about the business and the products.  Giving 5 stars for great, honest service**</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the concept and ingredients in this product. However, the smell is absolutely unbearable (it almost smells pungeant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... Unless you are single and wearing this to bed alone, you may find a distance between you and your partner.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used.  I have scleroderma and my face was like sandpaper.  I&#x27;ve almost used one jar, and my skin is unbelievably soft.  Even have my husband using it!</li>
            <li> very nice product. light, good quality ingredients.  very faint, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have lived with chronic face skin problems for a number of years. I will get blotchy red patches on my lip chin eyebrows and hair line that often itch sting weep and flake. I have had success with coconut oil, honey masks, and oatmeal moisturizers but every 3 or 4 weeks the condition resurfaces. I have used this product for only a week but it has eliminated the irritation in that time and brought instant relief to the itchy stinging sensations after the first use. I have not given the product the test of time but thus far I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife is using the creme and she likes it very much</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it day and night it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t cause me any acne. A little goes a long way with this moisturizer when using it for the face.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! As others have noted, the smell is a little unique, but not unpleasant and dissipates quickly. I think perhaps I am just so used to chemically laden aromas that I have lost some appreciation for natural smells that aren&#x27;t floral. My skin (hands, face, eyelids, arms, etc.), for whatever reason in the last six months, decided to go haywire. I have used straight aloe (from the plant) and manuka honey to try to correct my issues and was seeing some benefit. Since I prefer natural products, I was looking for a &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; to make using the two of them when I stumbled upon this product. So grateful I did! I purchased the cleanser and the moisturizer. I have been using the products for about a week, and except for one place on my hand (which was particularly inflamed and raw) my skin is mostly back to normal. There was noticeable improvement on all areas within the first 24 hours. The place on my hand is showing VAST improvement as well. I emailed the company with a question and received a prompt reply, so I appreciate that as well. I will definitely be ordering again and use on an ongoing basis. It&#x27;s that good! And with the money back guarantee, what do you have to lose!</li>
            <li> Thick and moisturizing. I use on my neck, face, and hands. There is not a greasy feeling and the lotion is absorbed well. I gave it 4 stars because there is a coco butter scent that I do not care for.  I probably will not order again due to the scent.</li>
            <li> After I tried the department store foundation, my skin became dry and patchy skin.  I searched on Amazon see if there&#x27;s any aloe vera cream instead of gel.  Lots of great reviews of this product and I would like to give it a try.  The chocolate smell of this face cream, which is not bad; the texture is a bit creamy, which I loved.  Once I put the cream on my face, it absorbed real quick and it won&#x27;t make my face greasy and heavy feeling.  I have been using it in a week now, my patchy skin is getting better and better.  Definitely will purchase it again.  Super fast shipment, placed the order on Wednesday and received it on Friday.  Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and absorbs very quickly. Helped my chronically dry and calloused hands. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The first thing I ever tried from this company was their grapefruit scented Dead Sea mud mask. Suffice to say, I loved it -- everything from its texture, to its results for me. The next thing I took a chance upon was their face and body cream. Before this, I was a devout coconut scented Skin Trip user. Era Organic&#x27;s is like whipped cream: the sort that a chef makes by hand with substance but very little weight. It smells of chocolate owing to the cocoa butter and spreads luxuriously and absorbs in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream lies somewhere between lotion and body butter. It is free of the chemicals and compounds you can&#x27;t pronounce and serve as preservatives for mass produced garbage clogging the shelves and your pores. This seemingly small couple of ounces goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad for Amazon to provide multiple vendors for consumers who may have otherwise not been able to reach the masses. I provide my testimonial on this product specifically because it has done me well and I continue to buy it. Everything I hope to convey is under my own volition and in the desire it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a 3 out of 5 on sensitivity (with a 5 being someone with psoriasis or extreme allergies) and I haven&#x27;t had rash or trouble. It says a lot since I sweat twelve hours at a time and in a filthy warehouse that such a combination breeds disastrous break outs.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this lotion. I use it everyday. I have problems with eczema, and this really helps to sooth it. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was not going to write this review because there are so many already but this is great!!!!! I tried a very expensive face cream, it worked but it was too expensive. Complete, works just as well if not better. I have had a reduction in my crow feet wrinkles, my face just glows and is not greasy. At night I use it with petroleum jelly around the eyes. I have used many brand name facial creams but this is wonderful and is not that expensive. Oh,and I use it on the back of my hands also. Who am I. African-American, light complexion, 62 years old, living in a city that has 4 seasons. 2 can be harsh. Too dry or too humid. Please do not stop making this without notifying me so I can buy up the last jars. Plus it was filled to the very top.</li>
            <li> Wow, the first time I tried it my face felt so soft and cured my chronic dryness. Love that it has no odor.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> What a Great moisturizer! I work outside 6 out of 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, and my skin takes a beating to say the least. It has an odd smell, not a bad smell, but not one you would be familiar with as other skin care products. It glides on smoothly and evenly and absorbs quickly, but does not leave your skin feeling oily.  This product has quickly become a go-to favorite. I know it&#x27;s meant for your face but I&#x27;ve also been using it on my hands and it works well for those too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Got an email from the company the day of purchase but wanted to wait to review so I could give it a try. Very smooth, not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best facial/skin cream you will ever use. Not greasy. Heals skin very very well. A must for anyone</li>
            <li> I received the moisturizer a week ago and I love it. I love the ingredients and that aloe is the main ingredient. I use the moisturizer everyday and I love it. As soon as I put it on my skin it dissolves and my skin eats it up. It&#x27;s very light and I love it for the Florida weather, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. I ordered a second one for my mom. I will post an update after I have been using it for a month or so. I would highly recommended on purchasing from this company. Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best face moisturizer I have come across. It goes on feeling so light that you do not even feel it there. It is not greasy like many other products I have tried in the past. I will definitely be stocking up on this once I start to run low.</li>
            <li> This cream is great!  It soaks right in, not greasy at all, and even better, it isn&#x27;t perfumed.  Best cream I have found in a very long time!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is thick, goes on without any problems and dries within minutes. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin. My skin is looking a lot healthier. I will definitely be using this during winter because it works so well on moisturizing my skin. I definitely recommend using this product because you will notice that your skin looks so much better!</li>
            <li> UPDATE AS OF FEB. 13, 2015&lt;br /&gt;Routines: (I do this before I apply Era Organic Complete)&lt;br /&gt;- Noxzema Anti-Blemish Daily Scrub (Use for back and face about 3 times per week)&lt;br /&gt;- Noxzema Deep Cleansing Cream (Use for face everyday 2 times [In the morning &amp; before bed])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Help reduce acne (Meaning, it doesn&#x27;t make your acne gone \\&quot;forever\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;- Lightens scar&lt;br /&gt;- Jar lasted pretty long for the price (I would say about almost 2 months depending how much you use it-I used it for my back, face, neck, upper arms[both right and left side])&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Darker scars take forever to lighten using this cream, so it will take awhile to show any sign of improvements. Although, it works so much better on lighter scars and open wound; which I recommend you to apply the cream right away if the wound is still fresh and you don&#x27;t want it to end up as a scar.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t apply a thick coating of the cream&lt;br /&gt;Reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you keep trying to rub it in... the cream gets all lumpy (cream starts to roll into a ball/lump, idk how to describe it) because its having a hard time absorbing into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. This works both ways depending on your skin-it can either clog your pores or heal your acne faster.&lt;br /&gt;- It is a daily cream if you want it to help your acne (Not something I wanted.)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not help blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;The cream works a lot better for my scars than my acne. That&#x27;s just my opinion. I had new fresh wounds on my face due to my acne and I applied the cream on it right away and now there is barely even a noticeable scar there. I do have this larger darker scar that already healed up, but the cream has actually helped reduced the darkness of the scar, so its a relief. I also had dark patches due to scratching and picking on my acne at the side of my face and neck and these were old scars already and I just apply the cream twice daily and it reduced the dark patches. It really made a whole lot of difference, but now I still got little specs (dot-like) of scars there, but the dark scar patches are a little bit gone. I don&#x27;t have acne on my face anymore. Guessing due to because I apply the cream on my face twice daily. I still have acne on my back, but they are not as much as before. Before I even bought this cream, the acne on my back was horrible. Its just constantly one pimple after the other, but the cream help reduce that by half, I would say. Its better than feeling a ton of pimples on my back. I haven&#x27;t checked to see if the acne scars on my back are lighten; I don&#x27;t expect it to be because the scars on my back are super dark. The acne scar on my left arm has lighten. My right arm, not so much... but it doesn&#x27;t break out anymore like it normally usually do. If you are acne prone and you skip a day... your acne is likely to come back. It sucks. I skipped like 2 days of not using this cream and the acne on my back came back and I was upset. This is why I said the cream being a daily use is a con for me. What I recommend is cleaning the area of the skin in which you are planning to apply the cream on. Use it 2 times daily. If you have back acne like I do, make sure you have a decent body wash or some kind of acne product body wash. Using acne towelettes should work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jar lasted about a month and 2 weeks. I still have a bit more, hopefully it will run out by the end of February. I have already placed another order for this cream because I like it and it works ^_^ . Idk if I do plan to buy the mud mask when this cream already does the job already, but who knows. Anyways, this is my experience and I hope I helped some of you choose whether this product is a good choice for you or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it on Dec. 29, 2014 and received on Jan. 2, 2015&lt;br /&gt;How many times I applied the cream on a daily basis: 2-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar was dirty, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me because all I cared about was if this product really works or not. I have not used it for a very long time yet (not even a week yet), but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference so far. I will probably update about this product after 2 or 3 months of use. It does not moisturize my face, probably due to because my face doesn&#x27;t need any moisturizing. However, it does work for moisturizing my hand. You can tell by a little difference. They did advertise about applying a dime size, which I do believe they are right. You don&#x27;t need too much to cover a small area on your body or where ever you apply the product on. I only take a couple of dabs from the jar and it covers half my forehead. I didn&#x27;t even need a dime size amount. The texture of the cream is nice and white. Its thick, smooth, and non-greasy. Basically what they advertised. Just looks like the image they advertised. The smell is not pleasant, lol. I really can&#x27;t describe the smell unless you smell it for yourself. I thought it would be odorless, I was wrong. Its not a really bad smell, but... it has a feeling of you know its there. To me... it smell like as if there was grind/blended nuts...? Or the anti-itch cream with Hydrocortisone. However, the smell goes away in 20-30 minutes depending on the thickness of coating you applied to you skin. So it shouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product so far is the texture of the cream. It just feels right. Not too soft like a liquid lotion kind of thing. Its not greasy at all. Its organic. I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reaction to the ingredients, which sometimes I normally do and I hate that. I have very sensitive skin. Wouldn&#x27;t say extremely though. So I am very cautious in what ingredients are in the products that I&#x27;ve used. For a product that advertises that it helps acne, I&#x27;m hoping that it does. I notice I don&#x27;t break out as much as I usually normally do. I only got one pimple so far using this product, but it keeps the other pimples at bay from what I notice so that&#x27;s a good sign for me. Its actually one of the best product I&#x27;ve used so far. I have tried tree tee oil, neutrogena, and noxzema for acne. Tree tea oil was just too oily for me. Made me break out a little then it disappeared. Noxzema helps my acne disappears, but makes my face dry and sometimes flaky. Neutrogena... I can&#x27;t really say. Some people says it works, but I completely broke out so bad that I didn&#x27;t buy the product ever again. I probably had a allergic reaction to the ingredient called benzoyl peroxide which I&#x27;ve read it is suppose to help with your acne, but apparently, not for me. Even Bio Oil has that ingredient and it made me break out. Was really disappointed. Anyways... E-raorganics complete has been a good product on my skin so far and there really isn&#x27;t any cons I can say about this product. If it works... I&#x27;m glad I found this product and I can&#x27;t wait to buy the mud mask. If not... oh well... off to a new product then. I would definitely recommend you guys to buy this product if you need a moisturizer though. Its not so bad ;) .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week and I love it. I&#x27;m very cautious about what I use on my face because I have sensitive and acne prone skin. It didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me. At first, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell of this but it goes away quickly, it&#x27;s not bad - just different. I barely notice it now. Definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have never before written a review, but I love this product.</li>
            <li> Second attempt to write a review.  First came back and said it was &#x27;SUPPRESSED&#x27; for some reason.  Here goes again:  I like this product, BUT my skin requires a more intense moisturizer.  Ended up using a thin layer of organic coconut oil first, than a layer of this.  Would not buy again.  Now, let&#x27;s see if this one gets posted.  SHEESH.</li>
            <li> I do really like this product.  It works really very well especially in combination with aloe vera gel for me smoothing skin and diminishing the appearance of scars noticed after a few days, using for a few weeks . And it smells nice , a bit like chocolate.</li>
            <li> So far so good! That says a lot for my sensitive, oily and acne prone skin! I have recently made some changes to my diet and skin care routine and this moisturizer has been a great addition. Most people who struggle with oily skin sometimes tend to over exfoliate or not moisturize like they should. This has happened to me so many times. Fortunately, I am now taking a holistic approach to my skin care regimen. I am recently acne prone and most products ( even natural and/or organic ) irritate my skin. I did a patch test with this one before use and have been using it for close to a week now with no problems. I have added a couple other staples to my regimen ( Vitamin C Serum ) and phytoceramides and am excited by the results so far.</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected, moisturizes for hours.  It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, but still easily absorbs into the skin.  Has a very mild smell like cocoa butter :)</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and so far I love it.  I have Contact Dermatitis on my face and have been trying all different products and so far none have had any real great results.  I have used, to name a few products, SteriLid Cleaner, Aveno Eczema cream, Neosporin for Eczema, Organic Coconut oil, Organic Rose Hip seed oil, baby shampoo, and a prescription steroid cream and the list goes on.  I used this on my face last night and this morning and so far so good.  My condition looks much better and in less than 24 hours.  I will update this as I continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the moisturizing element, but it does smell a bit weird. I buy unscented products frequently and it&#x27;s hard to find anything that doesn&#x27;t have some sort of smell to it...I will use it up, but not reorder it.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! Love how the cream really moisturizes without feeling caky or overbearing. This cream was made with lots of care to detail. Better than the expensive creams that have fillers and actually don&#x27;t really work. Quality was definitely not compromised in this cream. My skin feels smooth and quenched. Fine lines are diminished. This is my new favorite moisturizer. Will keep ordering. Please never stop making it!!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer, so clean and light. Works for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin and just as well for my sensitive skinned teen.</li>
            <li> This stuff confuses me. I really want to like it--and I do, in some ways. It&#x27;s rich and silky, has a soft natural cocoa smell that dissipates, and is so nice and thick that you feel like you&#x27;ll never have to put on lotion again. Except you do. Like, 30 minutes later when you feel your hands starting to crackle again. Nextly, I like to put it on my face post-washing, and this produces an.... odd effect. Namely, beads of perspiration take over my face for about 15 minutes, or until it sinks in I suppose. My theory is that the thickness I spoke of earlier starts to suffocate my pores and they try to break free be producing geysers of sweat. That&#x27;s science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one last thing: there are waaaaaay to many ingredients, many of which I can&#x27;t pronounce. Isn&#x27;t that like, Twinkie territory, and not organic face cream territory? Anyhow, I basically still want to buy it again because, you know, I like the way it makes me feel. Don&#x27;t judge.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve purchased for my skin this year.</li>
    </ol>
