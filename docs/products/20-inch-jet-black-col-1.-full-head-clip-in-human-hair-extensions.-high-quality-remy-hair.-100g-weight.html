            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really liked them.</li>
            <li>For now one if I want crappy extensions i&#x27;ll just make my own.</li>
            <li>Great deal on such a great product!!</li>
            <li>no matter what kind I buy.</li>
            <li>They are sent to you in nice packaging.</li>
            <li>The hair feels nice</li>
            <li>I also found some of my own.</li>
            <li>They clipped in very easily.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the quality of this hair when I received it, it felt so soft &amp; shiny!...</li>
            <li>If you want good quality, cheap hair extensions, I recommend these.</li>
            <li>and I have by far had the best luck</li>
            <li>&amp; it didn&#x27;t come in nice packaging but its OK. :)</li>
            <li>And clips are great , kinda have a funny smell but what do you expect ?  </li>
            <li>It still looked ok in my hair</li>
            <li>I think I might sew more together even,</li>
            <li>The price is also phenomenal for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Save yourself some money and invest a bit more in better ones.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it</li>
            <li>I think if your hair has more texture or is just thicker these May work for you.</li>
            <li>&amp; they&#x27;re much better</li>
            <li>I love my extensions</li>
            <li>and i love the length and texture of it.</li>
            <li>definetly get more for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>i was gunna pay 108.00 on sallys before these kinda wish i did :)</li>
            <li>I have to put it in a braid for it to look okay</li>
            <li>Love Love LOVE, would recommend them to anybody looking to buy extensions from Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I love to curl my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than a week</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and i think i have found it! :)</li>
            <li>I love this hair.  </li>
            <li>and i love them&lt;</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, excellent customer service and very fast replies/delivery!</li>
            <li>The hair is SO soft &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good could be thicker</li>
            <li>Quick delivery was nice though.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they are easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li>They are well worth more than 40 bucks !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these amazing and cheap!!</li>
            <li>and it is soft and looks great on me</li>
            <li>But so far im a happy customer.</li>
            <li>and clips came off quick, but they are good for something quick and cheap.</li>
            <li>The only good thing were the clips!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to repair it</li>
            <li>They do tangle easily too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to see that Elizawigs cares.</li>
            <li>They are still super soft and beautiful looking.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for a newbie to extension like myself as they are A LOT more cost effective then some of the high end extensions out there.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fine also.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and curl really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money and splurge for the ones that are a little more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these they are great quality and price.</li>
            <li>The only thing its 18 inches instead of 20 but its great hair.</li>
            <li>But what can you expect for how cheap they were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they would match perfectly for girls with naturally black hair, but if you dye your hair this color they will look perfect!</li>
            <li>I will give this a 3 star only because the hair is very nice easily blends with your hair and also true to length</li>
            <li>I got these extensions for my fiancee and she absolutely loves them!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful land it took less than 48 hours to deliver! :)</li>
            <li>and for the price amazing the shipping was super fast (</li>
            <li>I was able to comb them, and curl them with no issues and they looked really pretty.  </li>
            <li>It shipped supper fast too ladies! :)</li>
            <li>I hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>( but good quality they should really tell the whole truth about their product though</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s for a full head</li>
            <li>Love this hair use it one time and people was asking me where I get it from,they really like it.</li>
            <li>The thickness is good as is, but I prefer buying a second pack.</li>
            <li>Blended so well with my hair and true to length</li>
            <li>For the cheap price, these extensions are worth it, I would say.</li>
            <li>its soft and looks nice</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and the seller appears to be very thoughtful.</li>
            <li>but if you wear it as a quick fix.</li>
            <li>It looks real, feels real, curls nicely</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick..</li>
            <li>I was able to curl them using high heat.</li>
            <li>They style easily and don&#x27;t really shed.</li>
            <li>, I like the service and the hair, will be back for more!</li>
            <li>The sellers are super sweet and willing to help in any way.</li>
            <li>These extensions are great for the money, but the ends look like they could use a little trim.</li>
            <li>The hair is great, just wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li>it isnt even worth $10</li>
            <li>So far I love the hair.</li>
            <li>And unlike most extensions they are not layered at the bottom and still thick at the ends (which is good for me)</li>
            <li>Takes forever to get in the mail but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Quality hair for price very much worth it</li>
            <li>The seller even put in extra clips which I am so thrilled with b/c</li>
            <li>After I started styling &amp; wearing this hair it started to look damaged pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The clips didn&#x27;t grip to my hair well either, slid out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I am wearing them right now</li>
            <li>The clips hold well, its wrapped very carefully and smells good.</li>
            <li>Not too thin actually a pretty good thickness!!</li>
            <li>The clips are so secure and the hair is super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I know that I could have just sewn higher quality clips in myself but this hair just isn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li>waste of money to be honest!</li>
            <li>Real hair that is perfect texture, but WAY TOO THIN....</li>
            <li>no it only has 7 pieces and you will definitely need two packs and had I known that I definetly would have gotten 2 packs from the beginning and not be waiting 3 more days to do my hair for my birthday!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had extensions plenty of times and used a hot iron on them without them melting..</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ll put another clip and ready to go!</li>
            <li>I was not going to spend $200 dollars the first time around.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying this hair.</li>
            <li>Also the hair is pretty...</li>
            <li>They also did not shed any more than my actual hair.</li>
            <li>The are exactly 20 inches.</li>
            <li>At first.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll keep these ones as back up :)</li>
            <li>and it was one whole weft !</li>
            <li>Real hair does not come off!</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying hair extensions</li>
            <li>Defintely for a first timer that doesnt want to spend a lot for hair extensions.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>stay in pretty well.</li>
            <li>I finally washed it and dye came out of it, on top of that</li>
            <li>I will definately be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>To be exact 6 days after ordering which is pretty fast.</li>
            <li>They stay super straight even in high humidity/rain.</li>
            <li>Be aware it is 100g so that how much hair your getting.</li>
            <li>About a year ago maybe a little longer i had purchased the dark brown ones and they were amazing !!!</li>
            <li>I like it its easy to use, but it was not enough hair.</li>
            <li>Received them super early, scheduled to come July 22nd, ordered them June 7th and received them June 14th</li>
            <li>This came to me as one large track...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok if you have fine to medium thick hair.</li>
            <li>Was a little nervous to buy human hair online, but this buy turned out great.</li>
            <li>I just got them and they seem of very quality.</li>
            <li>And also, the price is very affordable for the quality of what you get.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY apprehensive about buying this product as I have NEVER used extensions before.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Im so ready to install my clip ins.</li>
            <li>They worked really well for me</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very displeased that it says these are clips ins and the hair arrived WITHOUT clips.</li>
            <li>This is definitely real hair.</li>
            <li>It matched my hair very well.</li>
            <li>and they are ready for use</li>
            <li>I have really think hair</li>
            <li>in all I really like them.</li>
            <li>just save your money and buy some real ones.</li>
            <li>Very upset about this.</li>
            <li>I decided to pull out a couple strands and burn it to see if it was real hair</li>
            <li>and it smelt like real burnt hair.</li>
            <li>They curl and straighten like real hair and the clips</li>
            <li>And I do as well because they are SOOOOOO much cheaper than buying them anywhere else.</li>
            <li>she is very picky.</li>
            <li>but it sheds too much, need to buy another one so it would look fuller</li>
            <li>If you want human hair as extensions to your own hair, I definitely recommend Elizawigs hair extensions.</li>
            <li>This hair arrived about 3 weeks before expected  sooooo soft and its really nice hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin but it&#x27;s perfect if you just wanna add extra length.</li>
            <li>These actually came fairly quickly and were full extensions like the ones I have purchased from Sally&#x27;s but for more than half the price!</li>
            <li>The hair was silky, and easy to manage, and lasted a long time when taken care of.</li>
            <li>First of all there is now clips for these supposed &amp;#34;clip ins&amp;#34; and second this is basically a pack of local bss hair charged 40% more.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m out on my hot iron too because I really don&#x27;t want plastic melted on my natural hair...</li>
            <li>This hair does break &amp; dry easily.</li>
            <li>there of medium thickness and are so so SO soft and shinny, well worth more than 40$, they also come with two extra clips and the same color thread in case one ends up falling off or breaking.</li>
            <li>it is 100% true human hair.</li>
            <li>The hair has a decent thickness to it though.</li>
            <li>and i was looking for a quick fix to short hair;</li>
            <li>It was very soft the day i got them but after about two days of wearing them they got very clumped togethe.</li>
            <li>on a positive note, the hair was soft and shiny but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Highly upset about this.</li>
            <li>The length was correct and enough for a full head if your hair is not very thick.</li>
            <li>It is very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I know that is fairly normal</li>
            <li>they are normal thickness.</li>
            <li>you also have waste  $6.00 or more for clips that you have to sew in.</li>
            <li>The hair extensions were fine other than the fact that there were pieces of STRING sewed into the hair.</li>
            <li>The wreaths are a little thin, but that is why I bought 2 packs &amp; it turned out beautiful!</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;ll come b4 the new year</li>
            <li>I got the new set today</li>
            <li>I just got a new set of extensions from somewhere else</li>
            <li>I washed them once a week, just because if I didn&#x27;t they started to look super dry</li>
            <li>It is not as easy as it looks and my natural hair is very soft so even though the clips were covered in silicone (which is nice), I was afraid they would slip.  </li>
            <li>These extensions are very soft and shiny .</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft as well</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for its very little hair too many wefts</li>
            <li>(I used a low heat) and they are shiny and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these twice now and just got my second set my first has lasted 6 months</li>
            <li>First I ordered this in April &amp; it should have arrived May 15th or June 3rd</li>
            <li>First time I ever sent something back.</li>
            <li>I ordered jet black and I received light brown.</li>
            <li>First off it came extra early</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only positive thing I will say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for cheap, good quality human hair extensions since i had just cut all my beloved hair off due to the chemical damage done by a horrible hair dresser</li>
            <li>Once I sewed the clips back in myself, it looked a little bit better.</li>
            <li>But I do have Remy hair, and there is a clear difference between this and that hair.  </li>
            <li>I just received my hair today, which came two days early.</li>
            <li>The only pro is that this shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Its soft and I like the length.</li>
            <li>Totally soft and smooth!1</li>
            <li>they are not 100% natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>And developed lots of knots.</li>
            <li>I felt that I received a lot of hair in this package and it was thick enough to blend with my own hair.</li>
            <li>I like them but if you have thick hair your going to need more than one set.</li>
            <li>If you want to wear it straight and flat and do not want to style it then this is for you.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if all extensions are the same, but just more hair in each clip would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural african american hair and they blend with it when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li>Really thin,and not 20 inches long...</li>
            <li>Not too thick but just right!!</li>
            <li>They are VERY soft, and actually human hair.</li>
            <li>First off , the hair came in extra early the expected.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews here say they are thin.</li>
            <li>These extensions dried way to easy, I cannot wear them now due to split ends everywhere and tangles within 15 minutes of wearing them.</li>
            <li>I will update in a few more weeks of using it to let the users know the quality after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>As first the hair will fall out a little all you do</li>
            <li>Not even sure if there real hair if not high quality fake hair.</li>
            <li>I know I didn&#x27;t pay much for them but the quality of the hair is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think that is a better deal, I had to trip these to make them less stringy at least 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to girls with super soft thin hair like mine.</li>

            <li> If not, buy good weave and sew the clip-ons your self.</li>
            <li> I took the clips off &amp; sewed them in and the hair is surprisingly thicker</li>
            <li> Blends really good.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really liked them.</li>
            <li> For now one if I want crappy extensions i&#x27;ll just make my own.</li>
            <li> Great deal on such a great product!!</li>
            <li> no matter what kind I buy.</li>
            <li> They are sent to you in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> The hair feels nice</li>
            <li> I also found some of my own.</li>
            <li> They clipped in very easily.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the quality of this hair when I received it, it felt so soft &amp; shiny!...</li>
            <li> If you want good quality, cheap hair extensions, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> and I have by far had the best luck</li>
            <li> &amp; it didn&#x27;t come in nice packaging but its OK. :)</li>
            <li> And clips are great , kinda have a funny smell but what do you expect ?  </li>
            <li> It still looked ok in my hair</li>
            <li> I think I might sew more together even,</li>
            <li> The price is also phenomenal for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and invest a bit more in better ones.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love it</li>
            <li> I think if your hair has more texture or is just thicker these May work for you.</li>
            <li> &amp; they&#x27;re much better</li>
            <li> I love my extensions</li>
            <li> and i love the length and texture of it.</li>
            <li> definetly get more for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> i was gunna pay 108.00 on sallys before these kinda wish i did :)</li>
            <li> I have to put it in a braid for it to look okay</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE, would recommend them to anybody looking to buy extensions from Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I love to curl my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than a week</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and i think i have found it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this hair.  </li>
            <li> and i love them&lt;</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, excellent customer service and very fast replies/delivery!</li>
            <li> The hair is SO soft &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good could be thicker</li>
            <li> Quick delivery was nice though.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li> They are well worth more than 40 bucks !</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these amazing and cheap!!</li>
            <li> and it is soft and looks great on me</li>
            <li> But so far im a happy customer.</li>
            <li> and clips came off quick, but they are good for something quick and cheap.</li>
            <li> The only good thing were the clips!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to repair it</li>
            <li> They do tangle easily too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to see that Elizawigs cares.</li>
            <li> They are still super soft and beautiful looking.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for a newbie to extension like myself as they are A LOT more cost effective then some of the high end extensions out there.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fine also.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and curl really good</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money and splurge for the ones that are a little more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these they are great quality and price.</li>
            <li> The only thing its 18 inches instead of 20 but its great hair.</li>
            <li> But what can you expect for how cheap they were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they would match perfectly for girls with naturally black hair, but if you dye your hair this color they will look perfect!</li>
            <li> I will give this a 3 star only because the hair is very nice easily blends with your hair and also true to length</li>
            <li> I got these extensions for my fiancee and she absolutely loves them!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful land it took less than 48 hours to deliver! :)</li>
            <li> and for the price amazing the shipping was super fast (</li>
            <li> I was able to comb them, and curl them with no issues and they looked really pretty.  </li>
            <li> It shipped supper fast too ladies! :)</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> ( but good quality they should really tell the whole truth about their product though</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s for a full head</li>
            <li> Love this hair use it one time and people was asking me where I get it from,they really like it.</li>
            <li> The thickness is good as is, but I prefer buying a second pack.</li>
            <li> Blended so well with my hair and true to length</li>
            <li> For the cheap price, these extensions are worth it, I would say.</li>
            <li> its soft and looks nice</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and the seller appears to be very thoughtful.</li>
            <li> but if you wear it as a quick fix.</li>
            <li> It looks real, feels real, curls nicely</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick..</li>
            <li> I was able to curl them using high heat.</li>
            <li> They style easily and don&#x27;t really shed.</li>
            <li> , I like the service and the hair, will be back for more!</li>
            <li> The sellers are super sweet and willing to help in any way.</li>
            <li> These extensions are great for the money, but the ends look like they could use a little trim.</li>
            <li> The hair is great, just wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> it isnt even worth $10</li>
            <li> So far I love the hair.</li>
            <li> And unlike most extensions they are not layered at the bottom and still thick at the ends (which is good for me)</li>
            <li> Takes forever to get in the mail but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Quality hair for price very much worth it</li>
            <li> The seller even put in extra clips which I am so thrilled with b/c</li>
            <li> After I started styling &amp; wearing this hair it started to look damaged pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The clips didn&#x27;t grip to my hair well either, slid out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I am wearing them right now</li>
            <li> The clips hold well, its wrapped very carefully and smells good.</li>
            <li> Not too thin actually a pretty good thickness!!</li>
            <li> The clips are so secure and the hair is super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I know that I could have just sewn higher quality clips in myself but this hair just isn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li> waste of money to be honest!</li>
            <li> Real hair that is perfect texture, but WAY TOO THIN....</li>
            <li> no it only has 7 pieces and you will definitely need two packs and had I known that I definetly would have gotten 2 packs from the beginning and not be waiting 3 more days to do my hair for my birthday!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extensions plenty of times and used a hot iron on them without them melting..</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ll put another clip and ready to go!</li>
            <li> I was not going to spend $200 dollars the first time around.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time buying this hair.</li>
            <li> Also the hair is pretty...</li>
            <li> They also did not shed any more than my actual hair.</li>
            <li> The are exactly 20 inches.</li>
            <li> At first.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll keep these ones as back up :)</li>
            <li> and it was one whole weft !</li>
            <li> Real hair does not come off!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying hair extensions</li>
            <li> Defintely for a first timer that doesnt want to spend a lot for hair extensions.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> stay in pretty well.</li>
            <li> I finally washed it and dye came out of it, on top of that</li>
            <li> I will definately be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> To be exact 6 days after ordering which is pretty fast.</li>
            <li> They stay super straight even in high humidity/rain.</li>
            <li> Be aware it is 100g so that how much hair your getting.</li>
            <li> About a year ago maybe a little longer i had purchased the dark brown ones and they were amazing !!!</li>
            <li> I like it its easy to use, but it was not enough hair.</li>
            <li> Received them super early, scheduled to come July 22nd, ordered them June 7th and received them June 14th</li>
            <li> This came to me as one large track...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok if you have fine to medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> Was a little nervous to buy human hair online, but this buy turned out great.</li>
            <li> I just got them and they seem of very quality.</li>
            <li> And also, the price is very affordable for the quality of what you get.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY apprehensive about buying this product as I have NEVER used extensions before.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Im so ready to install my clip ins.</li>
            <li> They worked really well for me</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very displeased that it says these are clips ins and the hair arrived WITHOUT clips.</li>
            <li> This is definitely real hair.</li>
            <li> It matched my hair very well.</li>
            <li> and they are ready for use</li>
            <li> I have really think hair</li>
            <li> in all I really like them.</li>
            <li> just save your money and buy some real ones.</li>
            <li> Very upset about this.</li>
            <li> I decided to pull out a couple strands and burn it to see if it was real hair</li>
            <li> and it smelt like real burnt hair.</li>
            <li> They curl and straighten like real hair and the clips</li>
            <li> And I do as well because they are SOOOOOO much cheaper than buying them anywhere else.</li>
            <li> she is very picky.</li>
            <li> but it sheds too much, need to buy another one so it would look fuller</li>
            <li> If you want human hair as extensions to your own hair, I definitely recommend Elizawigs hair extensions.</li>
            <li> This hair arrived about 3 weeks before expected  sooooo soft and its really nice hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin but it&#x27;s perfect if you just wanna add extra length.</li>
            <li> These actually came fairly quickly and were full extensions like the ones I have purchased from Sally&#x27;s but for more than half the price!</li>
            <li> The hair was silky, and easy to manage, and lasted a long time when taken care of.</li>
            <li> First of all there is now clips for these supposed &amp;#34;clip ins&amp;#34; and second this is basically a pack of local bss hair charged 40% more.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m out on my hot iron too because I really don&#x27;t want plastic melted on my natural hair...</li>
            <li> This hair does break &amp; dry easily.</li>
            <li> there of medium thickness and are so so SO soft and shinny, well worth more than 40$, they also come with two extra clips and the same color thread in case one ends up falling off or breaking.</li>
            <li> it is 100% true human hair.</li>
            <li> The hair has a decent thickness to it though.</li>
            <li> and i was looking for a quick fix to short hair;</li>
            <li> It was very soft the day i got them but after about two days of wearing them they got very clumped togethe.</li>
            <li> on a positive note, the hair was soft and shiny but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Highly upset about this.</li>
            <li> The length was correct and enough for a full head if your hair is not very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I know that is fairly normal</li>
            <li> they are normal thickness.</li>
            <li> you also have waste  $6.00 or more for clips that you have to sew in.</li>
            <li> The hair extensions were fine other than the fact that there were pieces of STRING sewed into the hair.</li>
            <li> The wreaths are a little thin, but that is why I bought 2 packs &amp; it turned out beautiful!</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;ll come b4 the new year</li>
            <li> I got the new set today</li>
            <li> I just got a new set of extensions from somewhere else</li>
            <li> I washed them once a week, just because if I didn&#x27;t they started to look super dry</li>
            <li> It is not as easy as it looks and my natural hair is very soft so even though the clips were covered in silicone (which is nice), I was afraid they would slip.  </li>
            <li> These extensions are very soft and shiny .</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft as well</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for its very little hair too many wefts</li>
            <li> (I used a low heat) and they are shiny and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered these twice now and just got my second set my first has lasted 6 months</li>
            <li> First I ordered this in April &amp; it should have arrived May 15th or June 3rd</li>
            <li> First time I ever sent something back.</li>
            <li> I ordered jet black and I received light brown.</li>
            <li> First off it came extra early</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only positive thing I will say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for cheap, good quality human hair extensions since i had just cut all my beloved hair off due to the chemical damage done by a horrible hair dresser</li>
            <li> Once I sewed the clips back in myself, it looked a little bit better.</li>
            <li> But I do have Remy hair, and there is a clear difference between this and that hair.  </li>
            <li> I just received my hair today, which came two days early.</li>
            <li> The only pro is that this shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Its soft and I like the length.</li>
            <li> Totally soft and smooth!1</li>
            <li> they are not 100% natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> And developed lots of knots.</li>
            <li> I felt that I received a lot of hair in this package and it was thick enough to blend with my own hair.</li>
            <li> I like them but if you have thick hair your going to need more than one set.</li>
            <li> If you want to wear it straight and flat and do not want to style it then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if all extensions are the same, but just more hair in each clip would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural african american hair and they blend with it when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li> Really thin,and not 20 inches long...</li>
            <li> Not too thick but just right!!</li>
            <li> They are VERY soft, and actually human hair.</li>
            <li> First off , the hair came in extra early the expected.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews here say they are thin.</li>
            <li> These extensions dried way to easy, I cannot wear them now due to split ends everywhere and tangles within 15 minutes of wearing them.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few more weeks of using it to let the users know the quality after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> As first the hair will fall out a little all you do</li>
            <li> Not even sure if there real hair if not high quality fake hair.</li>
            <li> I know I didn&#x27;t pay much for them but the quality of the hair is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think that is a better deal, I had to trip these to make them less stringy at least 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to girls with super soft thin hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated this hair is EXTREMELY thin, I also just tried to put my hot iron through it, the same temp I use on my natural hair</li>
            <li> I then took a flat iron in the morning and tried to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It hasnt tangled &amp; i havent had a need to flat iron it yet.</li>
            <li> I try to flat iron it at the lowest setting and burned the hair off!</li>
            <li> The color matches L&#x27;oreal Preference Soft Black.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly just not happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend these 100%.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, my hair is not naturally black, I dye it jet black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> About 16 inches long.</li>
            <li> It even shipped &amp; was delivered earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> some white some pink and orange.</li>
            <li> I grey hairs in mine</li>
            <li> and they also came in way earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> NOT NATURAL LOOKING THICKNESS</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and its thick in will probably need like 3 of these, very disapointed</li>
            <li> From ElizaWigs - the hair is very very thin and stringy across the weft, especially across the longest ones (4 clips), so I sewed one of the smaller ones to these, to thicken it up (removing one set of clips) and to make it worth even clipping in...</li>
            <li> Not like black string nonono like different colors there were some blue</li>
            <li> The clips are just really low quality in my opinion, because they&#x27;re plastic, large, &amp; just poorly sewn.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s just too dry.</li>
            <li> Monday witch is 5 days and the hair is pretty thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a lot of hair extensions and these definently don&#x27;t suck, but they were pretty thin.</li>
            <li> if your looking for everyday nd long lasting pay for them</li>
            <li> I expected it to be 1 month</li>
            <li> This was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> For the price and the reviews I expected these to suck.</li>
            <li> I ordered these about a week ago, they aren&#x27;t here yet (as I already expected)</li>
            <li> but I have only had them a month and worn a few times and the hair is already falling off the clips.</li>
            <li> then I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This is not real.</li>
            <li> Not human hair please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really an issue..</li>
            <li> I have some extra hair and was going to go to the store on Saturday and buy a few clips.  </li>
            <li> The expected date was April 17th</li>
            <li> It was described exactly how it looks when I received it except it was a little thin.</li>
            <li> Came b4 expected date!  </li>
            <li> understand you get what you paid for, but these are only about $15 or so cheaper than the hair I usually buy</li>
            <li> I cut mines in pieces to make tape in extensions and had very minimal shedding (I cut it so</li>
            <li> Not real hair it doesn&#x27;t curl and its very fake and tangled I tried washing it with a deep conditioner and it got very stringy</li>
            <li> They have thinned out a little bit, but that&#x27;s expected with all hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect much for the price:/  looked fake</li>
            <li> Omg..  not worth getting it .. one clip came with it and you have to do it yourself. .</li>
            <li> I don’t appreciate being lied to and being shipped fake hair when I paid real money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not HORRIBLE, just annoying</li>
            <li> and I ordered new ones because they started to get a little thin.</li>
            <li> maybe less than a week)</li>
            <li> They are jet black like the picture</li>
            <li> , so i have to color my hair black.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and touched it, the hair almost felt crunchy and had an odd color to it.</li>
            <li> when I washed it a bunch of dye came off them and they didn&#x27;t look so black.</li>
            <li> the color is not too black.  </li>
            <li> Not Full not 100g and not at all clip in, didn&#x27;t even include clips.</li>
            <li> They actually didn&#x27;t they were human hair a little thin, but hey I don&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
            <li> and I thought that there was NO way this little bit of hair was going to work for me.  </li>
            <li> I will have to maybe rat my hair a little or something</li>
            <li> that a little girl would wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> The hair was too thin and is deffinetly not full human hair.</li>
            <li> and I spent over $80!!!</li>
            <li> I was told the delivery was going to be like a few weeks to a month</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t waste my money thinking</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> almost two months of everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I received the package within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> hair is not “super thick,” it’s about an average thickness.</li>
            <li> The hair itself is soft but very thin and stringy.</li>
            <li> and I generally get really expensive sets for 200+ dollars, but I decided I wanted to buy a couple cheapys</li>
            <li> The only negative part is that one of the clip was already broken when i received them and a piece of hair fell from the clips (unglued or unstitched)</li>
            <li> it took too long seriously!</li>
            <li> It matts pretty bad in the back if it rubs against my shirts the wrong way</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t post reviews</li>
            <li> I have a small head</li>
            <li> I pulled out - it looked like it was a gray hair, not sure which would have been worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine untill now :/  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really pointless to wear them</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I am pissed I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> so freakin disappointed wat they advertise is a lie the hair isnt clip in so thin and couldn&#x27;t even fill up half my hair, this isnt even worth the money i paid</li>
            <li> Very thin, wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless your hair is the same.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive reviews on these extensions and I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> if not more so might as well just get the 14&amp;#34; ones to start with - at least it will be thicker.</li>
            <li> I usually buy at least 3 pairs a year.</li>
            <li> Cheap hair was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I received my package fast but was very unhappy with the extensions.</li>
            <li> says tells me u catn tell they are a little thin</li>
            <li> but I need at least three packets.</li>
            <li> With these, I would need AT LEAST 3 sets to look even halfway normal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> : I have thick</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t I would not recommend this for thick hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, somehwat thick hair.</li>
            <li> What I received was plastic and felt like thick wires.</li>
            <li> They are thick just the way I wanted them</li>
            <li> This only worked for half of my head. :(</li>
            <li> I was Very skeptical about these based on mixed reviews but took a chance on getting them.</li>
            <li> Terrible, I thought i was going to get a good product and came back with nasty hair that burns and doesn&#x27;t curl like it said it did.</li>
            <li> A little thin but still does the trick!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m already disappointed with the fact that they have apparently been shipped but there is no tracking information.</li>
            <li> The 3 clip wefts were missing clips and the hair was very thin and falling out.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed, didn&#x27;t even return all of my money back, don&#x27;t recomand these to anyone unless you&#x27;re looking for synthetic hair!</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s already dyed black, and sheds crazy.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair I would recommend two packs.</li>
            <li> but i thought they came with the clips already in the hair.. was not happy when i opened it</li>
            <li> is false hair is reallyyyy thin and length is not what I ordered when I contacted seller the told me that&#x27;s how it is.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to me and its extremely thin</li>
            <li> I would order two sets if your hair is thin and you are looking for volume.</li>
            <li> This hair did shed not a lot, Also it was to thin for my hair and the color did not match my hair color.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair I would say go for it</li>
            <li> so poorly 4 of them have disconnected from the clips.</li>
            <li> this did not come with the clips and the hair is thin.</li>
            <li> Worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever gotten, it&#x27;s not even real hair</li>
            <li> Hair is thin, and not mutch hair is put on each clip</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair buy 2 packs for volume.</li>
            <li> But if you have thin hair you probably should buy 2 sets</li>
            <li> They are kinda thin</li>
            <li> Its frizzy and thin and tangly.</li>
            <li> I also had to cut off the ends because they were thin.</li>
            <li> the hair is kinda thin</li>
            <li> The hair is to thin, the color is off.</li>

            <li> False advertisement.</li>
            <li> and like another review mentioned... there IS some fake hair in there - had to straighten out the hair and saw melted strings in there... as well as a weird random string or thread</li>
            <li> They extremely THIN!</li>
            <li> The extensions are thin, but all the pieces and clips make up for it !</li>
            <li> that was weird.</li>
            <li> But just to test and see if I was just wrong I tried to curl them and they didn&#x27;t curl they fried.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thin</li>
            <li> These extensions are very very thin, almost to the point they look stringy.</li>
            <li> It is very thin.</li>
            <li> and also I don&#x27;t find them very thin</li>
            <li> I received these extensions and the hair is very thin....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS i got this hair today and im so freakin disappointed wat they advertise is a lie the hair isnt clip in so thin and couldn&#x27;t even fill up half my hair, this isnt even worth the money i paid it isnt even worth $10</li>
            <li> First off it came extra early I expected it to be 1 month and it came Monday witch is 5 days and the hair is pretty thin so it is 20inches and it is soft and looks great on me</li>
            <li> I wanted to look like the picture and it&#x27;s very thin and it&#x27;s not real human hair you can not bleach it it will melt.👎👎</li>
            <li> I love these!!! I just got them and they seem of very quality. They are VERY soft, and actually human hair. I was worried that they weren&#x27;t going to be 100% human hair. But they are! I am wearing them right now, I have straightened them already, and they look so good! If you want good quality, cheap hair extensions, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated this hair is EXTREMELY thin, I also just tried to put my hot iron through it, the same temp I use on my natural hair and it melted on my iron like plastic.. If it were real it definitely shouldn&#x27;t be doing this I&#x27;ve had extensions plenty of times and used a hot iron on them without them melting.. So now I&#x27;m out on my hot iron too because I really don&#x27;t want plastic melted on my natural hair...</li>
            <li> The extensions are beautiful I&#x27;ve been wearing extensions for 6 years now (because of salon mishaps) but these are awesome! and for the price amazing the shipping was super fast (maybe less than a week) and I received a personal thank you letter with the shipping as well, I like the service and the hair, will be back for more!</li>
            <li> These extensions are great for the money, but the ends look like they could use a little trim. They style easily and don&#x27;t really shed. The color matches L&#x27;oreal Preference Soft Black.</li>
            <li> Worst hair I ever bought it was like string</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t post reviews but I am so disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t not.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it came earlier than expected. That&#x27;s the only positive thing I will say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I got one piece of hair. About 16 inches long. With no clips attached. I didn&#x27;t even get instructions. The piece of hair I got isn&#x27;t even enough to cut somehow and just sew it in. I am so disappointed.This was such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If this is your firs time buying extensions I probably would recommend these to you, but if you are someone like me, who has been wearing them religiously for five years, please go look somewhere else. These extensions are very very thin, almost to the point they look stringy. Combing and curling these extensions makes them frizz out and become unmanageable. I am very disappointed. I returned mine after three days.</li>
            <li> It is very thin. I have a small head but I need at least three packets. It takes me 10 mins to clip in. It sheds a lot. I put flex rods in them over night and sprayed it with a spray to make the curls stay. It didn&#x27;t work. I then took a flat iron in the morning and tried to flat iron it. It didn&#x27;t work. If you want to wear it straight and flat and do not want to style it then this is for you. If not, buy good weave and sew the clip-ons your self. You pay for what you get. It still looked ok in my hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone spending their money on it because of the shedding, non curling, and thinness. They say it is remy and human hair. I can&#x27;t verify this. But I do have Remy hair, and there is a clear difference between this and that hair.  I don&#x27;t believe its Remy or Human hair but if you wear it as a quick fix. It does the trick. For the price you can get by until you buy something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful land it took less than 48 hours to deliver! :)</li>
            <li> From ElizaWigs - the hair is very very thin and stringy across the weft, especially across the longest ones (4 clips), so I sewed one of the smaller ones to these, to thicken it up (removing one set of clips) and to make it worth even clipping in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think I might sew more together even, and like another review mentioned... there IS some fake hair in there - had to straighten out the hair and saw melted strings in there... as well as a weird random string or thread I pulled out - it looked like it was a gray hair, not sure which would have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some 14&amp;#34; Remy extensions from another vendor and they were WAY thicker... hair seemed silkier too. I think that is a better deal, I had to trip these to make them less stringy at least 4&amp;#34; if not more so might as well just get the 14&amp;#34; ones to start with - at least it will be thicker.</li>
            <li> Cheap hair was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I have had these extensions since June. Although I don&#x27;t wear them every day, they are still in excellent condition! They are still super soft and beautiful looking. They have thinned out a little bit, but that&#x27;s expected with all hair extensions. They stay super straight even in high humidity/rain. The price is also phenomenal for the quality of this product. I recommend these 100%.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, my hair is not naturally black, I dye it jet black. I&#x27;m not sure if they would match perfectly for girls with naturally black hair, but if you dye your hair this color they will look perfect!</li>
            <li> For the price and the reviews I expected these to suck. They actually didn&#x27;t they were human hair a little thin, but hey I don&#x27;t have thick hair and they were  $40.</li>
            <li> Quality of the hair is incredible! Soft, shiny, excellent customer service and very fast replies/delivery! And also, the price is very affordable for the quality of what you get. The only negative part is that one of the clip was already broken when i received them and a piece of hair fell from the clips (unglued or unstitched) but it&#x27;s easy to repair it, i&#x27;ll put another clip and ready to go! :) I would recommend it to everybody!! And i plan to buy all my extansions from them now!</li>
            <li> Was a little nervous to buy human hair online, but this buy turned out great. I have no issues. The hair curls easy, and feels great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect much for the price:/  looked fake</li>
            <li> Terrible. The hair itself is soft but very thin and stringy. Save yourself some money and invest a bit more in better ones. I wish I never ordered them.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY apprehensive about buying this product as I have NEVER used extensions before.  I was told the delivery was going to be like a few weeks to a month but I had time to wait and was not in any hurry.  This product arrived within 7 days.  I opened the package and I thought that there was NO way this little bit of hair was going to work for me.  I went ahead and place the pieces throughout my hair as indicated in various tutorials I had seen.  It is not as easy as it looks and my natural hair is very soft so even though the clips were covered in silicone (which is nice), I was afraid they would slip.  I will have to maybe rat my hair a little or something but they actually DID stay in.  I was able to comb them, and curl them with no issues and they looked really pretty.  I did order another 100 gram pack and I&#x27;m going to sew them together and I think that will make a perfect amount of hair for my needs.  It looks real, feels real, curls nicely (I used a low heat) and they are shiny and pretty.  I would recommend these for a newbie to extension like myself as they are A LOT more cost effective then some of the high end extensions out there.  I was not going to spend $200 dollars the first time around.  After I play with these for a bit and get used to them, wear them out, etc, then I will look into the nicer ones but these are still very nice for the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair extensions 3 days ago and receive them yesterday! I am absolutely disappointed! I was wearing extensions for 2 years and never had hair like this! The look fake!!! They extremely THIN! Omg((( I was about to cry! When I tried to brush them before try it wear they start falling out like crazy!!!! I am going to return mine today!</li>
            <li> Loved these! Came b4 expected date!  Would bye again!!!</li>
            <li> These extensions dried way to easy, I cannot wear them now due to split ends everywhere and tangles within 15 minutes of wearing them. I am constantly brushing them or they look unprofessional.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying this hair. The colour was just as advertised. The length was correct and enough for a full head if your hair is not very thick. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my hair today, which came two days early. Awesome! Its a 100g like it said it would be. No! I have not curled it or installed my clip ins yet. They are jet black like the picture said it would bw, so i have to color my hair black. Im so ready to install my clip ins. Also the hair is pretty...long...and a lite shedding because of the track being cut to install the clips, but i hope the shedding stops after combing the access strings out. But so far im a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Got the package.. but i thought they came with the clips already in the hair.. was not happy when i opened it it says that the clip in where included</li>
            <li> I ordered these about a week ago, they aren&#x27;t here yet (as I already expected) I don&#x27;t know the quality and whatnot yet but I&#x27;m already disappointed with the fact that they have apparently been shipped but there is no tracking information. I know that is fairly normal but it bothers me because I&#x27;m paying for this item and I&#x27;d like to know what is going on with it, where it is, etc.</li>
            <li> The worst hair ever it started fallen apart as soon as I opened it .description is false hair is reallyyyy thin and length is not what I ordered when I contacted seller the told me that&#x27;s how it is. Never again will I buy from them . false advertising</li>
            <li> This came to me as one large track... I had to sew in clips and cut them myself. The hair has a decent thickness to it though.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly just not happy with the quality. Very thin, wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless your hair is the same. Dont purchase unless your into that bad, thinning mullet look.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine untill now :/  it took too long seriously! I thought it&#x27;ll come b4 the new year</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to me and its extremely thin I have a lot of hair and its thick in will probably need like 3 of these, very disapointed</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE FOR EXTENSIONS!! These actually came fairly quickly and were full extensions like the ones I have purchased from Sally&#x27;s but for more than half the price! Will use again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really liked them. They worked really well for me but I have only had them a month and worn a few times and the hair is already falling off the clips. I will have to sew them back on before I wear them again.</li>
            <li> I love the hair!!! It was described exactly how it looks when I received it except it was a little thin. I thought it would be thicker, but overall for the price it is great. I would order two sets if your hair is thin and you are looking for volume. I will be ordering another bag tonight. It shipped supper fast too ladies! :)</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU GOT MONEY TO BLOW! First of all there is now clips for these supposed &amp;#34;clip ins&amp;#34; and second this is basically a pack of local bss hair charged 40% more. This hair smells, doesn&#x27;t dye because it&#x27;s already dyed black, and sheds crazy. NEVER BUYING FROM THESE PEOPLE AGAIN. For now one if I want crappy extensions i&#x27;ll just make my own. The only pro is that this shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these twice now and just got my second set my first has lasted 6 months and I ordered new ones because they started to get a little thin. I got the new set today and they once again are amazing! I would definitely recommend these they are great quality and price.</li>
            <li> This only worked for half of my head. :( Had I known, I would have ordered two packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the hair itself is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This hair did shed not a lot, Also it was to thin for my hair and the color did not match my hair color. If you have thin hair I would say go for it but if you don&#x27;t I would not recommend this for thick hair</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but I&#x27;m very displeased that it says these are clips ins and the hair arrived WITHOUT clips. Also it says 20&amp;#34; which this hair is definitely not! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the worst hair extensions i have ever owned! They are so thin and cheap. Save ur money, dont buy these!!!</li>
            <li> The hair quality is ehh but it&#x27;s put onto the clips so poorly 4 of them have disconnected from the clips. I haven&#x27;t even been using them for 2 weeks. My last hair extensions lasted over 3 years and still haven&#x27;t come off the clip.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair. Doesn&#x27;t frizz after only a couple uses!! Not too thin actually a pretty good thickness!! Great deal on such a great product!!</li>
            <li> I was Very skeptical about these based on mixed reviews but took a chance on getting them. I wanted clip ins for a wedding, to add volume and length to my hair.I have shoulder length, somehwat thick hair. I must say when I received them I was very impressed. Many of the reviews here say they are thin. I actually don&#x27;t think they are. I felt that I received a lot of hair in this package and it was thick enough to blend with my own hair. This is definitely real hair. It is very shiny and soft. It matched my hair very well. They also did not shed any more than my actual hair. They clipped in very easily. My hair would be just above my shoulder when curled but the extensions allowed it to be almost mid back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was able to curl them using high heat. They did not burn. They dont curl as perfectly as my actual hair, I must say. It did the job to blend in with my hair though. Also, a couple of the ends did not hold the curl , but this only happened with 3 or 4 strands and I think if I trim them, they should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in all, I would definitely reccommend these. For the price, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. This is only my second time using extensions, and I only use them on occasion, not every day. But they can definitely be re-used so I would say try them out. For the price, it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> The 3 clip wefts were missing clips and the hair was very thin and falling out. on a positive note, the hair was soft and shiny but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> this did not come with the clips and the hair is thin. i did not like them.</li>
            <li> First I ordered this in April &amp; it should have arrived May 15th or June 3rd&lt;br /&gt;Yet I still don&#x27;t get anything and it&#x27;s June 15th what the hell is going on?.&lt;br /&gt;Regretting even buying it... I&#x27;m still just waiting for it to arrive. Highly upset about this.</li>
            <li> I received it much earlier than anticipated.  So far I love the hair. I took the clips off &amp; sewed them in and the hair is surprisingly thicker then I expected it to be. Its soft and I like the length. It hasnt tangled &amp; i havent had a need to flat iron it yet. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet either.  I hope I&#x27;m not disappointed. &amp; it didn&#x27;t come in nice packaging but its OK. :)</li>
            <li> Worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever gotten, it&#x27;s not even real hair so I don&#x27;t understand why it says human hair?! Really disappointed, didn&#x27;t even return all of my money back, don&#x27;t recomand these to anyone unless you&#x27;re looking for synthetic hair! Hate this!</li>
            <li> Hair is thin, and not mutch hair is put on each clip but they are great for length. I have natural african american hair and they blend with it when my hair is straight. But def buy two packs.</li>
            <li> It took only 7, yes 7, days to get here with regular shipping. I opened them and everything was there. The are exactly 20 inches. And unlike most extensions they are not layered at the bottom and still thick at the ends (which is good for me) I only got one package but if you have short hair (like me) get another package. (: happy buying!</li>
            <li> First time I ever sent something back. Not Full not 100g and not at all clip in, didn&#x27;t even include clips.</li>
            <li> Not real hair it doesn&#x27;t curl and its very fake and tangled I tried washing it with a deep conditioner and it got very stringy I wish they would have put synthetic hair on the caption so I didn&#x27;t waste my money thinking it&#x27;s human hair</li>
            <li> There are just perfect!! it is 100% true human hair. Totally soft and smooth!1 and they are ready for use</li>
            <li> they are not 100% natural</li>
            <li> Terrible. I ordered jet black and I received light brown. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Got my hair 2weeks earlier.. To be exact 6 days after ordering which is pretty fast. The hair it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. I cut mines in pieces to make tape in extensions and had very minimal shedding (I cut it so of course hairs will fall)  I&#x27;ve curled washed curled washed curled wash and this hair still looks like I just tapped it in. It&#x27;s so silky and soft. If you have thin hair buy 2 packs for volume. Otherwise I love it and I will be a return customer. I will update in a few more weeks of using it to let the users know the quality after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I will give this a 3 star only because the hair is very nice easily blends with your hair and also true to length and also I don&#x27;t find them very thin they are normal thickness. Not too thick but just right!! I&#x27;m soo upset and giving a 3 star because it says in the question answer section that it comes with 20 peices and it&#x27;s for a full head Uhm no it only has 7 pieces and you will definitely need two packs and had I known that I definetly would have gotten 2 packs from the beginning and not be waiting 3 more days to do my hair for my birthday!!:( but good quality they should really tell the whole truth about their product though</li>
            <li> Love this hair use it one time and people was asking me where I get it from,they really like it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the quality of this hair when I received it, it felt so soft &amp; shiny!... At first. Quick delivery was nice though. After I started styling &amp; wearing this hair it started to look damaged pretty quickly.  I washed them once a week, just because if I didn&#x27;t they started to look super dry &amp; they would tangle. This hair does break &amp; dry easily. Also, after my second wear the clips started detaching themselves from the track of hair &amp; it made it look SO obvious that I was wearing extensions, because the clips &amp; tracks were sticking out. LOL talk about ghetto:)  The clips are just really low quality in my opinion, because they&#x27;re plastic, large, &amp; just poorly sewn. Once I sewed the clips back in myself, it looked a little bit better. The clips didn&#x27;t grip to my hair well either, slid out pretty quickly. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to girls with super soft thin hair like mine. I think if your hair has more texture or is just thicker these May work for you. I know that I could have just sewn higher quality clips in myself but this hair just isn&#x27;t even worth it. It matts pretty bad in the back if it rubs against my shirts the wrong way &amp; it&#x27;s just too dry. I do think this is mostly human hair, just low quality. But for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything super impressive so I&#x27;m not overly disappointed. almost two months of everyday wear. they&#x27;re not HORRIBLE, just annoying &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or recommend. I just got a new set of extensions from somewhere else &amp; they&#x27;re much better so I&#x27;ll keep these ones as back up :)</li>
            <li> Love ! The curl so perfect ! And clips are great , kinda have a funny smell but what do you expect ?  As first the hair will fall out a little all you do is brush and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> This were horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I like them but if you have thick hair your going to need more than one set. I had to get a haircut so they would blend in with my extensions</li>
            <li> Omg..  not worth getting it .. one clip came with it and you have to do it yourself. . and if you don&#x27;t know how to sew then you are out of luck.. you also have waste  $6.00 or more for clips that you have to sew in.</li>
            <li> I love my extensions I recommend it to everyone PS great price</li>
            <li> The extensions are thin, but all the pieces and clips make up for it ! These extensions are very soft and shiny . I would totally buy again</li>
            <li> just recieved my hair today and i must saythat its quality is great and i love the length and texture of it.</li>
            <li> definetly get more for thicker hair. and clips came off quick, but they are good for something quick and cheap. like i always say its about quality not quanity. if your looking for everyday nd long lasting pay for them lol. i was gunna pay 108.00 on sallys before these kinda wish i did :)</li>
            <li> I love this hair! It even shipped &amp; was delivered earlier then expected. The wreaths are a little thin, but that is why I bought 2 packs &amp; it turned out beautiful! Blends really good.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely terrible. I’ve already posted a review about how awful my delivery experience was.&lt;br /&gt;Then after (finally) receiving them last night, I literally just laughed.&lt;br /&gt;These are NOT human hair. Please do not be fooled. I don’t appreciate being lied to and being shipped fake hair when I paid real money.&lt;br /&gt;I understand you get what you paid for, but these are only about $15 or so cheaper than the hair I usually buy that is GREAT quality.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, these are the thinnest extensions I have ever seen. You can see through them. I put one piece on just to see and it looked like play hair that a little girl would wear.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not “super thick,” it’s about an average thickness. Usually I only need one set of extensions no matter what kind I buy. With these, I would need AT LEAST 3 sets to look even halfway normal.&lt;br /&gt;I buy tons of extensions. I usually buy at least 3 pairs a year. And I would NEVER buy these again or recommend them to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;They are terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money and splurge for the ones that are a little more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair was silky, and easy to manage, and lasted a long time when taken care of. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I like it its easy to use, but it was not enough hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok if you have fine to medium thick hair. I have really think hair and I ordered 2, &amp; still u can see the difference. They do tangle easily too. But they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
            <li> This was not &amp;#34;20&amp;#34;Inch and it was one whole weft ! And there was no clips!  Horrible!  Would never order from here again waste of money to be honest!</li>
            <li> I received these extensions and the hair is very thin.... I try to flat iron it at the lowest setting and burned the hair off! Real hair does not come off!</li>
            <li> If you want human hair as extensions to your own hair, I definitely recommend Elizawigs hair extensions. They are sent to you in nice packaging. It is easy to see that Elizawigs cares. The hair is incredible..absolutely incredible. The sellers are super sweet and willing to help in any way. The best hair extensions are sold by Elizawigs.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-I love the fact that they are easy to put in and take out. I put them in my hair to make my hair look fuller. I wish I ordered longer hair to make my hair look longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- I wish they were a little thicker. I am not sure if all extensions are the same, but just more hair in each clip would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I really like them. People can&#x27;t tell I have them in my hair unless they touch my head.</li>
            <li> The hair feels nice but you get what you pay for its very little hair too many wefts but it&#x27;s no use if they have zero to nothing of hair it&#x27;s really pointless to wear them I have to put it in a braid for it to look okay</li>
            <li> This hair arrived about 3 weeks before expected  sooooo soft and its really nice hair. The only thing its 18 inches instead of 20 but its great hair. But if you have thin hair you probably should buy 2 sets</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying hair extensions and I must say these are very great.  They are kinda thin but so is my hair.  They blend so well and the color matches perfectly.  It comes with extra clips and directions on when to hair etc.  The clips are so secure and the hair is super soft and shiny.  Defintely for a first timer that doesnt want to spend a lot for hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Received them super early, scheduled to come July 22nd, ordered them June 7th and received them June 14th ;) The hair is SO soft &amp; beautiful. The clips hold well, its wrapped very carefully and smells good. The thickness is good as is, but I prefer buying a second pack. Love Love LOVE, would recommend them to anybody looking to buy extensions from Amazon. Great Price, Great Shipping, Great Hair :)</li>
            <li> This is not real. What I received was plastic and felt like thick wires. Horrible.</li>
            <li> its low quality. Its frizzy and thin and tangly. It sucks. just save your money and buy some real ones. and you cannot get your money back one u put them in and judge if u like them or not</li>
            <li> They do not curl, I bought these to add and lengthen my hair and I love to curl my hair and they do not curl. Very upset about this. Not even sure if there real hair if not high quality fake hair.</li>
            <li> Some what.. but I think it&#x27;s because I bought 2 packs. I also had to cut off the ends because they were thin. :/</li>
            <li> I love these! great price and you can curl and straighten them with no effort.</li>
            <li> I ordered human hair and it was synthetic. It won&#x27;t curl, very disappointed</li>
            <li> False advertisement. Not human hair please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> About a year ago maybe a little longer i had purchased the dark brown ones and they were amazing !!! Blended so well with my hair and true to length i just ordered these ones and eagerly waiting for them. I highly recommend these amazing and cheap!!</li>
            <li> Does not tangle and blends well when curled. It&#x27;s thin but it&#x27;s perfect if you just wanna add extra length. Be aware it is 100g so that how much hair your getting.</li>
            <li> The hair extensions were fine other than the fact that there were pieces of STRING sewed into the hair. STRING. Not like black string nonono like different colors there were some blue some white some pink and orange. There weren&#x27;t a lot only one of each color but my friends noticed and were like &amp;#34;Hey Kayla you have a string in your hair&amp;#34; when they tugged on it I then realized it was part of the extension. I also found some of my own. Then When they came in the mail I was supposed to get a set of TEN. I only got eight. I contacted them about it and they said they would send the two remaining pieces but it&#x27;s been almost 2 months since the day they said they sent them. So I contacted them again and was told maybe they got lost in the mail so then they said they would just refund the amount for those two pieces. They said they would refund $7 into my account. Nope still haven&#x27;t done that. It&#x27;s been more than a week and I&#x27;ve contacted them twice about the refund and not even a reply. I definitely will not be ordering from them at all and I don&#x27;t think you should either. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Love it. A little thin but still does the trick! Shipping was fine also. Just be sure to take care of it!</li>
            <li> The hair was too thin and is deffinetly not full human hair. Its a synthetic blend. It was very soft the day i got them but after about two days of wearing them they got very clumped togethe. And developed lots of knots. I wouldnt recommend for every day use.</li>
            <li> I just received my order and the hair, if I can even call it that, is TERRIBLE!!! I have been wearing clip in extensions for years and I generally get really expensive sets for 200+ dollars, but I decided I wanted to buy a couple cheapys so I could use them a couple times and dump them. This hair is not 100% human at all. When I opened the package and touched it, the hair almost felt crunchy and had an odd color to it. I decided to pull out a couple strands and burn it to see if it was real hair and it sure did smell like plastic!!! Did the same thing to my 200 dollar extensions and it smelt like real burnt hair. I am pissed I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> These extensions were a really good by for the price, good quality hair. Thicker than I expected. If you have very thick hair I would recommend two packs. Which for the price is still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a lot of hair extensions and these definently don&#x27;t suck, but they were pretty thin. They curl and straighten like real hair and the clips stay in pretty well. For the cheap price, these extensions are worth it, I would say.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick..quality is good except Umm I grey hairs in mine :/ that was weird.</li>
            <li> I got these extensions for my fiancee and she absolutely loves them!!! And I do as well because they are SOOOOOO much cheaper than buying them anywhere else. I got her some curly ones at a hair salon she likes and I spent over $80!!! These were about 3/4 the price!!!!! Takes forever to get in the mail but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Great product! They are perfect..and I&#x27;ve been through lots of Hair Extensions from $10- $300 different qualitie ones and I have by far had the best luck with theses hope you do too!!&lt;br /&gt;-Looks natural&lt;br /&gt;-Curls and straightens without a problem&lt;br /&gt;-Blends with my level 3 hair color perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good could be thicker but it&#x27;s good for the price!</li>
            <li> Hair was horrible! I finally washed it and dye came out of it, on top of that there&#x27;s A million different colored hair in my extensions. If you want fried, colored hair these are your extensions.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on the 1st of August and got them today it&#x27;s August 9th the hair is kinda thin but it&#x27;s not really an issue.. The hair is very soft as well</li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive reviews on these extensions and I am really disappointed. You can tell these aren&#x27;t human hair the shine and texture show that. But just to test and see if I was just wrong I tried to curl them and they didn&#x27;t curl they fried. I&#x27;m sending them back. Total bummer!</li>
            <li> Quality hair for price very much worth it</li>
            <li> The hair is great, just wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I was looking for cheap, good quality human hair extensions since i had just cut all my beloved hair off due to the chemical damage done by a horrible hair dresser and i was looking for a quick fix to short hair; and then i found these! there of medium thickness and are so so SO soft and shinny, well worth more than 40$, they also come with two extra clips and the same color thread in case one ends up falling off or breaking. the shipping was relativity quicker than it was estimated, almost 3 weeks before the earliest estimation, i got them 2 weeks after my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been searhcing for a reliable, trustworthy place to purchase my hair extensions and i think i have found it! :)</li>
            <li> My daughter was looking for extensions so I bought these for my her and she loves them, I&#x27;m very pleased becuase she is very picky.</li>
            <li> got 2 days use before got tangled looking and I took it out at night. when I washed it a bunch of dye came off them and they didn&#x27;t look so black.</li>
            <li> its soft and looks nice but it sheds too much, need to buy another one so it would look fuller</li>
            <li> Really thin,and not 20 inches long... The clips hurt and aren&#x27;t sewed in well. But what can you expect for how cheap they were.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend these extentions to everyone else. They are thick just the way I wanted them and they also came in way earlier than I expected. I love that! Now I get to show them off even quicker. yay!! I will definately be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I received the package within a few days.  I love this hair.  Really beautiful and the color is not too black.  I was worried b/c it was labeled as \\&quot;jet black\\&quot; but it matches my hair perfectly!  The seller even put in extra clips which I am so thrilled with b/c I have some extra hair and was going to go to the store on Saturday and buy a few clips.  When I looked in the package again....there were a couple of extra clips!  Thank you!  Highly recommend this product and the seller appears to be very thoughtful.</li>
            <li> I received my package fast but was very unhappy with the extensions. I know I didn&#x27;t pay much for them but the quality of the hair is not worth the money. The hair is to thin, the color is off. Mine had red and white strands throughout all the clip ins. And the hair fell out like crazy just combing them. The only good thing were the clips! I will contact the seller and update when I hear back from them. Thank you!</li>
            <li> First off , the hair came in extra early the expected. The expected date was April 17th but they came March 28. They are very soft and curl really good and omg they blend so well, it makes you never wanna go back to basic weave . They are well worth more than 40 bucks !</li>
            <li> so i bought these extension and i love them&lt;br /&gt;i washed curled the and straighten them&lt;br /&gt;everyone says tells me u catn tell they are a little thin but my hair is thin so it blends in perfect if u have lots of hair i recommend you buy two</li>
            <li> WAYYY TOOO THIN. HAIR IS FALLING OUT NOT NATURAL LOOKING THICKNESS AT ALL. Color looks good an shiny but nothing else</li>
            <li> Terrible, I thought i was going to get a good product and came back with nasty hair that burns and doesn&#x27;t curl like it said it did. Bad mistake. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Real hair that is perfect texture, but WAY TOO THIN....LIKE WAY WAY TOO THIN</li>
