            <li>This was great to take it on the go.</li>

            <li>This is really good.  </li>

            <li>Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus fragrance was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice sized tin with a product that you don&#x27;t need a ton of to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice once you get to it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried everything, including some very strong men.</li>
            <li>Love Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salves (and like them better than the Bath &amp; Body Works brand!)</li>
            <li>The product works well, but the rose smell was a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but that is okay.  </li>
            <li>Love this for my lips</li>
            <li>This fit the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried all the flavors now, and this isn&#x27;t quite her favorite.</li>
            <li>But if you love the smell of menthol, then I can&#x27;t find a reason not to recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Still a great lip balm for healing your lips, but not necessarily what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li>I use many different balms and usually enjoy Burts Bees, but this is much more effective and has a better feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>I am so impressed i am truly going to buy so much more, especially for my nine year old son.</li>
            <li>Great stuff especially for allergy sufferers.</li>
            <li>Since i use the original formula a lot, I ended up keeping it, but this kind of felt like a bait-and-switch haha.</li>
            <li>great for sore or dry nose at night, put it right in there, great product, can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>I ordered this expecting the Menthol and Eucalyptus version, but got the original formula and tin instead.  </li>
            <li>I also have the most sensitive, easily chapped lips in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best product ever!</li>
            <li>quick affordable shipping.big enoughamount  tin to use it for a muriad of reasons.</li>
            <li>My hands smell good and the area around my nails is no longer dry.</li>
            <li>You can use it on nearly anything, and it&#x27;s even super awesome on small cuts or acne.</li>
            <li>balm solved all of my problems and is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>and they come in multiple flavors :)</li>
            <li>First time purchase.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to open with a wrench.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good, versatile buy that actually works.</li>
            <li>It smells minty, almost exactly like Mentholatum, and is really moisturizing on the lips.</li>
            <li>patches are very close to ezcema.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the smell of roses.</li>
            <li>Really like.</li>
            <li>, I found this menthol and eucalyptus lip salve and in the description it talked about how this salve was god for hands, cracked skin and many other things.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it since I had tried other products, and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like when I have to apply with my fingers, but I don&#x27;t mind with this product.  </li>
            <li>i actually used this on my mother&#x27;s bed sore and it healed right up-</li>
            <li>it was almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>and, lo and behold, I wake up with lips that are actually SOFT.</li>
            <li>No matter how good the actual balm is, it does no good if I can&#x27;t even get to it!</li>
            <li>But this one actually makes them SOFT.</li>
            <li>Love the company and the history behind it.</li>
            <li>A little medicinal smelling (like Vick&#x27;s) but was perfect for when I was sick.</li>
            <li>I also bought a tin of the regular cream and tried some of my two year old daughter&#x27;s dry patches of skin that we have no clue why she gets, within 40 minutes</li>

            <li> I wanted it to be a little more subtle.</li>
            <li> You can use the balm to moisturize your cuticles and dry, flaky areas of skin, if necessary, though I would recommend keeping use of the balm to your hands and lips.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was super tired when I bought this, but I thought it would be rose-tinted when I did buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on these balms for hte last 2 years, and even with everyday multiple use these last almost a year</li>
            <li> This salve is a life saver for my dry lips, elbows, parts of my hands, and feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on dry skin patches on my hands &amp; elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me after I told a friend about a dry patch of skin</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff did and after two days of use, the dry patch of skin was gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a jar the size of a half dollar, and it&#x27;ll last for FOREVER.</li>
            <li> It is clear and very slick.</li>
            <li> I have the other scents and I like this one a lot.</li>
            <li> I had tried the regular rosebud lip salve before and it lasted for months, just the small tube!</li>
            <li> However, I deducted two stars because I was hoping the Eucalyptus/Menthol scent would be a little stronger, and because the tin is so hard to open!</li>
            <li> With the harsh winter this year I find that everything&#x27;s in need of some extreme moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Could be a little stronger of a smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get the tin container open at times.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing</li>
            <li> Along with muscle strengthening exercises and massaging with this ointment, they have been slowly repairing, less pain.</li>
            <li> Usually, I settle for a lip balm that just keeps my lips from cracking.</li>
            <li> Nothing should be this difficult to open.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous that the lid is on so tight.</li>
            <li> Serious waste of money.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and the menthol/eucalyptus scent is also a bonus if you&#x27;re sick as it helps open &amp; soothe a stuffy nose.</li>
            <li> I used some of this salve on my nose and within minutes it stopped hurting, within hours some of the hard cracked skin started to heal!</li>
            <li> I have been sick off and on for the past two months, i have three children and it seems like once we all get a cold and spread it, it comes full circle and starts over again, my nose was paying a horrible price even bleeding!</li>
            <li> , there is one thing wrong with this product and it&#x27;s the packaging.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> this even works on your nose after those horrible winter weather colds.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn like carmex and the winter has been horrible to his lips.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really good.  Could be a little stronger of a smell but that is okay.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I cannot do without Rosebud salve for my  lips and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Love this for my lips</li>
            <li> Love this! I was looking for something cooling for my lips. This fit the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> this even works on your nose after those horrible winter weather colds. I had tried the regular rosebud lip salve before and it lasted for months, just the small tube! so i looked up some replacements on amazon, I found this menthol and eucalyptus lip salve and in the description it talked about how this salve was god for hands, cracked skin and many other things. I just got this yesterday and i absolutely love it. I have been sick off and on for the past two months, i have three children and it seems like once we all get a cold and spread it, it comes full circle and starts over again, my nose was paying a horrible price even bleeding! Especially since i had recently underwent a skin peel. I used some of this salve on my nose and within minutes it stopped hurting, within hours some of the hard cracked skin started to heal! I am so impressed i am truly going to buy so much more, especially for my nine year old son. This doesn&#x27;t burn like carmex and the winter has been horrible to his lips. I truly recommend this product.  I also bought a tin of the regular cream and tried some of my two year old daughter&#x27;s dry patches of skin that we have no clue why she gets, within 40 minutes it was almost completely gone! It absorbedThese patches are very close to ezcema. Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and got the regular Rosebud balm.  Completely disappointed. There was a sticker on the back that said it was Menthol &amp; Eucalyptus, however it&#x27;s the standard Rosebud tin.</li>
            <li> This was great to take it on the go. The eucalyptus fragrance was amazing.  Great on the lips as a moisturizer.  Love the company and the history behind it.</li>
            <li> Helps with the occasional pain flare up in my knee and hip joints and associated muscles/ligaments.  Along with muscle strengthening exercises and massaging with this ointment, they have been slowly repairing, less pain.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best product ever! You can use it on nearly anything, and it&#x27;s even super awesome on small cuts or acne. I give this as a gift all the time and keep it stashed throughout my house. A must-have!</li>
            <li> With the harsh winter this year I find that everything&#x27;s in need of some extreme moisturizing. This salve is a life saver for my dry lips, elbows, parts of my hands, and feet. Its a nice sized tin with a product that you don&#x27;t need a ton of to get the job done. I carry this with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was super tired when I bought this, but I thought it would be rose-tinted when I did buy it. However, it is not! It is clear and very slick. Still a great lip balm for healing your lips, but not necessarily what I was expecting :)</li>
            <li> The product works well, but the rose smell was a bit overwhelming. I wanted it to be a little more subtle.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is healing my lips.  I use many different balms and usually enjoy Burts Bees, but this is much more effective and has a better feel and smell.  Normally I don&#x27;t like when I have to apply with my fingers, but I don&#x27;t mind with this product.  I actually use the leftover from my lips on my cuticles.  My hands smell good and the area around my nails is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell of roses. I also have the most sensitive, easily chapped lips in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm solved all of my problems and is my current favorite. It smells minty, almost exactly like Mentholatum, and is really moisturizing on the lips. I put it on at night before I got to sleep and, lo and behold, I wake up with lips that are actually SOFT. Usually, I settle for a lip balm that just keeps my lips from cracking. But this one actually makes them SOFT. When you put it on, it looks like a gloss, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a jar the size of a half dollar, and it&#x27;ll last for FOREVER. You can use the balm to moisturize your cuticles and dry, flaky areas of skin, if necessary, though I would recommend keeping use of the balm to your hands and lips. Overall, it&#x27;s a good, versatile buy that actually works.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else on my lips ever again. I&#x27;ve been hooked on these balms for hte last 2 years, and even with everyday multiple use these last almost a year so it&#x27;s definitely a big bang for your buck. You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing and they come in multiple flavors :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend, and she LOVES Rosebud&#x27;s products. It keeps her lips moist and and lasts for hours. She&#x27;s tried all the flavors now, and this isn&#x27;t quite her favorite. But if you love the smell of menthol, then I can&#x27;t find a reason not to recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome. I put it on every night before bed in the winter to keep my lips moisturized. It smells heavenly and the menthol/eucalyptus scent is also a bonus if you&#x27;re sick as it helps open &amp; soothe a stuffy nose. I&#x27;ve also used it on dry skin patches on my hands &amp; elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and according to their website this salve can also be used for &amp;#34;cold sores, razorburn, psoriasis, allergies, insect bites, and abrasions.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;(Their strawberry lip balm is also wonderful!)</li>
            <li> best lip balm EVER.  great for sore or dry nose at night, put it right in there, great product, can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting the Menthol and Eucalyptus version, but got the original formula and tin instead.  There was a sticker on it labelled Menthol and Eucalyptus.  Since i use the original formula a lot, I ended up keeping it, but this kind of felt like a bait-and-switch haha.</li>
            <li> nice tin, good smell&lt;br /&gt;\good stuff! quick affordable shipping.big enoughamount  tin to use it for a muriad of reasons. my son really loved it for sinus</li>
            <li> This is probably the best lip balm ever, I have tried Aquaphor and it&#x27;s good and all but it doesn&#x27;t come close tot his stuff. I have the other scents and I like this one a lot.</li>
            <li> This balm goes on nicely and has a great texture. However, I deducted two stars because I was hoping the Eucalyptus/Menthol scent would be a little stronger, and because the tin is so hard to open! I just spend five minutes trying to open it, and still no luck. No matter how good the actual balm is, it does no good if I can&#x27;t even get to it!</li>
            <li> First time purchase. Really like. Not overly menthol-y, which was a concern. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff especially for allergy sufferers.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, best stuff to use!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me after I told a friend about a dry patch of skin I couldn&#x27;t get rid of on the corner of my mouth. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it since I had tried other products, and none of them worked. Well, this stuff did and after two days of use, the dry patch of skin was gone! I have also used it on the heels of my feet and it even works well on bug bites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is one thing wrong with this product and it&#x27;s the packaging. It&#x27;s very hard to get the tin container open at times. I&#x27;ve tried everything - even sticking it in the fridge for a bit, and that didn&#x27;t make it any easier. I finally decided to just place saran wrap around the open container and just take it off whenever I want to use it. It&#x27;s a lot easier that way!</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life. I love it. Works well under my lipstick or alone. Just menthol enough to satisfy my lip balm addiction.</li>
            <li> i actually used this on my mother&#x27;s bed sore and it healed right up-the menthol does the trick</li>
            <li> A little medicinal smelling (like Vick&#x27;s) but was perfect for when I was sick. Love Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salves (and like them better than the Bath &amp; Body Works brand!)</li>
            <li> Serious waste of money. I can&#x27;t get the lid off and I&#x27;ve tried everything, including some very strong men. This is ridiculous that the lid is on so tight. I guess I&#x27;ll throw it away and consider this a lesson learned. I have no idea whether it works or not.  Update. I was finally able to open with a wrench. Nothing should be this difficult to open. It&#x27;s nice once you get to it. Please make it easier to open!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is soooo nourishing and delicious! Wait... I&#x27;ve got to go get me some!</li>
