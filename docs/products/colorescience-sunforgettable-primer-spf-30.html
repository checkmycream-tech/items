            <li>and it really is nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product wears well all day under make-up or on its own.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This light tint is good for fair to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>I liked how it made my skin look, but didn&#x27;t like how it made me breakout.</li>
            <li>Texture is silky, the color is perfect (i have pale-medium yellow Caucasian skin tone)</li>
            <li>I watched the manufacturer&#x27;s video on their website and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I love the SPF protection.</li>
            <li>I use the primer as is and don&#x27;t apply any powder over the top</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to many, many products , so this one is a blessing .</li>
            <li>I use this instead of foundation and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this primer and the SPF</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product and can be used around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it every time I apply makeup as part of my anti-aging routine.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many primer sunblocks (smashbox, la Roche posay, etc.)</li>
            <li>, I think it will be better for her.</li>
            <li>This product is a relatively safe combination of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in a tinted cream form that goes on smoothly over moisturizer and evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and it copletely protects my skin and makes it look great too.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, also.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and evenly</li>
            <li>Shipping and handling was fine.</li>
            <li>It is light coverage but still evens out a lot of texture and blotchyness in my skin.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly, stays put and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product - not too heavy and</li>
            <li>This primer goes on smoothly, covers well and has a sunscreen and the color blends in with all skin types.</li>
            <li>but it is such a great product, I use it as my foundation.</li>
            <li>I can pretty much use all the others except those two with my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>Almost like a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It does everything: goes on like air yet has really good light coverage (freckles nearly invisible), stays on, can be worn alone for a very natural look, keeps foundation and powder from settling into pores and lines.</li>
            <li>I love the product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product is very smooth, but for the price I paid I expected more: more product and completely allergy-free.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it</li>
            <li>It acts as a good primer with sun protection, but I especially like to use it as a light makeup: barely tinted with natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li>Skin seems to have improved since using this product consistently.</li>
            <li>I think it has a funny smell.</li>
            <li>I will use it for the sunscreen but go back to the Bronzing Primer for more covering effect.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time this summer and found it to be just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good product to put on your skin everyday.</li>
            <li>I can spend a few hours out at the park on a sunny day with my extremely fair skin without burning.</li>
            <li>With the physical barrier this product offers, you receive better and longer protection from the sun, keeping wrinkles away!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and last for hourse but most importantly it really protects you from harmful sun rays</li>
            <li>Allow a light moisturizer to set first, then one of these primers over that, than your choice of mineral or regular makeup (I prefer mineral), and dust with a finishing powder and my makeup lasts all day.</li>
            <li>For darker complexions I recommend the Wild to Mild Skin Bronzing formula that my latina sister uses in the summer when she is at her darkest.</li>
            <li>Plus it is much thicker than I would like.</li>
            <li>I work with horses and spend my days in the sun and heat, nothing really helped, until I try this brand.</li>
            <li>This goes onto your skin very smoothly, is a primer that can be used alone as it covers slightly.</li>
            <li>If I use this with powder, it makes me look 10 years older as it sits in your lines.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These primers have a thick mouse like texture and absorb right into your skin so if you have slightly oily skin like me you won&#x27;t get seperation of your makeup by the time you get to happy hour.</li>
            <li>Other primers pill, this one is smooth and covers evenly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it daily over the past summer and have been very pleased with its performance:  </li>
            <li>Unlike most other primers I&#x27;ve tried, it is not colorless, and this initially concerned me, as did the mousse-like texture.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more coverage but it barely concealed anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s with only barely there fine lines.</li>
            <li>it is a little pricey, but will probably will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>It offers SPF 30 sun protection, is scent-free, and is non-irritating on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have skin that is sensitive to sun and chemicals.</li>
            <li>It never breaks me out or irritates my acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried every high end tinted moisturizer/tinted primer and low end versions out there.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, large pores around my nose, hyper pigmentation, sun damage, wrinkles and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Other sun blocks can look chalky, this one looks very natural.  </li>

            <li> It seems a little expensive, but it last for several months so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> But i suppose it is a \\&quot;primer\\&quot;, meant to be worn under other makeups.</li>
            <li> It does not cover dark blemishes or discoloration like a heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> The product caused me a little breakout.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping it had a little tint to it.</li>
            <li> but I wish they continue making the round container.  </li>
            <li> and I would hate to think of it ever disappearing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can beat this stuff for a primer w/sunscreen.  I have combination skin and it really is nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was fine. The product feels great and looks great. Skin seems to have improved since using this product consistently. Texture is silky, the color is perfect (i have pale-medium yellow Caucasian skin tone) I have acne prone skin, large pores around my nose, hyper pigmentation, sun damage, wrinkles and dry skin. This does not catch on my dry skin or rest in my wrinkles. It does not cover dark blemishes or discoloration like a heavy foundation. It is light coverage but still evens out a lot of texture and blotchyness in my skin. But i suppose it is a \\&quot;primer\\&quot;, meant to be worn under other makeups. This product wears well all day under make-up or on its own. Never live a day without this product. I have gone through one bottle in a year and now am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, stays put and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. I wish it had more natural ingredients. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent primer.  It offers SPF 30 sun protection, is scent-free, and is non-irritating on my sensitive skin.  Unlike most other primers I&#x27;ve tried, it is not colorless, and this initially concerned me, as did the mousse-like texture.  However, when applied to the skin, the product is very sheer [almost invisible] and \\&quot;slippery.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve worn it daily over the past summer and have been very pleased with its performance:  it does everything a primer should, plus provides sun protection.</li>
            <li> Aaa, don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about. I think it has a funny smell. Plus it is much thicker than I would like. Almost like a full coverage foundation. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s with only barely there fine lines. If I use this with powder, it makes me look 10 years older as it sits in your lines. Won&#x27;t buy again and wish I could send back...</li>
            <li> The product is very smooth, but for the price I paid I expected more: more product and completely allergy-free. The product caused me a little breakout. I think next time I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more coverage but it barely concealed anything.  I will use it for the sunscreen but go back to the Bronzing Primer for more covering effect.</li>
            <li> This goes onto your skin very smoothly, is a primer that can be used alone as it covers slightly. Add the benefit of sunscreen and it&#x27;s a good product to put on your skin everyday. it also does not visibly &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; on the skin but absorbs into it.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the skin.  I watched the manufacturer&#x27;s video on their website and glad I did.  Easy to apply, also.</li>
            <li> Good Price, really good time of delivering, all my expectation was Ok, overall I&#x27;m Happy because my wife is happy!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful!  It goes on easily and evenly and I love the SPF protection. I use the primer as is and don&#x27;t apply any powder over the top and it still looks great.  I definitely recommend the Colorescience Sunforgettable Primer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. I have skin that is sensitive to sun and chemicals. This product is a relatively safe combination of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in a tinted cream form that goes on smoothly over moisturizer and evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Seems to cover well .</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - not too heavy and my skin is protected. I am allergic to many, many products , so this one is a blessing .</li>
            <li> Great. Used at beach and pool for me and my kids. No burns!!!</li>
            <li> Coverage is great. Good sun protection.  I use it to cover imperfections  I love the product and highly recommend it. GW</li>
            <li> I use this instead of foundation and love it.</li>
            <li> Seemed to do a good job of sun protection without looking chalky or greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have ever tried.  It gives good coverage and sun protection too.  It seems a little expensive, but it last for several months so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>

            <li> Worth every cent. It does everything: goes on like air yet has really good light coverage (freckles nearly invisible), stays on, can be worn alone for a very natural look, keeps foundation and powder from settling into pores and lines. I&#x27;m never going to be without this. In fact, I wonder if I should stock up in case they ever stop making it.</li>
            <li> Colorscience works and is good for the skin!</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  I was introduced to it through my dermatologist and was very happy when I found it on line.  It is not heavy and it copletely protects my skin and makes it look great too.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product and can be used around the eye area.  This product takes the place of primer, foundation, concealer and sunscreen.  Best all-in-one product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time this summer and found it to be just as advertised.  It goes on nicely and provides great coverage from the sun.</li>
            <li> it works good as a primer but I was hoping it had a little tint to it. I purchased one before that had some tint to it and i was hoping this one would too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It acts as a good primer with sun protection, but I especially like to use it as a light makeup: barely tinted with natural looking coverage. The texture is perfect: neither oily nor drying.</li>
            <li> I would go nuts if the Colorescience SPF Primers ever got discontinued. I have tried every high end tinted moisturizer/tinted primer and low end versions out there. Like 20 of them and non of them compare to Colorescience. Allow a light moisturizer to set first, then one of these primers over that, than your choice of mineral or regular makeup (I prefer mineral), and dust with a finishing powder and my makeup lasts all day. These primers have a thick mouse like texture and absorb right into your skin so if you have slightly oily skin like me you won&#x27;t get seperation of your makeup by the time you get to happy hour. It never breaks me out or irritates my acne prone sensitive skin. And with the SPF 30 I can spend a few hours out at the park on a sunny day with my extremely fair skin without burning. Nothing compares to this and I would hate to think of it ever disappearing. It is the most expensive product I use but it is totally worth it and 1 pump a day lasts me about 3 months. This light tint is good for fair to medium skin tones. For darker complexions I recommend the Wild to Mild Skin Bronzing formula that my latina sister uses in the summer when she is at her darkest. They also have a Chocolate Mousse version that I got my african american model friend hooked on. I can pretty much use all the others except those two with my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> this is the best primer I have ever used. it is a little pricey, but will probably will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> This is a primer but it is such a great product, I use it as my foundation.</li>
            <li> I adore this Colorescience product!</li>
            <li> I like this product but I wish they continue making the round container.  That way I can use this one to put in my purse and take it with me and one is for home whenever I want to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every time I apply makeup as part of my anti-aging routine.  Other primers pill, this one is smooth and covers evenly.  Others are sheer.  With the physical barrier this product offers, you receive better and longer protection from the sun, keeping wrinkles away!  Other sun blocks can look chalky, this one looks very natural.  I have tried many primer sunblocks (smashbox, la Roche posay, etc.) and this one is my all time favorite!</li>
            <li> I liked how it made my skin look, but didn&#x27;t like how it made me breakout. I ended up giving this product to my mother who has ruddy skin but doesn&#x27;t breakout, I think it will be better for her.</li>
