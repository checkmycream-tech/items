            <li> beautiful packaging and one of the best smelling perfumes in the world. If you like gardenia this is a dream gift.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to fragrance.  I especially like the roller ball for convenient way to carry it in my purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> I did not care for Fracas, sure other people may like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She loves the scent.</li>

            <li> I love Fracas - a classic, feminine floral scent.  This configuration is especially lovely and extremely well-priced.  It makes a great gift for yourself or someone else!</li>
            <li> If you love tuberose or ultra-feminine floral fragrance - this is for you. I&#x27;ve worn this for over 10 years and get a constant string of compliments when I wear it; my signature scent.</li>
            <li> I cannot stop smelling my wrists! This was a blind buy, but is absolutely one of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and I own many!!). It has wonderful staying power, and has a warm, comforting, and truly beautiful feminine smell. The positive reviews are spot-on. What a lovely, timeless fragrance!</li>
            <li> Buying it again never got so many compliments on a. Perfum</li>
            <li> I had only read about this fragrance prior to ordering.  Nice sample size and well&lt;br /&gt;packaged.  Really pretty scent!</li>
            <li> Very nice- what I expected.  Was a Xmas gift and had a wonderful &amp;#34;reception&amp;#34;.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Isabel</li>
            <li> It was prefect. Love the box it came in. Love the small roll on that fits in my purse so easily. Love the fact the spray bottle sits on my boyfriends dresser at his home. Love love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Strong, strong, strong scent of Gardenia.  I hate the scent of Gardenia.  But if you like it, then this is a perfume that you will love.  It is long lasting, which in my case wasn&#x27;t a good thing.  But definitely for those who favor the fragrance of Gardenia it is a perfume that lasts and will definitely give you the fragrance you like.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in good condition. Product was  exactly what it was supposed to be, no issues.</li>
            <li> Have been using this scent for yearsâ€¦love  it</li>

            <li> Love the flowery smell and the container was very nice it would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> As good as I remembered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try this perfume. Generally I hate flowery scents, but was shocked to find that not only myself, but my husband also, adored this heady tuberose perfume. The sizes were perfect for sampling. Highly recommend. I guess some scents are classics for a reason.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it but I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much again. I like gardenia scents a lot but this one is so similar to other gardenia scents that would cost far less.</li>
            <li> Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
