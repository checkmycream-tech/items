            <li>I noticed  more hair is growing out..</li>
            <li>This product, for me, works so much better than minoxidil.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say much more about this product.</li>
            <li>you just saved my ass :)</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cannot be honest about this product as I have not been using it consistently as the directions say.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost the first bottle and am not seeing any results as of yet to be honest.</li>
            <li>mostly gray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the fun part.</li>
            <li>I must be honest with you, I went through two whole orders and spend lots of money using this Product</li>
            <li>just what I&#x27;ve been trying to order from the original company, but they don&#x27;t want a debit card, they want a credit card so they can lock you in to a bunch of committments.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser is absolutely thrilled with the new growth.  </li>
            <li>: I wanted to use the product on the sides of my hair where it is thinning instead the product says that it must be used on the top of the head and that there must be a certain balding or thinning pattern that your hair is experiencing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, hair on her face!</li>
            <li>Great product, however the new pump didn&#x27;t work well,so I used the old style pump</li>
            <li>First, it does kind of work, but I think you need to be realistic in the results you&#x27;re expecting.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using this or know someone older who wants to use this... please make sure you read and understand the directions well!</li>
            <li>Even though this stuff is SUPER runny, I&#x27;m more inclined to believe this fuzzy face issue is from putting this treatment on *directly* before bed.</li>
            <li>And come to fine out now that I can order it from Amazon for so much cheaper</li>
            <li>Much better than Rogaine ,leaves hair feeling natural instead of coated.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Actually this is not a 3-piece treatment set but rather 4-piece because each box has its own medicine dropper.</li>
            <li>My hair filled in and there was new growth.  </li>
            <li>First product that seems to work.</li>
            <li>This is no miracle formula so don&#x27;t expect results on first application.  </li>
            <li>user be aware and watch for adverse problems.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s about the same length of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m losing tons of hair after shampooing and using this product the first time make it stop.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a higher percentage of monoxidile.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say whether this works better than generic minoxidil.  </li>
            <li>First of all I made a mistake ordering this product, can&#x27;t return it because this product is non returnable.</li>
            <li>The only advantage of these specialty shampoos is that they&#x27;re designed to super clean the scalp (at the risk of stripping your hair).</li>
            <li>First of all, don&#x27;t worry about ordering the whole kit.</li>
            <li>And this product really works because after using the first bottle I can see hairs sprouting in my scalp.</li>
            <li>But, she was NOT making sure it was totally dry before going to bed!</li>
            <li>This treatment kind of helps keep my hair a little longer  </li>
            <li>got credit for one bottle but really wanted two one was for my&#x27;s sister</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are not what cause hair regrowth really.</li>
            <li>she wants to continue with the minoxidil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t lose that much hair</li>
            <li>I paid to much money for this item.</li>
            <li>Keranique works really well helping to regrow hair.</li>
            <li>BUT WITH KERANIQUE I DO SEE A VERY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>This really works</li>
            <li>Just want to see if it really work.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s working my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li>Even my hairstylist has commented on how fast my hair is growing.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I have alopecia and the bald areas are growing in very well just slower than I would like.</li>
            <li>Also just to say keep in mind with any product ladies results will very.</li>
            <li>absolutely terrified of this product and would never ever buy it</li>
            <li>I am hoping that by then I will be able to wear my natural hair in public without being embarrassed.</li>
            <li>Using only two months, but my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily as it did, and seeing new growth.</li>
            <li>I did not want the shampoo and all the other trimmings, i just wanted the magic stuff...</li>
            <li>But, being older she really doesn&#x27;t want to go through that sort of beauty fuss.</li>
            <li>Of course, when you apply it, it messes any special hairdo you may have as it leaves a residue on your hair, but if your hair is worn in a simple fashion, applying this every day, twice a day, should not be a problem.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re not super acquainted with her face, you wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li>then a few family members was saying stuff like your hair is really looking thinner on top</li>
            <li>I found the products worked great, however, daily use made my hair very dry, not brittle just dry.  </li>
            <li>but my scalp was highly allergic to this.  </li>
            <li>the effects of which you can achieve by simply rinsing your hair with cool, strong black tea.</li>
            <li>In as little as one week, I experienced significantly less hair loss and my hair is growing fuller.</li>
            <li>After a year of use, I&#x27;ve finally concluded that nothing is strong enough to reverse the side effects of medicines that I must take.</li>
            <li>Has helped to increase the growth of new hair.</li>
            <li>It looks like some new growth</li>
            <li>but when I combed it all the new hair fell into the sink.  </li>
            <li>I have two new unopened if someone would like them.</li>
            <li>people inventing something new and never works.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually is growing some hair (not a lot, but some).</li>
            <li>I let my scalp heal after the first use and then tried it again a second time.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that this easy to use liquid caused my 80 year old scalp to regrow new hair,  I began seeing the new growth within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and it may not be pleasant for people with straighter or thin hair, but it was working for her!</li>
            <li>Finally found a product that really works</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply while hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I guess it is a blessing that we do have this sort of option, but this really should be a last resort!</li>
            <li>Personally, I guess it is a blessing that we do have this sort of option, but this really should be a last resort!</li>
            <li>It looks a little better than before but not exactly the way I wanted to be..</li>
            <li>Definitely helped my scalp isn&#x27;t near as visible.</li>
            <li>, this is funny and not funny at the same time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little expensive but it works great</li>
            <li>Ladies, the active ingredient in this product is Minoxidil, which is the active ingredient in Rogaine, save yourself a pile of cash and purchase generic Minoxidil, which is available at any drug store.</li>

            <li> After a year of use, I&#x27;ve finally concluded that nothing is strong enough to reverse the side effects of medicines that I must take.</li>
            <li> Has helped to increase the growth of new hair.</li>
            <li> It looks like some new growth</li>
            <li> but when I combed it all the new hair fell into the sink.  </li>
            <li> I have two new unopened if someone would like them.</li>
            <li> people inventing something new and never works.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually is growing some hair (not a lot, but some).</li>
            <li> I let my scalp heal after the first use and then tried it again a second time.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this easy to use liquid caused my 80 year old scalp to regrow new hair,  I began seeing the new growth within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and it may not be pleasant for people with straighter or thin hair, but it was working for her!</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that really works</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply while hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I guess it is a blessing that we do have this sort of option, but this really should be a last resort!</li>
            <li> Personally, I guess it is a blessing that we do have this sort of option, but this really should be a last resort!</li>
            <li> It looks a little better than before but not exactly the way I wanted to be..</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my scalp isn&#x27;t near as visible.</li>
            <li> , this is funny and not funny at the same time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little expensive but it works great</li>
            <li> Ladies, the active ingredient in this product is Minoxidil, which is the active ingredient in Rogaine, save yourself a pile of cash and purchase generic Minoxidil, which is available at any drug store.</li>
            <li> i havent used it long enough to rate it, after reading the possible side effects , i am considering not using it</li>
            <li> i see the little fuzzies (new growth) coming in.</li>
            <li> Well I have only noticed minimal results and I have been using the product for over a month now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried talking her into just going back to the castor oil, but she likes at least having black fuzz better than the slow results of thecastor oil.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have very bad hair loss, but she&#x27;s experienced a lot of thinning with age, and hair loss at the temples.</li>
            <li> Then just massage in and dry.  </li>
            <li> No new growth after almost a month.</li>
            <li> No new growth.  </li>
            <li> No new growth yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly sensitive either so am not sure what is in it that causes the reaction.</li>
            <li> You must continue use or you will begin to loose hair again.  </li>
            <li> Keranique had charged my credit card on day 30 $79.95, which is HALF the regular price.  </li>
            <li> Must affect some people worse than others, but it certainly knocked me for a loop.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, products with minoxidil have to be used continuously to maintain any hair growth you might get.</li>
            <li> I (sucker) didn&#x27;t know that when I ordered a Keranique package directly from the vendor&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I really was losing my hair, and it was looking really thin.  </li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and my daughter and my husband and myself  can feel  the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> However, one of the bottles was empty and the packing box quite damp...</li>
            <li> When I read 3 piece treatment set, I expected shampoo, serum and drops.....</li>
            <li> Absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I like the product itself but didn&#x27;t get what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> I will give the treatment at least until Oct 2015 to show major improvements.  </li>
            <li> But, there&#x27;s no way of knowing other than waiting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Keranique suggests, but they&#x27;re both about the same runny consistency</li>
            <li> The other option might be threading or the wire spring hair removal things (which can be found on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s just fuzzy on the sides of her face (the side she sleeps on being fuzzier than the other).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the small bottle with the actual drug that might work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Based on the results of the other products I did order...</li>
            <li> She started loosing hair due to age &amp; diabetic medications....</li>
            <li> so I can try other products of Keranique.</li>
            <li> (To me, this means I can appreciate the humor at least a tiny bit.)</li>
            <li> However, it will be some months down the road before results will be seen.</li>
            <li> slowing down hair loss.  </li>
            <li> (Personally, black tea rinses have worked for me when it comes to shedding.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She now has downy black hair at her temples where she had the hair loss.</li>
            <li> I discovered I needed less than a quarter size dollop of conditioner and.dime size of shampoo.</li>
            <li> But the items was not sealed tight and the shampoo and conditioner all leak out.</li>
            <li> The box from CVS at least says let the treatment dry for 2 to 3 HOURS before bed.</li>
            <li> I see a little hair growth already.</li>
            <li> even apply a little to my eyebrow</li>
            <li> Little by little</li>
            <li> I order it will be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> after being faithful to the twice a day application it did grow a little hair but it was black and stiff</li>
            <li> Have been using this 2 times everyday for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A lot of trouble.  </li>
            <li> and now I dont have to use an eyebrow pencil  everyday.  </li>
            <li> Month 1 - not sure if it is slowing down hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It really makes me mad when people say it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to help my shedding problem, but because of my hair type I&#x27;m not really able to apply castor oil every day and leave it on.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product yet.  </li>
            <li> but it was past 30 days.)  </li>
            <li> because there was not a more in depth description of how the product was to be used I am stuck with a product that I won&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;ex</li>
            <li> thus, I am stuck with this product because amazon was not more explicit in it description.</li>
            <li> but  now  no  more.  </li>
            <li> My advice, and what I&#x27;m trying to have her start doing, is apply cold cream around the hair line, let the stuff dry a little and then wash her face.</li>
            <li> that does all the hard work.</li>
            <li> The Keranique works but at a slow process for me , maybe because I have lost a of hair .</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s a slow process</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s making it worse not sure what to do</li>
            <li> I have thin slow growing hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the 3 piece set was only two regrowth drops and a dropper.  </li>
            <li> I was very slow growing</li>
            <li> it works but very slow I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to stop using it because it may have affected my b/p</li>
            <li> The nice-smelling shampoo and the scalp soothing treatment are USELESS in the hair regrowth process.</li>
            <li> and I thought it will work unfortunately</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> INSANE to charge $160, for something that I can get here at amazon, or even in my local drug store.  </li>
            <li> Keranique caused unwanted side effects, like palpitations, dizziness, cold sweaty skin and tiredness.</li>
            <li> Still very thin!</li>
            <li> Now it looks awful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible on the one hand, and I&#x27;d cry if it were my head, BUT despite what ended up happen</li>
            <li> had to stop using this product because I had nasty side effects from the drug: sweating, itching, rapid heartbeat, dizziness.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> order every month ......it works!</li>
            <li> First product that seems to work.</li>
            <li> Took my hair out...I&#x27;m pissed!</li>
            <li> This is no miracle formula so don&#x27;t expect results on first application.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and I&#x27;m beginning to see a change.  My hair has been thinning for a number of years (I&#x27;m a \\&quot;older\\&quot; person after all) and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos to voluminize and to thicken hair.  The only product that I know of and have used for thinning hair is minoxidil.  Keranique contains some minoxidil and it seems to be enough to work for me.  Even my hairstylist commented that my hair seems fuller.  Of course, when you apply it, it messes any special hairdo you may have as it leaves a residue on your hair, but if your hair is worn in a simple fashion, applying this every day, twice a day, should not be a problem.  As I understand the product info, you must keep using the product because if you stop, the hair loss will resume.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this faithfully as instructed so I cannot say if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Nobody said it could produce rapid heartbeat until I got the package. I have a heart prone to that. And I&#x27;m not allowed to return the product. Beware!</li>
            <li> Has helped to increase the growth of new hair.</li>
            <li> Was suppose to get two bottles only got one....got credit for one bottle but really wanted two one was for my&#x27;s sister</li>
            <li> Great product, however the new pump didn&#x27;t work well,so I used the old style pump I already had on hand, instead of returning it.</li>
            <li> I see a little hair growth already.</li>
            <li> Excellent product . I have thin slow growing hair. Definitely helped my scalp isn&#x27;t near as visible. Dropper makes it easy to get target areas. Cheaper than Sally&#x27;s. On 3rd purchase a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I had a allergic to this product and only used it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let user be aware and watch for adverse problems.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if it will make it grow</li>
            <li> Like the product but you have to use it all the time to see results.</li>
            <li> After an illness, I lost a lot of my hair.  Keranique helped my hair grow back over several months. It definitely works.  I was out of it for two months and I started losing hair again.  I have noticed since I started using it again, I have no hair loss in my brush.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with these products. Just hope it gets the job done. Don&#x27;t want to lose hair. Still waiting on back mailed order.</li>
            <li> Bought this..does not work al all</li>
            <li> Have been using this 2 times everyday for a few weeks then a few family members was saying stuff like your hair is really looking thinner on top before I used this it wasn&#x27;t noticeable at all accept to me! Now it looks awful it&#x27;s making it worse not sure what to do</li>
            <li> Am trying the product but it will take several months to see results as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> Ladies, the active ingredient in this product is Minoxidil, which is the active ingredient in Rogaine, save yourself a pile of cash and purchase generic Minoxidil, which is available at any drug store.</li>
            <li> Product does not regrow hair.  Have used it for 6 months now and no regrowth.</li>
            <li> Using only two months, but my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as easily as it did, and seeing new growth. Excited and pleased.</li>
            <li> Cannot be honest about this product as I have not been using it consistently as the directions say.  I am  now using it as directed so will update after a couple of months</li>
            <li> I have truly noticed a growth in my hair.  I really was losing my hair, and it was looking really thin.  The minoxil is used in hair growth products.  It is easy to apply while hair is wet or dry.  Then just massage in and dry.  I would recommend this for those who are concerned about hair loss.</li>
            <li> It seems to work for me. Easy to use. My hair dresser is impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Much better than Rogaine ,leaves hair feeling natural instead of coated. I will continue with this product</li>
            <li> I was using keranique for 6 weeks and did see a noticeable improvement.  My hair filled in and there was new growth.  Unfortunately I had to stop using it because it may have affected my b/p</li>
            <li> First of all, don&#x27;t worry about ordering the whole kit. The shampoo and conditioner are not what cause hair regrowth really. It&#x27;s the minoxidil in the runny treatment shown here that does all the hard work. The only advantage of these specialty shampoos is that they&#x27;re designed to super clean the scalp (at the risk of stripping your hair). There are a lot of shampoos on the market from dandruff shampoos to salicylic acid shampoos which can do the same job at a lower price. Some products which stimulate hair growth or reduce shedding simply contain caffeine... the effects of which you can achieve by simply rinsing your hair with cool, strong black tea. (Personally, black tea rinses have worked for me when it comes to shedding.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Keranique, my aunt is using it. And since I&#x27;m her official hair person, I&#x27;m writing this review. First, it does kind of work, but I think you need to be realistic in the results you&#x27;re expecting. It&#x27;s just minoxidil, so I got her the CVS brand to take the place of the Keranique when it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scoop: My aunts hair is 98% gray in the front and top. She doesn&#x27;t have very bad hair loss, but she&#x27;s experienced a lot of thinning with age, and hair loss at the temples. She now has downy black hair at her temples where she had the hair loss. A lot of hairs, but still very fine and downy. She used the Keranique for 4 months, and started to see results in about 2 months. With longer use of minoxidil (supposedly 8 months for best results) she *may* have thicker hair at the temples. But, there&#x27;s no way of knowing other than waiting. Just know that you may want to consider dying your hair if you&#x27;re mostly gray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the fun part. If you&#x27;re using this or know someone older who wants to use this... please make sure you read and understand the directions well! She&#x27;s been using the treatment 1 to 2 times per day every day. But, she was NOT making sure it was totally dry before going to bed! The box from CVS at least says let the treatment dry for 2 to 3 HOURS before bed. I&#x27;m not sure what Keranique suggests, but they&#x27;re both about the same runny consistency so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s about the same length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is funny and not funny at the same time. It&#x27;s horrible on the one hand, and I&#x27;d cry if it were my head, BUT despite what ended up happen she wants to continue with the minoxidil. (To me, this means I can appreciate the humor at least a tiny bit.) That&#x27;s right, hair on her face! Even though this stuff is SUPER runny, I&#x27;m more inclined to believe this fuzzy face issue is from putting this treatment on *directly* before bed. The good news is that it is downy and very fine. If she&#x27;s wearing make up and you&#x27;re not super acquainted with her face, you wouldn&#x27;t even notice it. I&#x27;m the one who plucks her chin, so I know. My advice, and what I&#x27;m trying to have her start doing, is apply cold cream around the hair line, let the stuff dry a little and then wash her face. But, being older she really doesn&#x27;t want to go through that sort of beauty fuss. The other option might be threading or the wire spring hair removal things (which can be found on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does not use this on her entire head for us to know if it in anyway helps with shedding or to prevent future hair loss. However, she used Jamaican castor oil before trying the minoxidil with results! It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and it may not be pleasant for people with straighter or thin hair, but it was working for her! It didn&#x27;t seem to help my shedding problem, but because of my hair type I&#x27;m not really able to apply castor oil every day and leave it on. She suffered through it and her regrowth (while slower than minxidil) came in matching the rest of the hair in that region -- gray and the same thickness and texture as the rest of her hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried talking her into just going back to the castor oil, but she likes at least having black fuzz better than the slow results of thecastor oil. Personally, I guess it is a blessing that we do have this sort of option, but this really should be a last resort! She hasn&#x27;t had any complaints of dizziness or palpitations, etc. She&#x27;s just fuzzy on the sides of her face (the side she sleeps on being fuzzier than the other).castor oil.

            <li> Will continue to use my hair is thicker snd can definitely tell the difference</li>
            <li> After a year of use, I&#x27;ve finally concluded that nothing is strong enough to reverse the side effects of medicines that I must take. One of which is &amp;#34;hair lost.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The Keranique works but at a slow process for me , maybe because I have lost a of hair .</li>
            <li> only been using it for a month. instructions say to give it 4 months  no sign of growth at this point</li>
            <li> It looks like some new growth</li>
            <li> This product has helped my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Well I have only noticed minimal results and I have been using the product for over a month now.</li>
            <li> After using for a year this product has given me good results. Have gotten in spray bottle last two orders and would prefer eyedropper.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this easy to use liquid caused my 80 year old scalp to regrow new hair,  I began seeing the new growth within a few weeks.  I have been using it for a year now, and could not be more satisfied. I am no longer self-conscious about my hair.</li>
            <li> This treatment kind of helps keep my hair a little longer  I don&#x27;t lose that much hair I don&#x27;t think my hair is thicker but then will see it takes time</li>
            <li> This definitely helps my hair to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been usisng for about a month now. It seems to be working but I think It&#x27;s to soon to tell. It looks a little better than before but not exactly the way I wanted to be.. Still very thin! I will keep going of course, it is a regiment and I still have one more bottle to go. Let&#x27;s give it another month.</li>
            <li> When I received my on time. But the items was not sealed tight and the shampoo and conditioner all leak out. I paid to much money for this item. I reach out to the cell and they never contacted me back. I am going to contact Amazon and take care of this matter</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t swallow the BALONEY advertising of this company. There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;new miracle&amp;#34; here as the company website claims. The actual &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; bottles of their product just contains minoxidil (generic  Rogaine) which has been OTC for several years now. I (sucker) didn&#x27;t know that when I ordered a Keranique package directly from the vendor&#x27;s website. You can buy Rogaine  treatment packs for women in big pharmacies and supermarket OTC departments for about 1/3 the cost of Keranique. The nice-smelling shampoo and the scalp soothing treatment are USELESS in the hair regrowth process. It&#x27;s the small bottle with the actual drug that might work.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using this product because I had nasty side effects from the drug: sweating, itching, rapid heartbeat, dizziness. Paid for a doctor&#x27;s visit only to learn it affects your vascular system. Minoxidil is a vasodilator, and LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE.  Must affect some people worse than others, but it certainly knocked me for a loop.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, products with minoxidil have to be used continuously to maintain any hair growth you might get. Consider that, plus the possible side-effects, if you plan to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I had seen it advertised and couldn&#x27;t  imagine that it would work but as anyone that has thinning hair knows - you will try anything.  Well it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks and what a difference!  Even my husband is impressed. I&#x27;m feeling so much better about myself!!!</li>
            <li> Actually this is not a 3-piece treatment set but rather 4-piece because each box has its own medicine dropper. And this product really works because after using the first bottle I can see hairs sprouting in my scalp. I&#x27;m just buying another set to make sure the growth of each strands continues.</li>
            <li> Keranique works really well helping to regrow hair.</li>
            <li> Keranique Hair regrowing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does increase hair growth, and is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have bee using the product for 2 years.</li>
            <li> I did my research about the product and I thought it will work unfortunately it never work at all.  I never see any improvement.  I don&#x27;t think I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE I HAD BEEN USING ANOTHER PRODUCT TO REGROW MY HAIR AND IT DID NOT WORK,BUT WITH KERANIQUE I DO SEE A VERY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE AND MY HAIR HAS GROWN BACK</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually is growing some hair (not a lot, but some).</li>
            <li> Works fine--I have been using it for some time.</li>
            <li> It has been three months since I started using the Keranique Hair Regrowth System.  At this time I see no hair growth results.</li>
            <li> a lot of warnings I had no idea about until the product arrived and was able to read the label</li>
            <li> The best!!!!  love this product  have been purchasing for several months  excellent  would recommend for every woman experiencing hair regrowth problems</li>
            <li> it gives me headache that did not go away for 5 days even though i have taken drugs to relieve the pain. I was wondering how if i could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but I know it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  This was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Keranique caused unwanted side effects, like palpitations, dizziness, cold sweaty skin and tiredness. I had to stop using it after one month.</li>
            <li> Though the kit is expensive if you have short hair you will get more than two months from a.one.month supply. I discovered I needed less than a quarter size dollop of conditioner and.dime size of shampoo. Can&#x27;t cheat on the treatment but can reorder just that product. Saw results in six weeks but.don&#x27;t quit then. Biggest drawback is leaving it on five minutes.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this treatment</li>
            <li> Excellent product.... works great i am seeing results, it thicken my hair and i am able to comb it now...great...</li>
            <li> Yes thank u. This really works I have been us using this for 3 months and I could tell the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Just want to see if it really work. and if it does then,I won&#x27;t hesitate to continue using it.Delivery of the item is great.Delivered in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I did not receive what is shown in the picture, I only received one bottle that is in the picture, and one was different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and my daughter and my husband and myself  can feel  the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now it&#x27;s a slow process but I think it&#x27;s working my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works. My dad hairs growth thicker</li>
            <li> In as little as one week, I experienced significantly less hair loss and my hair is growing fuller. Even my hairstylist has commented on how fast my hair is growing. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Have noticed increased hair growth.</li>
            <li> However, one of the bottles was empty and the packing box quite damp...I have requested replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I should not have to pay for one bottle when two were promised</li>
            <li> after being faithful to the twice a day application it did grow a little hair but it was black and stiff which was ok with me but when I combed it all the new hair fell into the sink.  In fairness to the product it said it won&#x27;t work for everyone.  I have two new unopened if someone would like them.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product yet.  I have used almost the first bottle and am not seeing any results as of yet to be honest.</li>
            <li> Have been using almost 3 years. Really works. Can go out in the sun without a hat now a my head does not burn</li>
            <li> it is good  ut to expensiv for me</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results I received.  I&#x27;ve used the product as instructed however I did not notice any additional hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have try everything and would pay any money just to find a product that would help my hear grow. I got and e-mail introducing this product. I said to myself, people inventing something new and never works. I must be honest with you, I went through two whole orders and spend lots of money using this Product and I give five stars, My hair never grew longer then a litter pass my shoulders, Today my hair is three inches from my waist. And come to fine out now that I can order it from Amazon for so much cheaper is a blessing. I was paying ordering online One hundred and seventy dollars ever two month. Go for it. Good Luck,</li>
            <li> Saw this advertised on tv.  I cannot tell you if it works or not.  After just two attempts, I had to throw it away.  (I was going to return it but it was past 30 days.)  Expensive but my scalp was highly allergic to this.  It left blisters in each place that I applied it.  I let my scalp heal after the first use and then tried it again a second time.  After just one use, same thing happened, blister rash on scalp.  I&#x27;m not overly sensitive either so am not sure what is in it that causes the reaction.</li>
            <li> Can not rate this.  I did not order this product.  Based on the results of the other products I did order...I will try this some day.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  A definite difference in hair loss.  Don&#x27;t expect Farah Fawcett hair.  You must continue use or you will begin to loose hair again.  I use the shampoo, conditioner and serum.</li>
            <li> i havent used it long enough to rate it, after reading the possible side effects , i am considering not using it</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough.  When I read 3 piece treatment set, I expected shampoo, serum and drops.....I was disappointed that the 3 piece set was only two regrowth drops and a dropper.  I should have looked closer at the description.</li>
            <li> It works!  I don&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This awesome, I have used it before, will order again</li>
            <li> A lot of trouble.  No new growth after almost a month. Probably need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> because there was not a more in depth description of how the product was to be used I am stuck with a product that I won&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;ex: I wanted to use the product on the sides of my hair where it is thinning instead the product says that it must be used on the top of the head and that there must be a certain balding or thinning pattern that your hair is experiencing. thus, I am stuck with this product because amazon was not more explicit in it description.</li>
            <li> Would rate it a zero. Absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> It really works.  Because of surgery, etc. I lost hair.  My hairdresser is absolutely thrilled with the new growth.  This has nothing to do with age.  I am in my mid 70&#x27;s and if it works for me, it should work for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Ritter</li>
            <li> l have been using this  for months now, l can see a difference in the thickness of my hair, and l will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the $3.95 30 day trial at their official site.  I wish I had looked at amazon.  After 60 days, I can start to see some hair growth &amp; I like the shampoo &amp; conditional products.  Keranique had charged my credit card on day 30 $79.95, which is HALF the regular price.  They then charged me again $79.95 on day 60.  I called &amp; they said since I did not return the product, I was on an auto-delivery system.  INSANE to charge $160, for something that I can get here at amazon, or even in my local drug store.  Make sure you look at all disclosures before buying!</li>
            <li> I like it but don&#x27;t think it is a month supply because it has to be used twice a day</li>
            <li> it&amp;#34;s just what I&#x27;ve been trying to order from the original company, but they don&#x27;t want a debit card, they want a credit card so they can lock you in to a bunch of committments.</li>
            <li> I was very slow growing but I did see so progress. it works but very slow I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I did not want the shampoo and all the other trimmings, i just wanted the magic stuff...thankyou Amazon! You rock</li>
            <li> great stuff  it&#x27;s a little expensive but it works great have been using it for about 6 months&lt;br /&gt;with noticeable improvement</li>
            <li> Girlfriend swears by this stuff as she complains about her thinning and all I do is replace it for her birthday</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> It works overnight for me, amazing product. I&#x27;m losing tons of hair after shampooing and using this product the first time make it stop.</li>
            <li> Wife loves their products.... She started loosing hair due to age &amp; diabetic medications.... Bought 2 wigs &amp; the Keranique product ... She&#x27;s never had to wear the wigs... Her hair has been growing back &amp; getting thicker.. Even her hair dresser noticed &amp; asked what she had been using...&lt;br /&gt;I feel their a bit pricey, but you know what they say... Happy wife is a happy life... so I guess I&#x27;ll just keep footing the bill... LOL</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough about it , thank you keranique and amazon</li>
            <li> Have not seen any result yet</li>
            <li> I started using Keranique hair products in Oct 2014.  The shampoo &amp; conditioner made my hair look and feel fuller.  It does not change the texture, just the look.  I found the products worked great, however, daily use made my hair very dry, not brittle just dry.  I had to oil my hair and scalp daily.  The hair re-growth treatment however, works wonderfully.  I wish it had a higher percentage of monoxidile. I use twice daily as recommended since Oct 2014.  I&#x27;m seeing a big change in my hair growth. I have alopecia and the bald areas are growing in very well just slower than I would like. I will give the treatment at least until Oct 2015 to show major improvements.  I am hoping that by then I will be able to wear my natural hair in public without being embarrassed.</li>
            <li> Awesome results with this product&lt;br /&gt;Great to use with the shampoo and conditioner. Finally found a product that really works</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use. However, it will be some months down the road before results will be seen. I will update response at that time.</li>
            <li> Month 1 - not sure if it is slowing down hair loss.  No new growth.  Month 2 - DEFINITELY slowing down hair loss.  Month 3 - switched to drugstore generic 2% minoxidil.  Happy that hair loss is 1/3 of what it used to be.  No new growth yet but I may be one of the people that needs to ride it out 5-6 months for this effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 5 months and it is working on my thinning hair.  I dont have to wear a hat or wig anymore.&lt;br /&gt;And all my friends notice my hair has volume already.  I always recommend it to my friends. Advice to go online to order.&lt;br /&gt;I even apply a little to my eyebrow and now I dont have to use an eyebrow pencil  everyday.  Before as soon as I get up in the&lt;br /&gt;morning I have to highlight my eyebrow but  now  no  more.  Little by little I noticed  more hair is growing out..&lt;br /&gt;I hope next time I order it will be a little cheaper so I can try other products of Keranique.</li>
            <li> I never tried any hair loss treatment so I can&#x27;t say whether this works better than generic minoxidil.  I can say it works.  After only about 2 weeks I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> This product, for me, works so much better than minoxidil. Rogaine or others.  At Amazon&#x27;s prices it is for me the best quality, effectiveness and cost!  Although it does course hair a bit I noticed a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and i have been using the 30 day trial and in just 2 weeks i see the little fuzzies (new growth) coming in. The shampoo and conditioner does wonders cleansing my hair without drying it out and bringing the fullness and thickness back to my hair. Only gave four stars because i want to see results after continued use. Also just to say keep in mind with any product ladies results will very. It really makes me mad when people say it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s a scam, everybody is different.</li>
            <li> First of all I made a mistake ordering this product, can&#x27;t return it because this product is non returnable. So I can&#x27;t say much more about this product. This thing is for women only.</li>
            <li> I recieved THREE droppers and one bottle of the product insted of the two bottles and one dropper as advertized!  I was going to return it but saw that it was not returnable.  I like the product itself but didn&#x27;t get what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> This product did not work. It just cost a lot with no results as guaranteed. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thank you reviewers for your stories... you just saved my ass :)&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m absolutely terrified of this product and would never ever buy it</li>
