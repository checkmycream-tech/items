    <ol>
            <li>This is the best smelling Axe there is.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for a man that sweats.</li>
            <li>and it turned out to be the best one, in my opinion</li>
            <li>Excellent fragance.</li>
            <li>Ordered it for my husband and he loved it!</li>
            <li>Great buy</li>
            <li>, i got a lot of compliments from friends on how i smelt good from this AXE</li>
            <li>got theses at a good Deal from Amazon and it arrived within 3 business days.</li>
            <li>So if your sweetie is scent-sensitive like mine, you&#x27;d probably be wise to avoid it.</li>
            <li>great deal- product works well and smells so sexy.</li>
            <li>Since AXE is no longer making this scent, I was happy to see it was still available here.  </li>
            <li>The kilo deodorant is like the body spray smells good and the women love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely effective.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own anything else AXE and wear cologne either 212 or BLEU and you never smell the deodorant.</li>
            <li>I know Axe is trying to branch out for more market share, but Kilo has been one of their most popular scents ever</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is Kilo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light.</li>
            <li>Kilo is my favorite scent on my hubby.</li>
            <li>All of the AXE products are way to overwhelming when it comes to smell.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Axe products for many years now</li>
            <li>does not give off a powerful scent and does smell good.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it, and this is a great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a very strong odor, so can&#x27;t really be used to cover up smells as well.</li>
            <li>but luckily  found this deodorant  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty neutral--kind of springlike.  </li>
            <li>A few months ago I got a great deal of some Old Spice deodorant on Costco.</li>
            <li>On top of that it really doesn&#x27;t leave your shirts with that yellow arm pit stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Axe dry is his favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>s the real deal...</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly</li>
            <li>and I still swear to this day that Axe deodorant has the longest lasting sent the will keep you with that fresh feeling all day.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have time to find a new scent.</li>
            <li>The women aren&#x27;t chasing after me but lets remember deodorant can only do so much!</li>
            <li>I have tried them all, dove, arrid, old spice etc.</li>
            <li>But I soon learned that Old Spice was too strong and irritated my skin and left that yellow arm pit stain quicker than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> All these lasted me a while, i got a lot of compliments from friends on how i smelt good from this AXE DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
            <li> A few months ago I got a great deal of some Old Spice deodorant on Costco. But I soon learned that Old Spice was too strong and irritated my skin and left that yellow arm pit stain quicker than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. So I went back to Axe Dry. Ohh how I missed this deodorant. My favorite scent is Kilo. It&#x27;s nice and light. Axe dry also never irritates my skin. On top of that it really doesn&#x27;t leave your shirts with that yellow arm pit stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got theses at a good Deal from Amazon and it arrived within 3 business days.</li>
            <li> The kilo deodorant is like the body spray smells good and the women love it that is why i only use axe products it,s the real deal...TRY IT</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband and he loved it!</li>
            <li> The women aren&#x27;t chasing after me but lets remember deodorant can only do so much! This works in the tough Summer months too.</li>
            <li> I know Axe is trying to branch out for more market share, but Kilo has been one of their most popular scents ever and now it has lost so much shelf space in brick and mortar stores it is often not available anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon.com!  The products I want to buy at a price I can afford to pay - even after shipping, which just makes it equal cost to the local store except I don&#x27;t have to stand in line.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; deodorants, this one doesn&#x27;t smell like a pack of teenaged boys at a Tool concert.  It&#x27;s actually pretty neutral--kind of springlike.  It&#x27;s definitely effective.  Overall, I love it, and this is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, my girlfriend hates the smell.  She says it&#x27;s too \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; and gives her a headache.  So if your sweetie is scent-sensitive like mine, you&#x27;d probably be wise to avoid it.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 and so far 2 were bad they wouldn&#x27;t advance when I spun the knob</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling Axe there is. Purchased for the boyfriend. I will was so sad when they no longer sold this in stores- yay for amazon!</li>
            <li> Since AXE is no longer making this scent, I was happy to see it was still available here.  I ordered a 4 pack so I&#x27;ll have time to find a new scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this locally. Kilo is my favorite scent on my hubby. Axe dry is his favorite deodorant. As long as this is offered on amazon, I&#x27;ll keep ordering.  Wonderful product for a man that sweats. A lot.</li>
            <li> I tried the kilo scent once just for the heck of it and it turned out to be the best one, in my opinion</li>
            <li> All of the AXE products are way to overwhelming when it comes to smell.  This one is subtle enough and I have been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Great buy</li>
            <li> I have been using Axe products for many years now and I still swear to this day that Axe deodorant has the longest lasting sent the will keep you with that fresh feeling all day. There&#x27;s other deodorant brands that only after a couple hours of work I could start to feel it wear off, but Axe is not the one.</li>
            <li> I do believe this item is no longer on the list to reorder on a regular basis- what a shame- great deal- product works well and smells so sexy.</li>
            <li> Too expensive they trick me not happy.</li>
            <li> This is THE only deodorant I have been using for years that keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is alright, but I would say phoenix is preferable.  It isn&#x27;t a very strong odor, so can&#x27;t really be used to cover up smells as well.</li>
            <li> I wear dress shirt and pants every day to work and the other deodorant would not stop the sweat get through my undershirt and then show on my dress shirts and that is the worse but luckily  found this deodorant  Trust me I have tried them all, dove, arrid, old spice etc. I don&#x27;t own anything else AXE and wear cologne either 212 or BLEU and you never smell the deodorant. does not give off a powerful scent and does smell good. saves me the stress. I recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Excellent fragance. Kilo. Not easy to find in stores</li>
