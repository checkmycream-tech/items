            <li> This product was recommended by my esthetician.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money at all. Tried it for a month and my scars still look the same shade</li>
            <li> I love it, works well! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have been using  for awhile my favorite,takes care all the brown spots on your face</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work . The description is a lie</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS. I have pigmentation from acne. Mine are purple/red on white skin. Using this prevents the pigment from ever occurring and definitely gets rid of pigment over time. It isn&#x27;t going to work in a week but use the whole bottle and you will notice a difference!!</li>

            <li> Works great and is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I like how it helps the overall appearance and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and starts working right away my skin looks amazing.  The dark spots are fading fast....</li>
            <li> It may task some time to see the results, but it has lightened the area&#x27;s needed. I only use it at night since it takes a bit for the serum to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Slowly but working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month morning and night and can definitely tell my dark spots are becoming more lighter. I&#x27;m excited to see how my skin will look at the end of 3 months.</li>
