            <li> but u have to press super hard to get it to work.</li>
            <li> The slight angle really helps when pushing down on your skin to remove the blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after your moisturizer has dried completely.</li>
            <li> i have black heads covering my nose and traditionally used tweezers to squeeze them out, which worked</li>
            <li> The fact is that its easier just using my fingers to remove any black or white heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for at all - just works like any other flat tip item in my household, like a bobby pin tweezers or other - bummer</li>
            <li> I tried it out and no matter how hard I pushed it just wouldn&#x27;t get any of the gunk out and just left my nose red and puffed up.  </li>
            <li> &amp; then it leaves a deep print in your skin, your skin will be red &amp; sore for at least three days.</li>
            <li> but i pretty much had to put it away because it doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> That could be just because I keep pressing harder to see if I can get it to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and All, big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter was having to go to the doctor&#x27;s office to have black heads extracted and with this tool</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get every little thing</li>
            <li> Some times, it will take a few times with applying pressure for it to pop but it will pop!     </li>
            <li> More pores are insanely clogged.</li>
            <li> u have to press so hard it is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot less painful than popping my pimples by hand as I was previously doing.</li>
            <li> It gets to the heart of the matter with busting down those nasty icky white heads.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that suffers with black heads.</li>
            <li> Neosporin is a beauty secret that prevents you from scarring.</li>
            <li> Base on the majority of other reviews</li>
            <li> It will not extract and is useless.  </li>
            <li> this thing is useless</li>
            <li> Wash with cold water.</li>
            <li> I take prescribed antibiotics for acne as well, but the clogged pores are too bad for the medicine to work.</li>
            <li> Get ALL the gunk out, no matter how BAD it hurts.</li>
            <li> Popping those nasty pimples that are about to burst without leaving scars on your face...</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as expected and the price is really good. Nice addition to the \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; aresenal. Like the fact the extractor procedure is practically painless and easy.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same one for the last five years before it finally broke last month. I immediately purchased a new one because it makes it so much easier for me to get rid of blackheads!</li>
            <li> Essentially all the extractors are pretty much the same. I just happen to buy this on a whim years ago from amazon.com and I still have it years later! It works just as good as it did several years ago. It gets to the heart of the matter with busting down those nasty icky white heads. Make sure that you have a steady hand while apply pressure. Some times, it will take a few times with applying pressure for it to pop but it will pop!     A good trick is to wash your face first and exfoliate ([[ASIN:B000AA9HGS St Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control 6 oz.]] is GREAT and its cheap) with your skin being soft from being wet and the exfoliation the pimple will burst more easily. You will see the puss than the blood. If you don&#x27;t see blood then its not over just yet! Need to apply more pressure! Be sure to put a warm/hot rag over the area, then alcohol it, moisturize try [[ASIN:B000052YJM Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action Moisturizer, Oil-Free, 4 fl oz (120 ml)]]and then apply [[ASIN:B001ECQ778 Neosporin Original First Aid Antibiotic Ointment, 1-Ounce Tube]] after your moisturizer has dried completely. Neosporin is a beauty secret that prevents you from scarring. I even apply it on my face during the day. If you dab it on neatly you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Does what it needs to do, I have no complaints about it! Popping those nasty pimples that are about to burst without leaving scars on your face... always a win!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;When popping a pimple that&#x27;s ready to be popped, wet a facial cloth towel, heat it up and put it on the area. To prep the pimple and face. Then grab a sewing needle and sanitize it over an open flame on your stove for a couple of seconds. Let it cool off and knick your pimple, grab your skin care tool and push down... It&#x27;s a great way to pop those suckers!</li>
            <li> More pores are insanely clogged. I used an exfoliator every day, but it can&#x27;t get deep. I take prescribed antibiotics for acne as well, but the clogged pores are too bad for the medicine to work. After two days of using this thing, my medicine can finally work. My skin is the best looking it has been since middle school.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product - it is easy to use, quick, efficient, no explanation necessary and very effective. It&#x27;s also a lot less painful than popping my pimples by hand as I was previously doing.</li>
            <li> The amount of pressure you have to use with this tool..you will cry. literally. u have to press so hard it is ridiculous. &amp; then it leaves a deep print in your skin, your skin will be red &amp; sore for at least three days. I guess if all that pain is worth it to you guys, go right ahead lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this does a thing for the blackheads on my nose, but it does pop tiny zits. In my opinion, it&#x27;s better to leave the tiny zits it can get alone (which is hard for a serial popper like me!).</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed. Easy to use. Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> This tool is effective, if you use it right. 1. Wash the tool first, and warm it. 2. Wash your face with warm water. 3. Take a cloth with heated water and warm the white head. 4. Once it&#x27;s warmed, take the tool to it and pop it. 5. Get ALL the gunk out, no matter how BAD it hurts. You will not be solving anything if you leave the gunk in. 6. Cleanse once more, making sure to get the popped spots good. 7. Wash with cold water. 8. Dry with CLEAN cloth. 9. Moisturize, or add on any product. Ta-da.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tool like the one an esthician uses.  This extractor does not work.  It will not extract and is useless.  It is nothing like what the professionals use.</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME.  I normally get facials and the tool my esthetician uses is not as effective.  The slight angle really helps when pushing down on your skin to remove the blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after a hot shower so my pores are more open and they seem to just clear out with little pressure and a lot less pain.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get every little thing but it works so its not a bad buy the price is good so it will do</li>
            <li> It does the job and that&#x27;s all I ever wanted...thanks guys!</li>
            <li> i have black heads covering my nose and traditionally used tweezers to squeeze them out, which worked okay but prompted me to look for alternatives, so I found this.  Base on the majority of other reviews, I thought this would be a more proper, less irritating, and all-around better alternative.  I tried it out and no matter how hard I pushed it just wouldn&#x27;t get any of the gunk out and just left my nose red and puffed up.  I then used my tweezers and it did the job.  this thing is useless</li>
            <li> There was an impressive amount of packaging for a fairly small item.  The tool is sturdy and the instructions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> it did not work well for me, delivery was quick but i pretty much had to put it away because it doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> It broke a week after I got it. Not worth it..spend the extra money and find one that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Good value. Love the brand! Stores well. Comes with well versed directions as to the uses of the product. All around A + !!</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought it to get out my blackheads and it works great. Very sturdy and strong. Didn&#x27;t rust and seems very well made. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> So glad that I found this product! make sure to use this only after you get out of a hot shower or after you steam your face or you risk damaging your skin!!! I wear coverup on the weekdays and this tool helps keep my pores clean and small. it makes taking care of pimples more sanitary. Always remember to clean with hot soapy water and toner after every use!  my skin care routine: I wash my makeup off, steam my pores for 5 minutes (face over bowl with hot water and towel over my head if I dont take a hot shower), use tool (have tissue with you to clean after each use as to not spread gunk to other pores) then I gently wash my face one more time, use toner (helps shrink pores then moisturize. People always tell me I look younger than I am &#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> Product works well but u have to press super hard to get it to work. Excellent tool for blackheads in the ears though if u can stand a lil pain.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product. It just sits in my drawer now. In fact I will most likely throw it away. It does not work. That&#x27;s all I have to say, pretty simple. I have tried every thing. I moisten my face, steam up the room, put a hot cloth on my face. The fact is that its easier just using my fingers to remove any black or white heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also hurts. That could be just because I keep pressing harder to see if I can get it to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and All, big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Revlon had a much thinner and better blackhead remove that came with a magnifying mirror. I just cannot find it in stores.</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter was having to go to the doctor&#x27;s office to have black heads extracted and with this tool she does it herself.  Extremely easy to us. I would recommend this to anyone that suffers with black heads.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Save your money and find something else.  I threw mine in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for at all - just works like any other flat tip item in my household, like a bobby pin tweezers or other - bummer</li>
