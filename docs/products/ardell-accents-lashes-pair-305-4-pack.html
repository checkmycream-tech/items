            <li>I love Ardell lashes.</li>

            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>love them both.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>my boyfriend noticed right away and he loved them.</li>
            <li>Great lashes, perfect for everyday wear or for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>The perfect touch of everyday sexy!</li>
            <li>I do not wear makeup very often so it is important to me to have an easy addition that looks great.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re half-lashes, I find them a lot more comfortable than the full ones.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>You can easily see the band.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>You know, where everyone just tells you that you look great without pin-pointing what is different. :)</li>
            <li>They have a durable band which makes them easily cleanable and reusable.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, my hair stylist recommended using Duo waterproof adhesive after telling her that the glue I use doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times, they are easier to use then full lashes.  </li>
            <li>In my case, it&#x27;s better to put on a full set of lashes</li>
            <li>I have been wearing lashes for about 2 years now and these are the best -hands down.</li>
            <li>They are more for a fun</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t purchase unless you&#x27;ve seen them in store and are comfortable with their size.</li>
            <li>I love the Accent line from Ardell and this was a good price for a 4 pack when I was going away and forgot them on my last shopping trip . . .</li>
            <li>These are a bit more dramatic than I was expecting, but they are very good quality, and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Easier to put on &amp; hotter looking than a full lash.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that looked natural and like my own.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the full lashes and they make me feel like I have spiders sitting on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>But I switch it up and sometimes wear the 120&#x27;s, a full lash in this brand as well:</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I cannot handle the full lashes; I just can&#x27;t seem to get them both on correctly.</li>
            <li>And its pretty easy to put on.</li>
            <li>For someone who has never worn falsies before, these were the easiest and most realistic lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to quickly add these and give the makeup a little more flare.</li>
            <li>however, once they were on, they looked very pretty.</li>
            <li>HOT!</li>
            <li>HOT!</li>
            <li>These really do the trick!!</li>
            <li>The price was right and they came quickly.  </li>
            <li>so you get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>Very economical; I intend to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>these lashes are super hot, they give you a cat eye effect in an effortless way.</li>
            <li>Its just the right amount of accent and thickness.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and natural looking (they are &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34; lashes).  </li>
            <li>I work for a well-known world-wide makeup company that sells their own as well, and I personally prefer Ardell&#x27;s lashes on the whole when I need to buy them for myself.</li>
            <li>These are the only kind I really wear.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping...</li>
            <li>They work really well for me and look much more natural.</li>
            <li>Great to find a deal on amazon for a lot of them as apposed to buying several individual.</li>
            <li>looks natural and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these I would give them a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>in my point of view these are much easier to apply than the full lashes , they make life so much simpler.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D; when you remove the lashes, remove the glue off the end.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; use a makeup applicator comb which you normaly use for your eyebrows and use it to comb the hair and remove any excess mascara if you have applied more for extra</li>
            <li>These are the first lashes I use</li>
            <li>not really an fake eyelashes gal</li>
            <li>definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li>They really look natural and go on so easy.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to get a full strip of lashes on and looking natural, so when I saw these in the local Walgreens, I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for a night out and for fun.</li>
            <li>And also this product seems pretty cheap cuz at the ends of the eyelashes you can see the white glue points</li>
            <li>they make you have a exotic look to your eye and are super easy to put on and only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li>They provide that &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look and are much more comfortable to wear than a full strip of false lashes.</li>
            <li>so these little halfsies are amazing.</li>
            <li>Very luxe.</li>
            <li>my lashes longer did not make  too real looking.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These are so much easier to wear and put on.</li>
            <li>I really like that you don&#x27;t feel them once the glue dries.</li>
            <li>I really like the look of these eyelashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this shipment, there was so much glue holding lashes on the right eye that  3 pairs are ruined so far out of 6.</li>
            <li>I have had Ardell lashes that looked more real, but at the same time added more thickness in the past.</li>
            <li>People just stare at me at work and cannot tell what I have done different but it is a very positive thing!</li>
            <li>They make my eyes appear seriously seductive, very sexy, sultry and just overall HOT!</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist, I&#x27;ve come across my fair share of false lashes.</li>
            <li>I love these little babies, they look so natural yet make a world of difference!</li>
            <li>For me, this kind of defeats the purpose of false lashes, as I don&#x27;t want to wear masacara, but I still really appreciate the look when all makeup is on.</li>
            <li>i am a makeup artist and even i dont really want to always have to sit down and put on a full lash.</li>
            <li>They look very natural.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes and I usually pay $6.00 for one pair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, subtle and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I now buy the regular full strip lashes (I like Ardell 124) and cut them in half, thus getting 2 for the price of 1;)</li>
            <li>These eyelashes look so natural on my eyes,  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t look natural and were not like tips I had hoped to buy.</li>
            <li>People can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing them because they look natural.</li>
            <li>They automatically change your look while looking all natural.</li>
            <li>They look really natural.</li>
            <li>I like these, but they really don&#x27;t look natural, unless you have naturally long lashes.</li>
            <li>So wearing the full ones don&#x27;t work for me and cutting them to fit is a disaster.</li>
            <li>but these are so natural i like how simple they are.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a dramatic look you may want to double the lashes.</li>
            <li>Was disappointing at first,  but now like them fine.</li>
            <li>I bought accents thinking it&#x27;d look more natural than other false lashes I&#x27;ve worn.</li>

            <li> not really an fake eyelashes gal</li>
            <li> definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> They really look natural and go on so easy.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a full strip of lashes on and looking natural, so when I saw these in the local Walgreens, I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for a night out and for fun.</li>
            <li> And also this product seems pretty cheap cuz at the ends of the eyelashes you can see the white glue points</li>
            <li> they make you have a exotic look to your eye and are super easy to put on and only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> They provide that &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look and are much more comfortable to wear than a full strip of false lashes.</li>
            <li> so these little halfsies are amazing.</li>
            <li> Very luxe.</li>
            <li> my lashes longer did not make  too real looking.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are so much easier to wear and put on.</li>
            <li> I really like that you don&#x27;t feel them once the glue dries.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of these eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this shipment, there was so much glue holding lashes on the right eye that  3 pairs are ruined so far out of 6.</li>
            <li> I have had Ardell lashes that looked more real, but at the same time added more thickness in the past.</li>
            <li> People just stare at me at work and cannot tell what I have done different but it is a very positive thing!</li>
            <li> They make my eyes appear seriously seductive, very sexy, sultry and just overall HOT!</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I&#x27;ve come across my fair share of false lashes.</li>
            <li> I love these little babies, they look so natural yet make a world of difference!</li>
            <li> For me, this kind of defeats the purpose of false lashes, as I don&#x27;t want to wear masacara, but I still really appreciate the look when all makeup is on.</li>
            <li> i am a makeup artist and even i dont really want to always have to sit down and put on a full lash.</li>
            <li> They look very natural.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes and I usually pay $6.00 for one pair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft, subtle and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I now buy the regular full strip lashes (I like Ardell 124) and cut them in half, thus getting 2 for the price of 1;)</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look so natural on my eyes,  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t look natural and were not like tips I had hoped to buy.</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing them because they look natural.</li>
            <li> They automatically change your look while looking all natural.</li>
            <li> They look really natural.</li>
            <li> I like these, but they really don&#x27;t look natural, unless you have naturally long lashes.</li>
            <li> So wearing the full ones don&#x27;t work for me and cutting them to fit is a disaster.</li>
            <li> but these are so natural i like how simple they are.</li>
            <li> If you want more of a dramatic look you may want to double the lashes.</li>
            <li> Was disappointing at first,  but now like them fine.</li>
            <li> I bought accents thinking it&#x27;d look more natural than other false lashes I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li> they instantly create a flirty look for ur eyes, i purchased 4 packs that come with 8 pairs of lashes, i only hope that they carry it in larger quantity with bigger discounts, that way i will wear a new one everyday and will never run out.</li>
            <li> These happen to be my favorites because they provide just the right drama and a little extra flare at the outside of the eye without weighing my lids down.</li>
            <li> Next time I will purchase a lash that is long for the entire lash</li>
            <li> these are a little more heavy than the ones I use for just everyday.  </li>
            <li> , otherwise it looks really obvious (just imagine if you only put mascara on the second half of you lashes).</li>
            <li> The lashes were a lot bigger and darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> As long as the service &amp; product stay this way, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have short and not-so-lucious lashes, so if I put these in, it&#x27;s pretty obvious where my lashes end and the fake start.</li>
            <li> so i find that in general, they are a little tricky to put on.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with, but I found that only making half</li>
            <li> this is my first time using false lashes</li>
            <li> But a regular set and cut them down if you just want accents.</li>
            <li> With these being only half the length, it makes it a lot easier to put on.</li>
            <li> In order for them to look natural or at least blend with my lashes</li>
            <li> It doesnt make me look like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked to remove the thick layer of clear glue that went halfway down lashes.</li>
            <li> That being said, they&#x27;re too small for the WILD costume effect I usually like lashes.</li>
            <li> Full fake lashes always feel heavy on my eyes, these dont!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them at least 5 times and I still have yet to open my other 3 packs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dramatic without being too over the top and obviously fake looking.</li>
            <li> I have lots of Ardell # 308 lashes and other half lashes..</li>
            <li> They felt uncomfortable and did not look like real hair.</li>
            <li> and I do think it looks odd if you don&#x27;t apply a bit of mascara to your inside lashes</li>
            <li> These lashes did blend into my lashes after I trimmed the longest part of the outer edges off slightly.</li>
            <li> I have used these about 8 times before work and it takes about 3 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they insist over putting the hair so tight.</li>
            <li> They did thicken my outer lashes a little bit though.</li>
            <li> I re use them by soaking them in a little bit of sudsy water overnight to remove the glue.  </li>
            <li> Looks dramatic but yet natural on small eyes like mine.</li>
            <li> They hold up and I can get a few wears out of them.</li>
            <li> I now have trouble leaving the house without them</li>
            <li> They are very thick and dark black</li>
            <li> They look a little too thick for my eyes.</li>
            <li> &quot; They give the extra pizzaz without looking like you are wearing fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered 12 pairs and the glue is inconsistent throughout hopefully no more pairs will be ruined.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are small.</li>
            <li> the way, just a small feedback</li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand of accent lashes in the past, but one day I didn&#x27;t want to go out to buy them.</li>
            <li> so I have not had the chance to try these though I am not sure if I would try them.</li>
            <li> And do not be afraid to trim them if you feel they are a bit too long.</li>
            <li> I would have to put a tremendous amount of mascara on my lashes which will cause them to look clumpy and nasty looking .</li>
            <li> they do not look fake and they stay on for a few days</li>
            <li> My lashes are very short and unnoticeable usually and i hate wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> Like drag queen fake!</li>
            <li> They are absolutely absurd for \\&quot;accent\\&quot; lashes--huge and thick and ridiculously long and clearly very fake.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just a dumb size...</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are thin from having thyroid problems and these have been a life saver.  </li>
            <li> when you&#x27;re wearing false lashes, you never want it to look like you&#x27;re wearing falsies, and have spider eyes like the kardashians.</li>
            <li> horrible at putting on regular false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They look sooooo fake.</li>
            <li> They give your lashes a boost without looking fake.</li>
            <li> but if you want something fancy these are very dramatic.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i am a makeup artist and even i dont really want to always have to sit down and put on a full lash. so these little halfsies are amazing. they make you have a exotic look to your eye and are super easy to put on and only takes a few seconds. i love these and will continues to buy them!!</li>
            <li> arrived in perfect condition. this is my first time using false lashes so i find that in general, they are a little tricky to put on. however, once they were on, they looked very pretty. my boyfriend noticed right away and he loved them.</li>
            <li> The lashes were a lot bigger and darker than I expected. These lashes are not for a &amp;#34;natural&#x27; look but if you want something fancy these are very dramatic. They do not come with glue and no application tweezers so beware if you do not have any beforehand. You will just get the lashes.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite accent lashes! They look very natural. Sometimes I double them up with a set of wispies for a fuller look.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look so natural on my eyes,  i always wear them before going out. they instantly create a flirty look for ur eyes, i purchased 4 packs that come with 8 pairs of lashes, i only hope that they carry it in larger quantity with bigger discounts, that way i will wear a new one everyday and will never run out.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make me look like a drag queen. Looks dramatic but yet natural on small eyes like mine. And its pretty easy to put on.</li>
            <li> For someone who has never worn falsies before, these were the easiest and most realistic lashes.  I would highly recommend for a night out and for fun.</li>
            <li> Needs to have the hair spaced out more. I don&#x27;t know why they insist over putting the hair so tight. You can easily see the band.</li>
            <li> looks natural and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important. when you&#x27;re wearing false lashes, you never want it to look like you&#x27;re wearing falsies, and have spider eyes like the kardashians. it&#x27;s soft, subtle and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  Easier to put on &amp; hotter looking than a full lash.  The price was right and they came quickly.  As long as the service &amp; product stay this way, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Love these :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m horrible at putting on regular false eyelashes. But these are a breeze &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love being able to quickly add these and give the makeup a little more flare. I do not wear makeup very often so it is important to me to have an easy addition that looks great.</li>
            <li> just what we needed for dance competition season!</li>
            <li> Love these corner lashes. Very luxe. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect length and shape to look \\&quot;naturally glamourous.\\&quot; They give the extra pizzaz without looking like you are wearing fake eye lashes. You know, where everyone just tells you that you look great without pin-pointing what is different. :)</li>
            <li> I use these with the Ardell glue and I quite like them. They are very thick and dark black and I do think it looks odd if you don&#x27;t apply a bit of mascara to your inside lashes, otherwise it looks really obvious (just imagine if you only put mascara on the second half of you lashes). For me, this kind of defeats the purpose of false lashes, as I don&#x27;t want to wear masacara, but I still really appreciate the look when all makeup is on. You can&#x27;t beat the look with string cat-eye liner, these lashes, and a swipe of mascara on the inner lashes. It&#x27;s a beautiful look. Quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and natural looking (they are &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34; lashes).  Very economical; I intend to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. They didn&#x27;t look natural and were not like tips I had hoped to buy. Looked very cheap when I got them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times, they are easier to use then full lashes.  I was very thrilled to find them sold in a pack of four!</li>
            <li> I bought accents thinking it&#x27;d look more natural than other false lashes I&#x27;ve worn. They look sooooo fake. Like drag queen fake!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with, but I found that only making half my lashes longer did not make  too real looking.  Next time I will purchase a lash that is long for the entire lash</li>
            <li> I love these lashes and I usually pay $6.00 for one pair.  The pack of four was a great deal and it arrived on time and intact.</li>
            <li> Love these demi lashes.  They are perfect especially during the day. People can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing them because they look natural.</li>
            <li> They hold up and I can get a few wears out of them.</li>
            <li> The perfect touch of everyday sexy!</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I&#x27;ve come across my fair share of false lashes. I work for a well-known world-wide makeup company that sells their own as well, and I personally prefer Ardell&#x27;s lashes on the whole when I need to buy them for myself. These happen to be my favorites because they provide just the right drama and a little extra flare at the outside of the eye without weighing my lids down. They have a durable band which makes them easily cleanable and reusable. I now own 5 pairs of these and am thrilled with the results every time I use them. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These lashes did blend into my lashes after I trimmed the longest part of the outer edges off slightly. They felt uncomfortable and did not look like real hair. They did thicken my outer lashes a little bit though. I have had Ardell lashes that looked more real, but at the same time added more thickness in the past. I will not be repurchasing these.</li>
            <li> These have lasted me a while. I use one pair then I remove the tacky glue and leave them to float in a bath or alcohol to disinfect them. I&#x27;ve used them at least 5 times and I still have yet to open my other 3 packs. I get a lot of compliments. I like to wear these at the outer corners of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these I would give them a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;They look gorgeous on. Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;However, this shipment, there was so much glue holding lashes on the right eye that  3 pairs are ruined so far out of 6. Nothing worked to remove the thick layer of clear glue that went halfway down lashes. I ordered 12 pairs and the glue is inconsistent throughout hopefully no more pairs will be ruined.  It is a shame because they look so nice when on.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not vey flexible. But a regular set and cut them down if you just want accents.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all of the time when I wear these. I mostly wear these on nights out. They make my eyes appear seriously seductive, very sexy, sultry and just overall HOT! HOT! HOT! Never discontinue these, Ardell! I LOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEE! them. I place a HUGE! emphasis on LOVE. ;-)</li>
            <li> Always my fav lashes for cat eye :)</li>
            <li> These are the only kind I really wear. I love them. My eyes are small. So wearing the full ones don&#x27;t work for me and cutting them to fit is a disaster. And forget about the 1 by 1 method. These are so much easier to wear and put on.</li>
            <li> Love the lashes! They provide that &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look and are much more comfortable to wear than a full strip of false lashes.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Super fast shipping... Excellent product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like these, but they really don&#x27;t look natural, unless you have naturally long lashes. They are more for a fun Halloween or dance look.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a full strip of lashes on and looking natural, so when I saw these in the local Walgreens, I decided to give them a try. They work really well for me and look much more natural. I now have trouble leaving the house without them bacause I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;done\\&quot;. I have one tip for anyone else who loves these...I now buy the regular full strip lashes (I like Ardell 124) and cut them in half, thus getting 2 for the price of 1;)</li>
            <li> Great for daytime wear. If you want more of a dramatic look you may want to double the lashes. They ate very light, feels like you aren&#x27;t even wearing lashes.</li>
            <li> Bought them before, easy to apply and affordable!</li>
            <li> these lashes are super hot, they give you a cat eye effect in an effortless way. in my point of view these are much easier to apply than the full lashes , they make life so much simpler. if you use them carefuly and apply them in the correct way you can reuse them also  just do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; when you remove the lashes, remove the glue off the end.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; use a makeup applicator comb which you normaly use for your eyebrows and use it to comb the hair and remove any excess mascara if you have applied more for extra drama.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; reapply the glue and go ahead and reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the way, just a small feedback, i dont remove my lashes, i keep them for one week on using the duo eyelash glue, i dont wash my eyes, instead i remove any makeup or eyeshadow by using wipes, this helps prolong the usage of the lashes and keeps you at a low maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck!  you will love it! i will definatly repurchase!</li>
            <li> these are a little more heavy than the ones I use for just everyday.  I would use just at night</li>
            <li> This would work best for someone that already has a pretty good set of lashes on their face. I have short and not-so-lucious lashes, so if I put these in, it&#x27;s pretty obvious where my lashes end and the fake start. In my case, it&#x27;s better to put on a full set of lashes so I have uniform coverage.</li>
            <li> Perfect lashes. These are the first lashes I use and I love them. They automatically change your look while looking all natural.</li>
            <li> My fav day off lashes. I have small eyes so lashes fit perfectly on just the edge to give that uplifted look. Please don&#x27;t stop making these!</li>
            <li> They look great!  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and take them off.  They make your eyes look beautiful cat eyes!</li>
            <li> i love these. not really an fake eyelashes gal but these are so natural i like how simple they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand of accent lashes in the past, but one day I didn&#x27;t want to go out to buy them. I thought I&#x27;d try these from Ardell. They are absolutely absurd for \\&quot;accent\\&quot; lashes--huge and thick and ridiculously long and clearly very fake. I like to wear lashes on an almost every day basis, but these are for costume nights only. So, I used up a couple pairs during halloween season, and the rest will have to stay in storage until next year. That being said, they&#x27;re too small for the WILD costume effect I usually like lashes. They&#x27;re just a dumb size...don&#x27;t purchase unless you&#x27;ve seen them in store and are comfortable with their size. I still gave them two stars because they did stay on and work as they were supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have lots of Ardell # 308 lashes and other half lashes..so I have not had the chance to try these though I am not sure if I would try them. They look a little too thick for my eyes. In order for them to look natural or at least blend with my lashes I would have to put a tremendous amount of mascara on my lashes which will cause them to look clumpy and nasty looking .</li>
            <li> Love Love these lashes they are my favorite they do not look fake and they stay on for a few days so you get your monies worth.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I have been wearing them for a while and will continue.  No one can tell they aren&#x27;t mine. They last forever too. They really look natural and go on so easy.  I love them..my eyelashes are thin from having thyroid problems and these have been a life saver.  I wanted something that looked natural and like my own.  These work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great lashes, perfect for everyday wear or for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> With these being only half the length, it makes it a lot easier to put on. They add a lot of volume, and great for people, like me, who have the almond shaped eyes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great for beginners! I have been wearing lashes for about 2 years now and these are the best -hands down. They give your lashes a boost without looking fake. Its just the right amount of accent and thickness. I really like that you don&#x27;t feel them once the glue dries. I have tried the full lashes and they make me feel like I have spiders sitting on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Love these. They look really natural.</li>
            <li> I love the Accent line from Ardell and this was a good price for a 4 pack when I was going away and forgot them on my last shopping trip . . . arrived in a day so I can continue to be fancy.</li>
            <li> I love Ardell lashes. These came quickly and are beautiful! Make sure you have eyelash glue as these are not stick on :) Good luck and happy lashing!</li>
            <li> Sometime I want to just make my eye look brighter and fuller. These really do the trick!! I&#x27;ve already ordered a dozen of these and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of these eyelashes. They&#x27;re dramatic without being too over the top and obviously fake looking. Since they&#x27;re half-lashes, I find them a lot more comfortable than the full ones.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> These are a bit more dramatic than I was expecting, but they are very good quality, and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and I have medium amount of eyelashes and they are medium lengths too. This product is good for people with longer and fuller eyelashes. It&#x27;s too obvious on me. And also this product seems pretty cheap cuz at the ends of the eyelashes you can see the white glue points so when you put eyeliner and place the lashes, the white dots are visible.</li>
            <li> These Andrea lashes good, but have heavier strip. I purchased duo adhesive and had good results.  Was disappointing at first,  but now like them fine.</li>
            <li> My favorite....  Been using these for a million years.  Love.</li>
            <li> I swear by these lashes! Only ones that I buy. Great to find a deal on amazon for a lot of them as apposed to buying several individual. My lashes are very short and unnoticeable usually and i hate wearing mascara. so instead whenever I go out I simply put these lashes on. &amp; they are very comfortable to wear all day or all night. Full fake lashes always feel heavy on my eyes, these dont! definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  Did you know Marilyn Monroe wore half-lash, corner lashes ?  That was her look and her preference.  I love these.  But I switch it up and sometimes wear the 120&#x27;s, a full lash in this brand as well: love them both.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I cannot handle the full lashes; I just can&#x27;t seem to get them both on correctly. I have also used the individual lashes but that is so time consuming. I love these little babies, they look so natural yet make a world of difference! People just stare at me at work and cannot tell what I have done different but it is a very positive thing! Easy to apply, my hair stylist recommended using Duo waterproof adhesive after telling her that the glue I use doesn&#x27;t hold. I have used these about 8 times before work and it takes about 3 minutes or less. I re use them by soaking them in a little bit of sudsy water overnight to remove the glue.  And do not be afraid to trim them if you feel they are a bit too long.</li>
            <li> I love it Thank you Good product</li>
