            <li>Color is great .</li>
            <li>very nice just received it</li>
            <li>great color perfect for any season and goes with most complexions</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Very nice color dries to a nice matte.</li>
            <li>i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the color!</li>
            <li>love this color!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Color is nice</li>
            <li>I love the color and smell.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>Really like this, great buy</li>
            <li>Still okay though.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>In love with this formula.</li>
            <li>but I mix it with a matte lipstick that is close in color so as to give it more staying power.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love anything from NYX</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>As a girl who is a,ways in the makeup loop I strongly suggest that you should buy this product.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good but the one I receive was maybe 1/4th full and very clumped up</li>
            <li>Like the color, the consistency and the it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>this company rocks goes on smoothly just what i wanted i will buy again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more pink than it looks pictured, it&#x27;s more of a Barbie color, but if you put just the right amount on, not too much, and then blot it, it looks great!</li>
            <li>Make sure you mostorize because this will settle into lines other than that good lip cream</li>
            <li>It goes on like butter than it turns into a lips stain that lasts all night and day, perfect for those transitions in between working girl and hard rocker.</li>
            <li>Buildable, long lasting, good shade range just purchased more as we speak!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy wasn&#x27;t what I expected very disputed</li>
            <li>I love the soft matte lip cream.</li>
            <li>Very pretty pink, I love it!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t even look like the exact color in the picture.</li>
            <li>Pretty creamy but not to where its sticky like a gloss.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great nude shade for anyone that wants to try a soft shade of pink.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft shade, its very pretty</li>
            <li>: use a little other wise when it dries it looks like you dumped you lips in paint and then went out:)</li>
            <li>Makes lips dry so you need so.ething to put over top or under it.</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cotton candy pink which is the shade I was looking for. :)</li>
            <li>so much fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Obviously if you&#x27;re eating and drinking a lot with it on throughout the day you might need to re-apply it occasionally, but it really does stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li>just a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>like it was old and used..very sketchy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to apply chapstick first before applying, that way your lips won&#x27;t be too dry.</li>
            <li>if you want to add moisture to it since it&#x27;s matte, I recommend some Vaseline or just regular clear Chapstick will do.</li>

            <li> I got such a dark pink it doesn&#x27;t even look like the exact color in the picture. ðŸ˜’</li>
            <li> Got here fast. I love the color and smell. It&#x27;s a cotton candy pink which is the shade I was looking for. :)</li>
            <li> i use this for nights out because i don&#x27;t have to reapply lipstick over and over. really good lip cream came before estimated delivery and arrived in perfect condition i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very pretty pink, I love it!</li>
            <li> Like the color, the consistency and the it applies smoothly. The only thing I had a problem with is the way the applicator is, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get enough product out.</li>
            <li> Very nice color dries to a nice matte. Make sure you mostorize because this will settle into lines other than that good lip cream</li>
            <li> I love the soft matte lip cream. It doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it lasts all day.</li>

            <li> soft, pretty but natural pink, can be worn alone or as a base for a gloss. Really like this, great buy</li>
            <li> Pretty creamy but not to where its sticky like a gloss. But I got the sydney shade and its pinker than the picture. I thought it would be a sheer baby pink but its darker. Still okay though. I love it. Its just what I needed for an everyday lip color!</li>
            <li> Idk. The product itself is good but the one I receive was maybe 1/4th full and very clumped up like it was old and used..very sketchy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy wasn&#x27;t what I expected very disputed</li>
            <li> I believed to have longer</li>
            <li> Makes lips dry so you need so.ething to put over top or under it. I just use regular chap stick. Color is great .</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I waited so long to try the lip creams. In love with this formula. Buildable, long lasting, good shade range just purchased more as we speak!</li>
            <li> Color is nice but I mix it with a matte lipstick that is close in color so as to give it more staying power. I love the color! Thanks.</li>
            <li> love this color! it&#x27;s a lot more pink than it looks pictured, it&#x27;s more of a Barbie color, but if you put just the right amount on, not too much, and then blot it, it looks great! if you want to add moisture to it since it&#x27;s matte, I recommend some Vaseline or just regular clear Chapstick will do. even gloss if you like shine.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great color and is moisturizing too!!  Usually get it at Nordstrom Rack for $7 so was definitely cheaper!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love anything from NYX but I&#x27;ve never seen or tried anything like this before. It&#x27;s like a creamy lip gloss that isn&#x27;t sticky, and then it dries about two minutes later acting as a matte lipstick. It stays on EXTREMELY well. Obviously if you&#x27;re eating and drinking a lot with it on throughout the day you might need to re-apply it occasionally, but it really does stay on pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t even come off if you kiss someone! Not for me at least. I would recommend to apply chapstick first before applying, that way your lips won&#x27;t be too dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on like butter than it turns into a lips stain that lasts all night and day, perfect for those transitions in between working girl and hard rocker. As a girl who is a,ways in the makeup loop I strongly suggest that you should buy this product. Tip: use a little other wise when it dries it looks like you dumped you lips in paint and then went out:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money and it&#x27;s very small .I don&#x27;t know if it was just this lipstick but I won&#x27;t be buying anymore matte lip cream</li>
            <li> This is a very soft shade, its very pretty and it&#x27;s a great nude shade for anyone that wants to try a soft shade of pink. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I will be buying more</li>
