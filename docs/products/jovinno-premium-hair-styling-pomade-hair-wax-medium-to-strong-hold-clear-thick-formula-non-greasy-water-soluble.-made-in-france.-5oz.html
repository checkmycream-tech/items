            <li>They all offer a much superior hold, and wash out much easier than Jovinno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to wash out with just water as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 20 high end hair styling products, and this one is easily the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>and it holds just fine like suavecito.</li>
            <li>Also, this product is huge, twice to three times the size of others.</li>
            <li>That being said the product works fantastic for edges</li>
            <li>I ordered another one for my boyfriend because he liked it so  much.</li>

            <li>in all, I would not recommend this to anyone and am vastly surprised as to how it got so many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li>but this product is much more natural than others on the market.</li>
            <li>Best Pomade I tried so far, they should really put their other products here as well.</li>
            <li>Gives a very strong hold, but is still flexible enough to be adjusted throughout the day.</li>

            <li>Really liking this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many customers here, I was persuaded by the other reviews here to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to style on wet hair and does not leave a wax-like residue.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this easy-to-use pomade.</li>
            <li>In my past experiences, the only good pomades/waxes that worked well for me, were not organic.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, product sucks.</li>
            <li>The hold is decent but I bought it mainly because it uses a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have medium length straight thick asian hair, and am constantly looking for a product that is strong enough to hold my hair in style, yet is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked, despite being organic.  </li>
            <li>might as well use a product that&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the vendor for responding to my questions prior to purchase.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling natural after use.</li>
            <li>Jovinno is all natural and has no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Its all natural</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and am African American and i use this for my edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not really because it didn&#x27;t hold my hair and didn&#x27;t really have shine</li>
            <li>Only downside is cost---its pricier than anything else that I&#x27;ve used and its natural, but it does work well.</li>
            <li>Not a single complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pomade does the job, without making my hair super hard and also has the added benefit of permitting restyling if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Smelling</li>
            <li>I also wanted a clear substance (gray hair can absorb color from hair products) without a strong fragrance or questionable chemicals.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Like many customers here, I was persuaded by the other reviews here to give it a shot.  Despite it being so expensive, I decided to give it a real shot since  Jovinno claims this formula to be fully natural, aka organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use was good.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked, despite being organic.  In my past experiences, the only good pomades/waxes that worked well for me, were not organic.  Also, at first use, the smell is great. I think I may have been biased from the reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each further application, I found myself liking it less and less.  It did not seem to hold well throughout the day, like it did in my first uses. The smell started to bother me, now to the point where I hate it.  Also this stuff is a total pain in @$$ to wash out.  Despite claims of being natural, one would think that this would wash out easily - NO!  I shampoo every night.  When using Jovinno,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally needed to shampoo thorouhgly 3 times - each time in order to get this stuff out.  Now you&#x27;re all probably wondering, how do I know that it was stuff in my hair and didn&#x27;t wash out?  After shampooing once (like most people normally do) and drying your hair, you&#x27;ll feel your hair still somewhat crunchy.  It is difficult to explain, but the texture after trying to rinse this stuff out with shampoo similar to shampooing your hair ,and only rinsing it out with water just a little bit.  It is as if soap/shampoo is still stuck in your hair somewhere and when towel drying, it feels crunchy.  The only wash I could get over this &amp;#34;phenomenon&amp;#34; is shampooing and rinsing 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I used it, the more aggravated I got.  So perhaps this may just be fluke and I got a bad batch, but I will not use this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, this review was based on only one tub.  Also, I use Layrite, Tigi Matte Separation Wax, and American Crew Fiber also.  They all offer a much superior hold, and wash out much easier than Jovinno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not recommend this to anyone and am vastly surprised as to how it got so many 5-star reviews.an Jovinno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not recommend this to anyone and am vastly surprised as to how it got so many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend and he loves it! He&#x27;s tried several different products but everything either left a funky residue or was overly hard when it dried! But this works perfectly w very little amount of product! It was recommended by a friend of mine and he is in the fashion industry and highly recommends it to a lot of people! Washes out easily which is a plus!!! And it smells good too!! 👍🏼</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. It&#x27;s expensive but the best wax I&#x27;ve ever bought. Love the fragrance too.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest waste of money, the wax leaves your hair sticky and smelly. Bad product overall I give it a 1 out of 10</li>
            <li> Really liking this product. Has a watermelon-esque scent to it but it&#x27;s a very light smell. The hold is decent but I bought it mainly because it uses a lot of natural ingredients. I figured if I&#x27;m going to have something in my hair all day might as well use a product that&#x27;s natural. I would say American Crew has slightly better hold but dries your hair out. Jovinno does not.</li>
            <li> Contains PROPYLENE GLYCOL. That&#x27;s also called Mineral Oil: a by product of gasoline production. Linked to cancer and considered TOXIC. Thanks but no thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To be fair I purchased this twice while falling for the terminology of &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; labeling until I took a closer look at the ingredients. It does have a nice hold. But BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Not really because it didn&#x27;t hold my hair and didn&#x27;t really have shine</li>
            <li> Great product just very pricey! I have fairly long hair and it holds just fine like suavecito. The smell is definitely better then suavecito as well. The only downfall is the price but I guess that&#x27;s what you pay for because of what&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> Easy to Style, Smells Good and Washes out Easily</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would ;)</li>
            <li> I must have missed that ingredient when I was reading them online. I&#x27;m super disappointed to see it on the list. That being said the product works fantastic for edges, is just shiny enough, not to shiny, has a long hold. I have very curly hair and am African American and i use this for my edges.&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;m done with this product I won&#x27;t reorder it because I personally don&#x27;t like that ingredient but this product is much more natural than others on the market. You have to weigh your options. Also, this product is huge, twice to three times the size of others.</li>
            <li> Must say, this is definitely one of he best pomades I have ever used. Goes into hair nice and smooth and washes out extremely easy. Holds hair firmly and let&#x27;s you style any type of hair. Good for both men and women.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best Pomades I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried purchasing a variety of gels at the store. However, nothing compares to Jovinno. I would recommend this just about anyone who desires to have a &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Took 3 washes to get it out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Best pomade ever..! Highly recommended. No alcohol which is great and healthy. We all use it at home..!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, product sucks. I don&#x27;t trust Amazon reviews anymore.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Gives a very strong hold, but is still flexible enough to be adjusted throughout the day. Gives great texture and just a little bit of shine. Easy to wash out with just water as well. I have medium length straight thick asian hair, and am constantly looking for a product that is strong enough to hold my hair in style, yet is easy to wash out. I have finally found it in Jovinno Hair wax. The smell is light and pleasant as well. I hope this product is never discontinued. I have tried over 20 high end hair styling products, and this one is easily the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is an awesome product, Its makes fixing my hair a breeze. Hold and texture is great. I Will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the product I had been seeking for travel.  I usually use a natural mousse on my shortish curly salt and pepper hair, but I wanted product that wouldn&#x27;t leak when packed and a concentrated product, as I don&#x27;t like packing water.  I wanted something other than a gel, which tends to weigh my hair down and doesn&#x27;t provide the lift I&#x27;m looking for.  I also wanted a clear substance (gray hair can absorb color from hair products) without a strong fragrance or questionable chemicals.  Jovinno Pomade meets all these criteria.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  I started with a small amount and added a little more as my hair is quite thick.  Thanks to the vendor for responding to my questions prior to purchase.  I highly recommend this easy-to-use pomade.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling natural after use. No smells or greases. Quality product. I&#x27;ll be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> This is the only one that is not sticky while it holds my short hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Only downside is cost---its pricier than anything else that I&#x27;ve used and its natural, but it does work well. For reference, I used to use Scwartzkopf Spikers Glue for my hair---not for any crazy hairdo but for my long,straight,rigid Asian hair that does like to style well with the softer/weaker type gels.&lt;br /&gt;This pomade does the job, without making my hair super hard and also has the added benefit of permitting restyling if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Smelling nice is a bonus.</li>
            <li> If this a pomade or a wax? With this title this company try to sell this product as many people posible. I was looking for a pomade, and this is not a pomade, its wax, or maybe hard gel. But is good. And of course can be unisex, cause they want everybody use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this pomade for about a year and I really love it. Nothing like this product in the market. I definitely recommend Jovinno</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is easy to style on wet hair and does not leave a wax-like residue. It&#x27;s also very easy to wash and it has a sweet smell to it. Jovinno is all natural and has no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is the best pomade/gel/wax whatever you want to call it period!. Its all natural and it smells great. i have ever tried several ones all my life and trust me nothing compares to this one. Its a little pricey but it is worth every dollar plus you  literaly just need a small amount everyday so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several pomades. This is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used. Everyone noticed it and gave me compliments on how shiny and full my hair looked. I ordered another one for my boyfriend because he liked it so  much.</li>
            <li> Best Pomade I tried so far, they should really put their other products here as well. I&#x27;m so hyped. And I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks now. Not a single complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use American Crew pomade, but this guy just killed it.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold.  Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would be so thick . But smells great</li>
