            <li>Mary Kay has an excellent product line and I use many of her products, however, this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams, but this is the best</li>
            <li>it was always a good thing.  </li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>a mirror handy</li>
            <li>Though to be honest, nothing compares to the soothing eye gel for immediate and drastic puffy relief.</li>
            <li>Feels nice</li>
            <li>but it sure feels good.  </li>
            <li>But the product is great and the price was right!</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times over the years and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is awesome, leaves my eyes feeling very soft and seems to diminish the lines.  </li>
            <li>I feel MK products are safe and I am glad I found a skin routine that works for me!</li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Yes, the transaction went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this eye cream.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I think revitalist works better</li>
            <li>Being able to buy it from Amazon made it more affordable.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will keep using it!</li>
            <li>I love their products and use them all.</li>
            <li>I love the eye firming cream.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product and will continue to use</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>This is just an okay product for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>My skin had more elasticity as well.</li>
            <li>thank you for this, :-)</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found that Amazon now sells the product, which is almost a 50% savings.</li>
            <li>I  have many allergies, and often wake up with puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>Love the results of this product for the price.</li>
            <li>and she always advised to \\&quot;pat lightly using ring or pinky finger\\&quot; on and around one&#x27;s eyes to prevent irritation and more puffiness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s removed all the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my eyes from showing fine lines, and moisturizes as well.</li>
            <li>It is lubricating but not too lubricating and helps with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>My order came in and it was fine</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen no difference in the fine lines under my eye</li>
            <li>This is a nice, gentle and non-irritating eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, super sensitive skin, that&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and  absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, works very well!</li>
            <li>But I challenge you folks that have it...and stopped using it, to clean your face...</li>
            <li>Guess it is better to buy direct from a Mark Kay rep. to be confident.</li>
            <li>The product seems like it is true mary kay.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li>I have liked most other Mary Kay products but not this one.</li>
            <li>good eye cream.. but not good ingredient.. not for amazing eye cream..</li>
            <li>good product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I used it for one month and started noticing my eyes were brighter underneath, and the fine lines looked much smoother.</li>
            <li>It lasts a couple of months, but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I like the pump dispenser, so the cream stays fresh.</li>
            <li>You need to use in the right way too ..</li>
            <li>I have the type of lines that are right under the eye not crows feet</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin, but normal deeper lines are catching up with me.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I am an avid Mary Kay user.</li>
            <li>At 58 years of age with deep set eyes, the area just below my brows was beginning to drop and almost touching my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Really takes away the lines and wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>This had tracking info within a day, arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, exactly as described</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user for over 15 years</li>
            <li>the last reviewer asked: how many of these 5 star rating reviews are from mary kay sales reps?</li>
            <li>Im open for suggestions :)</li>
            <li>I SEE HOW MUCH I NEED IT!  </li>
            <li>Again, I have used numerous products and have returned many and this is one I will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>Real deal!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>must have&#x27;s for bedtime when I finally get to rest after a long day I wake up looking rested and felling good about my self.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure u use it every single day.</li>
            <li>I also received my package sooner than expected, a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I only had to return the item and postage and a return label were made available to print for the return.  </li>
            <li>now, put it on ONE  eye lid, and lower,  gently, then look at your eyes--compare!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also feels really nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This eye cream really works.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FOR TIRED, BAGGY EYES...</li>
            <li>It took over a year of using it with my TimeWise set and then going without it for me to realize how much of a part the firming eye cream played in how my eyes look.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps those lines underneath your eyes.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li>i used product and it turned out to be real greasy under my eyes</li>
            <li>it made my face shine to much</li>
            <li>it does absolutely &#x27;nada&#x27;</li>
            <li>I like the feel of this eye cream but don&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>Expensive when you buy at full price, but definitely good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Age really hasn&#x27;t settled in like a newly built house under a year</li>
            <li>maybe it was an older batch?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>You have to use it for more than a few months to see a change.  </li>
            <li>Recently I tried Mary Kay and found it to be as good if not better and</li>
            <li>Used in past, much cheaper here than from a Mary Kay rep, same stuff, love it!</li>
            <li>I did an experiment, using it only around my right eye.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good--I actually use it on my eyelids for firmness and I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Still works pretty well overall though!</li>
            <li>I actually like this product more than the other eye-wrinkle products from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been consistent with daily use with it, too.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews, but I felt the need to speak on this product.</li>
            <li>I have used other, more expensive products, but the cream was thicker and not as effective as the Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of really expensive eye creams and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Not only that, I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about 10 days and have really noticed a difference -</li>
            <li>I like the look and feel of this stuff, but i guess i will not know if i really like it or not until sometime in the future.</li>
            <li>This product does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s too early for results.</li>
            <li>It is not gimmicky.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When I ordered directly from Mary Kay, the year on the product box was 2013.</li>
            <li>The shocker came when I was carded for alcohol (I&#x27;m nearly 40) about 5 times.</li>
            <li>Got me so far?  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin AND eyes and have had no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks and enjoy the way it moisturizes</li>
            <li>Was a low price, but it was because it was in the old packaging, so probably and older batch.  </li>
            <li>Although, I have not noticed a huge... difference in the firming area, this cream is the only eye cream that has helped my dry, red, and patchy eyelids!!</li>
            <li>I have always been pleased with Mary Kay products though not able to use it recently because of cost and budget restrictions.</li>
            <li>Makes eyes feel so smooth and helps with small wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The only thing I DON&#x27;T like is the &#x27;container&#x27; (which I realize has nothing to do with Amazon!), because I&#x27;m very frugal and you cannot get every last drop out of it!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rock solid in delivering moisture to a very sensitive part of the face.  </li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;m selecting L&#x27;oreal eye products which are average to good but still not settling for the ultimate decision of Botox which all realize does work.  </li>
            <li>I have used this eye cream in the past and was very pleased with it, but this eye cream was old and did not meet my expectations of what I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eye lids and this is the only eye cream that doesn&#x27;t give me problems.</li>
            <li>29 years old, just trying to prevent further damage around the eye area.</li>
            <li>It did firm the skin and my eyes look more open rather than closed with drooping skin.</li>
            <li>those pesky little laugh lines are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li>If something makes your eyes tight in 24hrs, you should worry about what exactly is in that.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is thick enough to last all day but glides on smoothly without pulling on the fragile skin.</li>
            <li>it works really well for keeping the bags from under my eyes, you only need a little and</li>

            <li> My order came in and it was fine</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen no difference in the fine lines under my eye</li>
            <li> This is a nice, gentle and non-irritating eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, super sensitive skin, that&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and  absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, works very well!</li>
            <li> But I challenge you folks that have it...and stopped using it, to clean your face...</li>
            <li> Guess it is better to buy direct from a Mark Kay rep. to be confident.</li>
            <li> The product seems like it is true mary kay.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> I have liked most other Mary Kay products but not this one.</li>
            <li> good eye cream.. but not good ingredient.. not for amazing eye cream..</li>
            <li> good product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used it for one month and started noticing my eyes were brighter underneath, and the fine lines looked much smoother.</li>
            <li> It lasts a couple of months, but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I like the pump dispenser, so the cream stays fresh.</li>
            <li> You need to use in the right way too ..</li>
            <li> I have the type of lines that are right under the eye not crows feet</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin, but normal deeper lines are catching up with me.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I am an avid Mary Kay user.</li>
            <li> At 58 years of age with deep set eyes, the area just below my brows was beginning to drop and almost touching my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Really takes away the lines and wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> This had tracking info within a day, arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly as described</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user for over 15 years</li>
            <li> the last reviewer asked: how many of these 5 star rating reviews are from mary kay sales reps?</li>
            <li> Im open for suggestions :)</li>
            <li> I SEE HOW MUCH I NEED IT!  </li>
            <li> Again, I have used numerous products and have returned many and this is one I will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> Real deal!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> must have&#x27;s for bedtime when I finally get to rest after a long day I wake up looking rested and felling good about my self.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure u use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I also received my package sooner than expected, a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I only had to return the item and postage and a return label were made available to print for the return.  </li>
            <li> now, put it on ONE  eye lid, and lower,  gently, then look at your eyes--compare!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also feels really nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This eye cream really works.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR TIRED, BAGGY EYES...</li>
            <li> It took over a year of using it with my TimeWise set and then going without it for me to realize how much of a part the firming eye cream played in how my eyes look.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps those lines underneath your eyes.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li> i used product and it turned out to be real greasy under my eyes</li>
            <li> it made my face shine to much</li>
            <li> it does absolutely &#x27;nada&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this eye cream but don&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> Expensive when you buy at full price, but definitely good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Age really hasn&#x27;t settled in like a newly built house under a year</li>
            <li> maybe it was an older batch?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> You have to use it for more than a few months to see a change.  </li>
            <li> Recently I tried Mary Kay and found it to be as good if not better and</li>
            <li> Used in past, much cheaper here than from a Mary Kay rep, same stuff, love it!</li>
            <li> I did an experiment, using it only around my right eye.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good--I actually use it on my eyelids for firmness and I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Still works pretty well overall though!</li>
            <li> I actually like this product more than the other eye-wrinkle products from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been consistent with daily use with it, too.  </li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but I felt the need to speak on this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other, more expensive products, but the cream was thicker and not as effective as the Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of really expensive eye creams and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Not only that, I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about 10 days and have really noticed a difference -</li>
            <li> I like the look and feel of this stuff, but i guess i will not know if i really like it or not until sometime in the future.</li>
            <li> This product does not irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too early for results.</li>
            <li> It is not gimmicky.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I ordered directly from Mary Kay, the year on the product box was 2013.</li>
            <li> The shocker came when I was carded for alcohol (I&#x27;m nearly 40) about 5 times.</li>
            <li> Got me so far?  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin AND eyes and have had no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks and enjoy the way it moisturizes</li>
            <li> Was a low price, but it was because it was in the old packaging, so probably and older batch.  </li>
            <li> Although, I have not noticed a huge... difference in the firming area, this cream is the only eye cream that has helped my dry, red, and patchy eyelids!!</li>
            <li> I have always been pleased with Mary Kay products though not able to use it recently because of cost and budget restrictions.</li>
            <li> Makes eyes feel so smooth and helps with small wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The only thing I DON&#x27;T like is the &#x27;container&#x27; (which I realize has nothing to do with Amazon!), because I&#x27;m very frugal and you cannot get every last drop out of it!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rock solid in delivering moisture to a very sensitive part of the face.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;m selecting L&#x27;oreal eye products which are average to good but still not settling for the ultimate decision of Botox which all realize does work.  </li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream in the past and was very pleased with it, but this eye cream was old and did not meet my expectations of what I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eye lids and this is the only eye cream that doesn&#x27;t give me problems.</li>
            <li> 29 years old, just trying to prevent further damage around the eye area.</li>
            <li> It did firm the skin and my eyes look more open rather than closed with drooping skin.</li>
            <li> those pesky little laugh lines are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li> If something makes your eyes tight in 24hrs, you should worry about what exactly is in that.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is thick enough to last all day but glides on smoothly without pulling on the fragile skin.</li>
            <li> it works really well for keeping the bags from under my eyes, you only need a little and</li>
            <li> I am very particular about products and this is the ONLY eye cream I have used for the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always looked a few years older than I was, as a kid</li>
            <li> or you have a slight tingling or allergic reaction to the secret ingredients that summon its claim to magic.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but not completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not old enough.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time, in my thirties but definitely have &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; eyes.</li>
            <li> I was accidently sent the wrong item and the seller was very quick to answer my message and send the correct item.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on like butter or rain, and minutes later, the area is just as dry</li>
            <li> A friend pointed out that your eyes are usually what makes a person look older</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I try different eye creams and this one did not really meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed drastic results, but will continue to use long term.</li>
            <li> it just seemed to take a long time</li>
            <li> I try other products but always end up back with Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely helps with dark circles and keeps my skin moistureized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eye revitalizer which is their similar but separate eye cream is used to target puffiness and dark circles in addition to what the Firming Eye Cream does.</li>
            <li> My eyes don&#x27;t have dark circles under them when I use this daily,</li>
            <li> When I went back for more, there wasn&#x27;t any:-(</li>
            <li> and I can say I have little wrinkles that my younger sisters.</li>
            <li> Saw a little improvement , but not enough to purchase again, save your money Girls.</li>
            <li> The year on the box was 2009, so it must be at least 5 years old.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected, but it seemed to run out in just days.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles are minimal.</li>
            <li> and this isn&#x27;t at all irritating (especially to the sensitive area close to the eyes).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well Spent!</li>
            <li> I use this among other things as part of my night time routine and it keeps me from having puffy eyes when I don&#x27;t get the sleep I need</li>
            <li> It did not help in any other way.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed and pretty surprised.</li>
            <li> It removes dark circles and evens the complexion around the eyes with time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just thick enough to be moisturizing, but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> Dark circles seem lighter &amp; wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was wary of paying so much for a little bottle but after a month or so, I&#x27;ve noticed my areas around my eyes looking for youthful and clearer.</li>
            <li> I see a difference using this product along with Timewise  Repair eye cream, the eye area is smoother and the lines at edge of the eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I checked out Amazon to see if I could get it for less than the $32 I would have to pay my MK rep</li>
            <li> but I need another supply ASAP for less.  </li>
            <li> and I required a product that works not a &#x27;QUICK FIX&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone whose eyes could use a little help.</li>
            <li> Made me think maybe the package had been a tester or used a little.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while</li>
            <li> i use this product everyday...</li>
            <li> and this product hasn&#x27;t done much to firm them up.</li>
            <li> Its not that I disliked this product--it was helpful as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Waste of money..</li>
            <li> This cream seems a little thinner than usual....</li>
            <li> I like that it has very little fragrance, as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure though.</li>
            <li> but it does help get rid of small rinkles under the eye.</li>
            <li> ...I allowed myself to go without the firming eye cream for the past four (4) months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cream itself or the fact that it might be expired and doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for lines , just feels like a thick cream.</li>
            <li> Cause its not nearly as amazing as otgers have claimed.</li>
            <li> This product will slow aging.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than the Bobbi Brown counterpart.  </li>
            <li> duh no!</li>
            <li> and ive been using it for a few months! !!</li>
            <li> I have used Principal Secret for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money! :(</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of very expensive brands but nothing beats this cream.</li>
            <li> and I feel BAD for doing this</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t hate it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good--I actually use it on my eyelids for firmness and I can tell a difference. But it didn&#x27;t seem to help the lines under my eyes, I use a different product for that.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream. Been using it for 4 years. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles around my eyes yet but it definitely helps with dark circles and keeps my skin moistureized. One bottle will last me about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Removes mascara well.</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY buy fron this seller again.  I was accidently sent the wrong item and the seller was very quick to answer my message and send the correct item.  I only had to return the item and postage and a return label were made available to print for the return.  Great transaction!  Very happy customer!  :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin. I think revitalist works better</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a number of years now. I love it! I feel it has helped my eyes looking fresher.</li>
            <li> I have always been pleased with Mary Kay products though not able to use it recently because of cost and budget restrictions. Being able to buy it from Amazon made it more affordable.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes but this product is great and I have no problems with it at all. Not only that, I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about 10 days and have really noticed a difference - so has my husband! It&#x27;s removed all the fine lines around my eyes. I also like the consistency, not oily at all and there&#x27;s no smell to it either. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> This product really works! You just need to make sure u use it every single day. You need to use in the right way too .. Wash your skin with the right soap, and then, go ahead !!!! GOOD LUCK YALL !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Shortly after purchasing this product, I discovered from my dermatologist that Mary Kay products did not agree with my skin. After receiving it, I attempted 3 times to contact this seller by email with NO RESPONSE. I will definitely think twice about ordering from them again. I have not used the product (it is still in the receiving envelope unopened), so in all fairness I cannot comment on the product itself. Just the seller.</li>
            <li> This cream seems a little thinner than usual....maybe it was an older batch? Still works pretty well overall though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always looked a few years older than I was, as a kid it was always a good thing.  Now that I&#x27;ve entered my mid 20&#x27;s it&#x27;s started to irritate me.  A friend pointed out that your eyes are usually what makes a person look older so I figured I&#x27;d try this out.  After a few weeks I noticed that my eyes really were starting to look brighter.  I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone whose eyes could use a little help.</li>
            <li> i use this product everyday...it is both a savior and a maintainer! Great Buy, Money Well Spent! I recommend this product heartily</li>
            <li> I am an avid Mary Kay user. I love their products and use them all. I see a difference using this product along with Timewise  Repair eye cream, the eye area is smoother and the lines at edge of the eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I got it at a great price.  When I went back for more, there wasn&#x27;t any:-(</li>
            <li> At 58 years of age with deep set eyes, the area just below my brows was beginning to drop and almost touching my eyelids. It did firm the skin and my eyes look more open rather than closed with drooping skin. It didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I gave this a three because it came without a cap on it. I don&#x27;t see how I can keep the hell from drying out without putting it into a plastic baggie.</li>
            <li> I love the eye firming cream. I use Mary Kay all the time. It is all I know it to be.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Really takes away the lines and wrinkles!  Will definitely purchase again.  Was in doubt before trying the product.</li>
            <li> I am NOT an MK rep. But I challenge you folks that have it...and stopped using it, to clean your face...&lt;br /&gt;have a mirror handy...check out your eyes--for my my upper lid is sagging a bit--age does that! I am not&lt;br /&gt;asking for miracle cream here....now, put it on ONE  eye lid, and lower,  gently, then look at your eyes--compare!!&lt;br /&gt;Do I think it will look like a face lift--duh no! lol But now that I am 47 and did not take care of my face as I should, I&lt;br /&gt;now just have to deal with how I look...I SEE the difference when I did this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times over the years and am very pleased with it. It was also delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I gave it 1 star because it did not work. I used it for 3 months and I didn&#x27;t see any changes at all. I was really disappointed and pretty surprised. I have liked most other Mary Kay products but not this one. I will return this one and try another one.</li>
            <li> Was a low price, but it was because it was in the old packaging, so probably and older batch.  It worked as expected, but it seemed to run out in just days.  Made me think maybe the package had been a tester or used a little.  Not sure though. Guess it is better to buy direct from a Mark Kay rep. to be confident. You get what you pay for I guess....</li>
            <li> Received the next day, Happy😎</li>
            <li> I like the look and feel of this stuff, but i guess i will not know if i really like it or not until sometime in the future. I do like MK products.</li>
            <li> This had tracking info within a day, arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted. Great seller, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone wondering what this cream is, it&#x27;s the last part of the TimeWise Miracle Set (Facewash, Day/Night Cream, Moisturizer). It&#x27;s intended for use at both night time and morning applications before applying the moisturizer. The effects include removing lines and helping your eye makeup stay in place. It removes dark circles and evens the complexion around the eyes with time. It also feels really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye revitalizer which is their similar but separate eye cream is used to target puffiness and dark circles in addition to what the Firming Eye Cream does. Though to be honest, nothing compares to the soothing eye gel for immediate and drastic puffy relief. (Their pitch is &amp;#34;it&#x27;s great for after crying&amp;#34; and it is!)</li>
            <li> Love Timewise Eye cream! Have used for years!</li>
            <li> Been using this for three weeks now....those pesky little laugh lines are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Does what the product says it will do. Very impressed with Mary Kay. I will purchase again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered Mary Kay TimeWise Firming Eye Cream.  I received Mary Kay TimeWise 3-in-1 Cleanser, Combination/Oily Skin in the mail.  I wanted the firming eye cream.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my eyes from showing fine lines, and moisturizes as well. I am satisfied with this product and will continue to use</li>
            <li> Feels nice but I  don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything...haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  I have the type of lines that are right under the eye not crows feet and this product hasn&#x27;t done much to firm them up.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 months and notice a big difference around my eye area. They are softer and smoother than before</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of eye creams over the years and I always keep coming back to this product.  It is lubricating but not too lubricating and helps with fine lines.  I have tried all sorts of very expensive brands but nothing beats this cream.</li>
            <li> Yes, the transaction went very smoothly.  All if well with the product!</li>
            <li> This eye cream really works. It takes a little while but it does help get rid of small rinkles under the eye.</li>
            <li> good product for dry skin.  This product does not irritate sensitive skin.  Less expensive than the Bobbi Brown counterpart.  The container is plastic and good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I use this among other things as part of my night time routine and it keeps me from having puffy eyes when I don&#x27;t get the sleep I need it works really well for keeping the bags from under my eyes, you only need a little and it goes along way this is one of my must have&#x27;s for bedtime when I finally get to rest after a long day I wake up looking rested and felling good about my self.</li>
            <li> It truly takes the puffiness from my upper lids and firms the skin under my eyes.  I love the Firming Eye Cream!</li>
            <li> This is just an okay product for me.  I try different eye creams and this one did not really meet my expectations.  I gave it this rating because just because I dont care for it ,  I also don&#x27;t hate it.  I would not buy it again nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> still in the wait and see mode</li>
            <li> Great Price - I actually like this product more than the other eye-wrinkle products from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  The only thing I DON&#x27;T like is the &#x27;container&#x27; (which I realize has nothing to do with Amazon!), because I&#x27;m very frugal and you cannot get every last drop out of it!  But the product is great and the price was right!</li>
            <li> The product seems like it is true mary kay. I just started using it so it&#x27;s too early for results. The cream is definitely mosturizing.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Will definitely continue using it. Makes eyes feel so smooth and helps with small wrinkles. This is just what a MK product should be!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have been using it for years. I have sensitive eye lids and this is the only eye cream that doesn&#x27;t give me problems.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for years and it&#x27;s rock solid in delivering moisture to a very sensitive part of the face.  It is gentle and  absorbs very easily. It is not gimmicky. It doesn&#x27;t go on like butter or rain, and minutes later, the area is just as dry or you have a slight tingling or allergic reaction to the secret ingredients that summon its claim to magic. Its a solid, non-greasy, moisturizing step in the face care process.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for lines , just feels like a thick cream.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly as described</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and have been using it for years.  It&#x27;s just thick enough to be moisturizing, but not at all greasy.  I have really sensitive skin and this isn&#x27;t at all irritating (especially to the sensitive area close to the eyes).  I have tried all kinds of really expensive eye creams and this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> This works great. I have been an avid user for over 15 years and I can say I have little wrinkles that my younger sisters. I&#x27;m the oldest mind you.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR TIRED, BAGGY EYES... WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> Soooo what I&#x27;d like to know is how many of you reviewers that gave it all of these stars are Mary Kay representatives?!  This product is bull. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now...NOTHING! It does nothing.  I&#x27;ve been consistent with daily use with it, too.  What a waste of money! :(</li>
            <li> Best under eye firming cream!</li>
            <li> Its not that I disliked this product--it was helpful as a makeup remover. It did not help in any other way.</li>
            <li> Great. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Came as described and on time</li>
            <li> I Love this Time Wise Eye Firming Cream !!!  It works Great !!</li>
            <li> The Mary Kay Timewise Firming eye cream is excellent at hydrating the skin around my eye without making the area sting or burn. It is not greasy and does not interfere with my makeup. It lasts a couple of months, but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but I felt the need to speak on this product. Its done NOTHING for ne and ive been using it for a few months! !! I would have to ask tge same question the last reviewer asked: how many of these 5 star rating reviews are from mary kay sales reps? Cause its not nearly as amazing as otgers have claimed. Waste of money.. anyone know of an actual eye cream that works? Im open for suggestions :)</li>
            <li> I love that the item arrived on time and the product is luxurious, fills in fine lines, and best of all it is non-irritating to the eyes!  This product is quite affordable for the caliber and the quality of cosmetic.</li>
            <li> ...I allowed myself to go without the firming eye cream for the past four (4) months.  I SEE HOW MUCH I NEED IT!  It definitely helped with my undereye puffiness.  It took over a year of using it with my TimeWise set and then going without it for me to realize how much of a part the firming eye cream played in how my eyes look.  I checked out Amazon to see if I could get it for less than the $32 I would have to pay my MK rep and I feel BAD for doing this but I need another supply ASAP for less.  I am not a MK rep and I&#x27;m not going to get anything for saying the firming eye cream works.  You have to use it for more than a few months to see a change.  That is the problem with women and products nowadays, we don&#x27;t give something the time it needs to snatch those parts of ourselves that we want to see improved.  Don&#x27;t bounce from product to product.  If something makes your eyes tight in 24hrs, you should worry about what exactly is in that.  I feel MK products are safe and I am glad I found a skin routine that works for me!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but not completely satisfied with this product. The year on the box was 2009, so it must be at least 5 years old. When I ordered directly from Mary Kay, the year on the product box was 2013. Also, after using it for about a month I have not noticed any difference around my eyes. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the cream itself or the fact that it might be expired and doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> good eye cream.. but not good ingredient.. not for amazing eye cream.. but their texture is good.. im not gonna use any eye cream at all for the future.. because it is no difference with face cream..</li>
            <li> I am not kidding you - I initially only bought this because my friend was selling Mary Kay. I used it for one month and started noticing my eyes were brighter underneath, and the fine lines looked much smoother. My skin had more elasticity as well. The shocker came when I was carded for alcohol (I&#x27;m nearly 40) about 5 times. Each person thought I was in my twenties. This never happened until I started using it. Now I know &#x27;everything ain&#x27;t for everybody&#x27; - but this stuff works for me. I have very fair, super sensitive skin, that&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> It takes time to see the results, but it definitively helps you out by helping you reduce all the wrinkles by your eye area.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go without it. This product really helps those lines underneath your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, works very well! Keeps my skin very hydrated. I use before putting on makeup in morn. and at night. I can tell the improvement in skin smoothness!</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Timewise eye cream works great!  I have eye allergies and since using this product, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> thank you for this, :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used so far.  Expensive when you buy at full price, but definitely good stuff.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use this every night! Have been for years.  Wrinkles are minimal. :o)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and it works great!</li>
            <li> good product quality, good presentation and good item &#x3D;) it came on time, not damage. feel very happy to have it</li>
            <li> I have used Principal Secret for over 20 years. Recently I tried Mary Kay and found it to be as good if not better and a heck of a lot cheaper. This produce is not to reverse aging. Anything that says it will is either surgery or snake oil. This product will slow aging.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, gentle and non-irritating eye cream. Been using for a month or so. Haven&#x27;t noticed drastic results, but will continue to use long term. I like the pump dispenser, so the cream stays fresh. Highly recommend. Absorbs quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> My order came in and it was fine it just seemed to take a long time</li>
            <li> I love this product. At my age, my eyelids were starting to droop. After using this product, my eyelids look years younger. I have used other, more expensive products, but the cream was thicker and not as effective as the Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months and I see no difference. I feel like I&#x27;m just putting lotion under my eyes. I don&#x27;t even bother using it anymore.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about products and this is the ONLY eye cream I have used for the past 2 years.  Although, I have not noticed a huge... difference in the firming area, this cream is the only eye cream that has helped my dry, red, and patchy eyelids!! Again, I have used numerous products and have returned many and this is one I will continue to use.  A little bit goes a long way. In addition, my friend is a Mary Kay rep and she always advised to \\&quot;pat lightly using ring or pinky finger\\&quot; on and around one&#x27;s eyes to prevent irritation and more puffiness. I am glad I found that Amazon now sells the product, which is almost a 50% savings.</li>
            <li> Saw a little improvement , but not enough to purchase again, save your money Girls. I  have many allergies, and often wake up with puffy eyes. This didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li> i used product and it turned out to be real greasy under my eyes it made my face shine to much</li>
            <li> I checked out Mary Kay&#x27;s firming eye cream on the Internet from Amazon to Makeup Alley which by the way gives excellent reviews.  Gals between the ages of 18 yrs. to 29 yrs. have great things to say, but what do they know - they are the NO wrinkle, sort-of-puffiness chicks.  Age really hasn&#x27;t settled in like a newly built house under a year it is a BABE and hasn&#x27;t settled yet.  Got me so far?  Girls it does absolutely &#x27;nada&#x27; but it sure feels good.  I have puffiness and wrinkles around and under my eyes and I required a product that works not a &#x27;QUICK FIX&#x27;. Mary Kay has an excellent product line and I use many of her products, however, this isn&#x27;t one of them. It possitively doesn&#x27;t firm any part of the eye and that is the absolute truth.  This product is like having a cheating husband that you are just putting up with cause he works some of the time.  Lately, I&#x27;m selecting L&#x27;oreal eye products which are average to good but still not settling for the ultimate decision of Botox which all realize does work.  Good Luck !!!!</li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams, but this is the best</li>
            <li> It my friends order. I took for her in Brazil.</li>
            <li> Love the results of this product for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 years. I notice good firming, moisturizing, and line-reducing effects. I have naturally oily skin, but normal deeper lines are catching up with me. This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I also have sensitive skin AND eyes and have had no irritation with this product. I like that it has very little fragrance, as well.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well. Dark circles seem lighter &amp; wrinkles less noticeable. Not a 100% cure, but I&#x27;m happy to be using it.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and also during the day, too.  I like the results I get.  My eyes don&#x27;t have dark circles under them when I use this daily,</li>
            <li> I was wary of paying so much for a little bottle but after a month or so, I&#x27;ve noticed my areas around my eyes looking for youthful and clearer. I would recommend this product to everyone. I also received my package sooner than expected, a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this eye cream but don&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is awesome, leaves my eyes feeling very soft and seems to diminish the lines.  It does not do it all for the&lt;br /&gt;puffiness under the eyes however.</li>
            <li> This was for my girlfriend and she looks ten years younger!!!</li>
            <li> Real deal! Used in past, much cheaper here than from a Mary Kay rep, same stuff, love it! 29 years old, just trying to prevent further damage around the eye area. Can see instant improvement upon application.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay for years.  I try other products but always end up back with Mary Kay.  The price is comparable and the products are good.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream in the past and was very pleased with it, but this eye cream was old and did not meet my expectations of what I had used in the past.  I will stick (and recommend others to do the same) with ordering this product from a mary kay representative.</li>
            <li> Happy to see this product on amazon so I don&#x27;t have to deal with pushy reps. This eye cream is thick enough to last all day but glides on smoothly without pulling on the fragile skin. It is the only eye cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t seep into my eyes at the end of the day and burn my eyes. And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I did an experiment, using it only around my right eye. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks and enjoy the way it moisturizes but I&#x27;ve seen no difference in the fine lines under my eye I haven&#x27;t seen a brighter skin look either. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m doubting Mary Kay&#x27;s products, I use several others. I&#x27;m just saying this one doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I&#x27;m not old enough. I&#x27;m 41.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time, in my thirties but definitely have &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; eyes. Good product to have</li>
