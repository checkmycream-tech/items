            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is great for others, but the ingredients just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  </li>

            <li>and I am loving that feature.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best I have found so far for moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased with this purchase &amp; the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>It is a gel, has a pleasant, mild, refreshing scent and does not over moisturize your skin.  </li>

            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Getting it for a lower price with free shipping(Order &amp;#62; $35) is a bonus!</li>
            <li>and it is simply my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I purchased another brand of moisturizer that works MUCH better</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me when I was having microderm abrasion treatments at my favorite salon.  </li>
            <li>I love this for morning or night.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day on top of another Bioelements product, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>so there are better products for me .</li>
            <li>Love the lightness of the product</li>
            <li>It was nice and light and easy to apply under makeup.</li>
            <li>it can easily go rancid, there is nothing holding together on a molecular level.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally stopped using it and everything has been fine.  </li>
            <li>Felt smooth and light on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight and comfortable</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing, and would work for absolutely any skin type, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fragrance free also, if you can&#x27;t stand smells.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is fantastic</li>
            <li>This is a light gel like consistency.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of moisturizer/serums and this one is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to wash my face</li>
            <li>This is the most unusual type moisturizer I have ever encountered!..</li>
            <li>My skin still feels refreshed and super clean after applying it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer so much that I do the Subscribe &amp; Save and get 15% off.</li>
            <li>The gel like substance isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d expect from a moisturizer but it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin super mositurized</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Bioelements Quick Refiner, 3-Ounce]]  </li>
            <li>I am a product junkie and love trying new products.</li>
            <li>It absorbed almost immediately after rubbing it quickly on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li>It was really watery and smelled strong of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on so smoothly, but it definitely is drying.</li>
            <li>After using this combination, I&#x27;ve rarely had any pimples.</li>
            <li>I take a few hot yoga classes a week and for any of you who have experienced hot yoga you sweat tremendously.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the perfect everyday lotion, look no further.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gives it enough moisture to keep you feeling comfortable and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is the same residue that irritated my skin and caused me more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I discovered it at my local spa and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using an organic product but, the esthetician steered me away from that because after an organic lotion sits in a hot room (bathroom with a shower running)</li>
            <li>I bought this and used it for the first time yesterday morning..</li>
            <li>so I think you do use more each time than you would with a regular lotion based moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I would even go back and apply more after about 30 minutes and still no relief from the dryness.</li>
            <li>I love the entire Bioelements face cleanser line and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>It takes very little  to obtain good moisture coverage.</li>
            <li>have mostly normal-to-dry skin, and am prone to a bad pimple or two every now and then, which I treat with some pretty harsh creams such as PCA Skin&#x27;s PHaze 33 (which is awesome in its own right).</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me.  </li>
            <li>My forehead is really oily, this product helps a bit with that.</li>
            <li>Bioelements thanks for making quality products for people with problem skin, wished I found you 13 years ago.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very suttle.  </li>
            <li>very dissapointed</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused my face to break out, and is very gentle for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Of course this isn&#x27;t some magic potion that gets rid of oil, but I&#x27;ve noticed a great decrease in the amount of oil present on my face and of course, less oil means less break outs.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and was excited to see that I could purchase this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>product seemed to dry very quickly when placed on face.  </li>
            <li>I have only subtracted one star because, yes, the price is a bit high (but worth it!).</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel fresh and it seems to really help with my overall acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>Did not do well with my older skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a keeper and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Normal and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and will last about 3 months using 2 to 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>So I opened the box and opened the jar, it smelled kind of weird but not bad.</li>
            <li>I use it, I have new pimples.  </li>
            <li>But my hands/nuckles are super dry and cracked, so I decided to put it it on my hands just to see what it felt like on the skin.</li>
            <li>(even though bioelements says there isn&#x27;t) I have very sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>A little goes along way and quite refreshing.. a definite TRY product..</li>
            <li>my dry/cracked/painful hands were immediately soft and relieved of pain.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly light, soaks in immediately, and does not feel at all greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>Compared to more pricy options such as La Mer, which is the only other product that works wonders for my sensitive skin, it defiantly carries its weigh, especially in combination with their stress serum.  </li>
            <li>I am very acne prone, yet have annoyingly dry skin as well.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and easily rubs and absorbs in the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond Hydration is so light that it hardly feels like putting anything on, but then leaves your skin feeling so well hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have amazingly oily skin that is incredibly difficult to manage and keep from breaking out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in it made my skin flare up, but apparently I am allergic to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>As mentioned in another review, a little does go a long way, so the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to other people that suffer with the discomfort of foot pain.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this to other people that suffer with the discomfort of foot pain.</li>
            <li> I was initially recommended this product during a facial, and after trying to cut costs by buying other products, found myself coming back to this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and have suffered with breakouts and the damage it leaves behind for about 13 years now.  </li>
            <li> That said, these harsh treatments leave my skin pretty dry, but when I try to moisturize with any other lotion, find myself breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also picked up a DDF glycolic toner for my occasional breakouts and use it daily before using this moisturizer, if you have oily skin and pimples due to solely that reason I&#x27;d recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s strange to use a gel moisturizer</li>
            <li> so it lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> keep it with me at all times and reapply during the day during particularly dry Chicago months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;little dry for me</li>
            <li> I have combination skin: greasy T-Zone and dry for the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I got this because I have oily but dry skin.</li>
            <li> The jar lasts me at least 4 months, possibly even to 5 months if I only moisturize once daily.</li>
            <li> and my face gets a little red</li>
            <li> and this is the only moisturizer I can wear without feeling all gloopy and having a heavy film of oil on my face all day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> After using this product of and on for the past two years I keep coming back to it.</li>

            <li> Sorry - It didn&#x27;t feel or smell like real Bioelements Beyond Hydration.</li>

            <li> The beyond hydration is a little watery for me</li>
            <li> When I wash my face, I always get that tight feeling and this took it alway without feeling oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t at all heavy.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I have trouble finding one that does not cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>

            <li> I have oily skin that sometimes forms pimples and when it gets late at night</li>
            <li> and it helps so much on cutting back oil production without clogging and breaking me out.</li>
            <li> even oil-free moisturizers cause me to start looking like an oil slick with in 10-15 minutes of wear under my make up even with an oil controlling foundation primer!</li>
            <li> So this isn&#x27;t a bad product but just not what I was looking for .</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wash my face, the oil gets really annoying.</li>
            <li> HATE IT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I really wanted this to work for me.  I am a Tazarac user and I need to moisturize even though I have oily skin.  I tried this for a year off and on.  I couldn&#x27;t identify what was causing my break outs for a while.  Then I started to notice the pattern.  I use it, I have new pimples.  I stop, they go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally stopped using it and everything has been fine.  I&#x27;m sure it is great for others, but the ingredients just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  On to the next...</li>
            <li> Very light and creamy. It was nice and light and easy to apply under makeup. Felt smooth and light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Been using it for years. I have the oiliest skin of anyone I know and this is the only moisturizer I can wear without feeling all gloopy and having a heavy film of oil on my face all day. It works great because its gel and water based not lotion based.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is so great for oily skin I would Def recommend it. It&#x27;s so lightweight and comfortable I actually waited like 2 hours to see if my skin will get oily and it never did especially when I slept through the night with it on my skin still hasn&#x27;t gotten oily. I love this moisturizer never this continue.</li>
            <li> I was initially recommended this product during a facial, and after trying to cut costs by buying other products, found myself coming back to this moisturizer. It is absolutely amazing, and would work for absolutely any skin type, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mostly normal-to-dry skin, and am prone to a bad pimple or two every now and then, which I treat with some pretty harsh creams such as PCA Skin&#x27;s PHaze 33 (which is awesome in its own right). That said, these harsh treatments leave my skin pretty dry, but when I try to moisturize with any other lotion, find myself breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Hydration is so light that it hardly feels like putting anything on, but then leaves your skin feeling so well hydrated. You can really slather it on and not feel it heavy on your face. Even when you use what feels like a lot, however, it ends up just being a small amount and going a long way! I&#x27;d say that a 2.5 oz jar lasts me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it with me at all times and reapply during the day during particularly dry Chicago months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely will  not be disappointed with this product. I have only subtracted one star because, yes, the price is a bit high (but worth it!).</li>
            <li> If you need to tone down the moisture in your complexion this is the product for you.  I love how it goes on so smoothly, but it definitely is drying. So do not use if you are trying to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Bioelements is a good product.  The gel like substance isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d expect from a moisturizer but it absorbs quickly.  I have combination skin. My forehead is really oily, this product helps a bit with that. Instead of having to wash my face every 3 hours or so, I can go from morning to late afternoon with this moisturizer. It does not have any SPF protection so I would advise using a 30+ SPF cream with this.  I&#x27;ve had basal cell carcinoma on my cheek, not a fun experience to have it removed.  Use your SPF people!!</li>
            <li> I personally thought this was a great product, which provided the best comfort ever. I highly recommend this to other people that suffer with the discomfort of foot pain.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and love trying new products. After using this product of and on for the past two years I keep coming back to it. Compared to more pricy options such as La Mer, which is the only other product that works wonders for my sensitive skin, it defiantly carries its weigh, especially in combination with their stress serum.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it.</li>
            <li> OHMYGAWD!! THIS MOISTURIZER IS AMAZING!!!!! I just got it in the mail just now. I opened it up and saw this was a gel (which is wasn&#x27;t expecting for some reason). So I opened the box and opened the jar, it smelled kind of weird but not bad. My face was unwashed so I didn&#x27;t want to put it on my face yet. But my hands/nuckles are super dry and cracked, so I decided to put it it on my hands just to see what it felt like on the skin. It absorbed almost immediately after rubbing it quickly on the backs of my hands. INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS!!!! my dry/cracked/painful hands were immediately soft and relieved of pain. I can&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m so excited to wash my face so I can put this product on my cheeks!!!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin and can&#x27;t use skin care products that have oil in them this is the product for you. It leaves the face nice and moisturized. It isn&#x27;t at all heavy. Goes on nice. Fragrance free also, if you can&#x27;t stand smells.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I have oily skin that sometimes forms pimples and when it gets late at night and I can&#x27;t wash my face, the oil gets really annoying. Of course this isn&#x27;t some magic potion that gets rid of oil, but I&#x27;ve noticed a great decrease in the amount of oil present on my face and of course, less oil means less break outs. With that said, it does take some time for the oil on your face to decrease gradually, its not gonna happen in a day. It took about a month but the result is definitely there. I also picked up a DDF glycolic toner for my occasional breakouts and use it daily before using this moisturizer, if you have oily skin and pimples due to solely that reason I&#x27;d recommend this to you. After using this combination, I&#x27;ve rarely had any pimples.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. If your thinking about buying it, buy it. I have oily skin and get cystic acne all over my face. since using the product i have been very happy with the results. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It makes your face feel fresh and it seems to really help with my overall acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> this is good for senstive skin and oily skin&lt;br /&gt;i have combination and senstive skin&lt;br /&gt;little dry for me so i have to use other lotion.</li>
            <li> I use bioelements decongestant cleanser and then use this moisturizer afterwards.  My skin still feels refreshed and super clean after applying it on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, oily residue like other moisturizers.  This is the same residue that irritated my skin and caused me more breakouts.  I have super oily skin and have suffered with breakouts and the damage it leaves behind for about 13 years now.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin super mositurized but it&#x27;s gives it enough moisture to keep you feeling comfortable and clean.  This is gel based moisturizer and has the consistency of aloe vera gel.  A little goes a long way and easily rubs and absorbs in the skin.  This is an honest review and the bioelements decongestant cleanser is also the best I have ever used.  Bioelements thanks for making quality products for people with problem skin, wished I found you 13 years ago.</li>
            <li> Wife has been using this product for years and loves it. Getting it for a lower price with free shipping(Order &amp;#62; $35) is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and was excited to see that I could purchase this on Amazon.  I have this set up on &amp;#34;auto refil&amp;#34; every couple of months and I am loving that feature.  I am someone who has oily skin and I never used moisturizers before getting hooked on this product by my solon.  Love it, it is a must try!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. I have oily skin, so I have trouble finding one that does not cause my skin to break out. This one works great. I have been using for some time, and I have purchased several from Amazon.  I recommend this product for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bioelements Beyond Hydration for over a year now and it is simply my favorite moisturizer. I discovered it at my local spa and fell in love with it. I have amazingly oily skin that is incredibly difficult to manage and keep from breaking out. Normal and even oil-free moisturizers cause me to start looking like an oil slick with in 10-15 minutes of wear under my make up even with an oil controlling foundation primer! This moisturizer is fantastic an actually makes it so I can go for 45-60 minutes before I have to hit my t-zone with shine control powder. It is incredibly light, soaks in immediately, and does not feel at all greasy or heavy. I love this moisturizer so much that I do the Subscribe &amp; Save and get 15% off. Hopefully Amazon will keep it around.</li>
            <li> This is the most unusual type moisturizer I have ever encountered!.. Gel in consistency, which i find very interesting and would seemingly consider to be drying; however.. gives an amazing moisture content. A little goes along way and quite refreshing.. a definite TRY product.. ME LIKEY!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin: greasy T-Zone and dry for the rest of my face.  I only used Bioelements Beyond Hydration for two days and my skin felt tight after use.  I purchased another brand of moisturizer that works MUCH better (Algenist Regenerative Anti-Aging Moisturizer).</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me when I was having microderm abrasion treatments at my favorite salon.  It is amazing!  It is a gel, has a pleasant, mild, refreshing scent and does not over moisturize your skin.  It contains no oil and so it is  perfect for those of us who are prone to acne and oily skin.  As mentioned in another review, a little does go a long way, so the price is worth it.  I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love this for morning or night. It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky at all. I feel like I&#x27;m hydrating my skin, but not over-hydrating it. It hasn&#x27;t caused my face to break out, and is very gentle for my very sensitive skin. I like that it has a little spatula to get product out so you don&#x27;t have to put your fingers into it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin hydrated and not greasy feeling. I have oily/sensitive skin. This product is the best I have found so far for moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased with this purchase &amp; the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the perfect everyday lotion, look no further. This is a light gel like consistency. I know it&#x27;s strange to use a gel moisturizer but, this is a must have if you have oily, combination or acne prone skin. This was recommended to me by an esthetician after I had a facial. I take a few hot yoga classes a week and for any of you who have experienced hot yoga you sweat tremendously. It was making me breakout horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using an organic product but, the esthetician steered me away from that because after an organic lotion sits in a hot room (bathroom with a shower running) it can easily go rancid, there is nothing holding together on a molecular level. I was sold. I use this twice a day on top of another Bioelements product, [[ASIN:B004CR43GY Bioelements Quick Refiner, 3-Ounce]]  the pair have created perfect flawless skin for me in order 3 weeks. I haven&#x27;t had skin this beautiful since I was a baby. Highly HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now and it works!  This is a keeper and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This does not disappoint.  The only moisturizer I can use that does not leave my skin feeling oily.  A little goes a long way so it lasts very long.  Keeps me feeling moisturizer all day.</li>
            <li> Sorry - It didn&#x27;t feel or smell like real Bioelements Beyond Hydration. It was really watery and smelled strong of alcohol. Its 1/2 the price for a reason I guess.</li>
            <li> This moisturiser is the best on the planet!  No greasy feeling and the fragrance is very suttle.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Used for a week. My skin felt like alligator skin. Imagine...I have extremely oily skin. Waste of my money. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin and it helps so much on cutting back oil production without clogging and breaking me out. It takes very little  to obtain good moisture coverage. The jar lasts me at least 4 months, possibly even to 5 months if I only moisturize once daily. I love the entire Bioelements face cleanser line and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> HATE IT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of moisturizer/serums and this one is by far the best I have ever used. It is not a cream... It is a gel, so it 100% will not leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. This is my 4th jar I have purchased and I will continue to buy it and recommend it. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and will last about 3 months using 2 to 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this gel. It felt tacky on my skin and rolled off when I applied sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it for the first time yesterday morning.. When I wash my face, I always get that tight feeling and this took it alway without feeling oily and heavy. It is a gel so I think you do use more each time than you would with a regular lotion based moisturizer. I gave it only 4 stars because I feel like there is some sort of fragrance in it. (even though bioelements says there isn&#x27;t) I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and I feel a little tingle after I put it on and my face gets a little red but it does go away after about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this moisturizer and i am completely in love with it! I have since purchased another jar to keep in my makeup kit to use on my clients. This is the perfect moisturizer for people with oily skin!</li>
            <li> The beyond hydration is a little watery for me so I will use it up and probably not repurchase . I have dry skin so there are better products for me . I do like the bio elements crucial moisture that I use day and nite and will probably try the sleepwear also. So this isn&#x27;t a bad product but just not what I was looking for .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what ingredient in it made my skin flare up, but apparently I am allergic to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, before the allergic reaction started, I noticed that this wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> product seemed to dry very quickly when placed on face.  Did not do well with my older skin.  very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Love the lightness of the product</li>
            <li> a bit sticky on skin, does not feel that good to me. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have oily but dry skin. I am very acne prone, yet have annoyingly dry skin as well. This just felt like I was putting water on my face. I would even go back and apply more after about 30 minutes and still no relief from the dryness. Dissappointed.</li>
