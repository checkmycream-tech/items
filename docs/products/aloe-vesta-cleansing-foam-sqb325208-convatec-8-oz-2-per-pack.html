            <li>Thank you very much..</li>
            <li>so use a 1/2 pump first.</li>
            <li>My first experience with this product was 7 years ago after giving birth to my daughter.  </li>
            <li>This all over body wash is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>First used it in the hospital and have been an avid user since</li>
            <li>From camping to home-care, this cleanser works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this when I first got hit with RA and couldn&#x27;t get out of bed without agonizing pain, it was a God-send.  </li>
            <li>Such an outstanding cleaning form when used for incontinence.</li>
            <li>It really works well!  </li>
            <li>Used on toilet tissue, it will not clog up the pipes or cause irritation as many baby wipes do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require rinsing when used on skin (although I do rinse her hair a bit because it tends to dry her scalp otherwise) and dissolves &amp; cleans away fecal matter quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hardly a substitute for hot, running water,,, but regular use can keep you clean, and your skin, healthy when a hot shower isn&#x27;t an option. :)</li>
            <li>After the surgeon and several doctors said the outcome for fixing the problem and maintaining a good quality of life were almost none, we found a pelvic floor physical therapist who fixed the problem!!  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The product works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is also gentle on the skin even if it is not rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>Very healing.</li>
            <li>It totally cleared up my light acne.  </li>
            <li>I bought a lot of cheap washcloths (white) and used those for cleansing.  </li>
            <li>There are fabulous physical therapists out there that specialize in rehabilitating the pelvic floor (for both men and women).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have time to shower to get ready in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>An absolute necessity for home health care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that is mild and strong enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this Soap highly.</li>
            <li>you just put it on a cloth or paper towel and wash yourself as you normally would or would have someone assist you and get dressed and on your way.</li>
            <li>this is very soothing and cleansing - hygiene with ease, no strong scent, easy.</li>
            <li>order it for her to keep her general personal areas clean.</li>
            <li>Much easier and clean without the mess of a bedbath for any caregiver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sentimental ok?</li>
            <li>I poured my new liquid in the old bottle.</li>
            <li>A quick side note for anyone dealing with a similar problem: don&#x27;t let anyone railroad you into surgery to fix such a problem.</li>
            <li>you are bed-ridden, this works wonders to clean yourself while laying down.</li>
            <li>My 97 year old grandmother uses this is the shower.</li>
            <li>Every time I change his adult diaper between showers, I use this to wash him up.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean my hands after a round of golf.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if, like me, you can&#x27;t bath or shower following surgery.</li>
            <li>I have major allergies and have never had a reaction.</li>
            <li>Really helps when things are tender, or not normal.</li>
            <li>no regrets.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time while in the hospital a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>It has little scent and is not irritating.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to use Aloe Vesta Cleansing Foam years ago.  I love it.  Even if you don&#x27;t get it all rinsed off..its still ok.</li>
            <li> Purchased product from elderly parent to help keep good hygiene. Product works well.</li>
            <li> Best non-rinse cleanser on the market.  We have used this for five years and will continue as long as it is marketed.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Good to clean your hands if you can&#x27;t get to the sink.&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> for my Mom who is elderly this is very soothing and cleansing - hygiene with ease, no strong scent, easy.</li>
            <li> I have a spine injury and am not able to always take a shower as often as I want and certainly not able to walk to the sink to wash my hands as often as I want (I&#x27;m a hand-washing freak) so this is a great product for me. I have major allergies and have never had a reaction. Great for anyone who can&#x27;t get to running water.</li>
            <li> Had this in hospital after my 2nd child was born 15 years ago!  I saved my bottle and coddled it thinking it wasn&#x27;t sold anywhere. I was wrong. Lol. HOWEVER, in my defense, it doesn&#x27;t go bad!!!!  I&#x27;m not a rancid cleanser user!  It can be used a waterless shampoo, or a personal cleanser. Smells nice. It does come in a foam so use a 1/2 pump first. It goes a long way. I poured my new liquid in the old bottle. I&lt;br /&gt;They changed the look. I&#x27;m sentimental ok?😁</li>
            <li> Introduced to product duiring hospital stay and have continued using it since.  So easy to use and none irritating like other body washes.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive (then I would give it 5 stars).</li>
            <li> My 97 year old grandmother uses this is the shower. It cleans really well and smells nice. It is so expensive though :(</li>
            <li> I take care of my husband who has advanced dementia and cannot use the bathroom.  Every time I change his adult diaper between showers, I use this to wash him up.  It cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t need to be rinsed off.  It is easy on his skin.  When the time comes that he can no longer go into the shower, I can use it as a shampoo too.</li>
            <li> My first experience with this product was 7 years ago after giving birth to my daughter.  It&#x27;s the only product that is mild and strong enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent body cleansing product. Will gladly purchase again. Thanks</li>
            <li> The product works very well.  It is convenient and easy to use.  If you don&#x27;t have access to water it is a good way to clean up.  If for whatever reason you cannot get in the shower or tub this works well.  You can use it as a shampoo and a skin cleanser.  Also cleaning after the toilet.  No rinsing needed.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Really helps when things are tender, or not normal.Very kind to tender skin. Takes very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> While this cleansing foam is not cheap, it goes a long way.  It is also gentle on the skin even if it is not rinsed off.  It is a wonderful product for invalids and makes life easier for them.  According to the directions, it can also be used as a shampoo, but I have not tried this, so I cannot comment on that aspect.  I do recommend this Soap highly.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for spong baths. This all over body wash is exactly what I needed. I see why hospitals use it.</li>
            <li> This a great product for people who have trouble showering or bathing.  Much easier and clean without the mess of a bedbath for any caregiver.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Keeps me very clean in the winter when I can&#x27;t take a daily shower because of the frigid temps.I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M MY WIFES CARE GIVER, (SHE SUFFERS WITH DEMENTIA) ALOE VESTA MAKE MY JOB EASIER ON CLEANING HER BODY. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is for those occassions you need to freshen up but don&#x27;t have time or access for a full shower. Self foaming, nicely scented, anti-bacterial. PERFECT for babies, elders.</li>
            <li> Great product,  even hospitals use it.</li>
            <li> MY fathers CNA, in his hospice home, recommended this product for his sore, red, bottom. It worked wonders !! Very healing.</li>
            <li> This soap is one of the best products I have bought. I smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of oilly film. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very good product, useful for the infirm and all around good hygiene for daily use by anyone.</li>
            <li> Great Buy it does what&#x27;s supposed to , satisfied with my decision i  would recommend ! no regrets. hope it helps</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times. They used this on my wife as a body wash when she was in the hospital. It is a greet&lt;br /&gt;product, and very easy to use. Priced right, and delivered on time as promised. Give this product a try, I promise you&#x27;ll like it. I&lt;br /&gt;give this a A++++++++</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time while in the hospital a few months ago.  It totally cleared up my light acne.  So easy to use and so gentle on my skin.  I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Great all purpose body cleaner. First used it in the hospital and have been an avid user since</li>
            <li> It is an excellent stuff for using after the bath room and helps people who have some irritation after,  though I don&#x27;t but still use as a good hygienic foam. I think it is a great super product.Pradeep Berry</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product for patients, especially since it doesn&#x27;t require rinsing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly a substitute for hot, running water,,, but regular use can keep you clean, and your skin, healthy when a hot shower isn&#x27;t an option. :)</li>
            <li> This product is great for someone who can&#x27;t get in the shower do to limited mobility.  You use this stuff don&#x27;t have to rinse it you just put it on a cloth or paper towel and wash yourself as you normally would or would have someone assist you and get dressed and on your way.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this product while visiting a hospital and found that as many times as I had to use this product my skin felt moist&lt;br /&gt;and a ring-rash disappeared.  Jeanne</li>
            <li> Product is great not as happy with delivery bottle was 1/2 empty leaked</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vesta cleansing Foam has proven valuable in caring for my invalid mother-in-law who isn&#x27;t always able to have a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shampoo . While nothing can beat a good shower and shampoo this product has been very helpful in our situation.</li>
            <li> From camping to home-care, this cleanser works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this when I first got hit with RA and couldn&#x27;t get out of bed without agonizing pain, it was a God-send.  I was skeptical that it would clean and get rid of body-odor, but it did.  I bought a lot of cheap washcloths (white) and used those for cleansing.  Just throw the washcloths in with other towels in your wash and re-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it for my hair (long layered), it never felt clean.  I loved it for all over my body and especially underarms that stayed clean-smelling without deodorant.  Cuts through dirt and grease.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my face but will give it a try and also try again on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use it again, now, since I&#x27;m hit with kidney problems.  Kidney problems makes urine smell bad...this works to get rid of the strange odor after using the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are bed-ridden, this works wonders to clean yourself while laying down. To have your body clean makes you feel a lot better about yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my super-sensitive skin, gets rid of strong odors, cuts through grime, no water/no rinse needed, works all over skin and hair, easy to transport, easy to use, smells nice without over-powering...EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Does the job without any skin reaction.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, on time shipment! I will use again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, ordered the 2 bottle set since I&#x27;ve not seen it in stores near me. My grandmother has limited mobility after broken hip no 2, and since leaving the nursing home she refuses to use anything else (even of that product family).</li>
            <li> I have tried the drug store equivalent of this product and believe me, they are not the same.  Aloe Vesta is more expensive and performs beautifully.</li>
            <li> Used for elderly, originally. Now using as hand and face cleanser. Medical/hospital grade product, not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Can use for quick, neck ,face and hand clean when in hurry.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use for washing! No water or rinsing required, just spray onto cloth and wipe area that needs cleaning.</li>
            <li> My Mom started using this in a rehab hopsital. She had a badly prolapsed rectum at the time, and this product was gentle enough to keep that very sensitive area clean and sanitary. She is VERY sensitive to many chemicals and fragrances, and this worked great. A quick side note for anyone dealing with a similar problem: don&#x27;t let anyone railroad you into surgery to fix such a problem. There are fabulous physical therapists out there that specialize in rehabilitating the pelvic floor (for both men and women). After the surgeon and several doctors said the outcome for fixing the problem and maintaining a good quality of life were almost none, we found a pelvic floor physical therapist who fixed the problem!!  Back to the product.... even though my Mom&#x27;s prolapse has been fixed, she liked the cleanser so much that she still has me order it for her to keep her general personal areas clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually use the stuff I have it used on me and I can tell you from experience it works a whole lot better than most</li>
            <li> They used this cleanser, when I had surgery in the hospital.  It is so easy to use, and you feel clean, and your skin feels so soft.  I don&#x27;t always have time to shower to get ready in a hurry.  So I keep a bottle of this Aloe Vesta on hand, and I feel clean and fresh, and ready to go!</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my hands after a round of golf. We normally finish the round after the other facilities are closed.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleansing Foam....especially for someone in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I needed this product post-surgery. Couldn&#x27;t find it in local pharmacies. Fortunately, Amazon could provide it at a reasonable price and with timely delivery. The product itself is excellent. It can be used both as a body wash and a shampoo. No rinsing required. I highly recommend this product if, like me, you can&#x27;t bath or shower following surgery.</li>
            <li> Good product, foam is convient, good cleansing product, a little goes a very long way, will buy again, when ready</li>
            <li> I use this for my Mom&#x27;s shampoo, bed baths and diaper area care. It doesn&#x27;t require rinsing when used on skin (although I do rinse her hair a bit because it tends to dry her scalp otherwise) and dissolves &amp; cleans away fecal matter quickly and easily. The foaming action is very handy for getting in crevices and folds without getting everywhere. It has little scent and is not irritating. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> have used product before, it is quality, and is used in hospitals in our area..Good price, too!  Thank you very much..</li>
            <li> An absolute necessity for home health care.</li>
            <li> Such an outstanding cleaning form when used for incontinence.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome....I am a nurse who recently had to take care of my Dad, who was recuperating from knee replacement surgery. I knew my hands were clean before donning gloves to change his dressings at home!!!</li>
            <li> I purchase this to help caregivers make sure my son gets his bottom clean.  It really works well!  Make sure you get the foam because the other is just to strong</li>
            <li> While the foam costs a bit more, it&#x27;s worth it.  Excellent product - works well, gentle on the skin, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Already knew and used this excellent product. Price and shipping was very good.</li>
            <li> Makes my life easier, caring for my son who is disabled.  And it smells nice and clean.  You don&#x27;t need to rinse with water when you use the cleansing foam but it is okay if you want too.</li>
            <li> This is the best for feeling fresh from head to toe.  Pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate even sensitive skin.. Used on toilet tissue, it will not clog up the pipes or cause irritation as many baby wipes do.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hygiene product for elder care or travel because it cleans gently without needing to be rinsed off.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I have found.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it all the time for my husband</li>
