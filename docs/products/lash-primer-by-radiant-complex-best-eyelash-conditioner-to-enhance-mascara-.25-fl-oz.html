            <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>:  I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>A very light hand is needed.</li>
            <li>This primer works more like an eye lash moisturizer than a primer.</li>
            <li>I have received this item at a great price for my complete and honest review.</li>
            <li>Will let you know more after more use.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I have used so many on Amazon and this primer is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am very excited about this product.</li>
            <li>This primer goes on easy and feels like it&#x27;s gliding onto my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>There is no color to this as it is a lash primer-which is fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product (made in America ;-)</li>
            <li>Its just a nice clean primer, and once mascara is applied, it really amps the lashes up!</li>
            <li>I also tried using this primer with a really cheap mascara ($1)</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smooth after primer application.</li>
            <li>so far so good I am liking how my lashes are looking</li>
            <li>I love this product and the results are VERY noticeable!</li>
            <li>Of course, I over applied my first time on one eye, but my other eye that I didn&#x27;t over apply on was perfect!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this Lash Primer by Radiant Complex.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just very pretty and defined.</li>
            <li>The primer seems to glide on my lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump and dries right away.</li>
            <li>Mascara removal is so much easier now at night; I&#x27;m no longer accidentally pulling out my lashes while trying to clean my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so very gratefully received this product for a slightly discounted price for an honest and unbiased review!</li>
            <li>I use this as my first coat, before applying my mascara.</li>
            <li>First use today.  </li>
            <li>First, I would like to say, &amp;#</li>
            <li>This is my first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li>Multiple coats would produce even more amazing results but for daily use I only apply one coat.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and takes only one application for me!</li>
            <li>It helps make my lashes look so much nicer than just mascara.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my lashes.</li>
            <li>It also makes the color of your mascara really stand out.</li>
            <li>I also love the packaging and the look of the product; other people might not care about this</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes long and thick and when I add mascara, they look so good!  </li>
            <li>and I used it with a more expensive mascara ($8)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better to use this primer with a more expensive brand, it came out nicer.</li>
            <li>This primer also comes in a bigger tube than most primers on the market and will last about 3 months.</li>
            <li>With this lash primer I was able to use a typical drug store brand and make it look like I had put on something couture and high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I put it on before my normal mascara and it completely lengthens my lashes!</li>
            <li>I have pretty short eyelashes, I often feel that mascara alone doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>the 3rd photo, I&#x27;m wearing the primer under my mascara on my right eye (left hand side) and jus mascara on my left eye (right hand side)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because this last primer from Radiant Complex has really taken my mascara to new</li>
            <li>And my eyelashes feel soft to the touch, not clumpy or waxy.</li>
            <li>My lashes look so long and full with this primer underneath, and it&#x27;s so simple to use I can put it on every day!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lashed were extra long &amp; full.</li>
            <li>It has a nice brush with wider spaces that really lay the primer down onto the lashes, and there aren&#x27;t the messy fibers!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry overly fast when applied, so you can quickly get your mascara on while it is still wet.</li>
            <li>I regularly use a face primer and an eye primer, so I figured it was high time</li>
            <li>I have longer lashes but this product majorly defines.  </li>
            <li>Primer&#x27;s coat the lashes with a clear drying white mascara like substance.</li>
            <li>It goes on white, but dries clear without being shiny or sticky.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands and this one is by far the nicest.</li>
            <li>apply, you only need to barely blink your lashes on the brush.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to thicken, it took forever to dry, and I used a blow dryer on my eye lashes, but still my lashes didn&#x27;t look any thicker.</li>
            <li> And you do need to let it dry</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Radiant Complex&#x27;s Lash Primer.</li>
            <li> I then apply mascara and have found I only need to apply half the mascara I was using before trying this primer!</li>
            <li> I think the other reviewers who had issues with this product clumping were using way too much or maybe had a poor mascara product they used afterwards.</li>
            <li> I do not find the product is difficult to remove, but feels the same as removing my normal mascara.  </li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long ways&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It makes each lash thicker when dry, allowing your mascara to go over lashes that appear much thicker and longer since it adds volume to the very thin ends of your lashes.</li>
            <li> The chemical in the product stings my eye a little when applying to lashes.</li>
            <li> I even used the brush from my dried out lancome lash primer-</li>
            <li> I usually apply 2 coats of primer, then add on my mascara (before primer dries).</li>
            <li> Game Changer for thick long lashes!  </li>
            <li> In the daytime, I keep my makeup subtle and simple, this primer makes my eyelashes look thicker and longer, but not being over dramatic.</li>
            <li> At least that is what a primer is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Some of the ones that are cheap and originate from Asia have been terrible, and others found in drug stores have fibers that somehow seem to flake and travel into my eyes!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look too thick, like I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always the skeptic but this stuff does make my seriously wimpy lashes grow longer.</li>
            <li> Going back to Chanel mascara base and waiting for my lashes to regrow.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this Lash Primer.  </li>
            <li> It almost makes them look like false lashes.</li>
            <li> I keep the over dramatic look for the night time makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use these because my brows and lashes aren&#x27;t terribly unruly or otherwise need help, but I wanted to see if it would improve my makeup application, and I like it alot.</li>
            <li> But it when I use it as a base it pumps up the volume of my mascara and helps prevent smudging during the day.</li>

            <li> There is no color to this as it is a lash primer-which is fine. What I don&#x27;t like is that this doesn&#x27;t seem to plump my lashes in preparation for mascara. Lancome makes a very nice lash primer and I assumed all lash primers were basically the same. I even used the brush from my dried out lancome lash primer-but it wasn&#x27;t the brush that was the problem. This primer works more like an eye lash moisturizer than a primer. Primer&#x27;s coat the lashes with a clear drying white mascara like substance. It makes each lash thicker when dry, allowing your mascara to go over lashes that appear much thicker and longer since it adds volume to the very thin ends of your lashes. At least that is what a primer is supposed to do. This didn&#x27;t seem to thicken, it took forever to dry, and I used a blow dryer on my eye lashes, but still my lashes didn&#x27;t look any thicker. I&#x27;ll go back to the Lancome lash primer which was out of stock when I made my purchase. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I was buying the forty dollar Lancome primer. This is just as good. I will say maybe you need one extra coat than Lancome requires. And you do need to let it dry but it only takes a minute. I&#x27;m using this with It&#x27;s So Big mascara and my teeny lashes have never looked longer. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a eyelash primer but since I use face and eyelid primer I figured why not!! I love this product and the results are VERY noticeable! I have longer lashes but this product majorly defines.  I use the primer and my mascara immediately after - without drying.  Multiple coats would produce even more amazing results but for daily use I only apply one coat.  I do not find the product is difficult to remove, but feels the same as removing my normal mascara.  Very satisfied and the price was great as well.</li>
            <li> Good eyelash primer. I like using this eyelash primer for my daytime makeup. In the daytime, I keep my makeup subtle and simple, this primer makes my eyelashes look thicker and longer, but not being over dramatic. I keep the over dramatic look for the night time makeup. I use this as my first coat, before applying my mascara. I usually apply 2 coats of primer, then add on my mascara (before primer dries). I do one eye at a time (as instructions state). This primer actually gives length to my eyelashes too. I also tried using this primer with a really cheap mascara ($1) and I used it with a more expensive mascara ($8), it&#x27;s better to use this primer with a more expensive brand, it came out nicer. I have received this item at a great price for my complete and honest review.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this Lash Primer by Radiant Complex. I actually have never used an eyelash primer before because I always like how my lashes look with mascara alone, so I just didn&#x27;t think I need it. But I am so glad I gave it a try! It helps make my lashes look so much nicer than just mascara. It almost makes them look like false lashes. They don&#x27;t look too thick, like I was expecting. They&#x27;re just very pretty and defined. You can even use it on your eyebrows to help keep them in place. It goes on white, but dries clear without being shiny or sticky. I&#x27;ve also been applying it before bed to both my lashes and my brows to help condition them. This stuff really is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 3rd photo, I&#x27;m wearing the primer under my mascara on my right eye (left hand side) and jus mascara on my left eye (right hand side) so you can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> First use today.  Can really tell a difference.  Lashes are thicker and longer.  Will let you know more after more use.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it as a primer for my majorlica majorca fiber lash mascara. It really helps my lashes. Mascara removal is so much easier now at night; I&#x27;m no longer accidentally pulling out my lashes while trying to clean my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply, you only need to barely blink your lashes on the brush. A very light hand is needed. Your lashes shouldn&#x27;t be covered in the white primer. I think the other reviewers who had issues with this product clumping were using way too much or maybe had a poor mascara product they used afterwards.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d1b695c8df165396d5c30f561946a120]] I regularly use a face primer and an eye primer, so I figured it was high time I got on the last primer train. I&#x27;m glad I did, because this last primer from Radiant Complex has really taken my mascara to new heights!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No mascara can meet every need, even high-priced ones. With this lash primer I was able to use a typical drug store brand and make it look like I had put on something couture and high quality. This primer goes on easy and feels like it&#x27;s gliding onto my eyelashes. It doesn&#x27;t add any extra clumps or cause my lashes to stick together so my mascara goes on perfectly! My lashes look so long and full with this primer underneath, and it&#x27;s so simple to use I can put it on every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and I am head over heels that this one tube has made every brand of mascara I own look 10 times better! I did receive this primer at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how great it makes my lashes look, nor does it effect my review.</li>
            <li> I love it! I put it on before my normal mascara and it completely lengthens my lashes! I have pretty short eyelashes, I often feel that mascara alone doesn&#x27;t do the job. This def changed that for me. It also makes the color of your mascara really stand out. I also love the packaging and the look of the product; other people might not care about this but I for some reason or another I do. I would without a doubt purchase this again! Great Find!&lt;br /&gt;I so very gratefully received this product for a slightly discounted price for an honest and unbiased review! So happy I did!</li>
            <li> I love this lash primer! I have tried several different brands and this one is by far the nicest. The primer seems to glide on my lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump and dries right away. I then apply mascara and have found I only need to apply half the mascara I was using before trying this primer! And my eyelashes feel soft to the touch, not clumpy or waxy. This primer also comes in a bigger tube than most primers on the market and will last about 3 months. I highly recommend Radiant Complex&#x27;s Lash Primer. Once you try it, you will never go without!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> NICE!  I have used several different eyelash primers prior to this one, and I just find with these you get what you pay for. Some of the ones that are cheap and originate from Asia have been terrible, and others found in drug stores have fibers that somehow seem to flake and travel into my eyes! ugg!.  But THIS product is WONDERFUL!~  It has a nice brush with wider spaces that really lay the primer down onto the lashes, and there aren&#x27;t the messy fibers! Its just a nice clean primer, and once mascara is applied, it really amps the lashes up! Love this stuff and I cant see applying mascara without it! Thanks for a great product (made in America ;-)</li>
            <li> I am super happy with this product! First, I would like to say, &amp;#34;a little goes a long ways&amp;#34;. The directions on the box say, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t over apply&amp;#34;. Of course, I over applied my first time on one eye, but my other eye that I didn&#x27;t over apply on was perfect! The lashed were extra long &amp; full. This is a great primer. I have only used it twice but I feel as though that is all it needs for a 5 star review. It doesn&#x27;t dry overly fast when applied, so you can quickly get your mascara on while it is still wet. The mascara goes on smooth after primer application. I am very happy with this product and I would recommend it. The tube is a good size too!</li>
            <li> If used as directed, your eyelashes look longer!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Game Changer for thick long lashes!  I can&#x27;t believe I have lived without this product!  Use any Mascara after applying this.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
            <li> This primer did not condition or strengthen my lashes. One morning, all the ends just broke off! Going back to Chanel mascara base and waiting for my lashes to regrow. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this Lash Primer.  The white liquid was caked up on brush.  Continues to be that way.</li>
            <li> The chemical in the product stings my eye a little when applying to lashes. But it when I use it as a base it pumps up the volume of my mascara and helps prevent smudging during the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use these because my brows and lashes aren&#x27;t terribly unruly or otherwise need help, but I wanted to see if it would improve my makeup application, and I like it alot.</li>
            <li> This is my first time I am using this product. so far so good I am liking how my lashes are looking and I want to continue to use this product and i want to see how my lash look. I am very excited about this product. I also received this product to do a review on it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t order, but would have loved too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always the skeptic but this stuff does make my seriously wimpy lashes grow longer. I&#x27;m quite a ways from the runway model lashes look but they are growing.</li>
            <li> GREAT Purchase!  It makes my lashes long and thick and when I add mascara, they look so good!  I have used so many on Amazon and this primer is my favorite.  Easy to apply and takes only one application for me!</li>
            <li> This is a great primer...mascara stays on all day without flaking or smudging it coats every lash</li>
