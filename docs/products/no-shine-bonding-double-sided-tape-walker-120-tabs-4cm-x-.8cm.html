            <li> I make my tape extensions out of clip on for the fact that tape extensions cost an arm and a leg...i love these. They aren&#x27;t stiff like some tapes or anything like that. They really stick for the full time. Just know that when time comes to remove them you definitely need the citrus solvent or you will have a mess on your hands, or head i should say. They last me almost 4 months but my hair grows like an inch every millennium!</li>
            <li> The hold is great and they are very comfortable! Amazing price and service!! Definitely purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I got the tape delivered quickly. The service was great. However, I used this for tape in extensions with a client. I wasn&#x27;t too happy in the long run when she came back in for a retouch. After this experience I tried the no-shine rolled tape 1/2 inch double sided tape and that held in better, sustained more weight, and it&#x27;s all I will use from this point forward.</li>
            <li> The double sided no shine bonding tape is great and holds extensions very well. I am impressed how well it works. It is the best I&#x27;ve found out there.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Works good for a long time</li>
            <li> Tried to cut costs by purchasing these tapes for my clients wefted hair extension. It didn&#x27;t stay in at all. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> Works great as long as you wait three days before washing to allow the tape time to adhere and you must your sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fell right out. Waste of money! DO NOT BUY. SPEND A FEW MORE DOLLARS ON THE REAL THING. DONT BUY</li>
            <li> Holds for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The tape is easy to apply to hair extensions.  They hold until I wash the hair and they fall right out as I shampoo.  They last for three days.</li>
            <li> I like the strong hold, I have had 3 fall out so far but I do believe it was the person who put them in and not the tape. I am going to redo my hair soon. Very happy with how fast they got to me!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy that product it is really NOT good at all  Tape dose not stay in hair. Big thumbs down</li>
            <li> Love it, fast delivery. I will order again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come loose</li>
            <li> Best tape ever!  These tapes stay on until you remove them.  The only problem is they are VERY sticky and a little bit hard to remove.  Once you remove the extension, you need to remove the tape from your hair.  On the plus side, you will never be embarrassed by an extension falling out :)</li>
            <li> easy for use , strong and remove fine</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK....AT ALL!!! Tape is so tiny that there is no way it would hold anything let along small wefts of hair. Does not hold at all and comes right out when hair is damp :( WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
