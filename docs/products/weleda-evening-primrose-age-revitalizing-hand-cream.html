    <ol>
            <li>This is the best hand cream, period.</li>
            <li>Excellent hand cream I&#x27;ve been using since I found Weleda Products while living abroad.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the best hand creams.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best!  </li>
            <li>Hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>Best hand cream.</li>

            <li>Makes my hands smell and feel great!  </li>
            <li>Very good moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Works great for healing</li>
            <li>Great stuff, smells like oranges</li>
            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>Told my hub, the wrinkles on my hands seemed to go away (am sure it&#x27;s a temporary thing), but the consistency is wonderful....</li>
            <li>I love introducing this hand cream to friends; mames a great gift!</li>
            <li>To be fair, my hands are in water a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Skin Food on my hands to good effect.</li>
            <li>I rubs in better than Skin Food, though that lotion is great, too.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and not at all sticky.</li>
            <li>Seems my friend liked it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice light cream with a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a pleasant light citrus smell to it</li>
            <li>delightful fragrance, soothing, not greasy and a complete winner!</li>
            <li>Product came in a very timely manner, but it is not of a very good quality.</li>
            <li>I like it because it does not leave your skin oily and also the fragrance is so light and smells so good.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice and the consistency is just right.  </li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I will surely buy again.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best hand cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love the Sea Buckthorn hand cream.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the feel of this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of lotions over the years and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It does moisturize to an okay level, but I would prefer something that feels more hydrating.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely and unique scent.</li>
            <li>Smell is fantastic, absorbing rate unmatched, and hands feel so smooth and good.</li>
            <li>I especially love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the excessive chemical and petroleum additives many drugstore-bought hand creams do.  </li>
            <li>My hands felt silky smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light lemony/lemon grass/ herbal smell.</li>
            <li>The result is smoother hands and the smell is unique - citrus with a twist someone commented.</li>
            <li>This product has a light but sickly sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Light orange scent is nice, natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>which kind of makes my skin tone on my hands slightly more yellow when I apply it.</li>
            <li>Works really well and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Non-oily cream soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Cream absorbs quickly and leaves NO greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I found that it does absorb into my skin quickly, but seems to require a lot of lotion before my hands feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this company and I had high hopes for this hand cream.</li>
            <li>B00957WZNE Sea Buckthorn Oil]] is an amazing ingredient that was used by Russian cosmonauts to help alleviate their radiation burns.  </li>
            <li>You might be thrown off by the color of the cream and say: no way this has no artificial coloring added.</li>
            <li>and it immediately is absorbed....</li>
            <li>Buy every month with S and S. Good value for money spent.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and uplifting.</li>
            <li>Still left kind of a sticky waxy coating on the hands.  </li>
            <li>I will try some of Weleda&#x27;s other products, the pomegranate hand cream seems like it might be a better smelling and better moisturizing choice.</li>
            <li>Although each is for different applications (hand vs feet), I&#x27;ve had other hand creams which are just as good or better.</li>
            <li>I like Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food better which is why I only gave this 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The first tube I purchased came with a pair.  </li>
            <li>But, Skin Food is definitely better for very dry hands.</li>
            <li>Buckthorn berries are naturally very orange and are known for its healing power.</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my hands.  </li>
            <li>Gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is very hydrating and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a good hand cream should contain alcohol and if they do contain alcohol, it should certainly not be the third ingredient on the list.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The smell is incredibly powerful and citrus-y and the actual cream itself</li>
            <li>I used this product for several months and when I ran out I realized that I needed some more as my hands were getting so dry.</li>
            <li>It is just right for daily use.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003CYFC18 Weleda Sea Buckthorn Hand Cream]] is natural and works very well at keeping my hard-working hands soft.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li>This product is all natural (as all other weleda products), which is fantastic thing.</li>
            <li>Washed my hands a second time and finally felt clean.  </li>
            <li>And yes, all Weleda products are natural and produced without animal testing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural ingredients and lack of an overpowering perfume scent are also reason to purchase this.</li>
            <li>The smell is so pungent that it would prevent me from using it very often, especially in the company of others, and I am not going to be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not necessarily a bad product, but I am sorry to say that I did not find anything special about it either.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant but completely artificial.  </li>
            <li>Super moisturizing but not to heavy.</li>
            <li>The body lotion is more watery and the shower cream is weak.</li>
            <li>It has a very sharp smell and on a long term, it tends to dry out hands more than moisturizing them.</li>
            <li>Soft enough to use on body..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky at first, but it absorbs quickly and that goes away although you can definitely still feel it, like a faint residue, on your hands for a bit afterwards.</li>
            <li>Weleda Sea Buckthorn Hand Lotion has healed dry cuticles and made my hands very softer than any other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product came in a very timely manner, but it is not of a very good quality. It has a very sharp smell and on a long term, it tends to dry out hands more than moisturizing them. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great for healing</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream, period. Smell is fantastic, absorbing rate unmatched, and hands feel so smooth and good. And yes, all Weleda products are natural and produced without animal testing.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several months and when I ran out I realized that I needed some more as my hands were getting so dry. I like it because it does not leave your skin oily and also the fragrance is so light and smells so good. I will buy it again and may try some of the other Weleda products.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream. I have rough hands and this cream provides all the moisture I need without all the grease. And did I mention the smell. This product is all natural (as all other weleda products), which is fantastic thing. You might be thrown off by the color of the cream and say: no way this has no artificial coloring added. But google buckthorn berry and you will see why this cream is that orange. Buckthorn berries are naturally very orange and are known for its healing power. The cream is packaged in a metal tube which can be recycled. Although I wish they had a bigger tube. I will surely buy again.</li>
            <li> While I made the purchase based on the recommendation of someone else, I must say it exceeded my expectations...delightful fragrance, soothing, not greasy and a complete winner!</li>
            <li> During the winter the tips of my fingers always tend to get rough and dry.... and this is the ONLY lotion I have tried that actually helps remedy and not mask the problem.  I have tried other Weleda products in the past and was never terribly impressed, but after trying a tester of this from Whole Foods I was hooked!  The lotion has a pleasant light citrus smell to it and it immediately is absorbed.... unlike using Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food that leaves your skin sticky and oily.  It&#x27;s natural ingredients and lack of an overpowering perfume scent are also reason to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and I really haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my hands.  To be fair, my hands are in water a lot and I don&#x27;t always put the cream on every time after my hands have been in water.</li>
            <li> Gentle fragrance. Non-oily cream soaks in quickly. Softening lasts a couple of hours. Very little needed each application.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and not at all sticky. I like Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food better which is why I only gave this 4 stars. Although each is for different applications (hand vs feet), I&#x27;ve had other hand creams which are just as good or better. I&#x27;ve also used Skin Food on my hands to good effect.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best hand cream I have ever used. I try lots of different brands and keep coming back to this one. A bit pricey but you only need a small amount. Absorbs faster than any cream out there. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems my friend liked it. She smelled it, tested it, and her facial expression did not indicate that it smelled \\&quot;funky\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, looks like I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Upon application of this product my hands actually felt drier. Subsequent applications only worsened dryness. I read the ingredients label and noticed the third ingredient is alcohol. I don&#x27;t think a good hand cream should contain alcohol and if they do contain alcohol, it should certainly not be the third ingredient on the list. The fragrance is pleasant but completely artificial.  I would expect this from a 50mL hand cream that is $1.99 from the drugstore, but not something I paid $8.80. I will not repurchase or recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, smells like oranges</li>
            <li> A great product.  Cream absorbs quickly and leaves NO greasy residue.  Light orange scent is nice, natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream I&#x27;ve been using since I found Weleda Products while living abroad. We buy several tubes regularly, it&#x27;s the only thing my husband will use!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use hand cream often but if I do I use this!~Weleda Sea Buckthorn Hand Cream, 1.7 Ounce.......It takes very little and will last forever!~I would buy this again!~</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hand creams. Works really well and will be ordering more. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the Sea Buckthorn hand cream. It is just right for daily use. Not greasy and soaks in fast. This seems lighter duty than the Skin Food. I use that at night and this during the day.</li>
            <li> I agree with a reviewer- it&#x27;s a small tube but all you need is a drop-sized amount and it works! The result is smoother hands and the smell is unique - citrus with a twist someone commented. Yes, it&#x27;s very expensive but VERY high quality product. The body lotion is more watery and the shower cream is weak.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best!  i use it in the winter for chapped hands, after gardening or working with clay, or just because.</li>
            <li> This product has a light but sickly sweet scent. I found that it does absorb into my skin quickly, but seems to require a lot of lotion before my hands feel hydrated. After about an hour or after washing my hands, another application is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not necessarily a bad product, but I am sorry to say that I did not find anything special about it either.</li>
            <li> Tried sample in the store, and had to purchase. Told my hub, the wrinkles on my hands seemed to go away (am sure it&#x27;s a temporary thing), but the consistency is wonderful....a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying this on my rosacea too.  Hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> Weleda Sea Buckthorn Hand Lotion has healed dry cuticles and made my hands very softer than any other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It also has a lovely and unique scent. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel of this hand cream. Soft enough to use on body.. Or even face if need be. Buy every month with S and S. Good value for money spent.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing but not to heavy. Smells fresh and uplifting.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003CYFC18 Weleda Sea Buckthorn Hand Cream]] is natural and works very well at keeping my hard-working hands soft.  I especially love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the excessive chemical and petroleum additives many drugstore-bought hand creams do.  The scent is also nice and subtle.  [[ASIN:B00957WZNE Sea Buckthorn Oil]] is an amazing ingredient that was used by Russian cosmonauts to help alleviate their radiation burns.  It&#x27;s high in pro-vitamin A, vitamin E, and essential fatty acids.  I keep a tube of this in my bag at all times.  While this hand cream is a bit pricey, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found this cream to be sticky.  I left it on for an hour and it stayed sticky.  I had to wash my hands to get it off. Still left kind of a sticky waxy coating on the hands.  Washed my hands a second time and finally felt clean.  My hands felt silky smooth then.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think this would be my fav as I cant do anything with sticky hands, the cream doesnt absorb and it feels yucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light lemony/lemon grass/ herbal smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of lotions over the years and this is my favorite.  I prefer to use it before bed with a pair of cotton gloves.  The first tube I purchased came with a pair.  The fragrance is very nice and the consistency is just right.  I rubs in better than Skin Food, though that lotion is great, too.</li>
            <li> I usually use Weleda Skin Food, but thought I&#x27;d try something new. This is a nice light cream with a pleasant fragrance. But, Skin Food is definitely better for very dry hands. It seems this cream does not provide lasting moisturization.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream. No greasy feeling. Very good moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this company and I had high hopes for this hand cream. However, it smells and feels on your hands as if you had just peeled and eaten an orange. It&#x27;s a bit sticky at first, but it absorbs quickly and that goes away although you can definitely still feel it, like a faint residue, on your hands for a bit afterwards. The smell is incredibly powerful and citrus-y and the actual cream itself is yellow which kind of makes my skin tone on my hands slightly more yellow when I apply it. It does moisturize to an okay level, but I would prefer something that feels more hydrating.The smell is so pungent that it would prevent me from using it very often, especially in the company of others, and I am not going to be repurchasing. I will try some of Weleda&#x27;s other products, the pomegranate hand cream seems like it might be a better smelling and better moisturizing choice.</li>
            <li> The best stuff for peeling hands</li>
            <li> Makes my hands smell and feel great!  I love introducing this hand cream to friends; mames a great gift!</li>
            <li> This hand cream is very hydrating and not too greasy. I like the aluminum packaging too. I will buy more.</li>
