            <li>I give this great oil 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great biological oil that gives me moisture without looking greasy or making me breakout.  </li>
            <li>It looks great even in the day after a moment or two to absorb.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil is is supposed to be great for skin health, but I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt-</li>
            <li>and I put this on the bite and literally within hours the swelling was gone and the pain was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>- I got great results from this.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>The nutty fragrance is a welcome fragrance.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>Really good oil and great brand.</li>
            <li>Used it after a shockingly successful treatment with Curaderm BEC5.</li>
            <li>I waited a while to review this oil so that I could be fair.  </li>
            <li>Good news is, Tamanu oil didn&#x27;t cause any breakage.</li>
            <li>They say it is good for insect bites, rashes and to keep the skin moisturized</li>
            <li>But the oil is a nice product and the price is great.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t let that deter you it feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be good for sun damage...    </li>
            <li>I used oxygenated olive oil, Amerigel,(a good soothing product)</li>
            <li>Doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I found calendula superior  </li>
            <li>Good at getting rid of blemishes and healing pimples that I popped without leaving a scar</li>
            <li>The oil looks and smells good,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and believe it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good service and packaging.</li>
            <li>All this is well and good, but there is a bonus benefit that I am very pleased about.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the Mountain Rose brand, so I can&#x27;t comment on their product, but I tend to find good info on their site.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality oil; I&#x27;m using it in my homemade moisturizer and my skin is in fantastic shape.</li>
            <li>The smell of this oil is amazing, think hazelnut coffee.</li>
            <li>Tamanu and Sunflower oils are suppose to be amazing for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent service.</li>
            <li>However, despite the thickness it has not clogged my pores and has done some nice healing on some scars I have.</li>
            <li>I had heard it helps heal the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>It helped nicely.  </li>
            <li>But after reading more about it, I read it is also good to use on the face.  </li>
            <li>:) he thought it was funny...due to the hair mop, I&#x27;m dropping my rating, I don&#x27;t use it often, but I&#x27;ll start again now that it&#x27;s winter, still smells good, not rancid after 15 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing so many good things about this oil.</li>
            <li>Combined with Rose Hip Oil</li>
            <li>After doing more research on Tamanu oil, I found that this is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Good ole caster oil is better for those.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really spectacular, just an another OK oil.</li>
            <li>However, I wish I didn&#x27;t mix it all up because I love the oil just on its own.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This is amazing works better than any acne cream.</li>
            <li>of all the brands i have tried this one is by far the best Tamanu oil out there.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using them each morning and evening and love</li>
            <li>Each morning I wake up with better looking skin.</li>
            <li>My acne isn&#x27;t gone, but I can tell my skin is doing better, and that counts for something.</li>
            <li>Skin seems to be softer, better hydrated.</li>
            <li>have also noticed that the quality of my skin between the pimples is better</li>
            <li>is going to stop the acne, it just helps make it more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and will purchase it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>LOVE xoxo &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>You cannot expect magic.</li>
            <li>You cannot expect magic.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;ll mix better.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>The color and tone is more even.</li>
            <li>use it every morning and love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not terrible.</li>
            <li>I was determined to find something to help her in a more organic way.  </li>
            <li>I have been using tamanu oil for about a year now on my face and love the results.  </li>
            <li>, so I did some more digging and came across this.</li>
            <li>But for the face I wanted an oil with more nutrients.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
            <li>It just seemed to sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>most importantly, I love putting it on my face.</li>
            <li>Also like to apply it to my lips, just make sure not to ingest.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Nails seem better</li>
            <li>found it works best if you alternate</li>
            <li>Otherwise I am a satisfied customer.-</li>
            <li>and appropriately I also use tea tree oil to promote skin healing and both work well with me.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is one of the best healing oils out there for clearing red marks and healing wounds.</li>
            <li>I do love the healing affects however and will continue to use it, just not on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is good but the cap broke opening it up the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very rich, and strongly scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s purported use is for anti-aging and moisturizing and it is wonderful for that; I like to mix it with my other oils for a potent elixir.</li>
            <li>I mix it with Grapeseed, Vitamine E, Jojoba, Sweet Almond, Rosehip a fragrance oil for a nice, light healing scented moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out with many carrier oils - despite the luxurious,thick feel - it goes on light and soaks in well.</li>
            <li>And most important, though it was costly...it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tamanu Oil is greasy when applied but gets absorbed nicely in 3-4 hours or over night.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu</li>
            <li>Mustard Oil is a strong oil</li>
            <li>It moisturizer fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also appears to be plumping up any fine lines I might have around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I liked jojoba as a general moisturizer and the unbleached oil has a nice nutty scent.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it helps my pimples heal MUCH more quickly</li>
            <li>Oils (coconut, tamanu) show great results for some people, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for genuine Tamanu oil...  </li>
            <li>This is very effective - more than other brand offered.</li>
            <li>Nice product of high quality and well packaged in a brown glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the oil to put on a tattoo I am getting lasered off.  </li>
            <li>I recently cured my own skin cancer and this oil was recommended for the healing of scar tissue, which is proving to work fantastically!</li>
            <li>to 1.5 weeks Review:&lt;br /&gt;I am getting used to seeing a brightly lit face in the morning in the white (6500k) light of mine.</li>
            <li>Such quick shipping and is nicely packaged so no leakage or anything like that!</li>
            <li>Will most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>seems effective, thanks very much</li>
            <li>I feel like I would have gorgeous skin, but it seems like Tamanu oil is only a part of that.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet, but the maple sugar scent goes away.  </li>
            <li>This product has a pretty strong \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; odor to it, but I do like the product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong at first and takes a bit of getting used to</li>
            <li>I use it on my face in the evening very lightly, then put my regular moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>SUPER IMPROVEMENT in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild ecema and this oil helps.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, have been using it for 10 years or more,.</li>
            <li>FYI, thickens very easily in coolish temps, but thins out fine when brought back to warmer room temperatures.</li>
            <li>Now several days later, the soreness is completely gone, my eyes still look bright and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely strong and not one I like too much</li>
            <li>In this dry weather it gives quite good moisture.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering another bottle for our first aid kit!</li>
            <li>This stuff is thicker than most oils I&#x27;ve used, and kind of a bluish black color.</li>
            <li>100% pure Tamanu  oil not diluted with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Provides fast healing of many skin</li>
            <li>more thing, it all started improving rapidly when I became aware that high blood sugar slows wound healing and took care to correct that.  </li>
            <li>used it on my heels,i got immediate results.smells funny at first , but the smell wears off and its by far the best thing ive used for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on both acne and scar diminishing products, this is by far the best solution for both</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t soften the skin even after it has been fully absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime NOTHING else has worked so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Whereas the others are a thinner consistency and are excellent for what their respective purposes are, this one is very thick and quite pungent - very strong nutty scent.</li>
            <li>Keep brushing the flakes (gently) off your skin to get rid of scars soon.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil should be applied on a clean skin.</li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s Organic Healing Moisturizing Balm (love the smell of that, too,...lavender-y) for a more substantial treatment (I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li>The dark oil on my skin vanished and my complexion looks so clear and bright!</li>
            <li>So glad I did my mommy research and was able to help my daughter fight teenage Acne in a natural way.</li>
            <li>On the health segment of the local news a doctor was asked what natural product would be good for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>really work wonders to help clear up my skin (acne) and make it look more</li>
            <li>but it certainly feels better than the castor oil, and the scars are less prominent after using it.</li>
            <li>this is a very reasonably priced bottle.</li>
            <li>so I tried tamanu body butter cream----It is wonderful &amp; it lasts much, much longer for same results &amp; less money</li>
            <li>I need something else in my routine or diet to help stop the pimples from forming in the first place, because it&#x27;s not looking like Tamanu oil</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the future..</li>
            <li>For softness mix it with your favorite cream (Only one cream at a time: night cream at night time and water based moisturizer in the morning</li>
            <li>I think in two more days my skin will be totally healed.  </li>
            <li>But it did, first the flesh under my toe name came off and</li>
            <li>Although, it will make your skin peel for the first time, I think that it might be the rejuvenation process.</li>
            <li>A previous bottle was fine, but I won&#x27;t order any more of this brand.</li>
            <li>The reaction was first noticed in my hands.</li>
            <li>When I woke the next morning, most of the soreness was gone and my eyes looked brighter than they had in weeks.</li>
            <li>So be aware of that if applying before going anywhere.</li>
            <li>has all but completely alleviated prior challenges with acne.</li>
            <li>but then it takes a while for toenails to grow back in healthy.</li>
            <li>my arm.&lt;br /&gt;I was foolish enough to try another brand (because the price was better), but wish I had just to stuck with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s appears oily at first</li>
            <li>I love the oil and have been putting it on my entire face rather than just on the Bec-5 treated spots.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works, Follow the instructions and it will work!</li>
            <li>Since it is a natural product, it may take its own time to heal the skin properly.</li>
            <li>Since it is a natural product, it may take its own time to heal the skin properly.</li>
            <li>Well white light unlike the soft white/yellow light tells me the reality of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li>So far so good, I&#x27;m using it twice a day with other oils in my roll on bottles.</li>
            <li>However, scars are still at large and the skin-flaking is there.</li>
            <li>However, scars are still at large and the skin-flaking is there.</li>
            <li>I bought their body butter too, for large areas like legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B003YDZON8 Life-flo Pure Tamanu Oil, 1-Ounce]]</li>
            <li>good to mix with other lotions for a major moisturising effect</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up when I found this Life Flo Pure Tamanu.  </li>
            <li>She had been using it regularly for about 3 months and what a huge difference with the amount of acne on her face.  </li>
            <li>and it really does help.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very noticeable</li>
            <li>how much faster they heal.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>So wash your skin gently before every application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;1st time application:&lt;br /&gt;It is very neutral on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I rub it in very well.  </li>
            <li>Unusual smell, but not obtrusive.  </li>
            <li>My skin absolutely glows</li>
            <li>was really working.  </li>
            <li>Lately, I don&#x27;t really have to wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I do not use sunscreen at all, but perhaps my use of tamanu oil has been the reason for me not getting much redness on my fact this summer.  </li>
            <li>Have not noticed any real change in my skin or my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing and seems to speed recovery.</li>
            <li>clears up nail fungus very well - takes time, but works</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t very convenient so I will be transferring the oil to a dropper bottle which will be easier to control how much oil to want to use.</li>
            <li>The real Tamanu heals them in 24 hours...</li>
            <li>It feels very soothing.  </li>
            <li>You only need a few drops - its potent stuff!!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong odor like old wet hay, so putting it on my toes and then covering with socks makes it tolerable.</li>
            <li>I have even added a small amount to my homemade body butter and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest as to how effective it is on scars as I have not used it long enough</li>
            <li>It takes so very little of it to be effective</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t particularly used it on scars either.</li>
            <li>It is not great but pleasant enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I used it in a blend with jojoba oil, but have since started using it on its own all over my face and following up with a little jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>I actually have to mix this with other essential oils like lavender and argan oil so that it is not so potent or strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Nuts are high in this amino acid</li>
            <li>I love the smell (reminds me of kukui nut oil, but a little thicker and darker color) and it seems to be helping my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it makes my skin dryer, so I have to use a little bit more moisturizer than normal around my mouth</li>
            <li>and is very soothing to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Your skin won&#x27;t absorb more than a few drops, that&#x27;s all it takes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not awful, it smells green.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase the Shea Terra brand</li>
            <li>Normally I have ALOT of swelling and pain when stung.</li>
            <li>is soft and clean (finally discovered how to make the skin soft with tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>Big Thing to keep in mind is that since it is an oil, if you don&#x27;t apply to clean skin (make sure your face and hands are clean) then dirt will get into the oil and small pimples will start to form, as an extra precaution I would regularly sanitize any wash cloth or lufa</li>
            <li>only seems to dry out my face (probably because it gets more exposure to air) and so on my chest I just use a normal moisturizer directly over the</li>
            <li>I finally live my skin after battling with acne for over 18 yrs.</li>
            <li>This stuff was wonderful until I developed a really bad reaction.</li>
            <li>Over the past 20 years, I have tried numerous natural topical products (I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s) and am excited to share that Tamanu Oil is what is working amazing for me - nothing else has ever come close.  </li>
            <li>I attribute my new clear skin to this product!</li>
            <li>It does make you skin very soft; however, it caused my face to break out, so I had to discontinue using it.  </li>
            <li>It has not made me break out as of yet, and when I wake up my face feels very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer here, I&#x27;ve been trying out various oils as rich facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Locally, all I could find was an oil &amp;#34;claiming&amp;#34; to be 100% pure Tamanu</li>
            <li>I have tried and still use Ultra Clear Emu oil during the day -</li>
            <li>So far no adverse reaction has happened.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure chapped lips completely but it has made me stop gorging on my lip balm frequently.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t soft though.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my nivea soft cream goes wellwith it).  </li>
            <li>I have read that tamanu can eliminate facial spider veins as well, but obviously it is much too soon to comment on that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anybody that wants to can write and ask me specific stuff as I am just rambling now.  </li>
            <li>After 5 days of using it the eczema is almost completely diminished.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter says it smells like raisins.</li>
            <li>After about an hour the smell is completely dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with tons of side effects OR natural, organic Tamanu Oil with NO side effects?  </li>
            <li>Does not do much for red bumps though..</li>
            <li>so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>Wow makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>my skin smoother and soft</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my kids when they are teenagers to see if it really works on teenage acne.  </li>
            <li>I had read somewhere that it has natural sunscreen properties.  </li>
            <li>Earlier this week, I awoke with the skin beneath one of my eyes very sore, as if I were getting a stye.</li>
            <li>I also had an abrasion on the bridge of my nose from my glasses and in two nights&#x27; applications of this oil, it has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>My skin felt moisturized and soft, and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been exactly 2 weeks, and already my acne has decreased, my complexion is more even, and all acne related cysts have healed in record time.</li>
            <li>(I just ordered a shower filter to get the chlorine out), and this is the only stuff that took away the itch (and I have many anti-itch creams, natural and pharmaceutical that usually work, but haven&#x27;t been working on my itchy face).</li>
            <li>Possibly it promotes healing because it is high in arginine, which promotes blood flow.</li>
            <li>Not only that it is pure natural or organic it actually works.</li>
            <li>This oil really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Absolute waste of money for a very pungent smelling liquid.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Tamanu Oil after reading an article about how it helps to heal skin and reduce pain from insect bites as well as promote general healing from scrapes.</li>
            <li>am planning on applying it on my skin regularly for a couple of weeks to see if the light and small scars on my face disappear.</li>
            <li>am planning on applying it on my skin regularly for a couple of weeks to see if the light and small scars on my face disappear.</li>
            <li>and was clear not greenish yellow and had zero odor.</li>
            <li>knowing I&#x27;m putting such quality natural products on my body.</li>
            <li>Have only used for a week so too early to tell if this will help.</li>
            <li>So far, the only scar I might have is from the biopsy.</li>
            <li>The small pimples and bumps didn&#x27;t grow into full ones!&lt;br /&gt;However, the old scars are still present.</li>
            <li>I have gone through a months long process and used many products I bought here at Amazon for the treatment of this slow healing wound.  </li>
            <li>Remember that just because it is an oil does not mean it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li>Shortly after, I was stung by a wasp also and quickly put a few drops on the affected area.</li>
            <li>After using the Tamanu, the swelling was minimal and the pain was not nearly as bad as other bee stings I have gotten.</li>
            <li>As a regular user of herbal, natural, homeopathy and other so called alternative approaches I am unsure whether this is a function of my particular chemistry or general inadequacy of the product and not living up to claims.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>But thanks to all the reviews on Amazon as well as on other portals online, I mustered strength to apply it on face.</li>
            <li>I apply it before bed to the back of my hands, and several darkish age spots have lightened almost completely.  </li>
            <li>the first few days I applied 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I do notice that I am a little more oily than usual</li>
            <li>Did not find this one bit useful for any other uses as stated by other viewers.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face and on some large scars that I&#x27;d previously treated with Castor oil (at the insistence of a relative who reads Edgar Cayce).</li>

            <li> I give this great oil 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great biological oil that gives me moisture without looking greasy or making me breakout.  </li>
            <li> It looks great even in the day after a moment or two to absorb.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is is supposed to be great for skin health, but I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt-</li>
            <li> and I put this on the bite and literally within hours the swelling was gone and the pain was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> - I got great results from this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> The nutty fragrance is a welcome fragrance.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> Really good oil and great brand.</li>
            <li> Used it after a shockingly successful treatment with Curaderm BEC5.</li>
            <li> I waited a while to review this oil so that I could be fair.  </li>
            <li> Good news is, Tamanu oil didn&#x27;t cause any breakage.</li>
            <li> They say it is good for insect bites, rashes and to keep the skin moisturized</li>
            <li> But the oil is a nice product and the price is great.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t let that deter you it feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be good for sun damage...    </li>
            <li> I used oxygenated olive oil, Amerigel,(a good soothing product)</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I found calendula superior  </li>
            <li> Good at getting rid of blemishes and healing pimples that I popped without leaving a scar</li>
            <li> The oil looks and smells good,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and believe it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good service and packaging.</li>
            <li> All this is well and good, but there is a bonus benefit that I am very pleased about.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the Mountain Rose brand, so I can&#x27;t comment on their product, but I tend to find good info on their site.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil; I&#x27;m using it in my homemade moisturizer and my skin is in fantastic shape.</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is amazing, think hazelnut coffee.</li>
            <li> Tamanu and Sunflower oils are suppose to be amazing for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent service.</li>
            <li> However, despite the thickness it has not clogged my pores and has done some nice healing on some scars I have.</li>
            <li> I had heard it helps heal the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> It helped nicely.  </li>
            <li> But after reading more about it, I read it is also good to use on the face.  </li>
            <li> :) he thought it was funny...due to the hair mop, I&#x27;m dropping my rating, I don&#x27;t use it often, but I&#x27;ll start again now that it&#x27;s winter, still smells good, not rancid after 15 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing so many good things about this oil.</li>
            <li> Combined with Rose Hip Oil</li>
            <li> After doing more research on Tamanu oil, I found that this is about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Good ole caster oil is better for those.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really spectacular, just an another OK oil.</li>
            <li> However, I wish I didn&#x27;t mix it all up because I love the oil just on its own.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This is amazing works better than any acne cream.</li>
            <li> of all the brands i have tried this one is by far the best Tamanu oil out there.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using them each morning and evening and love</li>
            <li> Each morning I wake up with better looking skin.</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t gone, but I can tell my skin is doing better, and that counts for something.</li>
            <li> Skin seems to be softer, better hydrated.</li>
            <li> have also noticed that the quality of my skin between the pimples is better</li>
            <li> is going to stop the acne, it just helps make it more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and will purchase it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> LOVE xoxo &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> You cannot expect magic.</li>
            <li> You cannot expect magic.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll mix better.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> The color and tone is more even.</li>
            <li> use it every morning and love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not terrible.</li>
            <li> I was determined to find something to help her in a more organic way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using tamanu oil for about a year now on my face and love the results.  </li>
            <li> , so I did some more digging and came across this.</li>
            <li> But for the face I wanted an oil with more nutrients.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
            <li> It just seemed to sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> most importantly, I love putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> Also like to apply it to my lips, just make sure not to ingest.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nails seem better</li>
            <li> found it works best if you alternate</li>
            <li> Otherwise I am a satisfied customer.-</li>
            <li> and appropriately I also use tea tree oil to promote skin healing and both work well with me.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is one of the best healing oils out there for clearing red marks and healing wounds.</li>
            <li> I do love the healing affects however and will continue to use it, just not on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The oil is good but the cap broke opening it up the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very rich, and strongly scented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purported use is for anti-aging and moisturizing and it is wonderful for that; I like to mix it with my other oils for a potent elixir.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Grapeseed, Vitamine E, Jojoba, Sweet Almond, Rosehip a fragrance oil for a nice, light healing scented moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out with many carrier oils - despite the luxurious,thick feel - it goes on light and soaks in well.</li>
            <li> And most important, though it was costly...it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tamanu Oil is greasy when applied but gets absorbed nicely in 3-4 hours or over night.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu</li>
            <li> Mustard Oil is a strong oil</li>
            <li> It moisturizer fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also appears to be plumping up any fine lines I might have around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I liked jojoba as a general moisturizer and the unbleached oil has a nice nutty scent.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it helps my pimples heal MUCH more quickly</li>
            <li> Oils (coconut, tamanu) show great results for some people, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for genuine Tamanu oil...  </li>
            <li> This is very effective - more than other brand offered.</li>
            <li> Nice product of high quality and well packaged in a brown glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the oil to put on a tattoo I am getting lasered off.  </li>
            <li> I recently cured my own skin cancer and this oil was recommended for the healing of scar tissue, which is proving to work fantastically!</li>
            <li> to 1.5 weeks Review:&lt;br /&gt;I am getting used to seeing a brightly lit face in the morning in the white (6500k) light of mine.</li>
            <li> Such quick shipping and is nicely packaged so no leakage or anything like that!</li>
            <li> Will most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> seems effective, thanks very much</li>
            <li> I feel like I would have gorgeous skin, but it seems like Tamanu oil is only a part of that.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, but the maple sugar scent goes away.  </li>
            <li> This product has a pretty strong \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; odor to it, but I do like the product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong at first and takes a bit of getting used to</li>
            <li> I use it on my face in the evening very lightly, then put my regular moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> SUPER IMPROVEMENT in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild ecema and this oil helps.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, have been using it for 10 years or more,.</li>
            <li> FYI, thickens very easily in coolish temps, but thins out fine when brought back to warmer room temperatures.</li>
            <li> Now several days later, the soreness is completely gone, my eyes still look bright and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely strong and not one I like too much</li>
            <li> In this dry weather it gives quite good moisture.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering another bottle for our first aid kit!</li>
            <li> This stuff is thicker than most oils I&#x27;ve used, and kind of a bluish black color.</li>
            <li> 100% pure Tamanu  oil not diluted with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Provides fast healing of many skin</li>
            <li> more thing, it all started improving rapidly when I became aware that high blood sugar slows wound healing and took care to correct that.  </li>
            <li> used it on my heels,i got immediate results.smells funny at first , but the smell wears off and its by far the best thing ive used for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on both acne and scar diminishing products, this is by far the best solution for both</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t soften the skin even after it has been fully absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime NOTHING else has worked so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Whereas the others are a thinner consistency and are excellent for what their respective purposes are, this one is very thick and quite pungent - very strong nutty scent.</li>
            <li> Keep brushing the flakes (gently) off your skin to get rid of scars soon.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil should be applied on a clean skin.</li>
            <li> Pure&#x27;s Organic Healing Moisturizing Balm (love the smell of that, too,...lavender-y) for a more substantial treatment (I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li> The dark oil on my skin vanished and my complexion looks so clear and bright!</li>
            <li> So glad I did my mommy research and was able to help my daughter fight teenage Acne in a natural way.</li>
            <li> On the health segment of the local news a doctor was asked what natural product would be good for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> really work wonders to help clear up my skin (acne) and make it look more</li>
            <li> but it certainly feels better than the castor oil, and the scars are less prominent after using it.</li>
            <li> this is a very reasonably priced bottle.</li>
            <li> so I tried tamanu body butter cream----It is wonderful &amp; it lasts much, much longer for same results &amp; less money</li>
            <li> I need something else in my routine or diet to help stop the pimples from forming in the first place, because it&#x27;s not looking like Tamanu oil</li>
            <li> I will buy more in the future..</li>
            <li> For softness mix it with your favorite cream (Only one cream at a time: night cream at night time and water based moisturizer in the morning</li>
            <li> I think in two more days my skin will be totally healed.  </li>
            <li> But it did, first the flesh under my toe name came off and</li>
            <li> Although, it will make your skin peel for the first time, I think that it might be the rejuvenation process.</li>
            <li> A previous bottle was fine, but I won&#x27;t order any more of this brand.</li>
            <li> The reaction was first noticed in my hands.</li>
            <li> When I woke the next morning, most of the soreness was gone and my eyes looked brighter than they had in weeks.</li>
            <li> So be aware of that if applying before going anywhere.</li>
            <li> has all but completely alleviated prior challenges with acne.</li>
            <li> but then it takes a while for toenails to grow back in healthy.</li>
            <li> my arm.&lt;br /&gt;I was foolish enough to try another brand (because the price was better), but wish I had just to stuck with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s appears oily at first</li>
            <li> I love the oil and have been putting it on my entire face rather than just on the Bec-5 treated spots.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works, Follow the instructions and it will work!</li>
            <li> Since it is a natural product, it may take its own time to heal the skin properly.</li>
            <li> Since it is a natural product, it may take its own time to heal the skin properly.</li>
            <li> Well white light unlike the soft white/yellow light tells me the reality of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m using it twice a day with other oils in my roll on bottles.</li>
            <li> However, scars are still at large and the skin-flaking is there.</li>
            <li> However, scars are still at large and the skin-flaking is there.</li>
            <li> I bought their body butter too, for large areas like legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B003YDZON8 Life-flo Pure Tamanu Oil, 1-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> good to mix with other lotions for a major moisturising effect</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up when I found this Life Flo Pure Tamanu.  </li>
            <li> She had been using it regularly for about 3 months and what a huge difference with the amount of acne on her face.  </li>
            <li> and it really does help.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very noticeable</li>
            <li> how much faster they heal.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> So wash your skin gently before every application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;1st time application:&lt;br /&gt;It is very neutral on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I rub it in very well.  </li>
            <li> Unusual smell, but not obtrusive.  </li>
            <li> My skin absolutely glows</li>
            <li> was really working.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I don&#x27;t really have to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I do not use sunscreen at all, but perhaps my use of tamanu oil has been the reason for me not getting much redness on my fact this summer.  </li>
            <li> Have not noticed any real change in my skin or my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing and seems to speed recovery.</li>
            <li> clears up nail fungus very well - takes time, but works</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t very convenient so I will be transferring the oil to a dropper bottle which will be easier to control how much oil to want to use.</li>
            <li> The real Tamanu heals them in 24 hours...</li>
            <li> It feels very soothing.  </li>
            <li> You only need a few drops - its potent stuff!!</li>
            <li> It has a very strong odor like old wet hay, so putting it on my toes and then covering with socks makes it tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have even added a small amount to my homemade body butter and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest as to how effective it is on scars as I have not used it long enough</li>
            <li> It takes so very little of it to be effective</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t particularly used it on scars either.</li>
            <li> It is not great but pleasant enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I used it in a blend with jojoba oil, but have since started using it on its own all over my face and following up with a little jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> I actually have to mix this with other essential oils like lavender and argan oil so that it is not so potent or strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Nuts are high in this amino acid</li>
            <li> I love the smell (reminds me of kukui nut oil, but a little thicker and darker color) and it seems to be helping my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that it makes my skin dryer, so I have to use a little bit more moisturizer than normal around my mouth</li>
            <li> and is very soothing to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Your skin won&#x27;t absorb more than a few drops, that&#x27;s all it takes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not awful, it smells green.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the Shea Terra brand</li>
            <li> Normally I have ALOT of swelling and pain when stung.</li>
            <li> is soft and clean (finally discovered how to make the skin soft with tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Big Thing to keep in mind is that since it is an oil, if you don&#x27;t apply to clean skin (make sure your face and hands are clean) then dirt will get into the oil and small pimples will start to form, as an extra precaution I would regularly sanitize any wash cloth or lufa</li>
            <li> only seems to dry out my face (probably because it gets more exposure to air) and so on my chest I just use a normal moisturizer directly over the</li>
            <li> I finally live my skin after battling with acne for over 18 yrs.</li>
            <li> This stuff was wonderful until I developed a really bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Over the past 20 years, I have tried numerous natural topical products (I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s) and am excited to share that Tamanu Oil is what is working amazing for me - nothing else has ever come close.  </li>
            <li> I attribute my new clear skin to this product!</li>
            <li> It does make you skin very soft; however, it caused my face to break out, so I had to discontinue using it.  </li>
            <li> It has not made me break out as of yet, and when I wake up my face feels very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer here, I&#x27;ve been trying out various oils as rich facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Locally, all I could find was an oil &amp;#34;claiming&amp;#34; to be 100% pure Tamanu</li>
            <li> I have tried and still use Ultra Clear Emu oil during the day -</li>
            <li> So far no adverse reaction has happened.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure chapped lips completely but it has made me stop gorging on my lip balm frequently.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t soft though.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my nivea soft cream goes wellwith it).  </li>
            <li> I have read that tamanu can eliminate facial spider veins as well, but obviously it is much too soon to comment on that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anybody that wants to can write and ask me specific stuff as I am just rambling now.  </li>
            <li> After 5 days of using it the eczema is almost completely diminished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter says it smells like raisins.</li>
            <li> After about an hour the smell is completely dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with tons of side effects OR natural, organic Tamanu Oil with NO side effects?  </li>
            <li> Does not do much for red bumps though..</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> Wow makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> my skin smoother and soft</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my kids when they are teenagers to see if it really works on teenage acne.  </li>
            <li> I had read somewhere that it has natural sunscreen properties.  </li>
            <li> Earlier this week, I awoke with the skin beneath one of my eyes very sore, as if I were getting a stye.</li>
            <li> I also had an abrasion on the bridge of my nose from my glasses and in two nights&#x27; applications of this oil, it has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> My skin felt moisturized and soft, and I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been exactly 2 weeks, and already my acne has decreased, my complexion is more even, and all acne related cysts have healed in record time.</li>
            <li> (I just ordered a shower filter to get the chlorine out), and this is the only stuff that took away the itch (and I have many anti-itch creams, natural and pharmaceutical that usually work, but haven&#x27;t been working on my itchy face).</li>
            <li> Possibly it promotes healing because it is high in arginine, which promotes blood flow.</li>
            <li> Not only that it is pure natural or organic it actually works.</li>
            <li> This oil really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Absolute waste of money for a very pungent smelling liquid.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Tamanu Oil after reading an article about how it helps to heal skin and reduce pain from insect bites as well as promote general healing from scrapes.</li>
            <li> am planning on applying it on my skin regularly for a couple of weeks to see if the light and small scars on my face disappear.</li>
            <li> am planning on applying it on my skin regularly for a couple of weeks to see if the light and small scars on my face disappear.</li>
            <li> and was clear not greenish yellow and had zero odor.</li>
            <li> knowing I&#x27;m putting such quality natural products on my body.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a week so too early to tell if this will help.</li>
            <li> So far, the only scar I might have is from the biopsy.</li>
            <li> The small pimples and bumps didn&#x27;t grow into full ones!&lt;br /&gt;However, the old scars are still present.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a months long process and used many products I bought here at Amazon for the treatment of this slow healing wound.  </li>
            <li> Remember that just because it is an oil does not mean it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Shortly after, I was stung by a wasp also and quickly put a few drops on the affected area.</li>
            <li> After using the Tamanu, the swelling was minimal and the pain was not nearly as bad as other bee stings I have gotten.</li>
            <li> As a regular user of herbal, natural, homeopathy and other so called alternative approaches I am unsure whether this is a function of my particular chemistry or general inadequacy of the product and not living up to claims.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> But thanks to all the reviews on Amazon as well as on other portals online, I mustered strength to apply it on face.</li>
            <li> I apply it before bed to the back of my hands, and several darkish age spots have lightened almost completely.  </li>
            <li> the first few days I applied 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I do notice that I am a little more oily than usual</li>
            <li> Did not find this one bit useful for any other uses as stated by other viewers.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and on some large scars that I&#x27;d previously treated with Castor oil (at the insistence of a relative who reads Edgar Cayce).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right color, has the slightly nutty odor it&#x27;s supposed to have and works like a charm to heal any nick or cut or rough spot!  </li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way you don&#x27;t need much product.</li>
            <li> I killed the infection, MRSA, long ago with Manuka honey, and before that when it was very big and very sore, I used poultices of activated charcoal or bentonite clay.  </li>
            <li> It is very much like a thick oil it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> : The dark coloring of scars will fade after a few weeks, in certain areas I can barely see scars at all after a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> that I think this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> She has normal colored skin and few acne spots remaining.  </li>
            <li> Diet plays a major role in controlling or eliminating rosacea symptoms, but topicals can also be extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li> I know the frustration and disappointment of having tried so many different products that have worked for others, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> Patch test not only on the inner elbow, but if using on the face on an area behind the ear or on the side of the face for 24 hours first and on another area cover another patch with whatever mix of other products such as sunscreens or foundation one might use to see if there is cross reactivity.  </li>
            <li> I recently had 3 surgeries on my face and saw that this was recommended by several people for dealing with scars and other issues.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell...not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> But do far I like it because a little bit goes a long ways</li>
            <li> I still had some swelling and pain, but it was minor.</li>
            <li> It has a strange &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell that I did not care for.</li>
            <li> it is a rather thick, nutty oil that is very nourishing and</li>
            <li> I am in the final stages of closing all the little open spots in the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is unclear whether it is the derivation from nuts or some other aspect, but a valuable function of these reviews is that those who have specific sensitivities can make their experience known to others.  </li>
            <li> This was after trying numerous other over the counter scar treatments and silicone strips.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to clear up my hormonal acne, from OTC chemical laden things, to raw honey.</li>
            <li> did dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Or if my face is really dry</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t agree with the claims that Tamanu oil doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on skin after application or that it is a dry oil.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and dry lips a couple of times a week using a cotton ball</li>
            <li> I do still use it for dry patchy areas on my legs as I suffer from ezcema and it does help heal those areas.  </li>
            <li> She had red/purple areas of her skin at times, dry and flaky skin and nothing</li>
            <li> The redness, the dry, flaky skin is all gone.  </li>
            <li> I applied a very little amount, 3-4 drops, on my entire face and neck but my skin (facial, neck&#x27;s and hands&#x27;) still looks and feels greasy even after massaging oil into it.</li>
            <li> If youa re having skin issues ~ rash, redness, dry or cracked skin ~ give this oil a try!</li>
            <li> A weeks use and my skin was no longer dry and rough..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little less than a month and my scar is completely gone.</li>
            <li> but high amounts are not good for everyone.  </li>
            <li> After I wash my face, I apply the tamanu while my face is still wet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it does seem to help my rough skin patches.</li>
            <li> Saw changes after a few months of use on a relative.  </li>
            <li> A few drops on the hands beneath my regular hand cream leaves them moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> applying to stretch marks daily after showering for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> No real improvement in scar fading.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very desirable</li>
            <li> When I add it to other oils it sinks to the bottom</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for general moisturizing on my face- mix it with a lighter oil or a lotion if it is too heavy for your skin.</li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a serious change in my skin.</li>
            <li> but it works, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Not good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But, it didn&#x27;t prevent the already present ultra small pimples and minute bumps on skin from dying out.</li>
            <li> I will definitely add to my usual skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> Especially since it is winter time and a lot drier that usual.</li>
            <li> Maybe after a year of use, I would see improvement but decided to seek other remedies instead..  </li>
            <li> My face swelled up and was extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> I didnt mix with any other oils..</li>
            <li> It absorbs quicker than other oils</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.</li>
            <li> I can compare it to other oils though.</li>
            <li> It is also used for other things...</li>
            <li> Those who have ever had herpes canker outbreaks whether in the mouth or on the body should be extremely cautious if not avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I carefulkly read reviews from other users then ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I also tried Seabuckthorn oil, but I disliked the smell (the tamanu oil doesn&#x27;t bother me at all) and it seemed to dry and irritate my skin as well.  </li>
            <li> Use the honey if you have an active infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and it works well!!</li>
            <li> Although this is not cheap, a little bit can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I have had a pretty bad reaction on my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> A very little bit of this goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> apply this to both my face and chest after scrubbing down</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and not a watered down version or copy.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thicker than say other oils like jojoba or grape see.</li>
            <li> , I hardly used 10 times over last few months</li>
            <li> They just heal faster, and leave less</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use less of it</li>
            <li> My skin is much less reactive as well.  </li>
            <li> I am now noticing less wrinkles as well as less redness on my face.</li>
            <li> Once a month I may get slight acne, but if I apply the tamanu oil, it is gone by morning.  </li>
            <li> This oil does have a very weird scent to it, like a nutty, smokey aroma, however it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to and fades rather fast.</li>
            <li> It has a slight earthy/herbal smell to it which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Reduces nerve pain and after one week a mole is half way gone.</li>
            <li> I used this product as suggested for toe nail fungus and the fungus cleared up about half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> It looks a little odd, but put that aside.</li>
            <li> My husband had a really bad rash and it helped heal it tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Also, a small pea sized amount is all you need for the face, so the bottle should last at least 6 months if used 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I had some chemical burns after doing a glycol peel of 50% which left a long, nasty scar running down the contour of my cheek to the right side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is a little astringent, so if you have oily skin like I do it seems to help control the oil.</li>
            <li> no matter how little I used.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very dry and itchy lately</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this with a few drops of manuka oil, rub thoroughly and go to bed.</li>
            <li> The few months I&#x27;ve had this oil, I&#x27;ve had bug bites, eczema flare-ups and burns.</li>
            <li> Here are a few Tamanu Oil Pointers I have gathered in a week and a half:&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a green oil and when I applied on my brown skin, I got a tone darker skin as a result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it plain on some places and combining it w/ 100%</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s less dull than it used to be.</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because although ineffective, it did not cause any weird reactions such as acne or worsening of itches and rashes.</li>
            <li> It is a small 30 ml bottle about the size of a finger.</li>
            <li> The small pimples have an arrested development and the bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> The small pimples have an arrested development and the bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it did not work for my specific skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had expensive creams that are about equal to this.  </li>
            <li> but now its not as noticable and you can&#x27;t beat the results from using just a small amount of the Tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see an improvement above what I used before</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my breakouts worse, nor do I have the  usual problems of a heavy moisture cream( clogged pores, irratation from additives, no oil slick-</li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant but can be tolerated.  </li>
            <li> Also, explaning the side effects of the antibiotics which were not nice.  </li>
            <li> At least the stench washes out in the laundry.  </li>
            <li> but if you put it on too thick it will take awhile to absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> The oil is so thick that it did not travel up into my eyes, instead soothing and moisturizing the area underneath.</li>
            <li> I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it not to have any effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive than tamanu and easier to find.</li>
            <li> Mustard oil is a very commonly used in Indian (East) household for hair &amp; body massage, cooking, darkening the color-effects of henna designs/tattoos on palms and protecting food from germs.</li>
            <li> It smells like nuts and herbs, the oil is very thick and it makes the skin feel smoother as soon as you apply it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying that the oil will solidify a bit in the colder months and DEFINITELY during travel, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product for acne and acne scars and it probably made my acne worse and did not help my scars.</li>
            <li> Both really removed nasty fluids and infection.  </li>
            <li> They were making her face worse.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken me out.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> but I was using the wrong oil</li>
            <li> Both eyes were swollen from allergies and felt miserable all day; gritty and relentlessly itching.</li>
            <li> Also it has a peculiar nutty smell, neither bad but not good unless one is a squirrel.</li>
            <li> Lack of a dropper, which makes it inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I found that this type of wound hurts a lot if it dries out and makes sleeping impossible.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad burn</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also helped to reduce the severity of a bad burn scar I have on</li>
            <li> The downside is this oil breaks me out really bad, so</li>
            <li> I hate the smell</li>
            <li> the Vietnamese bottle was worthless.</li>
            <li> For those who said it did work and hated the odor, a shame they don&#x27;t make a deodorized version.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to use a lot of this oil, or it will leave your skin feeling awful &amp; greasy (&amp; smelly).</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>

            <li> Tamanu oil is amazing! The smell is definitely strong and not one I like too much but the benefits outweigh the smell. Dab this on a pimple, it is easier on the skin than Tea Tree oil is and it really does help. Remember that just because it is an oil does not mean it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. It is drying. Really good oil and great brand.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on both acne and scar diminishing products, this is by far the best solution for both I&#x27;ve ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;It has been exactly 2 weeks, and already my acne has decreased, my complexion is more even, and all acne related cysts have healed in record time. All my protruding scars have flattened out, still too soon to tell about the actual coloring  and whether that is fading yet, I&#x27;ll update on that later.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to both my face and chest after scrubbing down (it&#x27;s an oil so i don&#x27;t want to risk sealing in dirt, and so I scrub before applying it).&lt;br /&gt;For the first few days I applied 2-3 times a day. On the fifth day I started applying only once before going to bed, still seems to be working great.&lt;br /&gt;It did dry out my skin so I apply cortizone immediately over the oil each time.&lt;br /&gt;It only seems to dry out my face (probably because it gets more exposure to air) and so on my chest I just use a normal moisturizer directly over the oil.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using on the same area&#x27;s as myself, I would recommend treating the face in the morning to avoid the oil rubbing off in your sleep, and treating the chest before bed, that is if you sleep on your back or side.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The dark coloring of scars will fade after a few weeks, in certain areas I can barely see scars at all after a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;One Big Thing to keep in mind is that since it is an oil, if you don&#x27;t apply to clean skin (make sure your face and hands are clean) then dirt will get into the oil and small pimples will start to form, as an extra precaution I would regularly sanitize any wash cloth or lufa you use (just 60 seconds in the microwave while damp).</li>
            <li> I had some chemical burns after doing a glycol peel of 50% which left a long, nasty scar running down the contour of my cheek to the right side of my mouth. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little less than a month and my scar is completely gone. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very rich, and strongly scented. I use it at night to give my skin some deep, deep lovin. Or if my face is really dry I mix a couple drops with some Argan oil so my face won&#x27;t be too greasy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I recently had 3 surgeries on my face and saw that this was recommended by several people for dealing with scars and other issues. I love the smell (reminds me of kukui nut oil, but a little thicker and darker color) and it seems to be helping my skin. I&#x27;m using it plain on some places and combining it w/ 100% Pure&#x27;s Organic Healing Moisturizing Balm (love the smell of that, too,...lavender-y) for a more substantial treatment (I have very dry skin). The combo feels and smells so great I look forward to using them each morning and evening and love knowing I&#x27;m putting such quality natural products on my body.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  Took a bit of time to get it.</li>
            <li> The oil is good but the cap broke opening it up the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying that the oil will solidify a bit in the colder months and DEFINITELY during travel, but it does work. I mix a few drops of this with a few drops of manuka oil, rub thoroughly and go to bed. Each morning I wake up with better looking skin. My acne isn&#x27;t gone, but I can tell my skin is doing better, and that counts for something.</li>
            <li> I mix it with almond oil and put it all over my face at night. Skin seems to be softer, better hydrated. Nothing really spectacular, just an another OK oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I bought it to make an acne scar mixture (mix with MSM cream and essential oils: lavender, melaleuca and frankincense).  However, I wish I didn&#x27;t mix it all up because I love the oil just on its own. In Hawaii, we call it kamani. My skin has been very dry and itchy lately (I just ordered a shower filter to get the chlorine out), and this is the only stuff that took away the itch (and I have many anti-itch creams, natural and pharmaceutical that usually work, but haven&#x27;t been working on my itchy face).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, at night I use 2 drops all over my face after washing. I have noticed that it helps my pimples heal MUCH more quickly, it&#x27;s very noticeable how much faster they heal. But it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from getting pimples (yet?), and it hasn&#x27;t increased my pimples. They just heal faster, and leave less scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that the quality of my skin between the pimples is better, it&#x27;s less dull than it used to be. If the pimples would just go away I feel like I would have gorgeous skin, but it seems like Tamanu oil is only a part of that. I need something else in my routine or diet to help stop the pimples from forming in the first place, because it&#x27;s not looking like Tamanu oil is going to stop the acne, it just helps make it more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to use a lot of this oil, or it will leave your skin feeling awful &amp; greasy (&amp; smelly). Your skin won&#x27;t absorb more than a few drops, that&#x27;s all it takes. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it makes my skin dryer, so I have to use a little bit more moisturizer than normal around my mouth or I get flakes.</li>
            <li> I waited a while to review this oil so that I could be fair.  The few months I&#x27;ve had this oil, I&#x27;ve had bug bites, eczema flare-ups and burns. I bought this for my son and me since we both have eczema and are prone to bug bites. The oil was ineffective in every way. It didn&#x27;t help with the itching or redness. It didn&#x27;t help with speedy healing for burns. Aloe vera is still my remedy of choice for burns as of yet. As for packaging, the bottle came with no dropper.  Really?  Throw in a dropper for goodness sake!!! I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because although ineffective, it did not cause any weird reactions such as acne or worsening of itches and rashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 days and ALREADY have seen an improvement in my skin. Such quick shipping and is nicely packaged so no leakage or anything like that! I absolutely love this and will purchase it for the rest of my life. LOVE xoxo &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent service. We used this in conjunction with Curaderm cream. Excellent skin softener and is very soothing to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on a patch of psoriasis which has helped a lot.. I will buy more in the future..</li>
            <li> This is very effective - more than other brand offered.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle a couple of days ago. It is a small 30 ml bottle about the size of a finger. Here are a few Tamanu Oil Pointers I have gathered in a week and a half:&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil is greasy when applied but gets absorbed nicely in 3-4 hours or over night.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil clears/brightens the skin and kills all pimples and skin bumps. It also gets rid of all allergic skin redness.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil gets rid of the scars by skin-flaking method. Scars exists as hyper-pigmentation on the various layers of skin. Keep brushing the flakes (gently) off your skin to get rid of scars soon.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil should be applied on a clean skin. So wash your skin gently before every application.&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil is greasy when applied but it doesn&#x27;t soften the skin even after it has been fully absorbed into the skin. For softness mix it with your favorite cream (Only one cream at a time: night cream at night time and water based moisturizer in the morning time)&lt;br /&gt;Effects of Tamanu oil are not visible during or just after application. They are visible after 3-4 hours or overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Review:&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Tamanu oil, it looked and smelled just like mustard oil. Mustard oil is a very commonly used in Indian (East) household for hair &amp; body massage, cooking, darkening the color-effects of henna designs/tattoos on palms and protecting food from germs. Mustard Oil is a strong oil and I have had a pretty bad reaction on my facial skin.  So, I was apprehensive about applying Tamanu oil on my facial skin. But thanks to all the reviews on Amazon as well as on other portals online, I mustered strength to apply it on face. Here is what I think about Tamanu oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st time application:&lt;br /&gt;It is very neutral on my skin. So far no adverse reaction has happened. However, I don&#x27;t agree with the claims that Tamanu oil doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on skin after application or that it is a dry oil. It is very much like a thick oil it is supposed to be. I applied a very little amount, 3-4 drops, on my entire face and neck but my skin (facial, neck&#x27;s and hands&#x27;) still looks and feels greasy even after massaging oil into it. Maybe I need to use less of it so it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feel or I should apply it at night time. I don&#x27;t have any problem with its odor, as I have grown up in a country where everybody loves mustard oil (the similar looking and smelling oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2nd day of application:&lt;br /&gt;Also it is a green oil and when I applied on my brown skin, I got a tone darker skin as a result. Good news is, Tamanu oil didn&#x27;t cause any breakage. But, it didn&#x27;t prevent the already present ultra small pimples and minute bumps on skin from dying out. I applied it on my lips. It doesn&#x27;t cure chapped lips completely but it has made me stop gorging on my lip balm frequently. I will give it 3 stars for not causing breakage even though it is greasy in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd Day Result:&lt;br /&gt;Wow! My skin looks radiant. I applied it last night and slept. The dark oil on my skin vanished and my complexion looks so clear and bright! No redness on my face at all! The small pimples and bumps didn&#x27;t grow into full ones!&lt;br /&gt;However, the old scars are still present. Hope they will eventually vanish. Also my skin is flaking, hopefully, the flaking of skin is only to get rid of dead-skin-scars. My skin isn&#x27;t soft though. I am still clueless how to regain softness of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th/5th/6th Day(s) to 1.5 weeks Review:&lt;br /&gt;I am getting used to seeing a brightly lit face in the morning in the white (6500k) light of mine. Well white light unlike the soft white/yellow light tells me the reality of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Face is soft and clean (finally discovered how to make the skin soft with tamanu oil. Just mix tamanu oil with some non greasy-cream. Tamanu oil is greasy enough, since it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakage, it is trusted greasy. Mixing it with greasy pimple-causing cream may cause skin to break. Anyway, my nivea soft cream goes wellwith it).  The small pimples have an arrested development and the bumps are gone. However, scars are still at large and the skin-flaking is there. I give this great oil 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning on applying it on my skin regularly for a couple of weeks to see if the light and small scars on my face disappear. Since it is a natural product, it may take its own time to heal the skin properly. You cannot expect magic. Will update this review accordingly. Hopefully this will help everybody.with it).

            <li> I wanted to use this product for acne and acne scars and it probably made my acne worse and did not help my scars. I&#x27;m just staying away from oil products from now on. Oils (coconut, tamanu) show great results for some people, but definitely not for me. Only oil that has benefited me has been Tea tree oil from The Body Shop and that&#x27;s because they only put 15% of the oil in their mixture.</li>
            <li> I suggest if you buy this you mix it with a couple of lighter oils. Not only is it pricey its greasy so it doesn&#x27;t soak into your skin as well as say almond or grapeseed oil.  and to stretch its use, because 14 for 1 oz is a lot! This stuff is thicker than most oils I&#x27;ve used, and kind of a bluish black color. When I add it to other oils it sinks to the bottom so I have to shake it up so it&#x27;ll mix better. However, despite the thickness it has not clogged my pores and has done some nice healing on some scars I have. I mix it with Grapeseed, Vitamine E, Jojoba, Sweet Almond, Rosehip a fragrance oil for a nice, light healing scented moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice product of high quality and well packaged in a brown glass bottle. it is a rather thick, nutty oil that is very nourishing and moisturizing- They say it is good for insect bites, rashes and to keep the skin moisturized but unfortunately, it did not work for my specific skin ailments- I have a rash-like area on my decolletage that I was hoping to alleviate but to no avail. But the oil is a nice product and the price is great. I use it everyday for general moisturizing on my face- mix it with a lighter oil or a lotion if it is too heavy for your skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the oil to put on a tattoo I am getting lasered off.  I had heard it helps heal the skin nicely.  It helped nicely.  Sped up the healing process.  But after reading more about it, I read it is also good to use on the face.  I put it on my face and dry lips a couple of times a week using a cotton ball and oh boy is it wonderful!  My skin looks so radiant now and youthful.  It is definitely an anti aging tool.  Pricey but totally worth it.  Amazing!!</li>
            <li> This product has a pretty strong \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; odor to it, but I do like the product.  It does make you skin very soft; however, it caused my face to break out, so I had to discontinue using it.  I do still use it for dry patchy areas on my legs as I suffer from ezcema and it does help heal those areas.  Would still recommend this product even though I am unable to use it on my face.  :)</li>
            <li> Diet plays a major role in controlling or eliminating rosacea symptoms, but topicals can also be extremely helpful.  I know the frustration and disappointment of having tried so many different products that have worked for others, but not for me.  Over the past 20 years, I have tried numerous natural topical products (I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s) and am excited to share that Tamanu Oil is what is working amazing for me - nothing else has ever come close.  I have been using it at night for 2 weeks and any redness and irritation I used to have is going away.  My skin is much less reactive as well.  After I wash my face, I apply the tamanu while my face is still wet and I rub it in very well.  I have read that tamanu can eliminate facial spider veins as well, but obviously it is much too soon to comment on that.  I purchased this Life-flo Tamanu oil at a local Vitamin Shoppe, but will reorder from Amazon since the price is cheaper.  :)  I have tried and still use Ultra Clear Emu oil during the day - it&#x27;s a great biological oil that gives me moisture without looking greasy or making me breakout.  But it&#x27;s the tamanu that is healing my skin.  I also tried Seabuckthorn oil, but I disliked the smell (the tamanu oil doesn&#x27;t bother me at all) and it seemed to dry and irritate my skin as well.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> After reading about this product I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and it seems to have helped heal some persistent skin blemishes that hadn&#x27;t healed.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly and feels good on your skin. I would have given it 5 stars but I am not a big fan of the smell. But don&#x27;t let that deter you it feels really good on the skin. My skin is very dry and it works well!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin and does not leave me oily and shiny. It gives me a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil; I&#x27;m using it in my homemade moisturizer and my skin is in fantastic shape. I tend to break out with many carrier oils - despite the luxurious,thick feel - it goes on light and soaks in well. The smell of this oil is amazing, think hazelnut coffee. FYI, thickens very easily in coolish temps, but thins out fine when brought back to warmer room temperatures.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my breakouts worse, nor do I have the  usual problems of a heavy moisture cream( clogged pores, irratation from additives, no oil slick-I know, it&#x27;s oil, how is it not oily???). It looks great even in the day after a moment or two to absorb.  Smells sweet, but the maple sugar scent goes away.  I&#x27;ve had expensive creams that are about equal to this.  I will definitely add to my usual skin care regimen.  It&#x27;s supposed to be good for sun damage...    Update***my hairdresser commented on my face not feeling greasy b/c my hair was soaking it up :) he thought it was funny...due to the hair mop, I&#x27;m dropping my rating, I don&#x27;t use it often, but I&#x27;ll start again now that it&#x27;s winter, still smells good, not rancid after 15 months.</li>
            <li> Unusual smell, but not obtrusive.  Oiliness to skin absorbs with time.  Soothes damaged skin and seems to promote healing faster.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it does seem to help my rough skin patches.</li>
            <li> This one seems thicker and darker than the others I have tried.  My skin absolutely glows and I use it only once a day sparingly.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> 100% pure Tamanu  oil not diluted with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Provides fast healing of many skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Warning if you are allergic to nuts this product is made from nuts.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a months long process and used many products I bought here at Amazon for the treatment of this slow healing wound.  The last thing I bought was this oil.  I am in the final stages of closing all the little open spots in the skin.  I killed the infection, MRSA, long ago with Manuka honey, and before that when it was very big and very sore, I used poultices of activated charcoal or bentonite clay.  Both really removed nasty fluids and infection.  I should write up a journal of everything I did.  I used oxygenated olive oil, Amerigel,(a good soothing product), I tried bithmuth impregnated gauze, I drank tumeric infused milk, I took cayenne capsules, boron, I think I tried everything but colloidal silver.  Just didn&#x27;t get around to it.&lt;br /&gt;I found that this type of wound hurts a lot if it dries out and makes sleeping impossible.  So I learned to keep it moist.  I used telfa bandage pads because they don&#x27;t hurt when you removed them, I spread whatever I was using on these and wrapped it all in stretchy inexpensive gauze rolls.&lt;br /&gt;This oil seems to stimulate cell growth and sooth the wound at the same time.  Use the honey if you have an active infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody that wants to can write and ask me specific stuff as I am just rambling now.  I love this oil.  Its wonderful on the face.  It exfoliated stuff I didn&#x27;t even know was there.  I bought their body butter too, for large areas like legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, it all started improving rapidly when I became aware that high blood sugar slows wound healing and took care to correct that.  No starch or sugar in diet.</li>
            <li> I had a bad burn/rash from getting my facial hair waxed. I used the Tamanu oil for two nights and my skin is almost healed. I think in two more days my skin will be totally healed.  I am totally impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one week. I will update as I go along. So far I have noticed a serious change in my skin. It is smoother and softer. The color and tone is more even. I have not had any breakouts at all. I do notice that I am a little more oily than usual but I don&#x27;t wear make up so it doesnt bother me. I just wipe the excess off with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning and love the way it feels on my skin. Especially since it is winter time and a lot drier that usual. I have also starting using it on my seasonal eczema on my hands and it has almost immediately taken out the pain, itch and burn. After 5 days of using it the eczema is almost completely diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not terrible. I think it smells like brazil nuts and olive oil. My 4 year old daughter says it smells like raisins. Neither of which bother me at all. After about an hour the smell is completely dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this every day. Now that I know I am not going to have a breakout reaction, I am going to start using it on my neck and chest. As I age I notice my skin has lost a lot of elasticity in that area. I will report back on continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is not an issue considering the benefits I have received from the product.</li>
            <li> good to mix with other lotions for a major moisturising effect</li>
            <li> Excellent result, I hardly used 10 times over last few months and I didn&#x27;t expect it to work. But it did, first the flesh under my toe name came off and the the toe nail itself.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter with moderate to severe (at times) acne.  She was using all types of over the counter benzoyl peroxide, salacylic acid cleansers, creams, masks, etc. They were making her face worse.  She had red/purple areas of her skin at times, dry and flaky skin and nothing was really working.  The dermatoligist suggested antibiotics (internally) for 6 months to a year.  Also, explaning the side effects of the antibiotics which were not nice.  I was determined to find something to help her in a more organic way.  Tamanu Oil did it!  She had been using it regularly for about 3 months and what a huge difference with the amount of acne on her face.  The redness, the dry, flaky skin is all gone.  She has normal colored skin and few acne spots remaining.  She just loves it!  She said the oil is soothing when she puts it on, and calms her skin dramatically. The smell is strong at first and takes a bit of getting used to but now its not as noticable and you can&#x27;t beat the results from using just a small amount of the Tamanu oil.  Hmmm. antibiotics for a year? with tons of side effects OR natural, organic Tamanu Oil with NO side effects?  So glad I did my mommy research and was able to help my daughter fight teenage Acne in a natural way. Also, a small pea sized amount is all you need for the face, so the bottle should last at least 6 months if used 2x a day.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. I am now noticing less wrinkles as well as less redness on my face. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does help with the rejuvenation. Not only that it is pure natural or organic it actually works. Lately, I don&#x27;t really have to wear makeup. Although, it will make your skin peel for the first time, I think that it might be the rejuvenation process. I actually have to mix this with other essential oils like lavender and argan oil so that it is not so potent or strong for my skin type.</li>
            <li> In this dry weather it gives quite good moisture.  Does not do much for red bumps though..I&#x27;ll see on that.</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  I use sparingly still so may update later.  I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I found this did nothing for curing fungus nail .  Maybe after a year of use, I would see improvement but decided to seek other remedies instead..  Did not find this one bit useful for any other uses as stated by other viewers.  Absolute waste of money for a very pungent smelling liquid.</li>
            <li> use this with baobab oil, olive oil and shea butter, jojoba oil for my face as a moisturizer. SUPER IMPROVEMENT in 2 weeks. I hate the smell but it&#x27;s not awful, it smells green. but it works, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The oil would not pour out of the bottle.  A previous bottle was fine, but I won&#x27;t order any more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this product got rid of a toenail fungus that I had for 2 years. I used it twice daily for 6 months. I have not used it for about a month and I see no sign of return.</li>
            <li> This stuff was wonderful until I developed a really bad reaction. My face swelled up and was extremely itchy. It was terrible. The reaction was first noticed in my hands. if I didn&#x27;t get a reaction I would have stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Wow makes my skin soft.  I suffer from mild ecema and this oil helps.  Also a little goes a long way you don&#x27;t need much product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product. It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  Did not meet any of my expectations, or their claims. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works wonders with acne.  Saw changes after a few months of use on a relative.  He used it am and pm every day.  Takes times but yielded incredible results.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face in the evening very lightly, then put my regular moisturizer on top.  My face has been clearer than ever the last could months that I&#x27;ve been doing it.</li>
            <li> A weeks use and my skin was no longer dry and rough.. I didnt mix with any other oils.. my skin smoother and soft</li>
            <li> Didnt do what I wanted it too. Remove scars. It moisturizer fine. Doesnt smell good. Its smells like nuts but thats what it is.</li>
            <li> used it on my heels,i got immediate results.smells funny at first , but the smell wears off and its by far the best thing ive used for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This oil really goes a long way.  I would give a thumbs up!  Has a bit of a nutty smell but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using tamanu oil for about a year now on my face and love the results.  At first I used it in a blend with jojoba oil, but have since started using it on its own all over my face and following up with a little jojoba oil.  Once a month I may get slight acne, but if I apply the tamanu oil, it is gone by morning.  Also does wonders at taking any redness away. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my kids when they are teenagers to see if it really works on teenage acne.  I have also used it for bug bites, cuts &amp; scrapes and burns.  I had read somewhere that it has natural sunscreen properties.  I do not use sunscreen at all, but perhaps my use of tamanu oil has been the reason for me not getting much redness on my fact this summer.  Wonderful discovery!</li>
            <li> This is amazing works better than any acne cream. It heals and adds a glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this tamanu oil at all.  I normally purchase the Shea Terra brand and I decided to try this one out as Shea Terra had changed their formula.  I will say that I didn&#x27;t like this one at all.  There was no noticeable difference in my blemishes, like I had seen with the Shea Terra.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any real change in my skin or my psoriasis.  The smell is not very pleasant but can be tolerated.  Have only used for a week so too early to tell if this will help.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to clear up my hormonal acne, from OTC chemical laden things, to raw honey. Nothing seemed to work. I tried oil cleansing but I was using the wrong oil, so I did some more digging and came across this. Tamanu and Sunflower oils are suppose to be amazing for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both this and Life-Flo&#x27;s Sunflower Oil and use them to oil cleanse my face. I use the sunflower as the oil cleanser and then I put the tamanu oil on as a moisturizer. A very little bit of this goes a very long way. It absorbs quicker than other oils but if you put it on too thick it will take awhile to absorb into your skin. I have been using this for about two weeks now and I have never seen my face clearer than it has been with this and sunflower oil, except for before hormones took over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also appears to be plumping up any fine lines I might have around my eyes. I also have noticed that any scars I have on my face seem to be fading or have faded since using this. This oil does have a very weird scent to it, like a nutty, smokey aroma, however it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to and fades rather fast. It is a little astringent, so if you have oily skin like I do it seems to help control the oil. My skin looks dewy now, not oil slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product again, this is a must for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out various oils for the skin: manuka oil(great for acne), argan oil (anti-aging and moisturizing), rosehip oil (anti-aging and moisturizing) and now this one, tamanu oil by Life-flo. Whereas the others are a thinner consistency and are excellent for what their respective purposes are, this one is very thick and quite pungent - very strong nutty scent. It does not bother me, but I only use it on my face at night because otherwise I can smell it all through the day! It&#x27;s purported use is for anti-aging and moisturizing and it is wonderful for that; I like to mix it with my other oils for a potent elixir. A few drops on the hands beneath my regular hand cream leaves them moisturized for hours. All this is well and good, but there is a bonus benefit that I am very pleased about. Earlier this week, I awoke with the skin beneath one of my eyes very sore, as if I were getting a stye. Both eyes were swollen from allergies and felt miserable all day; gritty and relentlessly itching. I haven&#x27;t worn eye makeup all week (and may never again). I read about some of the uses for tamanu oil and found one comment by a person who said that he used it around his eyes to soothe them. So...I tried it under my eyes at night in lieu of the argan and rosehip oils. When I woke the next morning, most of the soreness was gone and my eyes looked brighter than they had in weeks. The oil is so thick that it did not travel up into my eyes, instead soothing and moisturizing the area underneath. Now several days later, the soreness is completely gone, my eyes still look bright and my skin looks great. So I use it as daytime undereye moisturizer as well, scent be damned. It takes so very little of it to be effective that I think this bottle will last a long time. I also had an abrasion on the bridge of my nose from my glasses and in two nights&#x27; applications of this oil, it has completely cleared up. I am a lifetime fan.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer here, I&#x27;ve been trying out various oils as rich facial moisturizers.  I tried the tamanu oil on a whim- I&#x27;d never heard anyone speak of it, but read a favorable overview of tamanu oil on another website- Mountainroseherbs.com. I didn&#x27;t buy the Mountain Rose brand, so I can&#x27;t comment on their product, but I tend to find good info on their site.  This is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands. I can compare it to other oils though. I&#x27;ve tried Jojoba, Rosehip Seed, and Argan oils. I liked jojoba as a general moisturizer and the unbleached oil has a nice nutty scent. It soaks in well. For regular body moisturizing, I stick with the jojoba oil. It&#x27;s less expensive than tamanu and easier to find. But for the face I wanted an oil with more nutrients.  Rosehip seed oil is is supposed to be great for skin health, but I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt- it left a tacky feeling on my skin and I didn&#x27;t love the smell.  Argan oil left me looking greasy no matter how little I used. It just seemed to sit on top of my skin.  For face, the tamanu came out ahead of all the others for me. My skin felt moisturized and soft, and I look forward to using it. I use it on my face and on some large scars that I&#x27;d previously treated with Castor oil (at the insistence of a relative who reads Edgar Cayce). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle cure but it certainly feels better than the castor oil, and the scars are less prominent after using it. I like the nutty smell, and I can wear makeup over this oil without worrying about oil show-through or my makeup sliding off. On the face it has reduced the redness of some scars.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I like to put it on my face at night. Hasn&#x27;t broken me out.&lt;br /&gt;Been applying to stretch marks daily after showering for a few weeks. Haven&#x27;t noticed any noticeable improvements.&lt;br /&gt;But most importantly, I love putting it on my face. It feels so nourished and moisturized. It absorbs to a relatively matte look, but still leaves sheen. So be aware of that if applying before going anywhere. Also like to apply it to my lips, just make sure not to ingest.</li>
            <li> Although this is not cheap, a little bit can go a long way.  It is very soothing and seems to speed recovery.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Used it after a shockingly successful treatment with Curaderm BEC5. This is now my night &amp; day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my wife&#x27;s skin....has all but completely alleviated prior challenges with acne.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Tamanu Oil after reading an article about how it helps to heal skin and reduce pain from insect bites as well as promote general healing from scrapes. My husband got stung by a wasp and I put this on the bite and literally within hours the swelling was gone and the pain was greatly reduced. He was amazed at how well it worked. Shortly after, I was stung by a wasp also and quickly put a few drops on the affected area. Normally I have ALOT of swelling and pain when stung. After using the Tamanu, the swelling was minimal and the pain was not nearly as bad as other bee stings I have gotten.I still had some swelling and pain, but it was minor. I will be ordering another bottle for our first aid kit! You only need a few drops - its potent stuff!!</li>
            <li> On the health segment of the local news a doctor was asked what natural product would be good for toenail fungus. He consulted with a naturopath and reported back that tamanu oil would do it. It has a very strong smell...not unpleasant. Been using it twice a day for a couple weeks. Nails seem better but then it takes a while for toenails to grow back in healthy. In the meantime NOTHING else has worked so it is worth the price. It is also used for other things...you&#x27;d have to google for that info....I think insect bites and stings.&lt;br /&gt;will update when results are definite.&lt;br /&gt;Oh this is a very reasonably priced bottle.</li>
            <li> clears up nail fungus very well - takes time, but works</li>
            <li> UPDATED: I wore a disposable glove to apply it because I didn&#x27;t want the odor on my hands.  I used this for over a month.  No real improvement in scar fading.At least the stench washes out in the laundry.  Bummer. I wanted it to work.  For those who said it did work and hated the odor, a shame they don&#x27;t make a deodorized version.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is derived from nuts which for some people can cause extensive dermatitis. It did for me so is being returned. Also it has a peculiar nutty smell, neither bad but not good unless one is a squirrel. Possibly it promotes healing because it is high in arginine, which promotes blood flow. Nuts are high in this amino acid but high amounts are not good for everyone.  Those who have ever had herpes canker outbreaks whether in the mouth or on the body should be extremely cautious if not avoid this product. Arginine promotes blood flow but it also triggers further herpes outbreaks or further allergic reactions. It is unclear whether it is the derivation from nuts or some other aspect, but a valuable function of these reviews is that those who have specific sensitivities can make their experience known to others.  Patch test not only on the inner elbow, but if using on the face on an area behind the ear or on the side of the face for 24 hours first and on another area cover another patch with whatever mix of other products such as sunscreens or foundation one might use to see if there is cross reactivity.  I did this but still got a reaction eventually after several applications, which probably means this product has potential for allegic reactions in time.[[ASIN:B003YDZON8 Life-flo Pure Tamanu Oil, 1-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It smells like nuts and herbs, the oil is very thick and it makes the skin feel smoother as soon as you apply it</li>
            <li> Not good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I read that this oil helps with scars, etc.  Maybe it does if you use it four times a day for years.  Very disappointed. It has a strange &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell that I did not care for.</li>
            <li> of all the brands i have tried this one is by far the best Tamanu oil out there. will definitely purchase this item again and again....</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing so many good things about this oil. I have used this for about two or three weeks, almost every night. The consistency is a little thicker than say other oils like jojoba or grape see. I want to say its a tiny bit sticky, but definitely not like castor oil. It has not made me break out as of yet, and when I wake up my face feels very soft and moisturized. I use a tiny bit, a drop or two and mix it with argan oil. I can&#x27;t attest as to how effective it is on scars as I have not used it long enough and I haven&#x27;t particularly used it on scars either. Time will tell. But do far I like it because a little bit goes a long ways, it doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it moisturizes without making me feel oily or congested. It has a slight earthy/herbal smell to it which I don&#x27;t mind. The bottle isn&#x27;t very convenient so I will be transferring the oil to a dropper bottle which will be easier to control how much oil to want to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for genuine Tamanu oil...  Locally, all I could find was an oil &amp;#34;claiming&amp;#34; to be 100% pure Tamanu but: it was from Vietnam (? Does Tamanu even grow there?) and was clear not greenish yellow and had zero odor. And most important, though it was costly...it didn&#x27;t work. I use it on my chronically cracked &amp; often bleeding cuticles. The real Tamanu heals them in 24 hours...the Vietnamese bottle was worthless. I was ready to give up when I found this Life Flo Pure Tamanu.  I&#x27;m delighted with it! It&#x27;s the right color, has the slightly nutty odor it&#x27;s supposed to have and works like a charm to heal any nick or cut or rough spot!  And best of all...I apply it before bed to the back of my hands, and several darkish age spots have lightened almost completely.  Order this brand with confidence, it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and not a watered down version or copy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell, calming.  Reduces nerve pain and after one week a mole is half way gone.</li>
            <li> If youa re having skin issues ~ rash, redness, dry or cracked skin ~ give this oil a try! It looks a little odd, but put that aside. It works GREAT at soothing irritated skin! LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I utilized this tamanu seed oil in an ointment I compounded to reduce scars. Within a day of application I saw reduced redness and swelling. This was after trying numerous other over the counter scar treatments and silicone strips. Combined with Rose Hip Oil - I got great results from this.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for acne marks. I have been using this for over 3 weeks now and the scars are fading.</li>
            <li> Lack of a dropper, which makes it inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> This tamanu oil is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I found it works best if you alternate it&#x27;s use (one night on one night off).&lt;br /&gt;It really work wonders to help clear up my skin (acne) and make it look more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is like that of nature/forest. It is not great but pleasant enough.&lt;br /&gt;It also helped to reduce the severity of a bad burn scar I have on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;I was foolish enough to try another brand (because the price was better), but wish I had just to stuck with this one. Will most certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it! My skin improved in 3 days. I also bought some marula and pumpkin oils to pack all the nutrients my skin needs.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I was not prepared for the odor of it. Otherwise I am a satisfied customer.-</li>
            <li> I attribute my new clear skin to this product! I use it every night. It&#x27;s appears oily at first but it absorbs after an hour or so. I finally live my skin after battling with acne for over 18 yrs.</li>
            <li> I used this as recommended to promote healing and prevent scarring after use of&lt;br /&gt;Curaderm. It seemed to do neither.It did not speed healing and I have scars. As a regular user of herbal, natural, homeopathy and other so called alternative approaches I am unsure whether this is a function of my particular chemistry or general inadequacy of the product and not living up to claims.&lt;br /&gt;But because of my experience and the cost to try it I do not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I found calendula superior  and appropriately I also use tea tree oil to promote skin healing and both work well with me.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of tamanu oil until I read the reviews of the BEC-5 cream for treating skin cancers.  I love the oil and have been putting it on my entire face rather than just on the Bec-5 treated spots.  It feels very soothing.  (It did not cure my winter-chapped lips though.)</li>
            <li> Awesome product, it was as it was described.  My husband had a really bad rash and it helped heal it tremendously.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is one of the best healing oils out there for clearing red marks and healing wounds. Highly recommend it, have been using it for 10 years or more,.</li>
            <li> Good at getting rid of blemishes and healing pimples that I popped without leaving a scar The downside is this oil breaks me out really bad, so I can&#x27;t use it on my face as I would like to. I do love the healing affects however and will continue to use it, just not on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> returned it....aweful smell</li>
            <li> so I tried tamanu body butter cream----It is wonderful &amp; it lasts much, much longer for same results &amp; less money</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil has been a lifesaver for me. It works wonderfully, is soothing, protective while healing. The nutty fragrance is a welcome fragrance.</li>
            <li> This oil exceeds all my expectations! After doing more research on Tamanu oil, I found that this is about as good as it gets. I recently cured my own skin cancer and this oil was recommended for the healing of scar tissue, which is proving to work fantastically! So far, the only scar I might have is from the biopsy. I have even added a small amount to my homemade body butter and LOVE it! It has also softened and healed my daughters excema.</li>
            <li> seems effective, thanks very much</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, Follow the instructions and it will work!</li>
            <li> This has worked well on toenail issues, but hasn&#x27;t done much for a few (what I call) barnacles.  Good ole caster oil is better for those.  It has a very strong odor like old wet hay, so putting it on my toes and then covering with socks makes it tolerable.</li>
            <li> The oil looks and smells good, I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it not to have any effect. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see an improvement above what I used before so I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that works well.</li>
            <li> I carefulkly read reviews from other users then ordered this product. I&#x27;ve been amazed at how well it heals sores and soothes my skin. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I used this product as suggested for toe nail fungus and the fungus cleared up about half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil (tamanu) for wrinkles and acne. I&#x27;ve used it and believe it is a good product. The smell is not very desirable so I mixed in  neroli to help with it. So far so good, I&#x27;m using it twice a day with other oils in my roll on bottles. Good service and packaging.</li>
