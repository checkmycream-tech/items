            <li>So I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes from the Armani line of products.  </li>
            <li>, I want to eat him up! :-) :-)</li>
            <li>I love how this smells.  </li>
            <li>So glad I could get this for such a great price since they do not sell it in stores anymore!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance on a man.</li>
            <li>Originally I used to buy it from Nordstrom&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Still worth it though</li>
            <li>I would say this is a safe smell, enjoyable, clean and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>so it would not overwhelm me, 1 spritz was more than enough.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of his scents although the dispenser on this one is not the greatest.</li>

            <li>You can&#x27;t really write a review of a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I found it generic, many other fragances smell alike.</li>
            <li>The high and low notes compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li>I had to be careful not to apply too much</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you I love it.  It&#x27;s smell so good.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I will wear. Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Very happy with service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would like to echo other user&#x27;s experiences in thinking this may be a knockoff. Granted, the last bottle I bought from Amazon was over a year ago but I could not help but think at the time it seemed very underwhelming. I came here to buy another bottle, but after reading other user&#x27;s reviews drove me to share my experience as well. Originally I used to buy it from Nordstrom&#x27;s and I remember how potent it was - I had to be careful not to apply too much so it would not overwhelm me, 1 spritz was more than enough. The product I received from Amazon was weak, to say the least. I had to apply it like hairspray for it to come across at all.</li>
            <li> My girl likes it. So I love it. So we are all very happy in my house and you will also with this purchase</li>
            <li> Product as described and a good price.  One of my favorite colognes from the Armani line of products.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and he just smells so good, I want to eat him up! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I love how this smells.  i have been wearing it for years.  It is my go-to smell.  It is masculine without being over powerful.  The high and low notes compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I remember. Smells like it&#x27;s been re done. I prefer Burberry touch over this any day</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any of his scents although the dispenser on this one is not the greatest. Still worth it though</li>
            <li> So glad I could get this for such a great price since they do not sell it in stores anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this is the real deal.  It does not last as long.  Also, I was told years ago Armani no longer makes this cologne. Too bad, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne. I have been wearing it for a while and always receive compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this cologne on here! It smells so good!!!! Nobody in my town carries it anymore and my husband loves the smell too.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really write a review of a fragrance. Everybody will have a different opinion of it. Even if my husband loves this specific fragrance (which he does), somebody else might hate it :)</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my male friends. I absolutely love this fragrance on a man. I would buy this product as a gift anytime.</li>
            <li> received, so good. Thank you</li>
            <li> the fragrance seems to have changed or at least it is much weaker in comparison with the one I bought some time ago.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a safe smell, enjoyable, clean and not overwhelming. I found it generic, many other fragances smell alike. In my opinion projection is low, as well as duration. I get 4-5 hours on my skin. Good for work I would say, unoffensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is poorly made, the sprayer started failing and the liquid started to leak. I had to change the bottle in less than a week. Since the bottle has this strange design it&#x27;s not possible to know where the failure is.</li>
