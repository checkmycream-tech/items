            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>However, after using it so many times, I have changed my tune.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>then i decided to go cheap and get a revlon, but it tore my hair apart!</li>
            <li>Like many others, I saw this in the mall and was amazed.</li>
            <li>have cute</li>
            <li>I do believe the ceramic is better on your hair.</li>
            <li>I love it way more than a chi.</li>
            <li>works better than my CHI and Maxiglide    </li>
            <li>Overall, best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I love my amika stylers and i am glad i bought two pair , i will be buying them again.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>It did work great on my sister-in-laws hair, her hair is curly but not very thick.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, good package.</li>
            <li>Compared to the prices I have seen other places, this is an excellent buy on this straightener.</li>
            <li>of the time, straightened in one easy</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, and has a dial to control the temperature.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my daughter has fine straighter hair than me, and the Amika works great on her!    </li>
            <li>I did some quick research and found it to be selling for much more elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It all slides and styles so smoothly</li>
            <li>My hair always turns smooth and silky, no frying.</li>
            <li>always looks fantastic, but was it the iron, or the shampoo&amp; products she used..?</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is truly the most useful gift.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money. :)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of purchasing a great quality straightener.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is so great at giving my hair shine while straightening it.</li>
            <li>Great Flat iron.</li>
            <li>The Amika flat iron works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, and there&#x27;s never any burning hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an original Amika.  </li>
            <li>This Amika flat iron is by far the best i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron ive ever used at first i questioned if it was a real amika or not</li>
            <li>Thanks I really love it, it was def.</li>
            <li>You would never be able to tell that my hair wasn&#x27;t naturally straight.</li>
            <li>my hair looks super healthy and this baby makes my hair routine soooo much shorter than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Did I mention I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant?  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>ready light was always red.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth my money.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, improves the look and feel of my hair texture and really holds up to most any weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been worth every penny of the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now, and it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with naturally curly hair, and this straightens my hair perfectly all the time.</li>
            <li>Nice long cord.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t touch my hair right after each pull through of iron, as it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair super straight and shiny, doesn&#x27;t look fried at all.</li>
            <li>then I decided to fork over more money for a better product, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it..?</li>
            <li>This straightener still is very very very harmful to my hair.</li>
            <li>Also very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and does not pull my hair while using it.  </li>
            <li>The website for this product charged 4 times as much as getting it here!  </li>
            <li>I bought my first Amika straightener not quite a year ago.</li>
            <li>The first straightener heated up so hot that I couldn&#x27;t even hold onto it.</li>
            <li>Still smokes when I use it, and still heats up soo incredibly hot, even on the lowest setting, that I can not handle it.</li>
            <li>did make my hair hot, duh.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord caused it to fall off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;VERY</li>
            <li>It also curls hair very well!</li>
            <li>The seller wanted me to pay almost $200 for it, and I wasn&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li>It last for days every time I use it I am in love with it</li>
            <li>I first bought one at a kiosk in the mall, and when it broke I wanted another one.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also not much of a buffer of plastic on either side of the ceramic; good for getting down to the roots straight, potentially hazardous to your neck or tips of your ears.     </li>
            <li>I have tried many different flat irons, and I must say that I love this iron.</li>
            <li>I just love this flat iron, it&#x27;s easier to style my hair and make it look so shiny.</li>
            <li>I personally love the Amika Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>I thought paying a higher price would mean getting a better product &amp; would also&#x3D; better quality</li>
            <li>I told Amika they should resolve this with Amazon and not someone who bought their product in good faith and actually likes their product and may continue to be a future customer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who  has a need to style their hair pretty much every day like I do.</li>
            <li>The flatiron is great on african american natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It ships pretty fast.</li>
            <li>This iron is easy to rotate for curls, has variable temperatures, and is simple to use.</li>
            <li>It straigtened my hair and my hair is vey curly and was hard for me to find a good product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I had a 2\\&quot; wide ceramic plate Chi which worked better and faster on my longer/thicker/wavier hair.  </li>
            <li>so ya its real nd</li>
            <li>I really like this straigtner and it is just awsome.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>very hott quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Curls and flips very well.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Perfectly straight hair in 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and straight.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li>I have very tick and alot of hair.</li>
            <li>It works fast, well, and my hair looks healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would definitely recommend this flat iron, just buy gloves with it also lol.</li>
            <li>this flat iron is just so fantastic.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve never ever been able to flip and curl my hair with any other straightener.</li>
            <li>Amika should be more aware of other companies selling their products through Amazon and take action there, not against a customer.</li>
            <li>I really wish that I wouldn&#x27;t have spend over $100 for this product; it was most definately not worth it!</li>
            <li>I found it for less $$ here, and I&#x27;m so glad.</li>
            <li>It really does my hair so straight and so soft.</li>
            <li>It has been dropped, kicked, wet, and is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for my fellow curly haired people.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Cheaper straighteners would leave my hair looking fried and bad, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>*too* straight so it still looks natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great straightener, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like we live in a disposable world these days.</li>
            <li>The product after inspecting it is brand new.  </li>
            <li>The initial results were fantastic, I noticed a big difference from my old cheaper irons.</li>
            <li>the chi died in about 9 months because it was made in china and was not as sturdy as the old models!</li>
            <li>This thing gets PRETTY HOT, so watch your ears and any other skin</li>
            <li>This ceramic styler is amazing, to say the least!</li>
            <li>&quot;    I bought the product on Amazon who stocked the item for Direct Super Center.  </li>
            <li>But from Amika&#x27;s point of view, Direct Super Center is not authorized to sell the product.  </li>
            <li>hopefully this iron will last at least a couple of years, and when it does die, i will surely buy another one!</li>
            <li>shaved a whole ten minutes off in the morning!</li>
            <li>Ihave already noticed how soft and shinny my hair is</li>
            <li>Thanks Mom for the b-day present.  </li>
            <li>i to used hear her complain all the time about her old straightener</li>
            <li>but it worked on my natural hair without a blow dryer at the 1/2 way heat setting.</li>
            <li>Considering other sites charge $180, this is definetly worth it.  </li>
            <li>straightens the hair very fast, lasts up to few days (my hair is very resistant).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that the outside of the flat iron gets so hot though while the iron is on.</li>
            <li>The iron is incredibly hot, though, so be careful.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite compare it to other products, this is my first straightening iron</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use too much product to keep my hair from becoming split frizzy and weak!</li>
            <li>I have wavy, thick hair and this flat iron works magic.</li>
            <li>but I am new at using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am of African American decent</li>
            <li>My sister in law recently used it and was surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new flat iron, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It did an okay job on my daughters hair (very thick and curly, she&#x27;s mixed b&amp;w), so I would not recommend this straightener if you have hair like hers.  </li>
            <li>saw these at the mall selling for $200    With my curly hair this is the only straightener that will actually straighten my hair, and it keeps it straight for up to 4 days, and it only takes me 15 min to straighten my long hair    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this straightner for people who don&#x27;t want to spent alot of money on one.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been worth every penny of the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now, and it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with naturally curly hair, and this straightens my hair perfectly all the time.</li>
            <li> Nice long cord.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t touch my hair right after each pull through of iron, as it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair super straight and shiny, doesn&#x27;t look fried at all.</li>
            <li> then I decided to fork over more money for a better product, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it..?</li>
            <li> This straightener still is very very very harmful to my hair.</li>
            <li> Also very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and does not pull my hair while using it.  </li>
            <li> The website for this product charged 4 times as much as getting it here!  </li>
            <li> I bought my first Amika straightener not quite a year ago.</li>
            <li> The first straightener heated up so hot that I couldn&#x27;t even hold onto it.</li>
            <li> Still smokes when I use it, and still heats up soo incredibly hot, even on the lowest setting, that I can not handle it.</li>
            <li> did make my hair hot, duh.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord caused it to fall off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;VERY</li>
            <li> It also curls hair very well!</li>
            <li> The seller wanted me to pay almost $200 for it, and I wasn&#x27;t interested.</li>
            <li> It last for days every time I use it I am in love with it</li>
            <li> I first bought one at a kiosk in the mall, and when it broke I wanted another one.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also not much of a buffer of plastic on either side of the ceramic; good for getting down to the roots straight, potentially hazardous to your neck or tips of your ears.     </li>
            <li> I have tried many different flat irons, and I must say that I love this iron.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron, it&#x27;s easier to style my hair and make it look so shiny.</li>
            <li> I personally love the Amika Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I thought paying a higher price would mean getting a better product &amp; would also&#x3D; better quality</li>
            <li> I told Amika they should resolve this with Amazon and not someone who bought their product in good faith and actually likes their product and may continue to be a future customer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who  has a need to style their hair pretty much every day like I do.</li>
            <li> The flatiron is great on african american natural hair.  </li>
            <li> It ships pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This iron is easy to rotate for curls, has variable temperatures, and is simple to use.</li>
            <li> It straigtened my hair and my hair is vey curly and was hard for me to find a good product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had a 2\\&quot; wide ceramic plate Chi which worked better and faster on my longer/thicker/wavier hair.  </li>
            <li> so ya its real nd</li>
            <li> I really like this straigtner and it is just awsome.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> very hott quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Curls and flips very well.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfectly straight hair in 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and straight.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> I have very tick and alot of hair.</li>
            <li> It works fast, well, and my hair looks healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would definitely recommend this flat iron, just buy gloves with it also lol.</li>
            <li> this flat iron is just so fantastic.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never ever been able to flip and curl my hair with any other straightener.</li>
            <li> Amika should be more aware of other companies selling their products through Amazon and take action there, not against a customer.</li>
            <li> I really wish that I wouldn&#x27;t have spend over $100 for this product; it was most definately not worth it!</li>
            <li> I found it for less $$ here, and I&#x27;m so glad.</li>
            <li> It really does my hair so straight and so soft.</li>
            <li> It has been dropped, kicked, wet, and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for my fellow curly haired people.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Cheaper straighteners would leave my hair looking fried and bad, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> *too* straight so it still looks natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great straightener, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like we live in a disposable world these days.</li>
            <li> The product after inspecting it is brand new.  </li>
            <li> The initial results were fantastic, I noticed a big difference from my old cheaper irons.</li>
            <li> the chi died in about 9 months because it was made in china and was not as sturdy as the old models!</li>
            <li> This thing gets PRETTY HOT, so watch your ears and any other skin</li>
            <li> This ceramic styler is amazing, to say the least!</li>
            <li> &quot;    I bought the product on Amazon who stocked the item for Direct Super Center.  </li>
            <li> But from Amika&#x27;s point of view, Direct Super Center is not authorized to sell the product.  </li>
            <li> hopefully this iron will last at least a couple of years, and when it does die, i will surely buy another one!</li>
            <li> shaved a whole ten minutes off in the morning!</li>
            <li> Ihave already noticed how soft and shinny my hair is</li>
            <li> Thanks Mom for the b-day present.  </li>
            <li> i to used hear her complain all the time about her old straightener</li>
            <li> but it worked on my natural hair without a blow dryer at the 1/2 way heat setting.</li>
            <li> Considering other sites charge $180, this is definetly worth it.  </li>
            <li> straightens the hair very fast, lasts up to few days (my hair is very resistant).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the outside of the flat iron gets so hot though while the iron is on.</li>
            <li> The iron is incredibly hot, though, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite compare it to other products, this is my first straightening iron</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use too much product to keep my hair from becoming split frizzy and weak!</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick hair and this flat iron works magic.</li>
            <li> but I am new at using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am of African American decent</li>
            <li> My sister in law recently used it and was surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new flat iron, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It did an okay job on my daughters hair (very thick and curly, she&#x27;s mixed b&amp;w), so I would not recommend this straightener if you have hair like hers.  </li>
            <li> saw these at the mall selling for $200    With my curly hair this is the only straightener that will actually straighten my hair, and it keeps it straight for up to 4 days, and it only takes me 15 min to straighten my long hair    </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this straightner for people who don&#x27;t want to spent alot of money on one.</li>
            <li> Straightening is usually too much of a hassle for me.</li>
            <li> but if yor hair is longer/wavier/on the thicker side, my advice would be to buy a wider plate flat iron .</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron two years ago and is still working.</li>
            <li> I have bought every flat iron out there</li>
            <li> I use to have to buy a new Conair or Revlon iron every few years or so...</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable compared to those expensive professional flat irons.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little hesitant because I was not familiar with the amika brand.</li>
            <li> non has lasted this long or worked this</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay on long enough to get the job done, or even partially done or</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought a different straightener, one that I can use and one that I like.</li>
            <li> but apparently they sell a midnight balack one with black plates</li>
            <li> Like the other cheaper irons that are only ceramic coated.   </li>
            <li> Is that normal to have to buy a new EXPENSIVE iron every year?</li>
            <li> This iron&#x27;s ceramic plates actually measure 1\\&quot; wide -- the other 1/2\\&quot; inch is desired by measuring the side / height of the iron -- and is included in the 1.5\\&quot; measurement.      </li>
            <li> After having to pay $22.95 to send my old one in and recieve a new one, I am still not impressed.</li>
            <li> Which was probably due to Amika being 100% ceramic vs. ceramic coated plates.   </li>
            <li> Now my question is if I should buy another Amika or some other brand...?   </li>
            <li> After I bought this I was approached three times by other workers at the mall, and depending on what I was wearing they would try to sell it to me for anywhere between $50 and $120.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe what the companies promise you, especially when they vary in price quite a bit.   </li>
            <li> I even tried to contact the corporate to see if they can help me, they were extremely rude and would not help me at all.</li>
            <li> 7 months later...changed my rating down from 5 stars to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and found that after using this product for a few weeks, it out performs any other product out there that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> i rlly ony thought tyhat cuz the plates were black</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or damage it nearly as much as other irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> We found few sellers at eBay / Amazon that sell duplicate irons that are not safe to use .If</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how you could go wrong with such a time saver as this product is.</li>
            <li> Seriously rethink spending your money, because it was not worth it!</li>
            <li> I had tried other irons before and was never happy with any of them.</li>
            <li> Hard to know.</li>
            <li> That shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to get.  </li>
            <li> Hardly need the hair dryer anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> i have never had worse split ends in my life.</li>
            <li> My iron is turning off at random.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if it&#x27;s the cord or just a malfunction, but I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst customer service.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This flat iron is so great at giving my hair shine while straightening it. I also like the temp control, so that I can adjust it to the temp I need.</li>
            <li> This ceramic styler is amazing, to say the least! I don&#x27;t have to use too much product to keep my hair from becoming split frizzy and weak! It all slides and styles so smoothly you wouldn&#x27;t even know you had a 400 degree (F) iron clamping your hair! I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who  has a need to style their hair pretty much every day like I do.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to pay the extra money and upgrade to an 100% ceramic iron. Yes, it makes a difference. My hair always turns smooth and silky, no frying. Like the other cheaper irons that are only ceramic coated.   Love it!  7 months later...changed my rating down from 5 stars to 4 stars.  My iron is turning off at random. It won&#x27;t stay on long enough to get the job done, or even partially done or sometimes it just won&#x27;t turn on.   I can&#x27;t figure out if it&#x27;s the cord or just a malfunction, but I&#x27;m so disappointed. (And, of course, I just finally threw away the box it came in, so now I definitely can&#x27;t return it.)  I loved this iron up until now. It&#x27;s more expensive than your drugstore brand irons, but I don&#x27;t think it should die after only 7 months!   What happened to making products that last? It&#x27;s like we live in a disposable world these days. Is that normal to have to buy a new EXPENSIVE iron every year? I thought paying a higher price would mean getting a better product &amp; would also&#x3D; better quality /durability.   Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do. I use to have to buy a new Conair or Revlon iron every few years or so...then I decided to fork over more money for a better product, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it..? The initial results were fantastic, I noticed a big difference from my old cheaper irons. Which was probably due to Amika being 100% ceramic vs. ceramic coated plates.   Now my question is if I should buy another Amika or some other brand...?   Wish me luck, I have been on the look out for a truly great iron for 10 yrs. now. It&#x27;s hard to believe what the companies promise you, especially when they vary in price quite a bit.   My hair dresser uses the Bio-ionic One-pass iron and my hair always looks fantastic, but was it the iron, or the shampoo&amp; products she used..? Hard to know. My friends all recommended the CHI, but the product description basically matched the Amika and then I read or heard similar stories of their CHI dying after one yr.   Huuuuhhhh!! Ifanyone has any suggestions please leave me a comment.   Thanks.</li>
            <li> The Amika iron is a nice quality product with a comfortable grip. But, I wish I had ordered a wider plate iron because my hair is mid length and on the thicker side.  This iron&#x27;s ceramic plates actually measure 1\\&quot; wide -- the other 1/2\\&quot; inch is desired by measuring the side / height of the iron -- and is included in the 1.5\\&quot; measurement.      I had a 2\\&quot; wide ceramic plate Chi which worked better and faster on my longer/thicker/wavier hair.  On the other hand, my daughter has fine straighter hair than me, and the Amika works great on her!    In a nutshell, great iron for straigter/more fine hair -- but if yor hair is longer/wavier/on the thicker side, my advice would be to buy a wider plate flat iron .</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Amika and all I can say is....FANTASTIC!!  It works great, no pulling my hair, no burnt smell, it leaves my hair shiny and almost no flyaways! It was definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. At first I was a little hesitant because I was not familiar with the amika brand. However, after using it so many times, I have changed my tune. I love this straightener. It is perfect. I am an African American woman with relaxed hair. It leaves my hair silky and smooth. This straightener is excellent.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron, it&#x27;s easier to style my hair and make it look so shiny. I love it !</li>
            <li> this flat iron is just so fantastic. i had a chi for years and it busted, so i bought another one. the chi died in about 9 months because it was made in china and was not as sturdy as the old models! then i decided to go cheap and get a revlon, but it tore my hair apart! i have never had worse split ends in my life. after finding this amika at a great price on amazon, i made the switch. and i am just as happy as a clam! this straightener rocks! my hair looks super healthy and this baby makes my hair routine soooo much shorter than it used to be. shaved a whole ten minutes off in the morning! hopefully this iron will last at least a couple of years, and when it does die, i will surely buy another one! would definitely recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ive ever used at first i questioned if it was a real amika or not but it is they told me nd i rlly ony thought tyhat cuz the plates were black but apparently they sell a midnight balack one with black plates so ya its real nd Ihave already noticed how soft and shinny my hair is yay amika i love u!!!!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery, good package. item is exactly as described, works perfectly. straightens the hair very fast, lasts up to few days (my hair is very resistant). also leaves a way lower amount of frizz than Philips Ceramic Straightener.</li>
            <li> Got the product withing the time frame that was given to me.  The product after inspecting it is brand new.  Considering other sites charge $180, this is definetly worth it.  Plugged it in to see if it works and it does work.  Thanks I really love it, it was def. worth the money.</li>
            <li> What a find!  The website for this product charged 4 times as much as getting it here!  This product was recommended to me.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Amika straightener not quite a year ago. I am severly unimpressed. The first straightener heated up so hot that I couldn&#x27;t even hold onto it. It also burnt my hair in several places causing me to have to go to the beauty salon and get countless inches of my hair cut off. I called the company and they were neither sympathic or helpful. After having to pay $22.95 to send my old one in and recieve a new one, I am still not impressed. This straightener still is very very very harmful to my hair. Still smokes when I use it, and still heats up soo incredibly hot, even on the lowest setting, that I can not handle it. I really wish that I wouldn&#x27;t have spend over $100 for this product; it was most definately not worth it! I finally broke down and bought a different straightener, one that I can use and one that I like. Seriously rethink spending your money, because it was not worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like this straigtner and it is just awsome. Also very fast delivery. It straigtened my hair and my hair is vey curly and was hard for me to find a good product. But i would recommond this product.</li>
            <li> They are horrible. I bought mine from Burlington Mall in Massachusetts. It burns my hair and I tried to return it, they kept telling me that they would try to help me out.I even tried to contact the corporate to see if they can help me, they were extremely rude and would not help me at all. The sales man at the mall told me to wait there until he hears from his boss. Instead he called the security on me.  Did I mention I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant?  The worst customer service. I still can&#x27;t believe I bought this product for $170.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I saw this in the mall and was amazed. I found one on here for muuuch cheaper so I could not pass it up. It was a good straightener, but it didn&#x27;t seem as amazing as the one in the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The humidity did still affect my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair hot, duh.&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord caused it to fall off the counter.&lt;br /&gt;VERY fragile, will shatter very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The ready light was always red.&lt;br /&gt;The outside of the straightener does get hot.&lt;br /&gt;My hair still had the burnt smell.&lt;br /&gt;Did still feel some pulling at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, any issues that you would expect from any straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets very hott quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Curls and flips very well.&lt;br /&gt;Great price from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Most have cute designs.&lt;br /&gt;You also get two handy hair clips.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely 100% Ceramic Plates.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, straightened in one easy swipe.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, for the price, you are getting a good straightener. I do believe the ceramic is better on your hair. I WOULD prefer Amika over CHI. The cons are what you would get from any straightener. But I&#x27;ve never ever been able to flip and curl my hair with any other straightener.</li>
            <li> Product is great but I am new at using a flat iron.  I understand it can also be used to curl but I don&#x27;t know how to use it.  I contacted Amazon numerous times asking for a product manual or instruction book as there was nothing in the box when I opened it.  Amazon has been NO HELP AT ALL IN RESOLVING THIS.  So, I contacted Amika and they said:    \\&quot;We are contacting every buyer on eBay that purchase Amika and notify him about the purchase.  We have only one dealer on eBay / Amazon: SFR.  If you had purchase from SFR you have product warranty and it&#x27;s an original Amika.  We found few sellers at eBay / Amazon that sell duplicate irons that are not safe to use .If you bought from them, and then you have no warranty. You should contact eBay.  Amika\\&quot;    I bought the product on Amazon who stocked the item for Direct Super Center.  But from Amika&#x27;s point of view, Direct Super Center is not authorized to sell the product.  I told Amika they should resolve this with Amazon and not someone who bought their product in good faith and actually likes their product and may continue to be a future customer.  Have never heard back from anyone.      All I want is a product manual.  That shouldn&#x27;t be so hard to get.  Amika should be more aware of other companies selling their products through Amazon and take action there, not against a customer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different flat irons, and I must say that I love this iron. I am an African American with naturally curly hair, and this straightens my hair perfectly all the time. This iron is easy to rotate for curls, has variable temperatures, and is simple to use. I don&#x27;t like that the outside of the flat iron gets so hot though while the iron is on. Overall, I would definitely recommend this flat iron, just buy gloves with it also lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter 11 months ago. She liked it and worked great until it just died. Upon contacting Amika customer service we were told it would cost us $22.95 for shipping and handling to remedy the matter. Any company that would make you pay for shipping and handling on a product that THEY garantee is going to lose my business.</li>
            <li> Great Flat iron. Still learning how to do waves and curls but works great. Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever.  Hardly need the hair dryer anymore.  Perfectly straight hair in 5-10 minutes.  Thanks Mom for the b-day present.  It is truly the most useful gift.</li>
            <li> I personally love the Amika Flat Iron. Good servive and shipped to my house in 2-4 days! It glides, shines and straightens perfectly! It took me 45 minutes to straighten my hair and style it. I would highly recommend this straightner for people who don&#x27;t want to spent alot of money on one. It was worth my money. I am not disappointed at all! Totally worth the money. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item when it was for about $50.  I did some quick research and found it to be selling for much more elsewhere. It heats up very quickly, and has a dial to control the temperature. My sister in law recently used it and was surprised at how well it worked. She has a Revlon one (no comparison). This thing gets PRETTY HOT, so watch your ears and any other skin it comes into contact with. No burning smell or anything like that. I can&#x27;t quite compare it to other products, this is my first straightening iron and I am very pleased with the purchase. I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking of purchasing a great quality straightener.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  The flatiron is great on african american natural hair.  It doesn&#x27;t fry the hair it smooths and straightens the hair well.  Will reccmmend to friends.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener for curly hair I have ever used. It makes my hair silky and straight. I have very curly hair that is prone to breakage. Highly recommend this product for my fellow curly haired people.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick hair and this flat iron works magic. I would recommend it to anyone!! You would never be able to tell that my hair wasn&#x27;t naturally straight. It also curls hair very well! I love it way more than a chi. Sometimes for me chi&#x27;s fry my hair and this doesn&#x27;t do that at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and found that after using this product for a few weeks, it out performs any other product out there that I&#x27;ve ever used. It heats up fast, improves the look and feel of my hair texture and really holds up to most any weather. It&#x27;s been worth every penny of the cost. It ships pretty fast. I don&#x27;t see how you could go wrong with such a time saver as this product is.</li>
            <li> Got this for my gf and she absolutely loves it... i to used hear her complain all the time about her old straightener and it drove me nuts soo.. i got her the amika and the complaining stopped lol</li>
            <li> This is a great hair straightener! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair *too* straight so it still looks natural. Also, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or damage it nearly as much as other irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> saw these at the mall selling for $200    With my curly hair this is the only straightener that will actually straighten my hair, and it keeps it straight for up to 4 days, and it only takes me 15 min to straighten my long hair    Heats up super fast  works better than my CHI and Maxiglide    Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick, curly hair. Straightening is usually too much of a hassle for me. I tried the Amika at a shopping mall kiosk. The seller wanted me to pay almost $200 for it, and I wasn&#x27;t interested. I LOVED how my hair looked and felt, though, so I did some searching when I got home. I found it for less $$ here, and I&#x27;m so glad. My hair has never been so straight and smooth. It&#x27;s super easy to use, and there&#x27;s never any burning hair. I&#x27;ve been out in the rain after using the Amika, and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz. That&#x27;s kind of a miracle in my world.    The iron is incredibly hot, though, so be careful. I can&#x27;t touch my hair right after each pull through of iron, as it&#x27;s too hot. There&#x27;s also not much of a buffer of plastic on either side of the ceramic; good for getting down to the roots straight, potentially hazardous to your neck or tips of your ears.     Overall, best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now, and it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I had tried other irons before and was never happy with any of them.I ordered this iron and just loved it. It really does my hair so straight and so soft.I have very tick and alot of hair.I was kind of worried that the iron wasn&#x27;t going to work on my hair.It did and I get alot of compliments on how my hair looks.I recommend this iron to everybody that have alot of hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener works great on my hair, but my hair is fairly easy to straighten.  It did an okay job on my daughters hair (very thick and curly, she&#x27;s mixed b&amp;w), so I would not recommend this straightener if you have hair like hers.  It did work great on my sister-in-laws hair, her hair is curly but not very thick.  Compared to the prices I have seen other places, this is an excellent buy on this straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron two years ago and is still working. I am of African American decent but it worked on my natural hair without a blow dryer at the 1/2 way heat setting. It has been dropped, kicked, wet, and is still going strong. It last for days every time I use it I am in love with it I take it everywhere even if I am not in need of it. I have bought every flat iron out there non has lasted this long or worked this well it is truly a piece of art. You must buy it.</li>
            <li> I love my amika stylers and i am glad i bought two pair , i will be buying them again. just to have an extra pair. i don&#x27;t want to be without them, my daughter will need a pair when she go off to college</li>
            <li> This Amika flat iron is by far the best i have ever purchased. It works fast, well, and my hair looks healthier and shinier. Price is very reasonable compared to those expensive professional flat irons.</li>
            <li> The Amika flat iron works great.  There is no burnt smell in my hair. My hair looks healthier.  It heats up very fast and does not pull my hair while using it.  If you are looking for a new flat iron, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive. I first bought one at a kiosk in the mall, and when it broke I wanted another one. After I bought this I was approached three times by other workers at the mall, and depending on what I was wearing they would try to sell it to me for anywhere between $50 and $120. It&#x27;s a great straightener, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Heats up in seconds. Nice long cord. Leaves hair super straight and shiny, doesn&#x27;t look fried at all. Love it! Definitely worth the price. Cheaper straighteners would leave my hair looking fried and bad, this one is the best.</li>
