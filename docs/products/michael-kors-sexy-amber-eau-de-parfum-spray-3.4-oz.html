            <li>This is a rich sexy smell.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged as described but has no scent!</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic.  </li>

            <li>I love it and the size is great because you can have it for a long time so worth the deal.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very rich and price was very reasonable for the 3.4 Oz spray.</li>
            <li>First time buyer!</li>
            <li>The warm amber in it is so romantic and luscious.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I  buy it again, but it&#x27;s worth a try</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very sensual.</li>
            <li>Soft, not loud, but elegant.</li>
            <li>Very nice...but a little to strong when first put on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had women chase me down the aisles in stores to tell me how lovely my fragrance is.  </li>
            <li>I can only hope that they keep making this fragrance for a long time - I love it.  </li>
            <li>this is the first time that an Eau Da Parfum does not last AT ALL!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic, yet it is a little on the sweet side.</li>
            <li>I like it, but there are other fragrances out there that are comparable in price and fragrance and stay with you much longer.</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my big bottle smelled a little different than the sample.</li>
            <li> less than 5 minutes later l did not smell.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received this two days ago, after ordering it 12 days ago, and my wife said something is not right with it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money can&#x27;t tell I have it on</li>
            <li> l returned it the next day unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I had a small sampler</li>
            <li> I actually bought this expensive perfume after smelling the magazine card/sample.  </li>
            <li> Yes, Taking a chance on something I might not love?  </li>
            <li> SO SAD</li>
            <li> Crazy?  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Aniverasury gift wife loved, Idid good</li>
            <li> Very nice...but a little to strong when first put on.</li>
            <li> my wife didn&#x27;t like it.for a michael kors brand .it&#x27;s unusual. !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great sexy scent, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a rich sexy smell.  However, if you don&#x27;t put it on your clothes the scent is gone in about 2 hours.  I like it, but there are other fragrances out there that are comparable in price and fragrance and stay with you much longer.</li>
            <li> My wife was delighted.  Got lots of brownie points with this purchase.</li>
            <li> l returned it the next day unfortunately. this is the first time that an Eau Da Parfum does not last AT ALL! less than 5 minutes later l did not smell. SO SAD</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. It&#x27;s my go to perfume and I always get compliments that I smell wonderful amd they always ask what I am wearing. You can&#x27;t go wrong with sexy amber.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. Smell sooo good. I love perfumes,  i have a great collection. This is a must keep. I get great complement from friends</li>
            <li> I had a small sampler and I feel like my big bottle smelled a little different than the sample. Not totally what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. I wanted to return it but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I can do that since I&#x27;ve already opened it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, great fragrance!</li>
            <li> Love it they came in time for x mas</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> love Love LOVE!!!!!!!  Best scent in the world!!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this expensive perfume after smelling the magazine card/sample.  Crazy?  Yes, Taking a chance on something I might not love?  Yes.  But oh my.  This smells fantastic.  And what a deal!</li>
            <li> For some reason the fragance just does not last</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. I received this two days ago, after ordering it 12 days ago, and my wife said something is not right with it. She took it to a store to compare with a bottle of perfume there. When compared, there is a noticable difference between both appearance and smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance on my wife</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this parfum again</li>
            <li> This perfume is a hit!  I wear it and often someone will ask me what I am wearing and this is it .  The warm amber in it is so romantic and luscious. I love it and the size is great because you can have it for a long time so worth the deal.  And Amazon is so good about getting it to you almost as soon as you order it. Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this beautiful fragrance, so do EVERYONE who gets  in arm reach. Soft, not loud, but elegant. Thanks amazon. The price, the immediate delivery and your very courteous staff is Excellent.  Janet Lott</li>
            <li> Michael Kors never disappoints! I love the sexy amber fragrance! It is sexy for sure! This is a great date night perfume!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good date night perfume or even a professional job perfume. It&#x27;s classic, yet it is a little on the sweet side. I wouldn&#x27;t say sugary at all, but it&#x27;s smooth. Almost a caramel scent is what I can compare it to. I received it as a gift and I am really loving it. It&#x27;s very seductive! Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love MK Sexy Amber!</li>
            <li> I can only hope that they keep making this fragrance for a long time - I love it.  The price here was the best.....</li>
            <li> Great perfum, love it</li>
            <li> I love the smell it has. It&#x27;s very sensual. Also the fragrance lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Arrived quickly and packaged as described but has no scent! Had to return it. I asked many people if they could smell it and no one could even tell I had anything on. It is a lovely scent...if it is there.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance.. I wear chanel products and this something different. I like it. Don&#x27;t know if I  buy it again, but it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> This purchase was the perfect gift for my wife. The fragrance is very rich and price was very reasonable for the 3.4 Oz spray.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. It is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> First time buyer! Just as described... Sexy!!! Smells absolutely beautiful! Would buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money can&#x27;t tell I have it on</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, glad we got it for my wife. She loves it so so I.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells ok, but i can&#x27;t smell it on my clothes for long.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this parfum!!! I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;smell myself&amp;#34; so I spray, walk into it &amp; do the same backwards.  I&#x27;ve had women chase me down the aisles in stores to tell me how lovely my fragrance is.  I&#x27;m hoping to find a rollerball just to carry in my purse.  I wear this whether I&#x27;m going anywhere or not! even after my nighttime routine before I go to bed.  It makes me feel good!  I highly recommend!!</li>
