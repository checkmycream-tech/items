    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I used them with the recommended hand remedy cream (which smells wonderful by the way)</li>
            <li>These gloves are the best!</li>
            <li>and there are amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>These are excellent in softening hands.</li>
            <li>These gloves are great.  </li>
            <li>So Great</li>
            <li>/&gt;this Would make a Great Gift To.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>love These &amp; Very Very Happy &amp; pleased !!</li>
            <li>&quot; he says they feel great and the gloves work amazing.  </li>
            <li>I never could wear gloves to work in, as I couldn&#x27;t feel the texture of the soil and the plants that I loved to feel.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>but they are very comfortable!  </li>
            <li>these are great for those winter hands that are a huge problems  just wear them at night with lotion</li>
            <li>but these are too bulky and warm.</li>
            <li>This helps to warm and activate the goodness there as well  (IMHO).</li>
            <li>After all the good reviews I was so excited to have moisturized hands again.</li>
            <li>Most nights I wear them all night.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m so glad i bought them</li>
            <li>In the morning, my hands were 100% better.  </li>
            <li>This really is an interesting idea.</li>
            <li>My hands will look okay after using them at night until about noon</li>
            <li>Definite A+ and a perfect gift for him-</li>
            <li>I do love these gloves.</li>
            <li>gotta love  &#x27;em</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I cleaned the gloves with disinfecting wipes and flipped them inside out between use which got rid of most of the odor.</li>
            <li>These gloves are worth the money!!</li>
            <li>For starters, they have great emolients (like jojoba oil) and the gel cushions dry, calloused skin so nicely.  </li>
            <li>Sure would have been nice to have a size for us people with large hands/long fingers.</li>
            <li>i put these on as i slide into bed and by morning, my hands are as good as new!  </li>
            <li>If it was easy, I would return them.</li>
            <li>However, they do keep the lotion in, and your hands will be smooth, if you can keep them on all night.</li>
            <li>(I checked throughout the night to make sure that they were not cutting off my circulation or giving me a rash.)</li>
            <li>However, you can easily hand wash the gloves or pop them in the washing machine to clean them.  </li>
            <li>but now they are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>the Morning, I took off,  Washed my Hands In Mild Soap  </li>
            <li>I will for sure buy a new pair every winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay is pretty much all there is to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Let me me reassure you that these therapeutic gloves are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>these gloves are worth the money.</li>
            <li>I did notice my hands were very smooth and there was no dry skin after using these over night.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;ve tried them without first applying lotion and the result is about the same.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got too hot.</li>
            <li>I still wash my hands a lot with hot water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I am a health care worker and my hands are pretty beat.</li>
            <li>I love these gloves to much that I even bought a second pair to use when the first pair are in the laundry basket waiting to be washed.  </li>
            <li>Used every other night for about 15 minutes, they are quite effective in healing my hands.</li>
            <li>i caught on to these because ive heard good results from more expensive competitors.</li>
            <li>I tried many different lotions (really expensives ones, too).</li>
            <li>These gloves are about a size 9, so they are way too large.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would suggest is ordering a size larger than you would expect because they are tight to get on, otherwise they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>id really like to know</li>
            <li>and I did not feel they really helped</li>
            <li>These gloves work really well.</li>
            <li>and it really helped heal my hands.</li>
            <li>So far the gloves have been fairly useful, although they do make your hands sweaty if you wear them overnight.</li>
            <li>Make your hands so soft!!!  </li>
            <li>and I really had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>they do work well if i wear them while watching tv or something, but i&#x27;m usually pretty busy at night</li>
            <li>After one more overnight use, my hands had returned to their previous condition.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>wore  mine to bed,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; woke up with Soft Hands !!</li>
            <li>On Few Or More Hours To Tel</li>
            <li>Tips: to put on, place the finger as far in as it will easily go, and with other hand work the glove finger</li>
            <li>Since then, I have used the gloves a couple of times per week to keep my hand soft.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Near My Bed</li>
            <li>When I wear these during the night the next day my hands are like new.</li>
            <li>My hands were sooo dry and chapped, they were cracking, so it really hurt.</li>
            <li>The next morning my hands were surprisingly soft!  </li>
            <li>I only use at night, and after I am sure there are no tasks to be done (impossible pretty much).</li>
            <li>He has worn them for about a week and says they are comfortable and has made his skin feel less dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>Rubber inside, soft outside.</li>
            <li>:work the opposite hand into the glove to break suction - up each finger, nearly to the tip -</li>
            <li>i was very excited to get this product but am not particularly happy with it.</li>
            <li>OK - these are hard to get on, harder to get off, they do stretch at the bottom - but</li>
            <li>Only problem I have is the joint in the gloves where the thumb meets the index finger there were pretty worn down areas, almost holes.  </li>
            <li>and i wash my hands all day, leaving my hands cracking and bleeding from all the harsh soaps and hot water.  </li>
            <li>** them - because they WORK - as well as the messy, drippy hot wax baths.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I found these gloves very heavy and hot to wear to bed</li>
            <li> I thought that my hands would never return to their previously soft condition, but, luckily, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> These gloves are different from all of those other products (some of which were much more expensive).  </li>
            <li> These gloves do the trick: after just a few days the cracks have healed and my hands are soft!</li>
            <li> There are other more expensive brands out there</li>
            <li> With a toddler and a baby, all I do is wash dishes and my hands all day long.</li>
            <li> I stopped using them immediately and offered them to my mom whose hands are unaffected by it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think anyone with rough hands need look further than these-  </li>
            <li> My hands are wrinkled and dry.</li>
            <li> After buying and using 8 - 10 products that promised to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; extremely dry and cracking hands, I came across these gloves.  </li>
            <li> My husband has really dry hands and sore cracked fingers.  </li>
            <li> and then my hands start to really dry out before I use the product.    </li>
            <li> My hands are DRY.</li>
            <li> Dry, itchy, cracked, sometimes bleeding.</li>
            <li> and I woke up to intensely dry, sweaty, and GRAY hands.</li>
            <li> My hands used to be as dry and scaly as Ann Coulter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> Hands Were So dry  </li>
            <li> My hands are always dry and rough from hand washing.</li>
            <li> These gloves were bought for my husband who has very dry hands.</li>
            <li> I had very dry hands from using abrasive hand soap at work/public restrooms.</li>
            <li> If/when I awaken to use the bathroom, gloves come off for the night (too hard to put back on in middle of night).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same results just applying lotion and then using plastic gloves for a few hours.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry and cracked due to the type of work I perform.</li>
            <li> I usually take them off in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion and every other thing I could find.  </li>
            <li> I was severely let down.</li>
            <li> I bought the gloves to sleep in, hoping they would make my hands look less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I was desperate because all of the other products that I had used seemed to only work for an hour or two before my hands returned to their prior condition (or less time if I to wash my hands).</li>
            <li> Yes, for those of us on a (relatively) tight budget, $24.99 can be a lot to shell out for a pair of gloves.  </li>
            <li> They could be a little longer in the cuff.</li>
            <li> I put bag balm on my hands and put these gloves on and within a few day my hands are healed...</li>
            <li> wear them again In few Nights..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people like them.</li>
            <li> Also, these are rather small.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had was after a few uses they started feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> If you are troubled by dry, cracked skin on your hands -- buy this.  </li>
            <li> They do work, but they are hard to get on and really hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Hard to don and doff.</li>
            <li> I have worn them at least two hours every night since getting them.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t See where ANY negative  reviews,&lt;br /&gt;You Gotta Leave These</li>
            <li> Yes, this is clumsy product to dress and un-dress - but the point of it is why.</li>
            <li> They are heavy and weird.</li>
            <li> I got tired of always using lotion on my hands, so I thought I&#x27;d try these gloves.</li>
            <li> If you use them with the cream, you will need to wash the gloves after a few uses because they will start to take on an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> These are WEIRD.</li>
            <li> No way can you pull your hand out - silly to try.</li>
            <li> From This cold Weather  &amp;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> , sorry!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I had another pair but they wore out from use. I put bag balm on my hands and put these gloves on and within a few day my hands are healed...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay is pretty much all there is to say about this product. I&#x27;ve had the same results just applying lotion and then using plastic gloves for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am 65 and have worked a garden since I was a child. My hands are wrinkled and dry. I never could wear gloves to work in, as I couldn&#x27;t feel the texture of the soil and the plants that I loved to feel. I have been using intensive therapy hand cream for years. But it has never worked for any length of time to help. I bought the gloves to sleep in, hoping they would make my hands look less wrinkled. I have worn them at least two hours every night since getting them. Most nights I wear them all night. I have noticed a measurable difference in the look of my hands. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> terrific product!  i found mine at linens and things and balked at the price.  but i&#x27;m so glad i bought them - they work wonders overnight!  like another review on here wrote, i&#x27;m a mom of two and i wash my hands all day, leaving my hands cracking and bleeding from all the harsh soaps and hot water.  i put these on as i slide into bed and by morning, my hands are as good as new!  (i&#x27;ve tried them without first applying lotion and the result is about the same.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t worry about the price - get them!  you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I wear a size 7 women&#x27;s glove. These gloves are about a size 9, so they are way too large. I&#x27;m not sure why people like them. My hands feel no different after wearing them to bed. I usually take them off in the middle of the night. If it was easy, I would return them.</li>
            <li> i just purchased these because ive been struggling to control my hand eczema. i caught on to these because ive heard good results from more expensive competitors. i receive it today and it says  specifically dont use if you have eczema. why? id really like to know</li>
            <li> These are WEIRD. Rubber inside, soft outside. They are heavy and weird. However, they do keep the lotion in, and your hands will be smooth, if you can keep them on all night. I got too hot.</li>
            <li> I found these gloves very heavy and hot to wear to bed and I did not feel they really helped, they are now land fill.</li>
            <li> After buying and using 8 - 10 products that promised to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; extremely dry and cracking hands, I came across these gloves.  I was desperate because all of the other products that I had used seemed to only work for an hour or two before my hands returned to their prior condition (or less time if I to wash my hands). These gloves are different from all of those other products (some of which were much more expensive).  I used them with the recommended hand remedy cream (which smells wonderful by the way) and I put them on before I went to bed the night after I got them and left them on overnight. (I checked throughout the night to make sure that they were not cutting off my circulation or giving me a rash.) In the morning, my hands were 100% better.  After one more overnight use, my hands had returned to their previous condition.  Since then, I have used the gloves a couple of times per week to keep my hand soft.  I haven&#x27;t changed my behavior.  I still wash my hands a lot with hot water.  If you use them with the cream, you will need to wash the gloves after a few uses because they will start to take on an unpleasant odor.  However, you can easily hand wash the gloves or pop them in the washing machine to clean them.  I love these gloves to much that I even bought a second pair to use when the first pair are in the laundry basket waiting to be washed.  I thought that my hands would never return to their previously soft condition, but, luckily, I was wrong. These gloves are the best!</li>
            <li> I tried these for a couple of hours as soon as they came and then again later at night when I went to bed.  I sure did look weird wearing girly blue gloves but no one can see me at night when I&#x27;m sleeping.    The next morning my hands were surprisingly soft!  Only problem I have is the joint in the gloves where the thumb meets the index finger there were pretty worn down areas, almost holes.  No, they&#x27;re not from me trying to put them on, they were there before I even put them on my hands.      Also, these are rather small.  Sure would have been nice to have a size for us people with large hands/long fingers.</li>
            <li> Yes, for those of us on a (relatively) tight budget, $24.99 can be a lot to shell out for a pair of gloves.  Let me me reassure you that these therapeutic gloves are worth every penny.  For starters, they have great emolients (like jojoba oil) and the gel cushions dry, calloused skin so nicely.  You slip these on for about three hours at time and you definitely FEEL a difference in the condition of your skin.  You won&#x27;t regret buying these gloves.  They last for about 40 uses...........It&#x27;s like bringing the spa to your living room, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> these gloves are worth the money. My hands were sooo dry and chapped, they were cracking, so it really hurt. With a toddler and a baby, all I do is wash dishes and my hands all day long. I tried many different lotions (really expensives ones, too). These gloves do the trick: after just a few days the cracks have healed and my hands are soft! I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> These gloves work really well. My hands are very dry and cracked due to the type of work I perform. Used every other night for about 15 minutes, they are quite effective in healing my hands. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion and every other thing I could find.  Nothing worked until I found these gloves.  I will for sure buy a new pair every winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!</li>
            <li> These gloves were bought for my husband who has very dry hands. He has worn them for about a week and says they are comfortable and has made his skin feel less dry and cracked. They could be a little longer in the cuff.</li>
            <li> Make your hands so soft!!!  My husband has really dry hands and sore cracked fingers.  These gloves are worth the money!!</li>
            <li> These gloves are great.  I wish I had found them sooner.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing the booties soon for my feet.</li>
            <li> This really is an interesting idea. I need to find a moisturizer that works for my hands. My hands will look okay after using them at night until about noon and then my hands start to really dry out before I use the product.    So, perhaps this product isn&#x27;t necessarily as helpful to everyone. Perhaps my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews I was so excited to have moisturized hands again. My hands are DRY. Dry, itchy, cracked, sometimes bleeding. I needed a solution and I really had high hopes for this product. I was severely let down. These gloves were not intended to moisturize hands, they were obviously just soften them. I put them on overnight as directed and I woke up to intensely dry, sweaty, and GRAY hands. Yes, my hands were gray. I stopped using them immediately and offered them to my mom whose hands are unaffected by it. She even has the socks of the same brand. Did not work for me though, sorry!</li>
            <li> i was very excited to get this product but am not particularly happy with it. i wanted moisturizing gloves that i could sleep in but these are too bulky and warm. i always end up taking them off after a couple minutes. they do work well if i wear them while watching tv or something, but i&#x27;m usually pretty busy at night so this doesn&#x27;t happen often. will probably look for lighter, basic cotton gloves next time.</li>
            <li> If you are troubled by dry, cracked skin on your hands -- buy this.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Overnight your skin is restored.  Now on my fourth pair!</li>
            <li> My hands are always dry and rough from hand washing. I got tired of always using lotion on my hands, so I thought I&#x27;d try these gloves. They do work, but they are hard to get on and really hard to get off. I&#x27;m a guy, and these gloves are even too big for my hands. They seem to work well. I just wish I could get them on/off easier.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends dad is a landscaper and has had problems with his hands (especially during the winter) for years.  He has been wearing these almost every night since I gave him these for xmas and while his hands aren&#x27;t \\&quot;cured\\&quot; he says they feel great and the gloves work amazing.  There are other more expensive brands out there but I don&#x27;t think anyone with rough hands need look further than these-  Definite A+ and a perfect gift for him-</li>
            <li> Made my hands stink. Hard to don and doff.</li>
            <li> I do love these gloves. I am a health care worker and my hands are pretty beat. When I wear these during the night the next day my hands are like new.</li>
            <li> these are great for those winter hands that are a huge problems  just wear them at night with lotion and there are amazing!!!  gotta love  &#x27;em</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is ordering a size larger than you would expect because they are tight to get on, otherwise they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I did notice my hands were very smooth and there was no dry skin after using these over night. The only issue I had was after a few uses they started feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> I used these last night after they arrived.  I didn&#x27;t think they would work but they are very comfortable!  My hands used to be as dry and scaly as Ann Coulter&#x27;s face but now they are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> These R What i Been needing !!  WOW,&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t See where ANY negative  reviews,&lt;br /&gt;You Gotta Leave These On Few Or More Hours To Tel The Difference,&lt;br /&gt;I wore  mine to bed,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; woke up with Soft Hands !!&lt;br /&gt;They Smell So Great To !!&lt;br /&gt;In the Morning, I took off,  Washed my Hands In Mild Soap  And they Still Felt Soft,&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t Belive These Did The Trick !!&lt;br /&gt;My Hands Were So dry  From This cold Weather  &amp;&lt;br /&gt;I have Them Near My Bed In the Plastic Thing They Came in,&lt;br /&gt;Ill wear them again In few Nights..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Seller !!&lt;br /&gt;this Would make a Great Gift To.&lt;br /&gt;I love These &amp; Very Very Happy &amp; pleased !!</li>
            <li> OK - these are hard to get on, harder to get off, they do stretch at the bottom - but I LOVE, LOVE, **LOVE** them - because they WORK - as well as the messy, drippy hot wax baths. Tips: to put on, place the finger as far in as it will easily go, and with other hand work the glove finger onTO your finger - a pushing, caressing motion. This helps to warm and activate the goodness there as well  (IMHO). I only use at night, and after I am sure there are no tasks to be done (impossible pretty much). If/when I awaken to use the bathroom, gloves come off for the night (too hard to put back on in middle of night). NOW - TO REMOVE:work the opposite hand into the glove to break suction - up each finger, nearly to the tip - it works like a charm - if you un-attach each finger separately. No way can you pull your hand out - silly to try. Yes, this is clumsy product to dress and un-dress - but the point of it is why. If it weren&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t work! I would buy again (and will) in a heartbeat - this is my second winter with these mitts.</li>
            <li> These are excellent in softening hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a nearby ROSS store for five dollars and I&#x27;m happy I did they are like heaven on the hands and I also bought the gel booties to match and after one use my hands already feel softer</li>
            <li> I had very dry hands from using abrasive hand soap at work/public restrooms. I used these gloves once a week a night with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and it really helped heal my hands. However, after the third use I noticed an odor on my hands and the gloves themselves. Afterwards, I cleaned the gloves with disinfecting wipes and flipped them inside out between use which got rid of most of the odor. So far the gloves have been fairly useful, although they do make your hands sweaty if you wear them overnight.</li>
