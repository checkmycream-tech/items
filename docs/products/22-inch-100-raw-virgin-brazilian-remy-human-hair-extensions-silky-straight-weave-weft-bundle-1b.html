            <li>And plus the price is cheap!!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and it came on time</li>
            <li>It arrived way sooner than original date!</li>
            <li>It came early which is fine wit me it didn&#x27;t come in the package that is displayed on the picture but from the feel of the hair I can tell it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>amazingly nnd still very soft</li>
            <li>they come basically in 1/2 packs you would need 6 packs for a full head</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Very deceiving that they use an image of the original Empyrean hair.</li>
            <li>This hair can&#x27;t be real , it didn&#x27;t come in the empyrean box &amp; also every time I brush or comb it , atleast 5 strands of hair fall out .</li>
            <li>It is not as it appears in the picture, it&#x27;s much thinner.</li>
            <li>becuz i paid my money for it, but i will definitely add more hair to it, and a different type of hair.</li>
            <li>Overall its okay but not the same quality.</li>
            <li>normally would&#x27;ve got three but</li>
            <li>Omg its so soft no tangles no shedding , nnd</li>
            <li>You will need at least 5 bundles to make a full head with decent density.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and natural looking, when I had it installed it sheds a little bit but not too much!</li>
            <li>this was too thin and had many split ends...</li>
            <li>but eventually it tangle a little no matter how much care you  put into it.</li>
            <li>Pretty hair but very little for the price.</li>

            <li> Love this hair it&#x27;s so soft and natural looking, when I had it installed it sheds a little bit but not too much! would definitily recommend to buy 2 bondels even tho it is already a lot of hair with one but if your playin on weaving it in I would get 2 for extra thickness</li>
            <li> This is Theee WORST HAIR EVER !!! It&#x27;s very thin they come basically in 1/2 packs you would need 6 packs for a full head Not 22 inches AT ALL ends of the hair are very thin As Well I ordered 2 packs because I was doing in betweens normally would&#x27;ve got three but ordering two packs is like ordering one its horrible !!!! NEVER ORDER THIS HAIR AND IT DOESNT COME PACKAGED LIKE THAT !!!!</li>
            <li> Got the job done! No complaints</li>
            <li> I like the hair, it&#x27;s not the same as the photo!! I haven&#x27;t installed the hair yet, but it looks good! And plus the price is cheap!! What y&#x27;all expect Beyonc&amp;egrave; weave??👍👍👏</li>
            <li> I have not installed the hair yet, but its not like the picture. The bundle is not full and the thickness at the bottom of the hair is very thin. Its definitely not like the picture at all. Im going to be installing it though becuz i paid my money for it, but i will definitely add more hair to it, and a different type of hair.</li>
            <li> bad quailty of Hair tangled very fast Didn&#x27;t Last a Week</li>
            <li> Really thin...sheds like crazy a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is %100 human hair but you buy 6 bundle hair full head !!!!!!😠😠😠😠😠😠 I buy two hair have one hair really so sad like amazon !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best (Hair)I have ever bought in my life!!!</li>
            <li> Dont be fooled by the picture. It doesn&#x27;t come in any sort of packaging. the hair thins out about five inches and the ramaining of it is about a few strands of hair. Total rip off!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and I&#x27;m waiting to get it.  The hair looks like it&#x27;s good quality based on the picture that is displayed. I bought the hair because of the length 22 inch, I hope that&#x27;s what I get. I&#x27;m real nervous now because I see that their are a lot of negative reviews. I will respond back once the product comes.</li>
            <li> I just bought this item and another one. I just received it in the mail. I absolutely love it. I was scared to buy it because of the bad reviews but I wanted to try it for myself. I love it and it came on time</li>
            <li> This is not the Empyrean Hair brand as pictured its another no name brand. The hair looks great when you first get it but eventually it tangle a little no matter how much care you  put into it. Empyrean hair never tangles. Very deceiving that they use an image of the original Empyrean hair. Overall its okay but not the same quality.</li>
            <li> The hair is nice but waaaaaay over-priced!! You will need at least 5 bundles to make a full head with decent density. I got it because I don&#x27;t keep a sew-in for very long. I wouldn&#x27;t do it again. I will update if I can keep it in for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...I&#x27;m sending it back! It is not as it appears in the picture, it&#x27;s much thinner.</li>
            <li> This hair is a 10!!! Omg its so soft no tangles no shedding , nnd I just bleached this hair nnd it took the bleach nnd color amazingly nnd still very soft</li>
            <li> The hair I received looks nothing like the picture the hair is stringy and sheads a lot it&#x27;s not in the same type of packaging as the picture show. I would not recommended any to buy this its not the same hair.</li>
            <li> It came early which is fine wit me it didn&#x27;t come in the package that is displayed on the picture but from the feel of the hair I can tell it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> this was too thin and had many split ends...wore it for three weeks and tossed it in the trash..</li>
            <li> If you ask me this is the best hair out for the lowest price and the customer service is outstanding</li>
            <li> Pretty hair but very little for the price. Was very disappointed with the little bit of hair that was sent.😒</li>
            <li> The bundle was too small</li>
