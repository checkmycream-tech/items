            <li>I love the smell of jasmine and this fragrance was amazing!</li>
            <li>I always loved the smell of jasmine and this fragrance captures the aroma I love.</li>
            <li>My favorite is some bath gift set that I bought in Walmart after Christmas (super good deal).</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and ordered one more today from another seller for $23.00</li>
            <li>I just think it has more alcohol</li>
            <li>It looks okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>my favorite scent...love it</li>
            <li>I love the scent and hopefully will be able to purchase more when it is gone.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of Jasmine.</li>
            <li>Love it, wear it every day and will order more.</li>
            <li>It is very clean sent and is safe for men to wear as well.</li>
            <li>It smells very clean and flowery -</li>
            <li>Use as a light perfume for work every day.  </li>
            <li>this was a gift for my sister who loved this perfume in her younger days.  </li>
            <li>It was fresh, clean, and floral.</li>
            <li>and it may smell better on an older person, who knows, but on me smells like flowers with pee....</li>
            <li>GREAT N NOT VERY STRONG..</li>
            <li>......I was expecting the smell of Jasmine, it actually smells like musk and kind of bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really like it - you can do what I do - spray it on your linens for a fresh bed each night.</li>
            <li>so when I first spray on on me it spill from the neck area of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite in white jasmine.</li>
            <li>I dropped my first bottle I bought on my tile floor.  </li>
            <li>This eau de toilette smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li>, I was surprised how genuine the scent is.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such  a shame because I read the reviews and they were braving about such amazing perfume that I was excited about buying.</li>
            <li>Subtle Jasmine smell for summer time is another great addition to my perfume collection.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, a simple light simple smell, doesn&#x27;t have some of the undertones of other scents that most perfumes do</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t get the jasmine from it -</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>i expected more from the woods of windsor.</li>
            <li>Like the fresh scent which is exactly as described, would prefer longer lasting.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is true to the scent of white jasmine.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted a jasmine perfume and it was difficult to find it in the US - more easy to find in Asia and other parts of the world.&lt;br /&gt;Found Woods of Windsor and it was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Everything was as expected , I love the scent even if it didn&#x27;t last for long , it&#x27;s for day time.</li>
            <li>I think any lady who loves perfume would be pleased with this very delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li>Customers should know that it is a very delicate scent which is probably going to be too light for evening or apecial occasion use.</li>

            <li> Use as a light perfume for work every day.  Like the fresh scent which is exactly as described, would prefer longer lasting.  Good value for the price.  Customers should know that it is a very delicate scent which is probably going to be too light for evening or apecial occasion use.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected , I love the scent even if it didn&#x27;t last for long , it&#x27;s for day time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know WHAT flower this is supposed to smell like, but it&#x27;s not jasmine. Bought this and the powder on a whim because my fiance told me he LOVES jasmine. It smells very clean and flowery - but I really don&#x27;t get the jasmine from it - every now and again after I spray it I go &amp;#34;Oh there&#x27;s jasmine&amp;#34;. I have used this for over a month and was hoping to get the &amp;#34;jasmine&amp;#34; sooner or later.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give it 3 stars - but it could be my nose/sense of smell? I gave it 4 stars because the quality for the price are incredible. It&#x27;s a very high quality fragrance - and for the price - you can afford to at least &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34;. If you don&#x27;t really like it - you can do what I do - spray it on your linens for a fresh bed each night.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and ordered one more today from another seller for $23.00</li>
            <li> IT arrive on time but, the bottle is not properly seal so when I first spray on on me it spill from the neck area of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Second......I was expecting the smell of Jasmine, it actually smells like musk and kind of bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I will be giving this to my mom or my neighbor, it&#x27;s such  a shame because I read the reviews and they were braving about such amazing perfume that I was excited about buying. :-(&lt;br /&gt;It may also be my body chemistry and it may smell better on an older person, who knows, but on me smells like flowers with pee....oh well.</li>
            <li> JASMINE SMELL!! GREAT N NOT VERY STRONG..AFFORDABLE, LASTS LONG.. IT WAS A GIFT AND THE PERSON LOVED IT.&lt;br /&gt;WILL RECOMMEND BUYING</li>
            <li> Very nice, My Mom liked it a lot</li>
            <li> I received it and it was dripping. My eyes burn whenever I apply the spray. I just think it has more alcohol then it has fragrant oil. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product came on time, and it aroma is what I was looking for. Subtle Jasmine smell for summer time is another great addition to my perfume collection.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is true to the scent of white jasmine. It smells very nice. It&#x27;s not my favorite in white jasmine. My favorite is some bath gift set that I bought in Walmart after Christmas (super good deal). Who&#x27;d a thunk it?!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my sister who loved this perfume in her younger days.  She is very pleased.  I think any lady who loves perfume would be pleased with this very delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is what my wife requested for an Xmas gift.  I opened the box and looked at the box sealed up with the Jasmine Toilette Spray inside.  It looks okay.  I will find out either during Xmas or shortly after if she likes it our not.</li>
            <li> I love this. I dropped my first bottle I bought on my tile floor.  I was heartbroken. My husband asked me to order another one. I really like the smell and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, a simple light simple smell, doesn&#x27;t have some of the undertones of other scents that most perfumes do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER , It did not arrive on time and arrived with missing cap</li>
            <li> I love the smell of jasmine and this fragrance was amazing! It was fresh, clean, and floral. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a jasmine perfume and it was difficult to find it in the US - more easy to find in Asia and other parts of the world.&lt;br /&gt;Found Woods of Windsor and it was exactly what we were looking for. Frangrant jasmine transports you to an enchanted jasmine garden (for those who know the smell!).</li>
            <li> Not exactly the scent I was looking for. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent...love it</li>
            <li> This eau de toilette smells absolutely divine! I love the scent and hopefully will be able to purchase more when it is gone. I have tried and tried to replace my perfume which was disconinued by the manufacturer and this White Jasmine has finally met my criteria. I have worn a jasmine scent for years and years and this one is surely the best I have found.I wish I had known about it earlier.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance woods of Windsor always has fragrancesðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Jasmine. It is very clean sent and is safe for men to wear as well.</li>
            <li> wonderful fresh fragrance, I was surprised how genuine the scent is.  Love it, wear it every day and will order more.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance. It is not too overpowering as some floral fragrances can be. I spray it on every morning and it lasts a long time. I always loved the smell of jasmine and this fragrance captures the aroma I love.</li>
            <li> not that great.. i expected more from the woods of windsor. The perfume scent is not enough. Do even smell it.</li>
