            <li>It seems to really work in the balm or wax evenly for the perfect  glossy sheen.  </li>

            <li>Comfortable feel.</li>
            <li>Fantastic grooming.</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is shaped to fit the curvature of one&#x27;s head, which I like.</li>
            <li>The box is padded, for secure storage and transportation.</li>
            <li>that what you call it?) is a nice solid chunk of wood with a nice look and</li>
            <li>but they went the extra mile with some very nice</li>
            <li>brush itself is sleek, contoured(bristles), smooth with a nice woodgrain finish and a prominant logo which, normally I say &amp;#34;Ick!&amp;#34; but I dig their logo.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>Good solid brush.</li>
            <li>Cool logo reminds me of Rocky and Bullwinkle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to anyone wanting give their beard a more manicured and neat look.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get such an amazing looking brush.</li>
            <li>The brush straightens out my beard hair and helps remove loose strands, it conforms to the curve of my face and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt an emotion for a hair organizing device before, but this little brush is a joy to use.</li>
            <li>The perfect amount of soft and hard in these genuine boar bristles.</li>
            <li>By itself the brush is a nice enough thing to see on your counter</li>
            <li>Far better than synthetic hair brushes</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of stiffness to feel like you&#x27;re getting some work done while brushing.  </li>
            <li>They are just right.</li>
            <li>The contoured bristles are awesome and really hug your face in a way other brushes don&#x27;t and actually let you brush more of your beard at once in single strokes.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I like the curve cut into the bristles, which definitely seems to wrap my face better than level cut bristles.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just absolute heaven to brush with this onyx badboy as it basically hugs your face, embracing your beard (as well any beard should be!)</li>
            <li>The hairs on the comb could not get in between my hairs, almost felt like I was just polishing the first layer of my beard.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast which I am very stoked about.</li>
            <li>I cannot give a rating as to longevity of the bristle retention., but as a new purchase, I believe it to be well worth the reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The tight grouping of the boar hair create a nice even brush.</li>
            <li>I really liked my beard comb and am quite surprised that this brush actually does a much better job of giving my beard the shape I want while taming down the fly-away whiskers.  </li>
            <li>First off, aside from the benefits to your beard and skin from brushing and the benefits of boar hair over other hairs (not really gonna get into that as that stuff is covered at great length elsewhere</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>brush itself is really sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>so it really gets a hold of your hairs and moves them along in the direction you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>While I do see SOME that have decided to put some thought into their design(oh, and the combs... ), something about the rocky mountain look just really sticks out and appeals to</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a testament, imo, to how much thought they put into their product from design to packaging</li>
            <li>I was worried about the bristles being real boar hair</li>
            <li>My beard is sorter on the sides and gradually tapers to a much longer 3&amp;#34; beard on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the brush &amp; brand!</li>
            <li>It is 100% real boar&#x27;s hair, I tested it via the lighter method.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Thus far it is just right for a 1 1/2 cut..</li>
            <li>Also felt good on my scalp as I cut my hair down to a #2 on the clippers and this runs through whats left like a boss.  </li>
            <li>wooden handle feels solid and sturdy unlike other plastic brushes, and the boars hair glides beautifully through the beard.</li>
            <li>The look and packaging are above and beyond so much that it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li>but I think this is normal and have not seen any since.</li>
            <li>I think I might over brush a little much just because it&#x27;s that comfortable and soothing to brush with this brush that I get lost in it.</li>
            <li>Love this little brush!</li>
            <li>Very gentle but with enough grab to release any tangles.</li>
            <li>Soon as I started using it the bristles fall out so easy and leaves a mess.  </li>
            <li>sure enough it was really black boar hair.</li>
            <li>Great quality brush bristles are firm but not too hard to scratch your face</li>
            <li>This boar hair brush beats my old one like it</li>
            <li>But this one works wonders with my wiry old beard.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any beard grower, especially if your beard is less than 4 inches long, and I love how it helps sculpt my mustache.</li>
            <li>It really helps my beard lie flat and stay in shape, and it spreads oil around well.</li>
            <li>shape eliminates that annoying center mass irritation I&#x27;ve experienced from standard shaped brushes and the ends are great for the swooping of the mustache, it even slides through my thick Italian head hair.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give the beard care product community in general</li>
            <li>be foolish and get another brush when clearly, this is your only option.</li>
            <li>Quality in this item is apparent.  </li>
            <li>smaller companies and can&#x27;t scale production like major retailers these days. &#x27;</li>

            <li> While I do see SOME that have decided to put some thought into their design(oh, and the combs... ), something about the rocky mountain look just really sticks out and appeals to</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a testament, imo, to how much thought they put into their product from design to packaging</li>
            <li> I was worried about the bristles being real boar hair</li>
            <li> My beard is sorter on the sides and gradually tapers to a much longer 3&amp;#34; beard on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the brush &amp; brand!</li>
            <li> It is 100% real boar&#x27;s hair, I tested it via the lighter method.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Thus far it is just right for a 1 1/2 cut..</li>
            <li> Also felt good on my scalp as I cut my hair down to a #2 on the clippers and this runs through whats left like a boss.  </li>
            <li> wooden handle feels solid and sturdy unlike other plastic brushes, and the boars hair glides beautifully through the beard.</li>
            <li> The look and packaging are above and beyond so much that it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li> but I think this is normal and have not seen any since.</li>
            <li> I think I might over brush a little much just because it&#x27;s that comfortable and soothing to brush with this brush that I get lost in it.</li>
            <li> Love this little brush!</li>
            <li> Very gentle but with enough grab to release any tangles.</li>
            <li> Soon as I started using it the bristles fall out so easy and leaves a mess.  </li>
            <li> sure enough it was really black boar hair.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush bristles are firm but not too hard to scratch your face</li>
            <li> This boar hair brush beats my old one like it</li>
            <li> But this one works wonders with my wiry old beard.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any beard grower, especially if your beard is less than 4 inches long, and I love how it helps sculpt my mustache.</li>
            <li> It really helps my beard lie flat and stay in shape, and it spreads oil around well.</li>
            <li> shape eliminates that annoying center mass irritation I&#x27;ve experienced from standard shaped brushes and the ends are great for the swooping of the mustache, it even slides through my thick Italian head hair.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give the beard care product community in general</li>
            <li> be foolish and get another brush when clearly, this is your only option.</li>
            <li> Quality in this item is apparent.  </li>
            <li> smaller companies and can&#x27;t scale production like major retailers these days. &#x27;</li>
            <li> A few loose bristles were noted in the first couple uses</li>
            <li> By the way, I use a small amount of beard oil to condition my beard and a small amount of product (either Beard Butter or a wax paste depending on the look I want) and this brush handles both just fine.</li>
            <li> One of the most popular sellers on here is that boring ass military style one I mentioned in the previous paragraph</li>
            <li> brush is stupid good.</li>
            <li> My beard is about 7&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> Inside the box is a foam padded rectangle with a smooth felt side for you to place the brush on bristle side down on which frankly was unnecessary</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brushes.</li>
            <li> The boar bristles are not too hard nor too soft.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet tried with wet oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked to write a review of the Rocky Mountain Military Brush just purchased.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily after only a day or so, but I otherwise think shampooing every single day is excessive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend their products to anyone looking to tame their unruly facial hair.</li>
            <li> I hope to see some of your other products you have to offer.</li>
            <li> but I think after a few strokes with a wide-toothed comb this brush will give my beard that little bit of body and shape to last the day.  </li>
            <li> It does have a little trouble penatrating the longest part of my beard, but my beard is also getting close to 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> Any less than that</li>
            <li> and I see a lot of other plain humdrum brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so tight that it snags your hairs though</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are tightly packed (this is the one thing I might change about the brush as I feel that as my beard gets longer and thicker I might need something with a little breathing room between the bristles)</li>
            <li> I read the dimensions and thought it would be to narrow not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I can say no more without the experience of use.</li>
            <li> A lot of other brushes are just the flat boring military style brush</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD FOR HAIR.</li>
            <li> Quite a few bristles are falling out, disappointing.</li>
            <li> Horrible brush.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just got in the mail, this brush is smooth and effective. Just one swipe through my beard and it detangles and straightens. Works well at applying beard oils. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Nice beard brush just right</li>
            <li> The brush straightens out my beard hair and helps remove loose strands, it conforms to the curve of my face and feels good on my skin.  Also felt good on my scalp as I cut my hair down to a #2 on the clippers and this runs through whats left like a boss.  A few loose bristles were noted in the first couple uses but I think this is normal and have not seen any since.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfectly designed. The tight grouping of the boar hair create a nice even brush. The perfect amount of soft and hard in these genuine boar bristles. And the shape of the brush contoures the face perfectly. I will never need another brush! Thank you, I love my beard!</li>
            <li> Great brush to keep your beard looking sharp!&lt;br /&gt;Stop using plastic combs and plastic brushes and pick this brush up works great after applying beard oil and balm great product the brush is also curve to brush your mustache over a great brush to keep your mustache on fleek</li>
            <li> great brush, nice and gentle on my beard.</li>
            <li> Good product  fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product like always.  The bristles are perfect and I like the contoured shape, it really makes good contact with the beard and skin. This boar hair brush beats my old one like it owes it money!  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Very well made. The way the brush is cut makes it very easy to use. Helps to make your beard look more clean and neat.</li>
            <li> Quality product! Loved the packaging and the bristles</li>
            <li> Good solid brush. I like the curve cut into the bristles, which definitely seems to wrap my face better than level cut bristles. I just wish it had a bit more weight to it. Would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I appreciate that it&#x27;s American made. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than I would expect but smaller companies and can&#x27;t scale production like major retailers these days. &#x27;merica</li>
            <li> Love this little brush! My hair gets oily after only a day or so, but I otherwise think shampooing every single day is excessive. This bursh somehow fixes that, I can get away with eod.</li>
            <li> Feels great and authentic.</li>
            <li> TL;DR at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is stupid good. First off, aside from the benefits to your beard and skin from brushing and the benefits of boar hair over other hairs (not really gonna get into that as that stuff is covered at great length elsewhere and you should know this, bearded person!), the brush is just designed really well and has great packaging/a great look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush:&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is really sturdy and well made. The grip/handle(is that what you call it?) is a nice solid chunk of wood with a nice look and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are tightly packed (this is the one thing I might change about the brush as I feel that as my beard gets longer and thicker I might need something with a little breathing room between the bristles) so it really gets a hold of your hairs and moves them along in the direction you&#x27;re brushing. It&#x27;s not so tight that it snags your hairs though so don&#x27;t worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contour. Oh my! I looove the contour of the bristles that they put on this thing. It&#x27;s just absolute heaven to brush with this onyx badboy as it basically hugs your face, embracing your beard (as well any beard should be!) as you groom your beautiful jaw mane. I think I might over brush a little much just because it&#x27;s that comfortable and soothing to brush with this brush that I get lost in it. Almost hypnotized. A lot of other brushes are just the flat boring military style brush and they suck. Sure, they get the job done but it&#x27;s like comparing a 5 minute truck stop handy to a talented hummer. If you can have the one, you&#x27;re NOT choosing the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so one thing I&#x27;ll give the beard care product community in general is... they know their audience. The know manly. They know what&#x27;s visually appealing to men and they milk it with impressive splendor. Except for a lot of the brushes out there. One of the most popular sellers on here is that boring ass military style one I mentioned in the previous paragraph and I see a lot of other plain humdrum brushes. While I do see SOME that have decided to put some thought into their design(oh, and the combs... ), something about the rocky mountain look just really sticks out and appeals to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is sleek, contoured(bristles), smooth with a nice woodgrain finish and a prominant logo which, normally I say &amp;#34;Ick!&amp;#34; but I dig their logo. It&#x27;s a nice design. By itself the brush is a nice enough thing to see on your counter but they went the extra mile with some very nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Box:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy... like, nice and sturdy. It&#x27;s cardboard but it&#x27;s quality and will serve as a nice display/storage box that you can leave out on your counter with the brush. Inside the box is a foam padded rectangle with a smooth felt side for you to place the brush on bristle side down on which frankly was unnecessary but it&#x27;s a testament, imo, to how much thought they put into their product from design to packaging and I love them for it. I understand the importance of function over form but dammit, I want both!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall TL;DR: It&#x27;s an awesome brush that looks beautiful and functions even better. The contoured bristles are awesome and really hug your face in a way other brushes don&#x27;t and actually let you brush more of your beard at once in single strokes. The look and packaging are above and beyond so much that it&#x27;s pretty much like you get a free display case and counter top decoration with your order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be foolish and get another brush when clearly, this is your only option.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Works amazingly. Perfectly groomed 5/16 Short Beard. Cool logo reminds me of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Gliding it through my hair however worked not at all. NOT GOOD FOR HAIR. FANTASTIC PRODUCT would buy from them again. The boars hair is probably good but who cares when it works this well. VERY GOOD SIZE YOU WOULDNT WANT ONE ANY BIGGER. I read the dimensions and thought it would be to narrow not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> Top-notch quality boar bristles.  Just the right amount of stiffness to feel like you&#x27;re getting some work done while brushing.  It seems to really work in the balm or wax evenly for the perfect  glossy sheen.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried with wet oil but I think after a few strokes with a wide-toothed comb this brush will give my beard that little bit of body and shape to last the day.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this brush!</li>
            <li> Received my brush and I am more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The wooden handle feels solid and sturdy unlike other plastic brushes, and the boars hair glides beautifully through the beard. Far better than synthetic hair brushes I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;The shape eliminates that annoying center mass irritation I&#x27;ve experienced from standard shaped brushes and the ends are great for the swooping of the mustache, it even slides through my thick Italian head hair.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product for the bearded.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I&#x27;ve never felt an emotion for a hair organizing device before, but this little brush is a joy to use. The coarse bristles have cured my beard-druff  and it helps my beard look effortlessly glorious and not overly groomed like a comb sometimes can. I love the contour of the bristles too. It makes it very comfortable to use. A must purchase for beardos everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is the softest brush i have ever used. I was excited to get it. This brush is for stuble beards. Does not even come CLOSE to getting to my skin. I was excited to get such an amazing looking brush. The hairs on the comb could not get in between my hairs, almost felt like I was just polishing the first layer of my beard.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. I&#x27;m a 360 waver and I use it for my beard and hair.. I wanted to give it five stars, but since my head hair is at a shorter length then I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be on thicker hair. Thus far it is just right for a 1 1/2 cut.. Feels amazing.</li>
            <li> A lot of bristles are coming out and into the sink but the brush does a good job</li>
            <li> Love my new Rocky Mountain 100% boar bristle brush for my beard it works great. I was worried about the bristles being real boar hair but I tested it out for my self as soon as I received it I burned a hair to find out and sure enough it was really black boar hair. Would recommend this brush for any type of beard. My beard is about 7&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I have tried several other brushes. But this one works wonders with my wiry old beard. I&#x27;ll be ordering another to keep in my locker at work.</li>
            <li> Works great smells good</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Bristle are just perfect.</li>
            <li> The beard brush is a outstanding product and works Great. The quality is Good and presented well too. The shipping was very fast which I am very stoked about. I hope to see some of your other products you have to offer.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for my beard.  My beard is sorter on the sides and gradually tapers to a much longer 3&amp;#34; beard on my chin.  My barber recommended I get a Beard Brush, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The different lengths of bristles and contoured shape of the brush works perfectly for this type of beard.  I really liked my beard comb and am quite surprised that this brush actually does a much better job of giving my beard the shape I want while taming down the fly-away whiskers.  I would highly recommend this brush to anyone wanting give their beard a more manicured and neat look.  By the way, I use a small amount of beard oil to condition my beard and a small amount of product (either Beard Butter or a wax paste depending on the look I want) and this brush handles both just fine.</li>
            <li> The RM beard brush is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. The boar bristles are not too hard nor too soft. They are just right. This brush encourages brushing my beard because it feels so good. Bottom line, my beard has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice package.</li>
            <li> I purchased the brush for travel. It meets all my requirements in size, bristles, and the box will keep it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush!  Comfortable, soft touch that feels great on the beard.  Quality in this item is apparent.  These folks have outstanding customer service!  Would highly recommend the brush &amp; brand!</li>
            <li> Rocky Mountain has great beard/moustache brushes/combs. Along with this great boar bristle brush, that is also curved to better match the contours of our faces, I also have the sandalwood comb and it smells amazing. Fine products. Comfortable feel. Fantastic grooming. Pleasant scent. I would recommend their products to anyone looking to tame their unruly facial hair. Two thumbs up. Thanks for the great products!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely fantastic. It is 100% real boar&#x27;s hair, I tested it via the lighter method. It really helps my beard lie flat and stay in shape, and it spreads oil around well. It does have a little trouble penatrating the longest part of my beard, but my beard is also getting close to 4 inches long. Any less than that and it would be perfect. I highly recommend this for any beard grower, especially if your beard is less than 4 inches long, and I love how it helps sculpt my mustache.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush bristles are firm but not too hard to scratch your face</li>
            <li> Great Product!! No complaints</li>
            <li> Great brush for your beard and hair. It is a well made brush and the curved design of the brushes are great. Fast shipping and packaged well. I would recommend purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush that adds volume to my beard. Very gentle but with enough grab to release any tangles. I&#x27;m satisfied with my brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked to write a review of the Rocky Mountain Military Brush just purchased. It was just received this day, 6/30/2015. It appears to be a quality product. It seems to be just the correct degree of firmness required. I cannot give a rating as to longevity of the bristle retention., but as a new purchase, I believe it to be well worth the reasonable cost. I bought it for use as a hair brush, not beard. Having had the product such a short time I hope the reader will take that into account. But, at this point, I intend to buy another to use in each hand. It is shaped to fit the curvature of one&#x27;s head, which I like. The box is padded, for secure storage and transportation. I can say no more without the experience of use. A good buy. 7/1/2015: Quite a few bristles are falling out, disappointing. Will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Horrible brush.  Soon as I started using it the bristles fall out so easy and leaves a mess.  Will not buy again.</li>
