            <li>Favorite men&#x27;s cologne bar none</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this</li>
            <li>so, when he ran out, I wanted to get him some more.  </li>
            <li>This spray is economic and still smells great on his skin.  </li>
            <li>It is his favorite (and mine too) scent.  </li>
            <li>totally recommend you getting this great parfum!</li>
            <li>but that I would just feel better if it were in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Well, ok, I like it too.  </li>
            <li>It has always been my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Great classic scent</li>
            <li>Love it - best kept secret, whenever I wear it I get non-stop compliments from ladies about how good I smell...</li>
            <li>Just pleasant and masculine without being overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>CLEAN, LIGHT, LASTS ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>Fresh men&#x27;s fragrance!</li>
            <li>FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS FRAGRANCE YEARS AGO, AND HAVE NEVER TIRED OF IT!</li>
            <li>Happy that I saved more than half the department store price!</li>
            <li>This has a fresh, clean, refined scent.  </li>
            <li>He was very surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, crisp, a hint of sweetness, but still manly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only scent I&#x27;ve ever liked to wear.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it..</li>
            <li>So thank you very much Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I would always come back for more..</li>
            <li>This was my first perfum when I was a Kid.</li>
            <li>Even had a lady come out of her office and ask what I was wearing  ;)</li>
            <li>I pretty much got ripped off with this counterfeit bottle.</li>
            <li>but we are taking about a classic one!</li>
            <li>The price was very expensived when I bought it.</li>
            <li>It smells like the real thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it for my husband&#x27;s Bday</li>
            <li>and I really like it too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift and it was very well recieved.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t see it at fragrance counters very often.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily saying it was tampered with as it seems to be okay as far as smell and longevity, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle because its small enough to put in your carry-on at the airport and the lid is very secure so no spillage.</li>
            <li>It must blend well with me because I have received more complements wearing this than my other colognes</li>
            <li>Smell so nice it lasting very long I would buy it again</li>
            <li>Like one of the previous posters, I would feel better if the set came in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>I need to be careful of what I wear if it is too strong .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a fresh dynamic wake up smell, yet women like it.</li>
            <li>this came in a retail box with the product wrapped in tissue paper and a clear sticker sealing the box.</li>
            <li>Retail packaging is completely sealed in plastic wrap...</li>
            <li>The cheapest price I&#x27;ve found by far.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s an old fragrance</li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of heavy, sweet or garish colognes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not a fan of heavy, sweet or garish colognes.  </li>
            <li> The 3.4 oz seems to last a long time too.  </li>
            <li> I compared the color of the liquid to an old bottle and it looked a little lighter.</li>
            <li> After a slight mix up of sending the wrong item, I&#x27;m pleased with the product .</li>
            <li> This cologne is very expensive to buy in the drugstore and most department stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> but know that you&#x27;re getting real stuff plus at least at Macy&#x27;s you can return it here at Amazon you&#x27;re screwed $70 down the drainwith the 2 bottles I bought.</li>
            <li> You never know if it has been tampered with, watered down, etc.</li>
            <li> In the past , I have purchased this scent from other sellers and the plastic was missing and the scent was watered down.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy, like when you get nailed by the aroma as you walk by an Ambercromie in the mall.  </li>
            <li> Projects well in the beginning but dry down is a little disappointing</li>
            <li> Came boxed as shown, usually buy a bottle a year!  </li>
            <li> This scent smells nasty and nothing like the real deal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Fake nasty scent</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The price was very expensived when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this product... I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local malls... So I went on amazon.com and found it.. I am very happy with this product and the company amazon for such great service .. this item is very good and I would always come back for more.. you can&#x27;t find a better product for you money    thank you,     Jesse</li>
            <li> Used for many years. Can&#x27;t go wrong. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Smell so nice it lasting very long I would buy it again this is 2 one and will buy again</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great classic scent and I always love Calvin Klein scents.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great too.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it - best kept secret, whenever I wear it I get non-stop compliments from ladies about how good I smell...great scent!</li>
            <li> The pro is that this came with an after shave lotion which isn&#x27;t pictured or mentioned. The con is that it DID NOT come in retail packaging as described. Retail packaging is completely sealed in plastic wrap...this came in a retail box with the product wrapped in tissue paper and a clear sticker sealing the box. It smells like the real thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it for my husband&#x27;s Bday had I known that it was not a factory sealed box. You never know if it has been tampered with, watered down, etc.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite fragrance top of the line!! U cannot buy this in dept stores anymore. Its the best ever!!</li>
            <li> The cheapest price I&#x27;ve found by far. Plus it&#x27;s the bigger 3 oz variation. I&#x27;ve already paid this price for the smaller 1 ounce bottle. I was wondering if this would have the stock plastic on it but I didn&#x27;t need to worry.... In the past , I have purchased this scent from other sellers and the plastic was missing and the scent was watered down.</li>
            <li> The brand Calvin Klein has excellent products as perfume fragrances are very nice. The fragrance purchase will escape also had a cream after shaving as a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this vendor for your attention</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really good and more importantly, my wife loves it.  If you like this cologne, Amazon is the best place to buy it.  It&#x27;s way cheaper than any store.  I love the bottle because its small enough to put in your carry-on at the airport and the lid is very secure so no spillage.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend smells so good when he wears this Cologne</li>
            <li> This was my first perfum when I was a Kid. So I had to buy it again. I know it&#x27;s an old fragrance but we are taking about a classic one! Good seller</li>
            <li> Fresh men&#x27;s fragrance!</li>
            <li> i have tried many fragrances and never found anything I like more than Escape by CK.  It must blend well with me because I have received more complements wearing this than my other colognes</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for years.  I need to be careful of what I wear if it is too strong .  I have received compliments on this for quite some time.  The product came as ordered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I purchase Escape by Calvin Klein at Amazon because I cannot find it in the stores in my city.  I appreciate that Amazon has it because it is the only fragrance my husband will wear and I really like it too.  I buy two at a time just to make sure he always has some.  So thank you very much Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this perfume</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this since college and never looked back.  I am not a fan of heavy, sweet or garish colognes.  This has a fresh, clean, refined scent.  I get asked what it is about once a month.  Tried others and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> Favorite men&#x27;s cologne bar none (not that I have tried them all - I just found that I like this one and stuck with it).</li>
            <li> My man has been wearing this for years and although we moved away, our friends still say, &amp;#34;He is the best smelling man they have ever known.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This a a great cologne.  Not heavy.  Not musky.  Just pleasant and masculine without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;CK Escape for Men is probably one of the best affordable colognes on the market.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;usband loves this cologne, so do I&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband smells wonderful in Escape, and so, when he ran out, I wanted to get him some more.  This spray is economic and still smells great on his skin.  The scent hasn&#x27;t dissipated, and he has had it for a year.  Good buy, great scent.</li>
            <li> Great price on a cologne I already knew I liked. Happy that I saved more than half the department store price!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  It is his favorite (and mine too) scent.  He was very surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want to smell exceptionally great.</li>
            <li> Great, slightly sweet but light cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only scent I&#x27;ve ever liked to wear.  Not to heavy, like when you get nailed by the aroma as you walk by an Ambercromie in the mall.  It&#x27;s clean, crisp, a hint of sweetness, but still manly.  The 3.4 oz seems to last a long time too.  Even if used daily I&#x27;m getting a good year or two out of it.  (not over done).</li>
            <li> For me this is an excellent fragance for young men. I had never tried a Calvin Klein before this one and now I don&#x27;t regret a thing about buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend you getting this great parfum!</li>
            <li> Another good one in the CK line, however the longevity doesn&#x27;t quite get there Projects well in the beginning but dry down is a little disappointing</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used it for years.  Women like it and I get compliments when I wear it. I approve</li>
            <li> This scent smells nasty and nothing like the real deal. I bought 2 colognes from this seller I pretty much got ripped off with this counterfeit bottle. Are all your bottles expired? Might as well go to Macy&#x27;s and pay that extra dollar but know that you&#x27;re getting real stuff plus at least at Macy&#x27;s you can return it here at Amazon you&#x27;re screwed $70 down the drainwith the 2 bottles I bought. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! Fake nasty scent</li>
            <li> Like one of the previous posters, I would feel better if the set came in a sealed box. I compared the color of the liquid to an old bottle and it looked a little lighter. Not necessarily saying it was tampered with as it seems to be okay as far as smell and longevity, etc. but that I would just feel better if it were in a sealed box.</li>
            <li> T was everything I was expecting!</li>
            <li> This cologne is very expensive to buy in the drugstore and most department stores no longer carry it.  When I found it on Amazon I was so excited!!  And I paid a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Escape is the only Cologne I wear. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, been using it for years, and always get compliments.  Even had a lady come out of her office and ask what I was wearing  ;)</li>
            <li> FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS FRAGRANCE YEARS AGO, AND HAVE NEVER TIRED OF IT! I WEAR IT ALL SPRING AND SUMMER.&lt;br /&gt;ITS CLEAN, LIGHT, LASTS ALL DAY. A GREAT COLOGNE FOR WORK OR DRESS.</li>
            <li> Name brand at a awesome price. Well worth it..</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and it was very well recieved. A wonderful fragrance and a great gift!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who uses Escape by Calvin Klein!  Came boxed as shown, usually buy a bottle a year!  My husband has been using Escape for many years and gets many compliments!</li>
            <li> The women like it and that&#x27;s all I care about. Well, ok, I like it too.  It&#x27;s got a fresh dynamic wake up smell, yet women like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Please keep in stock!</li>
            <li> After a slight mix up of sending the wrong item, I&#x27;m pleased with the product . It has always been my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this back in the 80&#x27;s . You don&#x27;t see it at fragrance counters very often. Always get compliments on how nice this smells.</li>
