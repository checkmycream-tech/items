            <li>I have purchased Argan Oil products from a shopping network years ago &amp; even though the product line is good, I didn&#x27;t like the thickness of her \\&quot;eye</li>

            <li>the product is amazing and has improved my skin with just a week of use...acne scars and imperfections have been reduced</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li>but this seemed like a nice oil.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Moroccan argan oil is wonderful for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I have tried much more espensive oil</li>
            <li>im sure it will work in any shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 daughters, 24 and 21, and they use it and love it as well.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and terrific price.  </li>
            <li>try it to skin , its smooth , i just try it at skin , i feel hydrate , comfort</li>
            <li>I have been using this light weight oil around my eyes at night and</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got it sooner than expected and the quality of the oil is superb because it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>Really great against wrinkles and to fight dry skin in the Winter.</li>
            <li>This oil goes on light, but yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>my laugh  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Pure Moroccan Argan Oil quickly absorbs into the skin and makes my skin feel moisturized and silky.  </li>
            <li>Having tried 3 different brands, I can say this one is the best, it&#x27;s light enough to use under make up and it keeps your skin moisturized for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have deep fine lines under the eyes specially when I&#x27;m smiling, after a WEEK they are almost gone.</li>
            <li>Just recently, after watching another celebrity on a shopping channel,(pitching her $100.00 oil), I decided to search the web and was able to find this.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to anyone, that is interested in using Argan Oil, to buy Cosmedica Argan Oil first.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed very well.</li>
            <li>The first time I put that oil on my face, I knew it would become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>You will not get such a good product anywhere for a lesser price!!!</li>
            <li>This one had a slight  odor and very light golden color.  </li>
            <li>my hair is super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>According to Amazon statement (and the label), it says that it is certified organic, but I certainly don&#x27;t see any USDA Certified Organic seal anywhere on the bottle or in the packet.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>How do I know if it is really organic and certified by the USDA?  </li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Highly absorbable and makes my skin softer than it has been in years.</li>
            <li>I use the argan oil at night and in the morning my face looks radiant, youthful and ready to receive directly primer and foundation.</li>
            <li>It gives new life and to my hair.</li>
            <li>I can tell the difference in how my face feels, especially here in hot New Mexico.  </li>
            <li>Another one I tried had no odor and a third is very pungent.  </li>
            <li>It has zero scent to it and it makes your skin soft as silk without causing any breakouts.</li>
            <li>it is really amazeing and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>like that this oil absorbs quickly, and you only need a tiny drop to go a long way.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is the same quality as the more expensive brand, It keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>

            <li> Hard to tell what is the real thing</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is organic and cold pressed.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know what that other review is talking about, maybe a different brand?</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been very frustrated for my last few purchases of argan oil because it really smelled bad/</li>
            <li> At only $8.95 (I see the price has gone up now), how can you go wrong?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> try it to skin , its smooth , i just try it at skin , i feel hydrate , comfort&lt;br /&gt;and i will use it at hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this light weight oil around my eyes at night and my laugh  lines have softened and darkish circles have definately gone away.  I also us it on my lip lines whic have smoothed out. mI like that this oil absorbs quickly, and you only need a tiny drop to go a long way. It is by far the best &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lightweight argan oil that isn&#x27;t greasy or makes me breakout. I&#x27;m happy to say I found it! Having tried 3 different brands, I can say this one is the best, it&#x27;s light enough to use under make up and it keeps your skin moisturized for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific oil does not have any smell so I don&#x27;t know what that other review is talking about, maybe a different brand?</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and effective. At only $8.95 (I see the price has gone up now), how can you go wrong? I like to use this on my lips as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> do not like it at all made my face break out do not use any more,would not buy again me</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil! I keep two bottles on hand now, at all times. I have purchased Argan Oil products from a shopping network years ago &amp; even though the product line is good, I didn&#x27;t like the thickness of her \\&quot;eye oil\\&quot; in a roller form bottle. Just recently, after watching another celebrity on a shopping channel,(pitching her $100.00 oil), I decided to search the web and was able to find this. I still can&#x27;t believe the price, especially since it is basically the same oil as the ones on TV. I would suggest to anyone, that is interested in using Argan Oil, to buy Cosmedica Argan Oil first. You will not get such a good product anywhere for a lesser price!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell what is the real thing but this seemed like a nice oil.  I have tried several brands and each one has been slightly different.  This one had a slight  odor and very light golden color.  Another one I tried had no odor and a third is very pungent.  Until I go to Morocco I may never truly know.</li>
            <li> I like it; too bad that it is no longer available. I will see if I can find it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. Mix with my foundation and it blends well. Use in morning only. Have not tried at night</li>
            <li> I apply it on my face at night. It is absorbed very well. It does not feel oily at all. Packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This oil goes on light, but yet very moisturizing.  I can tell the difference in how my face feels, especially here in hot New Mexico.  I will definitely will be reordering.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all, it just moisturizes the ends and it doesn&#x27;t take much so I expect it to last me quite some time.</li>
            <li> Highly absorbable and makes my skin softer than it has been in years. The price is right. I recommend for people of any age</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order!! I got it sooner than expected and the quality of the oil is superb because it&#x27;s 100% pure. Will definitely get my next bottle from here!!!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil.  This oil is great, but I prefer Aura Cacia Argan oil, seems to be a bit richer in texture, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Pure Moroccan Argan Oil quickly absorbs into the skin and makes my skin feel moisturized and silky.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far,it is helping with my dry skin.I have tried much more espensive oil and this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Love it so far. I would recommend putting on 1,5 hours before going to bed to let some of the oil absorb</li>
            <li> I love this moroccan argan oil!  I love the fact that it is organic and cold pressed.  It is a great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> It gives new life and to my hair. I&#x27;m in my sixties, hair begins to dull, this product restores younger looking hair.</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles - only open one to try.  According to Amazon statement (and the label), it says that it is certified organic, but I certainly don&#x27;t see any USDA Certified Organic seal anywhere on the bottle or in the packet.  How do I know if it is really organic and certified by the USDA?  I thought all USDA certified organic products come with the green seal from USDA.  The oil itself has no odor, but it does not work for my dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and terrific price.  Have been buying much more expensive Moroccan Argan oil and this works as well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it on a scar and i am seeing improvement after just a couple applications.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> i have dry frizzy hair and this is the only thing that works too get rid of frizz.  i put 12 pumps of the oil into my shampoo and 12 pumps into my conditioner and shake the bottle. i use suave professionals with argon oil in the  12.6oz bottles. im sure it will work in any shampoo.  i shake the bottles before each shower and no more frizz. no more buying gel neither. my hair is super soft and silky. it is really amazeing and the bottle lasts a long time. you have too try it its wonderfull.  dont spend 30. or 40. dollars for a bottle of shampoo, they dont work anyway. argon oil does. i havent tried it on my face yet but i will.  i bet a couple pumps into my daily face moisturizer and shake it up will prevent wrinkles. im doing that next. this is the best thing i have ever tried, try it.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my regular face lotion to only argan oil...the product is amazing and has improved my skin with just a week of use...acne scars and imperfections have been reduced</li>
            <li> The first time I put that oil on my face, I knew it would become one of my favorites. I have deep fine lines under the eyes specially when I&#x27;m smiling, after a WEEK they are almost gone. I use the argan oil at night and in the morning my face looks radiant, youthful and ready to receive directly primer and foundation. I have oily/combination skin by the way.</li>
            <li> I saw this item on Dr. Oz and thought it would be a miracle product. I am finding no difference in my skin or hair. It does smell good. This item was at a very good price and may work for others. Shipment was fast. Thank you....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very frustrated for my last few purchases of argan oil because it really smelled bad/had gone off regardless of where I bought it from. Rancid oil can&#x27;t be good for your skin. This is the real deal. It has zero scent to it and it makes your skin soft as silk without causing any breakouts. Really great against wrinkles and to fight dry skin in the Winter. I&#x27;ll buy this again once I&#x27;m down to half a bottle. This stuff is very long lasting as well. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will not be paying the big bucks for argan oil again. This argan oil is the same quality as the more expensive brand, It keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  I&#x27;m 61 and am told I look 10 yrs younger. No kidding! I have 2 daughters, 24 and 21, and they use it and love it as well.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your prompt order. The Morrocan Argon Oil is wonderful for the face, body and hair. It foes an exceptinal moisturuzing job. I will order agai</li>
            <li> Moroccan argan oil is wonderful for mature skin. You can also use this product for nails and hair. Awesome product!</li>
