            <li>Her Daughter found it rather fun too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is extremelly useful.</li>
            <li>can you make a toothbrush for more adult teeth?</li>
            <li>but I have felt like I have not been able to clean them properly.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>no more fighting which makes a happy momma</li>
            <li>My sensory sensitive child has extra clean teeth now!!!</li>
            <li>This three sided toothbrush has made it easy for my 11 1/2 yr old to brush his teeth by himself.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush for kids that don&#x27;t like to sit still especially to get their teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li>My sin can use, it cleans good and faster but it could be a little softer .</li>
            <li>It has helped because by brushing top front and back all at once it lets us get done sooner</li>
            <li>Made of some type of plastic, direction says to run it under hot water for softer bristles.</li>
            <li>but now he willingly brushes his teeth with ease.  </li>
            <li>Would be outstanding if the bristles were actually like a real tooth brush instead of nylon bristles..</li>
            <li>Great brushes for my adult autistic son!</li>
            <li>She is far more comfortable with this toothbrush than an average one.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li>There are way better and cheaper toothbrushes out there that are more or less the same thing.</li>
            <li>I really didnt like it.</li>
            <li>,she really likes it and the bristles are awsome</li>
            <li>Got delivered fast, haven&#x27;t used yet.</li>
            <li>This is for my son who is autistic&lt;br /&gt;Working very well</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>Really helps when you have a fussy kid</li>
            <li>It is durable and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My son wants nothing to do with it</li>
            <li>This product works very well with my clients.</li>
            <li>With this toothbrush, I feel like we&#x27;re getting all his tooth surfaces, even if we don&#x27;t get much time in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li>She loves it and makes brushing our teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li>my entire life and this toothbrush is the only thing that will remove it effectively.</li>
            <li>I originally  bought 1 to see how it was going to work for my daughter, but my next order will be a package of them.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this for anyone who has difficulties brushing their children s teeth because it makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Now he looks forward to it and it cleans much better that conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love these but a little pricey</li>
            <li>the brush part is kind of hard .</li>
            <li>I was able to cut our brushing time way down this brush deserve 10 stars!</li>
            <li>makes brushing my 4 yr old ASD son&#x27;s teeth much easier</li>
            <li>He really enjoys this &amp;#34;easy brush&amp;#34; and it works well for him at 6years old.</li>
            <li>I used this toothbrush for the first time last night and his teeth look so much cleaner and his breath is a lot fresher.</li>
            <li>When he saw this toothbrush, he was skeptical, but after the first brushing, he actually gets happy when he sees the new toothbrush come out at teeth-brushing time.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend to any parent who has a young one who struggles with not wanting to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels very soft</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very sensitive and HATES his teeth to be touched.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and the bristles are HARD.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush allows him to brush his teeth in less time but also cleans his teeth better than a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have an almost 2 yr old and this toothbrush works like a dream and  has changed both of our lives</li>
            <li>I bought this for my ten year old autistic grand son.</li>
            <li>It is hard to use and it doesn&#x27;t go around the teeth as easy as the picture.</li>
            <li>gets the job done with ease...before we got this tooth brush we couldnt get his teeth clean but now just a few strokes straight on top of his teeth ...... would recommend it to everyone with small children , but a miracle brush for a autistic child</li>
            <li>I love how you can change the stiffness of the bristles just by running hot water over the sturdy bristles for soft or cold water for medium-hard.</li>
            <li>and it makes brushing teeth so easy and not as painful as with conventional  toothbrushes we love them</li>
            <li>I have a special needs son, brushing his teeth is not easy, he doesn&#x27;t know to keep his mouth open, and it is hard to maneuver around the teeth, but this tooth brush made everything quicker and much easier!</li>
            <li>He loves the feel of this brush and it brushes twice as much of each tooth in half the time</li>
            <li>My son who is autistic would have a difficult time brushing his teeth, he has brushed his teeth more in these past months than he has most of his 14years.</li>
            <li>This makes brushing my daughter&#x27;s teeth, but it really needs to be a little larger.</li>

            <li> With this toothbrush, I feel like we&#x27;re getting all his tooth surfaces, even if we don&#x27;t get much time in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li> She loves it and makes brushing our teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li> my entire life and this toothbrush is the only thing that will remove it effectively.</li>
            <li> I originally  bought 1 to see how it was going to work for my daughter, but my next order will be a package of them.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this for anyone who has difficulties brushing their children s teeth because it makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Now he looks forward to it and it cleans much better that conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Love these but a little pricey</li>
            <li> the brush part is kind of hard .</li>
            <li> I was able to cut our brushing time way down this brush deserve 10 stars!</li>
            <li> makes brushing my 4 yr old ASD son&#x27;s teeth much easier</li>
            <li> He really enjoys this &amp;#34;easy brush&amp;#34; and it works well for him at 6years old.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush for the first time last night and his teeth look so much cleaner and his breath is a lot fresher.</li>
            <li> When he saw this toothbrush, he was skeptical, but after the first brushing, he actually gets happy when he sees the new toothbrush come out at teeth-brushing time.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend to any parent who has a young one who struggles with not wanting to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels very soft</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very sensitive and HATES his teeth to be touched.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and the bristles are HARD.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush allows him to brush his teeth in less time but also cleans his teeth better than a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have an almost 2 yr old and this toothbrush works like a dream and  has changed both of our lives</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ten year old autistic grand son.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use and it doesn&#x27;t go around the teeth as easy as the picture.</li>
            <li> gets the job done with ease...before we got this tooth brush we couldnt get his teeth clean but now just a few strokes straight on top of his teeth ...... would recommend it to everyone with small children , but a miracle brush for a autistic child</li>
            <li> I love how you can change the stiffness of the bristles just by running hot water over the sturdy bristles for soft or cold water for medium-hard.</li>
            <li> and it makes brushing teeth so easy and not as painful as with conventional  toothbrushes we love them</li>
            <li> I have a special needs son, brushing his teeth is not easy, he doesn&#x27;t know to keep his mouth open, and it is hard to maneuver around the teeth, but this tooth brush made everything quicker and much easier!</li>
            <li> He loves the feel of this brush and it brushes twice as much of each tooth in half the time</li>
            <li> My son who is autistic would have a difficult time brushing his teeth, he has brushed his teeth more in these past months than he has most of his 14years.</li>
            <li> This makes brushing my daughter&#x27;s teeth, but it really needs to be a little larger.</li>
            <li> Wish they were not costly, but as any parent of an autistic child no cost is to high for their care.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Smaller heads and cheaper quality than some of the other similar adaptive toothbrushes out there</li>
            <li> The product looks cheap and My daughter felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have a 6 year old Autistic son that has severe sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> It helps make teeth brushing for my 4 year old autistic son a lot easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for brushing my 8 year old autistic son&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this for my eldest,more colors besides yellow please, and I wish the brushes head was a tad but smaller to make brush a little smoother.</li>
            <li> He brushes longer with these than other double headed brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> The brush is hard to fit over his teeth and still a little to firm for us.  </li>
            <li> a little too small for big adult teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the added coverage that this brush offers because it&#x27;s so hard to cover all sides of a tooth.  </li>
            <li> My autistic son hates having his teeth brushed.</li>
            <li> Once there, it scrapped against her teeth and gums and was way worse than a normal tooth brush!  </li>
            <li> Kids with autism and sensory processing disorder generally have a very hard time tolerating having their teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this tooth brush are plastic and can be sharp on the gums.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I thought</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get my other 2 daughters to stop using it as well.</li>
            <li> My autistic nephew had some issues brushing his teeth....or at least brushing them long enough.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t as flexible as it looks, a matter of fact I had to press hard on it to get it open and in my daughters mouth.  </li>
            <li> This seemed promising, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t prove to be.</li>
            <li> Just love this toothbrush for my 2 boys who hate brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> His teeth look cleaner, and he complains much less.  </li>
            <li> Brushing her teeth takes half the time.</li>
            <li> She his mildly Autistic and attempts to bite down on her toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> it took a little while for my son to get used to</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s my daughter brush her autistic child&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> My Autistic daughter, HATES brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for any disabled person who already uses a tooth brush but refuses to floss.</li>
            <li> My son is Autistic and hates to brush his teeth, but this toothbrush has worked wonders and I don&#x27;t have to tell him to brush his teeth</li>
            <li> My sister, who is autistic, doesn&#x27;t suffer anymore when brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> His autism gets in the way of a lot of things but melting down over brushing his teeth is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I needed something to make the horrible brushing faster, more efficient and easier for my autistic son.</li>
            <li> Works well for my 3 year old ASD son who used to hate getting his teeth brushed.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed since this was for my boy with autism.</li>
            <li> still working on trying it for my son :-/</li>
            <li> When this arrived, I was very skeptical because of the soft quality both in the bristles and the handle itself, but I agreed to try it for one week and give my opinion as to weather</li>
            <li> Bristles are stronger so do not need to brush hard- especially on little ones.</li>
            <li> Thin, flimsy, hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> I got this tooth brush because it&#x27;s very hard for me to floss his teeth, and sometimes I am scared of hurting his gums with the dental floss.</li>
            <li> still difficult to brush my daughters</li>
            <li> teeth :-(</li>
            <li> He hated to brush his teeth but now enjoys it and</li>

            <li> Great for a feisty five year old.  Hits three surfaces at once. Helps our mornings go more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great tb for special needs kiddos... gets all sides in a quick time. Bristles are stronger so do not need to brush hard- especially on little ones.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my second toothbrush my son loves it and it makes brushing teeth so easy and not as painful as with conventional  toothbrushes we love them</li>
            <li> Works well for my 3 year old ASD son who used to hate getting his teeth brushed. I will continue to be a customer, thank you.</li>
            <li> It used to be a screaming match trying to get my son to let us brush his teeth. Now its a joy he loves that its quicker and his teeth are so much whiter than before because he actually looks forward to brushing. His autism gets in the way of a lot of things but melting down over brushing his teeth is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected it to be. But will work.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve had plaque problems my entire life and this toothbrush is the only thing that will remove it effectively. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best thing that has ever happend to our household! My Autistic daughter, HATES brushing her teeth. It is a sensory struggle every day. This brush makes the process much faster and more effective. HIGHLY recommend to any parent who has a young one who struggles with not wanting to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> This brush is the only brush. My sin can use, it cleans good and faster but it could be a little softer . Regardless it&#x27;s the only one that works for him</li>
            <li> My son is severely handicapped and brushing his teeth is a challenge. This seemed promising, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t prove to be. Very cheaply made and the bristles are HARD.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like it. The product looks cheap and My daughter felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This three sided toothbrush has made it easy for my 11 1/2 yr old to brush his teeth by himself. It has a wonderful handle that could be held on tight for a person who dosen&#x27;t had movement in hands. I strongly recommend this product not just for child with special needs butt for myself also. The toothbrush took off all plaque on my teeth, love love this product</li>
            <li> I have an almost 2 yr old and this toothbrush works like a dream and  has changed both of our lives,she really likes it and the bristles are awsome she can&#x27;t bite or chew them lIke she does with her regular brush. I don&#x27;t have to chase her around trying to brush her teeth for 10-20 min because she thinks it&#x27;s fun time  that&#x27;s what kids especially younger ones do.I was able to cut our brushing time way down this brush deserve 10 stars! I love how you can change the stiffness of the bristles just by running hot water over the sturdy bristles for soft or cold water for medium-hard. I wish I had this for my eldest,more colors besides yellow please, and I wish the brushes head was a tad but smaller to make brush a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit kids who give you a hard time about brushing</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t as flexible as it looks, a matter of fact I had to press hard on it to get it open and in my daughters mouth.  Once there, it scrapped against her teeth and gums and was way worse than a normal tooth brush!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Got delivered fast, haven&#x27;t used yet. Looks and feels very soft</li>
            <li> This is for my son who is autistic&lt;br /&gt;Working very well</li>
            <li> thank you i got it on time for my son with has autism and needs these to help him learn how to brush his teeth thank you i will be buying more stuff from you very soon thanks again</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, not what I expected at all. I was pretty disappointed since this was for my boy with autism.</li>
            <li> I really like these. Really helps when you have a fussy kid but I still continue to use the regular tooth brush as well. Truly anyone can use these.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes are amazing! If you have gum disease, then you need one of these! I have never had a better dental exam than I did after using one of these brushes for 2 weeks. The hygienist actually said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you have been doing, but I can see where you had tartar build-up below the gum line &amp; now it&#x27;s gone!&amp;#34; Amazing!! Get one!!</li>
            <li> I have a 6 year old Autistic son that has severe sensitivity issues.  Brushing his teeth has not been a big struggle but I have felt like I have not been able to clean them properly.  I wanted to try to floss but have been unsuccessful.  I used this toothbrush for the first time last night and his teeth look so much cleaner and his breath is a lot fresher.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this works. I used it to brush my sons teeth, and although I still have to help him, I noticed this got his teeth more clean then when we use a regular tooth brush. I got this tooth brush because it&#x27;s very hard for me to floss his teeth, and sometimes I am scared of hurting his gums with the dental floss. This tooth brush has definitely made teeth brushing easier. I would recommend it for any disabled person who already uses a tooth brush but refuses to floss.</li>
            <li> My SN son has a lot of soensory issues and tooth brushing has been a challange.  We hoped this would solve our problems.  It has helped because by brushing top front and back all at once it lets us get done sooner but it was not the magic solution we had hoped.  The brush is hard to fit over his teeth and still a little to firm for us.  I wish they had more options for size of the brush portion and bristle firmness.  It is durable and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> makes brushing my 4 yr old ASD son&#x27;s teeth much easier</li>
            <li> My son just chewed this thing right up! Plus I would inspect his teeth after using enclosed guidelines for brushing and still find all kinds of gunk in there. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my autistic grandson.  It used to be a problem getting him to brush his teeth.  Now he looks forward to it and it cleans much better that conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This makes brushing my daughter&#x27;s teeth, but it really needs to be a little larger. Great concept. I will look for a larger one.</li>
            <li> My autistic nephew had some issues brushing his teeth....or at least brushing them long enough. Not now.  He loves the feel of this brush and it brushes twice as much of each tooth in half the time</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all. Made of some type of plastic, direction says to run it under hot water for softer bristles. My son wants nothing to do with it so I tried it and I see why. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it works brilliantly for both my kids. Makes teeth brushing a non issue as its much more effective than normal toothbrush... It would prob be Improved with brush on back too not tongue scraper but regardless it&#x27;s great value for money and gets job done quicker too.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with my clients. they love using it because it makes brushing quick and easy and does a great job in the process. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles on this tooth brush are plastic and can be sharp on the gums. Caused my sons gums to bleed. There are others out there with nice soft bristles that do not hurt.</li>
            <li> Great item for my spd kiddo. He hated to brush his teeth but now enjoys it and no more fighting which makes a happy momma</li>
            <li> My son loves this brush, he looks forward to it and it gives him the liberty to use it on his own. It is efficient too, and cuts down the time of brushing while still giving a great cleaning</li>
            <li> My son is Autistic and hates to brush his teeth, but this toothbrush has worked wonders and I don&#x27;t have to tell him to brush his teeth he does it all on his own now!</li>
            <li> Kids with autism and sensory processing disorder generally have a very hard time tolerating having their teeth brushed.  My son is eleven, and brushing his teeth has been a constant life-long battle.  With this toothbrush, I feel like we&#x27;re getting all his tooth surfaces, even if we don&#x27;t get much time in his mouth.  His teeth look cleaner, and he complains much less.  It was a great investment!</li>
            <li> theconcept and design is great. Would be outstanding if the bristles were actually like a real tooth brush instead of nylon bristles..</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for kids that don&#x27;t like to sit still especially to get their teeth brushed.  It makes brushing teeth a quick and easy job.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Does a great job cleaning. I would recommend this for special needs people, if your dentist recommends this and toddlers.</li>
            <li> It working great on my sons teeth</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! WHYYYY DO THEY NOT PROMOTE THIS PRODUCT, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works so well for my daughter. She his mildly Autistic and attempts to bite down on her toothbrushes. This 3 sided toothbrush makes brushing her teeth so much easier and faster!!! I originally  bought 1 to see how it was going to work for my daughter, but my next order will be a package of them. I highly suggest this for anyone who has difficulties brushing their children s teeth because it makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It&#x27;s just that simple. My son is on the spectrum. He&#x27;s very sensitive and HATES his teeth to be touched. Now, because of this brush, I brush his teeth twice a day. I&#x27;ll be ordering one every month.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for everyone.  It&#x27;s especially useful for anyone with a disability.</li>
            <li> It is very good and very comfortable and easy</li>
            <li> It is hard to use and it doesn&#x27;t go around the teeth as easy as the picture. My son doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> still working on trying it for my son :-/</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush for my special needs daughter, thinking of getting one for my toddler also.</li>
            <li> It helps make teeth brushing for my 4 year old autistic son a lot easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> I needed something to make the horrible brushing faster, more efficient and easier for my autistic son. So glad I found this item, will be purchasing again I&#x27;m sure! Thankjas for making a product that helps us parents out!</li>
            <li> Works great, my son is autistic so brushing the whole tooth is great because he won&#x27;t sit still long, great product</li>
            <li> My autistic son hates having his teeth brushed. When he saw this toothbrush, he was skeptical, but after the first brushing, he actually gets happy when he sees the new toothbrush come out at teeth-brushing time. Works great, too!</li>
            <li> Just love this toothbrush for my 2 boys who hate brushing their teeth.  I like the added coverage that this brush offers because it&#x27;s so hard to cover all sides of a tooth.  Just wish this was available in stores so I didn&#x27;t have to order it.  Perfect for small teeth...a little too small for big adult teeth.</li>
            <li> One very happy mother who found it so much easier to brush her daughter teeth who has Austism. Her Daughter found it rather fun too.&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend to all as it make life easier for all and best of all to help there children / adults who has a disability to have great teeth like all of us. :) Well done DenTrust</li>
            <li> Brushing his teeth has always been a challenge for my son who is on the spectrum and has sensory issues.  This toothbrush allows him to brush his teeth in less time but also cleans his teeth better than a traditional toothbrush.  I wish I found this toothbrush years ago.</li>
            <li> LOVE!! My sensory sensitive child has extra clean teeth now!!! Wish I found it sooner!</li>
            <li> Love these but a little pricey</li>
            <li> My son it taking to the toothbrush, and can&#x27;t just suck on the toothpaste, like he is used to doing.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever, my two year old actually wants to brush her teeth now!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.... not exactly what I thought</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter &amp; it works wonders. Brushing her teeth takes half the time. She is far more comfortable with this toothbrush than an average one.</li>
            <li> would like it to be bigger for adults. But would be good for  children.  the brush part is kind of hard .</li>
            <li> Delighted with this product. Great Ide especially for children with sensory issues and ASD</li>
            <li> This product is extremelly useful. My sister, who is autistic, doesn&#x27;t suffer anymore when brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> My son has SPD and brushing his teeth had always been a fight.  He isn&#x27;t exactly thrilled with this toothbrush, but we haven&#x27;t had tears and screaming since we started using it, so it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It cleans very well. You may want o try it on your teeth first o see how it is supposed to fit over the teeth. I use it with my special needs daughter but I can&#x27;t get my other 2 daughters to stop using it as well. I will have to get more for all the kids</li>
            <li> Perfect for my autistic brother!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long. There are way better and cheaper toothbrushes out there that are more or less the same thing.</li>
            <li> still difficult to brush my daughters teeth :-(</li>
            <li> Smaller heads and cheaper quality than some of the other similar adaptive toothbrushes out there</li>
            <li> it took a little while for my son to get used to but now he willingly brushes his teeth with ease.  great invention for special needs and typical kids.</li>
            <li> Really good  helps he do the job right he cleans his teeth the right way now thank you he happy</li>
            <li> I have a special needs son, brushing his teeth is not easy, he doesn&#x27;t know to keep his mouth open, and it is hard to maneuver around the teeth, but this tooth brush made everything quicker and much easier!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for my adult autistic son! He brushes longer with these than other double headed brushes I have tried. Soft bristles are great. No gum erosion! Love them!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my ten year old autistic grand son.When this arrived, I was very skeptical because of the soft quality both in the bristles and the handle itself, but I agreed to try it for one week and give my opinion as to weather I will keep it or return it. As soon as I tried it on him, he loved it and took over the brushing of his own teeth. We&#x27;ve had it one day, I guess we&#x27;re keeping it. Will probably order more.</li>
            <li> Hurray! A toothbrush for my son with autism that works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can brush his teeth faster (he hates anything in his mouth except food).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion: can you make a toothbrush for more adult teeth?</li>
            <li> I am always trying to battle with my son to get his teeth cleaned accordingly. He really enjoys this &amp;#34;easy brush&amp;#34; and it works well for him at 6years old. it is a great one-size fits most brush. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this. She is developmental delay and her speech therapist recommended it. She loves it and makes brushing our teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li> Thin, flimsy, hard on the gums. Save your money</li>
            <li> My son who is autistic would have a difficult time brushing his teeth, he has brushed his teeth more in these past months than he has most of his 14years. Wish they were not costly, but as any parent of an autistic child no cost is to high for their care.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for brushing my 8 year old autistic son&#x27;s teeth. It is perfect for that purpose and cleans his teeth well. I am so pleased!</li>
