    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>with that being said after i was finished it looks GREAT!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>All in all a good product!</li>
            <li>The item is a great</li>
            <li>great buy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li>Great shipping...</li>
            <li>If you hold the barrel a longer period of time on thinner hair pieces you will have great results.</li>
            <li>My stylist used this on my hair at the salon, and it was amazing!  </li>
            <li>She loved it, and it works great -</li>
            <li>This has been a great tool and there are good tutorials on it on youtube if you&#x27;re unsure of all of the styles you can do with this.</li>
            <li>Very good price for this :)</li>
            <li>Being hot tools I thought this was going to be awesome!</li>
            <li>I saw girls on youtube who reviewed it and did an amazing beachy wavy locks with it</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they sold a glove for protection from burns.</li>
            <li>If you use a heat protector spray, I&#x27;ve noticed that the residue kind of stays on the barrel</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I did make sure that it ships from the amazon warehouse.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m thinking maybe it would work better on thinner hair :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I am using my clipless curler more.</li>
            <li>I looked around everywhere for a waver, so glad I went with this one.</li>
            <li>Is more like a crimp iron not curl</li>
            <li>all together the item is good and worth the money for fine hair.</li>
            <li>But for a special occasion, the look is unmatchable!</li>
            <li>the item is a nice and hot item.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as another one that I used to own.</li>
            <li>curls my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>It is worth more than the price paid.  </li>
            <li>great purchase especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I love this waver but i have owned several others and it doesn&#x27;t wave as good as others i have owned</li>
            <li>but it takes a long time to get the great affect.</li>
            <li>Probably a triple barrel waver with bigger barrels would be more effective.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t heat up very well and it just doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and maintains a hot temperature throughout.  </li>
            <li>I need more practice I think , but over all I love HOT TOLLS product due to the fast heating up and keeping the heat level as it is until the end .</li>
            <li>This product is priced well, is super easy to use (just place a section of hair between the V, the upper and lower sections), and has 4 heat settings.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture- arrive on time.</li>
            <li>I have always been a Hot Tools fan</li>
            <li>This &#x27;hot&#x27; tools barrel waver isn&#x27;t so &#x27;hot&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This tool does not heat up or stay hot.</li>
            <li>It heat up fast , I gave it 4 stars because I did not master the whole wavy look using it YET !</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast</li>
            <li>I really like this item.</li>
            <li>One thing to keep in mind is that i have shoulder length hair and it took a while to do my whole hair.</li>
            <li>It also dries your hair out b/c of the intense heat on every inch of your hair.  </li>
            <li>She said it cost $80, and I should really pick one up.  </li>
            <li>I got home, checked it out on Amazon, and was amazed how much cheaper it was.  </li>
            <li>I use it sometimes, for a party or a more fun, or out-there look, but it DOES NOT give the pretty beach-y texture I was hoping to achieve, the crimps are just too small.</li>
            <li>On thick hair it looks good</li>
            <li>As long as I use hair spray it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I do love this deep waver, I use it often and when I want to have something different without tons of time as I can do large portions of hair and quickly, if I don&#x27;t want it as poofy I will put a little hair oil in my hands and smooth it out</li>
            <li>Overall, good product but would try a different one next time.</li>
            <li>Instead of being big waves, it is more like you took your hair our of french braids.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a high quality styling tool but the barrel size is pretty ineffective for the \\&quot;waver look\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It looks very natural if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Check out the you tube tutorials including one by hot tools using this specific product if you want to see the differences barrel size makes.</li>
            <li>have wavy, fine hair and the tool on half of the heat</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything, even on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>The, Hot Tools Htbl1175 Blue Ice Titanium 3 Barrel Waver, was a gift for my daughter for Christmas and so far she loves it.</li>
            <li>I have thin and fine hair and it manages to make very nice waves that are not too big or too small.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a professional styling product, and you can tell.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your hair look natural and it works well.</li>
            <li>word on all curling crimpers:  they take a long time to curl your whole head b/c</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, and gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>Waving in general is more difficult than I thought it would be, and this particular Hot Tools waver creates a messier look due to the barrel size in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally thick and full -- with me using this tool my hair does NOT look like &amp;#34;80&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair.</li>

            <li> I have thin medium length hair and it took seemingly forever.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this item. It looks exactly like the picture- arrive on time. I did make sure that it ships from the amazon warehouse. Thats my personal preference. One thing to keep in mind is that i have shoulder length hair and it took a while to do my whole hair. Because you are working in sections and then carefully going down each section... with that being said after i was finished it looks GREAT!! i like the effect. My hair is naturally thick and full -- with me using this tool my hair does NOT look like &amp;#34;80&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair. It looks very natural if that makes sense. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the second wave iron I have owned.  I have thin and fine hair and it manages to make very nice waves that are not too big or too small.  My only complaint is that it seems not to heat up as high as others.  Also, there is not an automatic turnoff, so if you forget to turn it off, it will be on till the next time you use it or you remember. Overall, good product but would try a different one next time.</li>
            <li> Works well but takes time to get used to. It would have been nice if they sold a glove for protection from burns.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, she has shoulder length hair. The curls just pop. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> the item is a nice and hot item. but i tried looking everywhere for the size of the barrels and could not find it, so i gambled with it. The item is a great but i was hoping for it to be a 1 inch barrel. if you are buying this and you hair is thick and long i would go with maybe something different.On thick hair it looks good but it takes a long time to get the great affect. but if your hair is thin and med long it works well. i used the waver on my hair (thin and med long and  with products) and it lasted me about 4 days. all together the item is good and worth the money for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My teenage granddaughter saw this on-line and wanted it for Christmas. She loved it, and it works great - she uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I do love this deep waver, I use it often and when I want to have something different without tons of time as I can do large portions of hair and quickly, if I don&#x27;t want it as poofy I will put a little hair oil in my hands and smooth it out but it shines my hair and holds the look all day!!! great buy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t heat up very well and it just doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I thought it would. Maybe Im not using it correct thats why i gave it 3 starts.</li>
            <li> This item has been on my wish list for months and I kept putting off a purchase.  Finally I took the plunge and have zero regrets.  It is worth more than the price paid.  It heats quickly and maintains a hot temperature throughout.  I have always been a Hot Tools fan but this item went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product is priced well, is super easy to use (just place a section of hair between the V, the upper and lower sections), and has 4 heat settings.  The barrels are a little smaller (it didn&#x27;t say how big) so the s curls are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word on all curling crimpers:  they take a long time to curl your whole head b/c you have to keep moving it down each section of hair before it&#x27;s done.  I have thin medium length hair and it took seemingly forever.  It also dries your hair out b/c of the intense heat on every inch of your hair.  But for a special occasion, the look is unmatchable!</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings are what I have about this item. Its a quality piece made of durable material and works well. Waving in general is more difficult than I thought it would be, and this particular Hot Tools waver creates a messier look due to the barrel size in my opinion. I would consider whether you basically want to look like you combed out curly hair or if you want bigger waves which you would need to get bigger barreled waver to effect. Check out the you tube tutorials including one by hot tools using this specific product if you want to see the differences barrel size makes. Overall it is a high quality styling tool but the barrel size is pretty ineffective for the \\&quot;waver look\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this waver but i have owned several others and it doesn&#x27;t wave as good as others i have owned but i do have thick hair , i&#x27;m thinking maybe it would work better on thinner hair :) All in all a good product!</li>
            <li> The, Hot Tools Htbl1175 Blue Ice Titanium 3 Barrel Waver, was a gift for my daughter for Christmas and so far she loves it.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;hot&#x27; tools barrel waver isn&#x27;t so &#x27;hot&#x27;.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to wave hair &amp; I have very thin, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT AND THE PRICE IS UNREAL.</li>
            <li> It heat up fast , I gave it 4 stars because I did not master the whole wavy look using it YET !&lt;br /&gt;But I saw girls on youtube who reviewed it and did an amazing beachy wavy locks with it&lt;br /&gt;So I need more practice I think , but over all I love HOT TOLLS product due to the fast heating up and keeping the heat level as it is until the end .</li>
            <li> I love it but I am using my clipless curler more. This tool takes some time because I have long thick hair. It gets hot fast but you need to time to use it.</li>
            <li> Have to send back since we received broke. Hope to get a working one the second time around.  As soon as we get to use it, we&#x27;ll review.</li>
            <li> Great shipping...fast, sadly this iron did absolutely nothing for my hair.  Zero effect. No matter the temperature.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because usually everything I buy on Amazon isn&#x27;t this worthless.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair at the salon, and it was amazing!  She said it cost $80, and I should really pick one up.  I got home, checked it out on Amazon, and was amazed how much cheaper it was.  It&#x27;s a professional styling product, and you can tell.  It&#x27;s heavy, and gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> This has been a great tool and there are good tutorials on it on youtube if you&#x27;re unsure of all of the styles you can do with this. I&#x27;ve had this for over 2 years and it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy, fine hair and the tool on half of the heat curls my hair just fine. If you use a heat protector spray, I&#x27;ve noticed that the residue kind of stays on the barrel so a wash with soapy water from time to time might do it some good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as another one that I used to own. As long as I use hair spray it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I looked around everywhere for a waver, so glad I went with this one. It heats up quickly and does a great job. Very good price for this :)</li>
            <li> This tool does not heat up or stay hot. It only does small, thin pieces of hair. NOT for thick hair at all.</li>
            <li> Is more like a crimp iron not curl</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair look natural and it works well. If you hold the barrel a longer period of time on thinner hair pieces you will have great results.</li>
            <li> The crimps that this iron give you are a little too small to be very wearable. Instead of being big waves, it is more like you took your hair our of french braids. I use it sometimes, for a party or a more fun, or out-there look, but it DOES NOT give the pretty beach-y texture I was hoping to achieve, the crimps are just too small. Probably a triple barrel waver with bigger barrels would be more effective.</li>
            <li> Being hot tools I thought this was going to be awesome! It&#x27;s everything but! Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything, even on my daughters hair. Waste of money!</li>
