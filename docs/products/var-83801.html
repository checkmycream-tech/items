    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>As an aside, I splurged on NARS concealer and OMG, it is LOVELY!!!!</li>
            <li>Best $3 tone correcting powder</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect just what I was lookin for ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for something to hide the redness that comes with blemishes, which this powder does beautifully.</li>
            <li>this worked great</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Yellow is great covering under eye circles</li>
            <li>It covered my face and looked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about e.l.f. products</li>
            <li>Great product and shipping speed.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>The product is more incredible than the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t cake on - powder is good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good at controlling oil.</li>
            <li>&amp; I look amazing.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Imay give it another shot and if my results are better (maybe it was user error?)</li>
            <li>When it comes to color correction, this is ok.</li>
            <li>But my mother can use it, and her skin tends favorite the powders over the creams.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product I guess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll repurchase this !!:)</li>
            <li>I love the powder.</li>
            <li>Love this item..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but if I put primer on my face before hand it works a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear used to have a blue-tinted oil-absorbing powder that was one of the best products I ever purchased for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>;. I really like this stuff and can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great idea in sleek packaging, but the powder is not well pigmented and looks...chalky(?)</li>
            <li>and red are a great highlighter and blush respectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting this product to be a lot smaller than it is, so im happy about that.</li>
            <li>I have a yellow tint to my skin that isn&#x27;t attractive at all</li>
            <li>I swirl it with my fluffy brush and put it lightly all over my face and neck to gwt a wonderful matte airbrush look.  </li>
            <li>It covers up redness and blemishes and is great on top of concealer, foundation, or sans any other makeup.</li>
            <li>I think if you have dry to normal skin this product will work the best.</li>
            <li>Okay first of all I bought this at target for only $3.I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying it</li>
            <li>It is more loose than I thought, at first it seemed to have made my face more oily</li>
            <li>the powder barely works the cream one is better plus got them at target for  $3</li>
            <li>Will be buy much more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of this product but overall love elf products.</li>
            <li>The powder quality is good, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but I eventually got the hang of it, and started to REALLY like it.</li>
            <li>Nice product, it DOESN&#x27;T work for me, I have dark circles, menopausal acne, and oily skin.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that its 3$ at Wal-Mart and not so cheap on here.</li>
            <li>fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>but this did absolutely nothing for me - too much shimmer.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t change my skin tone that much</li>
            <li>I was excited for the potential for blending, concealing and augmenting, but this really didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>However, the blue seems to work better for my complexion overall - it brightens my skin.  </li>
            <li>And another day, one of my older sisters had a zit, so I put on foundation for her.</li>
            <li>Just like normal powder.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I tried it and it works pretty good .It dulls down my red acne and scars.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I am in a pinch I just lightly brush a layer on my face and don&#x27;t use any other makeup.</li>
            <li>But it goes like new candy at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>The color is more sheer than I expected</li>
            <li>I tried it out on myself first and even with the proper foundation and primer underneath, it still didn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>My daughter [mid 40s] saw me using it, and was so interested in this that she bought a compact for herself, and now she&#x27;s also hooked on this powder.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes it completely gone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference with the blotchiness of my face</li>
            <li>The product did help with dark circle correction.. works better as a primer and setting powder for wet cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I like to carry this product in my purse especially if I am going out to remove shine; you can easily apply over other makeup/foundation/bronzer and it does not leave a white layer on your face.</li>
            <li>some may spill out if not careful</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely cancelled out the red</li>
            <li>It really does help correct those little imperfections on your face.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> helps even out my uneven skin tone. my face has splotches of red due to sensitivity and dryness.  this worked great</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim after seeing a lot about e.l.f. products on YouTube. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect. The product is more incredible than the price! I have acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m always looking for something to hide the redness that comes with blemishes, which this powder does beautifully. Also, this product sets liquid foundation. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Were crushed when received.</li>
            <li> The product did help with dark circle correction.. works better as a primer and setting powder for wet cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product. It&#x27;s such a great idea in sleek packaging, but the powder is not well pigmented and looks...chalky(?) in use? I was excited for the potential for blending, concealing and augmenting, but this really didn&#x27;t do it for me. Imay give it another shot and if my results are better (maybe it was user error?), I will update this review.  As an aside, I splurged on NARS concealer and OMG, it is LOVELY!!!!</li>
            <li> When it comes to color correction, this is ok. The powder quality is good, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. For parts that are really red/blue/sallow, you may want to swirl your brush in the specific color, (Yellow: for correcting sallow/blue/purple tones; Blue: For adding highlights; Green: Correcting redness; Pink: For blush/overall color) rather than swirling it around in all four colors for overall color correcting. Note that if using the green for redness, you may have to use a lot in order to correct moderate redness. This palette mattifies the face well and doesn&#x27;t look caked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Affordable&lt;br /&gt;*Good at overall color correcting&lt;br /&gt;*Great at mattifying skin- oil is kept away for 6-8 hours&lt;br /&gt;*Yellow is great covering under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;*Blue and red are a great highlighter and blush respectively.&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t cake on - powder is good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;*Green needs a lot to cover up moderate redness&lt;br /&gt;*Blush is sheer&lt;br /&gt;*Powder is rather dusty- some may spill out if not careful</li>
            <li> the powder barely works the cream one is better plus got them at target for  $3</li>
            <li> Nice product, it DOESN&#x27;T work for me, I have dark circles, menopausal acne, and oily skin. But my mother can use it, and her skin tends favorite the powders over the creams.</li>
            <li> Caused me to breakout!!!! It covered my face and looked great. But after a couple weeks of use I started to have breakouts. I stopped using it and my face is clearing. It&#x27;s an okay product I guess. I just won&#x27;t order it again because my skin did not tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have no allergies that would warrant irritation.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> Okay first of all I bought this at target for only $3.I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying it but I thought you know what why not it was only 3 bucks.I gotta say I tried it and it works pretty good .It dulls down my red acne and scars.It doesn&#x27;t completely cancelled out the red but it&#x27;s pretty good.As for the yellow for dark circles mine aren&#x27;t really bad .But this stuff makes it completely gone.It doesn&#x27;t feel chalky at all like some say.I was worried it would.I&#x27;ll repurchase this !!:)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was doing a wedding party. I tried it out on myself first and even with the proper foundation and primer underneath, it still didn&#x27;t show up. I&#x27;ve heard great things about e.l.f. products but I definitely wouldnt buy this again</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Will be buy much more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the powder. I don&#x27;t use the individual colors I swirl it with my fluffy brush and put it lightly all over my face and neck to gwt a wonderful matte airbrush look.  Only downside is that its 3$ at Wal-Mart and not so cheap on here. But it goes like new candy at Wal-Mart.  I can never get to it!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping speed. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this item.. n fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> I use the E.L.F. studio tone correcting powder everyday in part of my makeup routine. It covers up redness and blemishes and is great on top of concealer, foundation, or sans any other makeup.

I like to carry this product in my purse especially if I am going out to remove shine; you can easily apply over other makeup/foundation/bronzer and it does not leave a white layer on your face. Best $3 tone correcting powder</li>
            <li> Great product! Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to be a lot smaller than it is, so im happy about that. This evens out my skin tone a lot but it doesnt prevent my skin from getting oily throughout the day well enough. I think if you have dry to normal skin this product will work the best.</li>
            <li> I like e.l.f. products but this did absolutely nothing for me - too much shimmer.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear used to have a blue-tinted oil-absorbing powder that was one of the best products I ever purchased for my oily skin.  So, of course, they stopped making it.  I asked at a cosmetics store about a blue-tinted powder, and the salesgirl insisted that I wanted green to cover redness.  However, the blue seems to work better for my complexion overall - it brightens my skin.  The green works well on the redder scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this won&#x27;t do is cover up those red scars, as some reviewers expected it to do.  This is intended to even out the tone - you&#x27;ll need a cover cream for the red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get the blue alone without the rest of the colours, but the surface is large enough to just pick up the blue on a makeup brush.  And the cost is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> Just bought it yesterday at Walmart for $3 and I lovee it ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜˜. Absolutely perfect just what I was lookin for ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> It really does help correct those little imperfections on your face. My daughter [mid 40s] saw me using it, and was so interested in this that she bought a compact for herself, and now she&#x27;s also hooked on this powder. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year at target for just $3. At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but I eventually got the hang of it, and started to REALLY like it. One day, I went up to my room to actually find my sister putting it on. This happened SEVERAL times to the point where I actually had to HIDE it! And another day, one of my older sisters had a zit, so I put on foundation for her. She still complained it was too noticeable. So I put some of this powder on her face, and she said, &amp;#34;How did you do that?!&amp;#34;. I really like this stuff and can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have a yellow tint to my skin that isn&#x27;t attractive at all &amp; this just makes everything even. doesn&#x27;t change my skin tone that much &amp; I look amazing. I&#x27;m almost out already.</li>
            <li> It is more loose than I thought, at first it seemed to have made my face more oily but if I put primer on my face before hand it works a lot better.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference with the blotchiness of my face</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it has the function of correcting tone. Just like normal powder.</li>
            <li> The color is more sheer than I expected but it&#x27;s good at controlling oil.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this...makes my skin look blue.  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. It came 3 days earlier then expected but when I opened it there was powder is on the out side and all over the package then I opened up the cover and 2/4 of the colors were cracked and they were mixed I would not recommend this product would rate zero stars if could and look at the picture</li>
            <li> Too powdery and I don&#x27;t feel like it color corrects anything. Not my favorite. Looked cakey over makeup. Not a fan of this product but overall love elf products.</li>
