    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Incredible wear!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a polish find this great since I discovered Seche Vite</li>
            <li>Infinite shine - great line.</li>
            <li>Also--my nail lady DID have me sit under a UV lamp to cure this, and I will bet you this is what made the difference for me and gave me the beautiful, squishy, shiny but hard-to-wreck finish I am loving.</li>
            <li>This is a great top coat.  </li>
            <li>UV cure this, and I bet you will love it!</li>
            <li>I bring my own to the salon when I want a manicure, and I can do it at home if I want a polish change</li>
            <li>I think the nail prep is AS IMPORTANT for a good finish on your nails as the polish is.</li>
            <li>Great line great product,the shine really last.</li>
            <li>Edited to add 7 day photos: as you can see the wear has been pretty great.</li>
            <li>For the best results I do the following:  1.)</li>
            <li>Prepping your nails with 91% alcohol or greater is sufficient to remove oil residue on your nails and  enhance wear.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wrap around tips  </li>
            <li>Be sure to cap the tips as this polish and the OPI top coat can cause shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>Apply OPI top coat about 5-10 minutes after applying the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The shine is much better than Sally Hansen</li>
            <li>Love OPI Infinite Shine</li>
            <li>The top coat makes my polish bubble up</li>
            <li>I think  this product is a miss and is outperformed by CND Vinylux top coat.</li>
            <li>I love my set and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>OPI is a good brand and the price was right.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve come across in a LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>Again be sure to cap the free edge of your nails.</li>
            <li>My polish was easily applied, but I still had a significant amount of chipping on my nails.  </li>
            <li>and it comes off just great with regular remover.</li>
            <li>Great shine but chips the next day.</li>
            <li>I reapplied 5 different times to make sure I gave it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>I  adore OPI and was truly excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Start with clean nails.</li>
            <li>Also make sure my nails get some sun while I&#x27;m driving since light, especially  natural uv,  will enhance the topcoat.</li>
            <li>Gel nails look nice, but still require a trip to the nail salon to soak off and fill and I wanted to be able to touch up my nails or change the color if I wanted without having to schlep back into the salon to do that.</li>
            <li>I chose the color &#x27;Staying Neutral&#x27; and I love the whole set.</li>
            <li>DOES THE JOB KEEPS IT SUPER SHINNY</li>
            <li>it dries quickly and compliments the infinite shine polish.  </li>
            <li>I usually love OPI and was very excited to try it, as was my regular manicurist.  </li>
            <li>Really useful not to use a lamp</li>
            <li>Perhaps the reason I had a great experience with this product was because I had it applied by a professional in a salon, so my nails were buffed and prepped properly before putting the product on.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t worth it..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that your nails be free and clear of any oils or debris so dip a q-tip in acetone and prep your nail.</li>
            <li>My understanding is that the more it is exposed to UV light, the harder the finish</li>
            <li>I do my normal manicure prep (file, clean up cuticles, moisturize, etc).</li>
            <li>The regular OPI Top Coat is a winner</li>
            <li>Actually can&#x27;t tell any difference In This one and so many others.</li>
            <li>and she applied the products exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>that it IS UV hardened--that is why the top coat product is in a black opaque bottle--to block all UV light from activating the polymer that hardens it.</li>
            <li>top dry, Duri Rejuvacoate, and Quimica Alemina nail hardner.  </li>
            <li>It costs a little more but it is worth it</li>
            <li>The product arrived very well packaged</li>
            <li>Be sure to cover those areas carefully.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole set.</li>
            <li>the shine is not very shiny more of a glow,  </li>
            <li>very sticky  to the touch</li>
            <li>Depends on how much you abuse your nails.    </li>
            <li>It leaves your polish with bubbles and is very gloppy.</li>
            <li>I do this due to the fact that the OPI top coat can pull the polish and ruin the manicure if you&#x27;re using a non-Infinite shine polish.  </li>
            <li>I do not let my polish chip off on its own as it usually takes a  layer of nail with it.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by some of the less than stellar reviews for this product (and the system in general) because I have been THRILLED with the results of this.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution for commitment-phobes who like to change the color of their nails if they want but have long lasting color when they are too busy or lazy to change it.</li>
            <li>Normal polish  </li>
            <li>Beautiful shine and thick coating!!!</li>
            <li>If you were painting the walls of your house, you would not get a good result if the walls were oily or dirty or had bits of dust or debris on them, right?</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Contrary to popular opinion, I prefer to keep the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on my nails as I find that they are much less like to peel, break or dry out.</li>
            <li>Apply a small dollop of Seche Vite quick dry top coat (especially if using a non Infinite shine polish).</li>
            <li>Spots where the nail itself has peeled are likely to chip much faster.  </li>
            <li>Shiny top coat that lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the shine, hence I purchased the whole set: base coat, nail polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>I normally rotate shellac and regular OPI polish.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to be the bomb, I love OPI,  sadly this product falls short,  </li>
            <li>Using this method I get at least a solid 7 days of chip free wear.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My polish consistently lasts me 7-10 days at least with only minor tip wear.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something that was long lasting, but did not require &#x27;fills&#x27; or soaking off in chemicals, or damage nails when I wanted them off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny and long lasting.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it on 3 different occasion ls, and it&#x27;s done this every single time.</li>
            <li> Allow that to dry then apply your steps allowing each to dry briefly.</li>
            <li> Long lasting....easy removal.</li>
            <li> The performance was as expected: long lasting and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product remained tacky for a very long time along with the polish.</li>
            <li> Let dry 1-2 minutes between coats.  </li>
            <li> This product did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> A total waste.</li>
            <li> I purchased the base, 2 different color polishes and the top coat.</li>
            <li> I have weak nails and this offers extra strength and protection; only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I normally mix and mash different  base coats and top coats, but this is one of those instances where I find that using the Infinite Shine base really enhances the wear of the polish.</li>
            <li> Stays on days longer than other ploish</li>
            <li> it was no better than regular polish, if fact started chipping in 2 days.  </li>
            <li> It DID last much longer than regular nail polish does on me, and it DID shine like crazy, and I am REALLY hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> I used infinite shine 1, 2, and 3 together as base coat, polish, top coat.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for nearly 20 years, and 2 years ago I decided to stop, as I was tired of the time it takes to maintain and the bothersome thickness and bulkiness of the nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased the base coat, polish and top coat for this system.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will see that it lasts way longer than typical polish.</li>
            <li> It also dries faster than typical polish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned,  braided my hair,  and ate hard shell crab legs during this time (hence the small nick on my left pointer finger).</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate it, and I am a very loyal OPI user.</li>
            <li> You may choose to reapply the gloss coat after a few days.</li>
            <li> For starters, I am a nail fanatic and I&#x27;ve tried at least 50 base and top coats (I have a polish stash of 400+).  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money! }</li>
            <li> This lasts at least 7 days on my nails.</li>
            <li> It lasts for at least 10 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> In fact, you&#x27;d get bubbles with any polish by applying a thick coat.</li>
            <li> It was a pain to grow out my thin, damaged nails</li>
            <li> It calls for THIN coats</li>
            <li> Not shiny at all! :(</li>
            <li> Apply Infinite Shine Base coat.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Infinite shine is terrible.</li>
            <li> It looked awful and chipped within 2 days!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Polish lasts a day before it starts chipping. I used infinite shine 1, 2, and 3 together as base coat, polish, top coat. I reapplied 5 different times to make sure I gave it a fair chance.  This polish even chips off my toes after two days. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> OPI is a good brand and the price was right. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very well packaged an in two days.  The performance was as expected: long lasting and shiny.</li>
            <li> For starters, I am a nail fanatic and I&#x27;ve tried at least 50 base and top coats (I have a polish stash of 400+).  This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve come across in a LONG TIME. I haven&#x27;t had a polish find this great since I discovered Seche Vite top dry, Duri Rejuvacoate, and Quimica Alemina nail hardner.  My polish consistently lasts me 7-10 days at least with only minor tip wear. I get 3+ weeks on my toes. I normally mix and mash different  base coats and top coats, but this is one of those instances where I find that using the Infinite Shine base really enhances the wear of the polish. I will add pictures for a wear test to go along with my review. For the best results I do the following:  1.) Start with clean nails. I do my normal manicure prep (file, clean up cuticles, moisturize, etc). I also buff and polish my nails with the buffer once every 2-3 weeks. Contrary to popular opinion, I prefer to keep the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on my nails as I find that they are much less like to peel, break or dry out. Prepping your nails with 91% alcohol or greater is sufficient to remove oil residue on your nails and  enhance wear.  2.) Apply Infinite Shine Base coat. Be sure to wrap around tips  Note: Spots where the nail itself has peeled are likely to chip much faster.  Be sure to cover those areas carefully. Apply colored polish of your choice. I&#x27;ve used several different brands with the same results . Let dry 1-2 minutes between coats.  3.) Apply a small dollop of Seche Vite quick dry top coat (especially if using a non Infinite shine polish). I do this due to the fact that the OPI top coat can pull the polish and ruin the manicure if you&#x27;re using a non-Infinite shine polish.  Be sure to cap the tips as this polish and the OPI top coat can cause shrinkage.  4.) Apply OPI top coat about 5-10 minutes after applying the Seche Vite. Again be sure to cap the free edge of your nails. Using this method I get at least a solid 7 days of chip free wear.  The orange polish below is OPI Infinite Shine Endurance Race to the finish. The purple is Sally Hansen Xtreme wear Pinch of Punch.  This day 2  of the Manicure (I&#x27;ll update this review on Day 7 and Day 14 if possible)  Edited to add 7 day photos: as you can see the wear has been pretty great. I&#x27;ve cleaned,  braided my hair,  and ate hard shell crab legs during this time (hence the small nick on my left pointer finger). I may redo this and recap the tips on the others to wear for another 5-7 days. I do not let my polish chip off on its own as it usually takes a  layer of nail with it. Also make sure my nails get some sun while I&#x27;m driving since light, especially  natural uv,  will enhance the topcoat. Hope this review helps someone</li>
            <li> Really useful not to use a lamp</li>
            <li> Beautiful shine and thick coating!!! Love it</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by some of the less than stellar reviews for this product (and the system in general) because I have been THRILLED with the results of this. It DID last much longer than regular nail polish does on me, and it DID shine like crazy, and I am REALLY hard on my nails. Perhaps the reason I had a great experience with this product was because I had it applied by a professional in a salon, so my nails were buffed and prepped properly before putting the product on. I think the nail prep is AS IMPORTANT for a good finish on your nails as the polish is. If you were painting the walls of your house, you would not get a good result if the walls were oily or dirty or had bits of dust or debris on them, right? So the same principle applies here too, of course. Also--my nail lady DID have me sit under a UV lamp to cure this, and I will bet you this is what made the difference for me and gave me the beautiful, squishy, shiny but hard-to-wreck finish I am loving. I have read that the reason this product lasts longer is that it IS UV hardened--that is why the top coat product is in a black opaque bottle--to block all UV light from activating the polymer that hardens it. So if you want this product to last the way it claims, my advice is to UV cure it. My understanding is that the more it is exposed to UV light, the harder the finish becomes.&lt;br /&gt; I had acrylic nails for nearly 20 years, and 2 years ago I decided to stop, as I was tired of the time it takes to maintain and the bothersome thickness and bulkiness of the nails. It was a pain to grow out my thin, damaged nails and I was looking for something that was long lasting, but did not require &#x27;fills&#x27; or soaking off in chemicals, or damage nails when I wanted them off. Gel nails look nice, but still require a trip to the nail salon to soak off and fill and I wanted to be able to touch up my nails or change the color if I wanted without having to schlep back into the salon to do that. This is the perfect product. I bring my own to the salon when I want a manicure, and I can do it at home if I want a polish change and it comes off just great with regular remover. This is the perfect solution for commitment-phobes who like to change the color of their nails if they want but have long lasting color when they are too busy or lazy to change it. UV cure this, and I bet you will love it!</li>
            <li> The nail polish lasted for a week without chipping</li>
            <li> Great shine but chips the next day. Not the quality of OPI. The shine is much better than Sally Hansen but it doesn&#x27;t last not even three days so it isn&#x27;t worth it..</li>
            <li> Actually DOES what it says!</li>
            <li> Stays on days longer than other ploish</li>
            <li> Gives polished look and shine to Gel Effect polish.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB KEEPS IT SUPER SHINNY</li>
            <li> Save your money. I bought the whole set. Lasted all of 2 days before the polish chipped.</li>
            <li> This product remained tacky for a very long time along with the polish. My nails were ruined shortly after I polished them and ended up taking off the mani.</li>
            <li> Love OPI Infinite Shine</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate it, and I am a very loyal OPI user. The top coat makes my polish bubble up and I&#x27;ve used it on 3 different occasion ls, and it&#x27;s done this every single time. The regular OPI Top Coat is a winner and I&#x27;ll be going back to using it, post haste.</li>
            <li> Not as shiny as I had hoped for.  Actually can&#x27;t tell any difference In This one and so many others.</li>
            <li> I  adore OPI and was truly excited to try this product. This product did not live up to my expectations.  My polish was easily applied, but I still had a significant amount of chipping on my nails.  A total waste.</li>
            <li> I purchased the base coat, polish and top coat for this system.  I usually love OPI and was very excited to try it, as was my regular manicurist.  The salon did not carry the product and thought we would give it a go.  I normally rotate shellac and regular OPI polish.  We watched the video together and she applied the products exactly as directed.  Outcome:  it was no better than regular polish, if fact started chipping in 2 days.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be the bomb, I love OPI,  sadly this product falls short,  the shine is not very shiny more of a glow,  it&#x27;s inbetween matte and gloss.  I think  this product is a miss and is outperformed by CND Vinylux top coat.</li>
            <li> Great product! Shiny top coat that lasts at least a week. Prevented chipped nails.</li>
            <li> Incredible wear! This lasts at least 7 days on my nails. Normal polish  chips in 1 day.... Wow!</li>
            <li> I use this as a topcoat only, didn&#x27;t like the nail polish in this line. I have weak nails and this offers extra strength and protection; only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is hard to remove. I</li>
            <li> Infinite shine - great line. I love the colors and the shine, hence I purchased the whole set: base coat, nail polish and top coat. It lasts for at least 10 days without chipping. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> very sticky  to the touch</li>
            <li> Long lasting....easy removal.</li>
            <li> Great line great product,the shine really last. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at beauty supply. I have the Infinite Primer and Infinite Gloss coat. I chose the color &#x27;Staying Neutral&#x27; and I love the whole set. It&#x27;s shiny and long lasting. Follow the directions and you will see that it lasts way longer than typical polish. It calls for THIN coats so if you over apply then expect bubbles. In fact, you&#x27;d get bubbles with any polish by applying a thick coat. The color I chose applied evenly in one coat.    It&#x27;s important that your nails be free and clear of any oils or debris so dip a q-tip in acetone and prep your nail. Allow that to dry then apply your steps allowing each to dry briefly. And also cap the tips of your nails. Overall it dries quickly especially compared to Vinylux. It also dries faster than typical polish.  Your polish will last. You may choose to reapply the gloss coat after a few days. Depends on how much you abuse your nails.    I love my set and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference for the extra price.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat.  I shines for days.  it dries quickly and compliments the infinite shine polish.  It can be worn with any polish to enhance the shine of the polish. It costs a little more but it is worth it</li>
            <li> Infinite shine is terrible. Starts chipping within one or two days. Not shiny at all! :( don&#x27;t waste your money! }</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It leaves your polish with bubbles and is very gloppy. I purchased the base, 2 different color polishes and the top coat. It looked awful and chipped within 2 days!</li>
