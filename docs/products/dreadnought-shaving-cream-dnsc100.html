            <li>can&#x27;t give it a 5 star because  I am still looking for that perfect one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I buy into the sales pitch regarding the additive that decreases beard growth, but as a shaving cream I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Great addition to the rotation!</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of products and this is the best shaving cream I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>

            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>I have been continuing to use my Gillette Fusion Proglide with this cream with great</li>
            <li>The price is great as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick tip, I use Aveeno&#x27;s and L&#x27;Occitane aftershave balms both are great, not greasy</li>
            <li>but I have had a great experience with Aveeno.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>Great for legs.</li>
            <li>Nothing but great things to say about it.</li>
            <li>Great for travel.  </li>
            <li>A GREAT PURCHASE..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>It is dependable, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li>Suds up great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great product goes on well with a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Great Scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and feels so light but delivers a great shave!</li>
            <li>Both of these are among the best I have used in many years.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful lather softens whiskers and creates excellent surface if using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It is easily the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Good cushion.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaving cream because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how smooth and wonderful my skin feels after shaving.</li>
            <li>I tried both by hand and with a good shaving brush.</li>
            <li>If you use this cream, Harry&#x27;s Razors and a good badger brush you will be amazed at the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>As good as Proraso is, Dreadnought beats it hands-down.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff,</li>
            <li>will probably use it up and return to using Edge Gel as it is quicker and cheaper and just as good, shave-wise</li>
            <li>This cream smells great and whips up a nice lather, but that&#x27;s about all the praise I have.</li>
            <li>It does produce a good lather, but with me, at least,&lt;br /&gt;the lather requires two almond size dollops, not just one.  </li>
            <li>Also it does not produce as good a lather as</li>
            <li>DE shavers will find it superior also.</li>
            <li>Smells great and has nice texture.</li>
            <li>use DE Razor with Astra  Superior Platinum Blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priort to Dreadnought</li>
            <li>Always good to good, close shave.</li>
            <li>Not inexpensive, but with a good bristle brush and Harry&#x27;s razor/blades I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Dreadnought is an excellent shave cream with a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Preforms just as well or better than TOBS, but yet smells great.</li>
            <li>handle razor, and finishing with the Dreadnought post shave balm, I have experienced the closest shave I have enjoyed in years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work great on men as well.  </li>
            <li>good quality  nice scent</li>
            <li>Nice scent, good lather but $18.00?</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is good, builds a nice lather and all, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Lathers up really nice, smells good</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced with great results!!  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and pleasant on the skin</li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT product that works exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This cream is better than those and located on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>, you deserve a top notch shaving cream!</li>
            <li>Love this cream!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, smells great, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This being my first foray into this type of shaving cream I must say it is very pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>this cream is AMAZING.... smells so goooooood....  </li>
            <li>Product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the lather this cream produced.</li>
            <li>Gives me a really nice shave.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, lathers well.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li>It may be an effective soap, but the aroma is</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>The shaving cream is nice,  lathers up well.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my face, leaves it very moisturized, prevents almost all irritation and smells great.</li>
            <li>This stuff kind of burns when you leave it on your face</li>
            <li>Nice aroma to it, lather nicely as well.</li>
            <li>cream.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it.</li>
            <li>Works well with any kind of brush (boar, badger, horsehair).  </li>
            <li>Lather is nice but you need about 2X to 3X the amount they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice protective lather</li>
            <li>Provides a nice rich lather that does a great job of protecting the skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream is very good but falls short of great.  </li>
            <li>The seller was also great, fast shipping and good pricing.</li>
            <li>Razor glides over face very easily with this cream.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, kind of like a spicy citrus with a hint of mint smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good shaving cream, that when rubbed onto your brush, gives a nice lather and a smooth shave, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of cream to achieve a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, very clean and manly.</li>
            <li>A good product, but I find I enjoy a soap puck better.  </li>
            <li>This has been the best product for my skin...does not dry out, smooth finish, smells good, has reduced the razor burn as well...</li>
            <li>First off, great business plan.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up good with a brush and provides decent lubrication, but not as good IMO as T&amp;H, Trumpers or TOBS.</li>
            <li>This Shaving Cream is great, very rich smooth and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li>Scent is citrus and herbal and very light.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaving cream - froths up nicely, clean and classic smell.  </li>
            <li>love the smell..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I shave my face and head, and have tried many products in search of the ones that work.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It applies well, forming a nice smooth lather on the face that is invigorating, but also quite soothing.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get the best shave unless you also use a brush, and this jar will last you six months.</li>
            <li>Better than shaving cream for sure.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more of it.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get many shaves out of it.</li>
            <li>I have been on a search for several years now, looking for the best shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I like it but just have a feeling there could be better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>more creams are a better value and better performer.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I use it with a badger-hair brush, though the tin says it&#x27;s ok to use with just your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I had known about this shaving cream many years ago.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, overall...</li>
            <li>It is ok, I have used better</li>
            <li>This is the BEST shaving cream on the market have tried numerous others but this one is way beyond them all..</li>
            <li>This product is extremely OK but is overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li>I used just my hands while traveling but using a shaving cup and brush at home produced an outstanding lather that I wasn&#x27;t able to obtain with my hands alone.</li>
            <li>However, the TOBS is the better deal for the money.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more for the money.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the ingredients are too safe.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>Need more than this to justify $24.00 purchase of shaving cream, fellas. - JS</li>
            <li>It works as well or better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>A great scent and absolutely &amp;#34;goodness&amp;#34; shave cream.  </li>
            <li>Simply one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>so it is overpriced, but I&#x27;ll probably get more anyway.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it more than two days in a row without getting a bunch of ingrowns.</li>
            <li>out- imagine a donut with a glaze on top hiding the hole.  </li>
            <li>Co Bigelow is cheaper and much better.</li>
            <li>The DREADNOUGHT products are outstanding.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I have many scents and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>defiantly not overpowering.this is one of the better shaving creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The slickness that the cream provided was top notch.  </li>
            <li>I could have skipped using an aftershave, because my face was so felt so healthy and</li>
            <li>Really glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff overall.  </li>
            <li>It will foam up creating a very rich lather.</li>
            <li>Forms a very rich lather when used with either my boar bristle or badger brush.</li>
            <li>an almond sized dab is needed to create a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li>I feel well groomed, and after adding some classic after shave, it&#x27;s a great experience.</li>
            <li>but it was decent and smelled great.</li>
            <li>Not too frou frou, but just a nice clean smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>When i first opened dreadnought, it smelled so good</li>
            <li>Very good modern scent and lathers like no other best I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li>The shaving cream is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So very much better than what is available at the drug store, market, etc.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent but</li>
            <li>Creates a creamy, pleasant smelling lather, that has excellent glide, and left my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This is will be my go to cream due to the excellent scent and close shave.</li>
            <li>with my brush and bowl I can easily whip up 3 applications using an almond size dollop</li>
            <li>Really, this cream is silky smooth and easy to work up into a good lather.</li>
            <li>Rinses easily from the brush.</li>
            <li>(albeit the scent is too strong for my preferences).</li>
            <li>for the shave itself, I was impressed - the cream brushes on very well, the blade glided without effort, and my face was soft and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has pretty much no scent, but if that&#x27;s what you want than great.</li>
            <li>The stuff works fine.  </li>
            <li>I used my Fine Accoutrements shaving bowl (with anti-static technology</li>
            <li>but never the less obtain an excellent, smooth, nick-free shave.</li>
            <li>us experienced guys of returning to classic shaving with a  real razor!  </li>
            <li>Rich, smooth lather with a mild scent great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this shaving cream allows mistake free shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and I never cut myself.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>There is a light tingling, but that is the product activating.</li>
            <li>The shave is extremely smooth and I&#x27;m always receiving compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave</li>
            <li>I have a fairly light and sparse beard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as if I had used an after shave balm or light after shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li>T&amp;H was $31 for 6.7 oz and the tub was completely filled.</li>
            <li>Using my Parker shaving brush, I lightly covered the bristle tips with the cream.  </li>
            <li>I do not take showers prior to shaving , this stuff works great without shower --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how good the reviews are.</li>
            <li>TLDR; Nowhere near as good as Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Duke Cannon shaving cream for over a year now and kept hearing about Dreadnought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth the cost over cheaper creams!</li>
            <li>just a dab is all you need to get a rich lather going.  </li>
            <li>I love the sent and how little you need to you for a great shave.</li>
            <li>TOBS is a great cream as well, although I get a little more irritation with it than I do with Dreadnought.</li>
            <li>No nicks, no razor burns, just a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have used dreadnought many times and I have discovered that it both soothes the skin and softens the beard so that you will have the fastest and smoothest shave in a style reminiscent of those classic shaves delivered by an experienced barber.</li>
            <li>It produces a lot of the rich, long-lasting lather that is essential for a good shave.  </li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t able to pack my tube of Proraso due to TSA barriers) and was delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>Pure foamy magic.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>Great product and all, though upon opening it up for the first time, it already looked as though a third of the product was already gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting use to the whole badger hair brush and shaving thing, but I love the smell of this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I got a shaving brush too - and it seems like a pain, but it really does work better.</li>
            <li>The most lubricating of all creams and soaps that I&#x27;ve tried, at a very premium price.  </li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t good enough, the company selling Dreadnought was a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is top notch and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I lathers easily, has great cusion and glide, and left my face feeling new and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, I am now able to get twice as many shaves from the same blade (I use feather blades in my DE razor).  </li>
            <li>AND for a luxury/premium shave cream it is super well priced</li>
            <li>The lather builds quickly and holds up well.</li>
            <li>you do the above, it will work about as well as Edge Gel albeit at the expense of more effort and greater cost.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, but the packaging needs to be better.</li>
            <li>I recommend it most highly.</li>
            <li>Price is a bit high, but not outrageously so for the quality.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the lid for the first time, I noticed a light, clean, fresh laundry scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They claim 50 shaves, but based on how much I&#x27;ve used so far, I expect to get many more.  </li>
            <li>After using shaving cream in a can for years this is my new favorite</li>
            <li>In my book this is a good characteristic since it means that I do not need to be concerned about my shaving cream scent mixing/clashing with my deodorant or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to using a double-edge razor</li>
            <li>and, when paired with my brush, really does a good job getting in and around my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the renaissance movement among young men as well as</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Old Bond Street, which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>By the time most people have achieved that duration, most nascent DE shavers will be skilled enough that everything seems easier (of they have gone back to cartridge).    </li>
            <li>I like it as well as or maybe even better than Taylor of Old Bond Street creams.</li>
            <li>Duke cannon wins.</li>
            <li>My better half has a bathroom full of shaving creams from piroso to nivea, and he says they are all better than this.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband for Christmas as he was looking for a higher end shaving cream that was still reasonably priced and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>The shave is extremely close and the scent is so good i refuse to use an aftershave balm (until i receive the dreadnought aftershave)</li>
            <li>I have a large rotation of creams and soaps, and love trying out new ones all the time.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and smooth after every shave without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>I was able to take 3 easy passes across my face with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the JAck Black</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get a rice, creamy lather, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li>first is that you don&#x27;t get very much</li>
            <li>soon as you open the tin, you just smell the very fresh, clean scent of the cream.  </li>
            <li>The stuff works exactly like you&#x27;ve always hoped</li>
            <li>Smooth skin, feels baby soft for hours, soothing to the skin if cuts or razor burns.</li>
            <li>I am just getting back into shaving with a safety razor and am really enjoying the experience.  </li>
            <li>I just got some of this shaving cream as a gift and from the first shave</li>
            <li>The same size dollop of Proraso gives me more lather.</li>
            <li>I have only been using dreadnought for 3 days and have fallen in love.</li>
            <li>used it exactly according to instructions and</li>
            <li>I like to re-lather several times as I shave, and that means cleaning my brush and re-applying more product in this case.</li>
            <li>*wink*)</li>
            <li>Just a few swishes of the brush over the TOBS cream and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li>F. Trumpers for less money, each with a nice lather and a distinct scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is &amp;#34;sporty,&amp;#34; and while I still enjoy traditional scents like coconut, almond, or sandalwood for my age (40), this scent is not too young for my taste (or my wife&#x27;s); it is a mild and clean scent.  </li>
            <li>You use a very very small amount on a brush and it creates great lather.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but easily the best overall shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Colonel Conks Bay Rum shave soap (not very good), and Taylor of Old Bond Street St. James shaving creams and Dreadnought gives me the best shave so far.</li>
            <li>Great product lathers well use very little so it does last very long time would recommend it to anybody who wants a good shave</li>
            <li>This cream smells fantastic, lathers fantastic, goes on smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>I like the small jar, which makes this product good for traveling.</li>
            <li>It gives me an alright shave, but no better than a good supermarket aerosol cream.</li>
            <li>Very HIGH quality product.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the best shaving creams I have used.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little of the product on the brush to shave,&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use to much and waste a lot.</li>
            <li>It also lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the answer to my shaving problems because over the counter shaving creams and gels don&#x27;t help me much ....</li>
            <li>I use a brush to apply it, also from Dreadnought, and the two work very well</li>
            <li>But he really like the dreadnought post shave balm.</li>
            <li>Too much product is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to my cheap store</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really it.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up really well</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this cream to anyone looking to enhance their shaving experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proraso and Art of shaving, and Dreadnought holds up really well.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and leaves my face with a very close shave.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need much at all to cover your beard.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell really &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Talk about a very close shave when using this cream with a brush.</li>
            <li>I suppose I should have known from the marketing copy, but the scent is very ah, manly, in a dudebro sort of way.</li>
            <li>Another plus for the TOBS cream over Dreadnought is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to make a lot of lather.</li>
            <li>Tried it once, too much residue on my razor for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Decelerine also provides a gentle moisturizing effect to the skin</li>
            <li>After the reviews, I expected a bit more.</li>
            <li>They should really consider dropping the nonsensical dribble on the box</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into straight razor shaving, this is a must have.</li>
            <li>It foams really nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially when I can get a bit more Taylor of old Bond street or Geo.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve actually had better experience with the cream by lathering it up directly on my face using a brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve actually had better experience with the cream by lathering it up directly on my face using a brush.</li>
            <li>Again use a proper razor, either a straight razor or a safety razor, or you will just plug up the modern crappy razors this is maybe the most expensive of the best shave cremes but a little goes a long way, it gives a closer and closer shave the more you use it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had better shaves with this product than any other cream or foam I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>there are plenty of creams for a great wet shave for half the price</li>
            <li>A good choice if you do not need or want the extra smell of typical shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I have no allergies that I am aware, and I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is overly sensitive, so I have to believe it is a chemical in the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and I have had almost no nicks since using this with my Merkur Futur with Feather blades.</li>
            <li>at half the price, better shave, no residue.</li>
            <li>Most recently I have been using Malin+Goetz Vitamin E shaving cream, and before that, Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li>It creates a thick, rick lather when combined with a shaving brush, and provides a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Considering dreadnought is just OK and actually more expensive than T&amp; H  </li>
            <li>Decent shave.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I decided, as I reached 44 years of age, that maybe I&#x27;d try something a little more &amp;#34;old school.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I use Geo F. Trumpers, Proraso, and other more traditionally scented shave creams, and I prefer the consistency and feel of Dreadnought Luxury Shaving Cream better than any other shave cream product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Have now re-ordered it a few times and am extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This just means that if I use enough Dreadnought to get a good lather for three passes I&#x27;ll go through the already small tub even faster.</li>
            <li>Nice thick lather.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff; I have some other expensive creams in my cabinet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this one yielded the smoothest shave with my straight razor (to date).</li>
            <li>I have a new paperweight in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Just a small dab on your brush gives you lots of lather and a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it allows the razor to work smoothly with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>In both cases I had a thick lather that maintained a good texture without collapsing during my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dreadnought cream has a neutral soapy scent that does not linger beyond the actual shave.</li>
            <li>This is not the average old school shave creme there is cool science here!</li>
            <li>Their premium shaving cream is delivered in a small 100ml container with a screw top as opposed to a tube.</li>
            <li>and WOW!</li>
            <li>love this stuff, but also use Proraso on a regular basis due to the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>Lathers quickly with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it quite as full a lather as I get from some other products</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be possible to use it without a shaving brush, but I think that would be far less satisfying.  </li>
            <li>That, of course, makes the apparent high cost of a bottle justifiable.  </li>
            <li>It seems like the struggle is to find a shaving cream that preforms like the classics, but that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you&#x27;re 80 years old.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and won&#x27;t make you smell like soap or an old man who&#x27;s been bathing in moth balls.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it helps my beard not grow as much.  </li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my head and again WOW.</li>
            <li>I also just got a tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street (aka TOBS)</li>
            <li>I used this for a complete week</li>
            <li>There was a considerable amount of cream &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34;, the air pocket was visible from outsider the tub.</li>
            <li>I have many of the grandpa scents as well as the mints,  limes,  bay rums (this sucks btw.)  </li>
            <li>Bought some, tried it out and initial impressions were promising.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and used to have irritation all the time, once I started using this stuff  no irritation at all</li>
            <li>Good viscosity, quite expensive</li>
            <li>Works well but is more time consuming and more expensive than other products that will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can agree that items settle during shipment but the jar i received was half full.</li>
            <li>So basically i am assuming for $19 you get a jar half full.</li>
            <li>The smell is not notable or strong.  </li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard and today was the first time I wasn&#x27;t red from the irritation.</li>
            <li>However, for those few who pursue the ancient and noble art of shaving in the manly fashion of a proper gentleman with a straight razor will find that it enhances an everyday experience and makes it transcend to the realm of relaxation and tranquility.</li>
            <li>I have a rough face that is hard to shave, this is like a miracle to me, I love to shave with this!</li>
            <li>All I need is a small blog on the brush and it provides ample cream for two passes, if need be.or light after shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much lather so little cream was  capable of making.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product settled during shipment from England, to Chicago, to New york and the its final destination.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will have to try the English brands I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about next.</li>
            <li>This old school type shave creme uses technology that will thin the stubble the more you use it.</li>
            <li>I think if you can either get Dreadnought as a gift or keep it in a rotation with other creams so it can last longer, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The tub of TOBS will last a long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much cream for each shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried giving it a couple of weeks to see if my skin just needed to get used to it, but eventually ended up going back to my old standby, Proraso.</li>
            <li>I have many creams and soaps and never experienced this.</li>
            <li>It is just a bit softer than the tube cream and packs a truly rich cushion of lather so that I hardly feel the blade anymore</li>
            <li>A little on the expensive side, but as most of the other reviews explain, very little product is needed to produce a great lather.</li>
            <li>It was thick, luxurious, rich, and seemed to lubricate my face well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other positive reviews, so it&#x27;s very possible</li>
            <li>Lest I forget, a significant secondary benefit is that the Dreadnought Cream is must lest costly than the last two I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>final drawback is that the small tub came only about 2/3 to 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>This works really well and has cut down on my razor burn quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a safety razor (about 3 months).</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this premium product and will definitly keep a jar of it in my shaving rotation (and look forward to trying there other products).</li>
            <li>Makes the dry skin on my legs really soft.</li>
            <li>I typically rotate my creams, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use this one for a month straight and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have no trouble going 12 hours without a second shave on a long day.  </li>
            <li>I got an extremely close shave with my (new) merkur slant with feather blade in only 2 passes (WTG, XTG).</li>
            <li>when I don&#x27;t use this, I find it hard to resist cracking it open and smelling it; fresh and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I have been continuing to use my Gillette Fusion Proglide with this cream with great</li>
            <li> The price is great as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick tip, I use Aveeno&#x27;s and L&#x27;Occitane aftershave balms both are great, not greasy</li>
            <li> but I have had a great experience with Aveeno.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It is dependable, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> Suds up great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product goes on well with a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Great Scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and feels so light but delivers a great shave!</li>
            <li> Both of these are among the best I have used in many years.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful lather softens whiskers and creates excellent surface if using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It is easily the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Good cushion.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving cream because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how smooth and wonderful my skin feels after shaving.</li>
            <li> I tried both by hand and with a good shaving brush.</li>
            <li> If you use this cream, Harry&#x27;s Razors and a good badger brush you will be amazed at the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> As good as Proraso is, Dreadnought beats it hands-down.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff,</li>
            <li> will probably use it up and return to using Edge Gel as it is quicker and cheaper and just as good, shave-wise</li>
            <li> This cream smells great and whips up a nice lather, but that&#x27;s about all the praise I have.</li>
            <li> It does produce a good lather, but with me, at least,&lt;br /&gt;the lather requires two almond size dollops, not just one.  </li>
            <li> Also it does not produce as good a lather as</li>
            <li> DE shavers will find it superior also.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has nice texture.</li>
            <li> use DE Razor with Astra  Superior Platinum Blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priort to Dreadnought</li>
            <li> Always good to good, close shave.</li>
            <li> Not inexpensive, but with a good bristle brush and Harry&#x27;s razor/blades I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Dreadnought is an excellent shave cream with a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Preforms just as well or better than TOBS, but yet smells great.</li>
            <li> handle razor, and finishing with the Dreadnought post shave balm, I have experienced the closest shave I have enjoyed in years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work great on men as well.  </li>
            <li> good quality  nice scent</li>
            <li> Nice scent, good lather but $18.00?</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is good, builds a nice lather and all, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Lathers up really nice, smells good</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced with great results!!  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and pleasant on the skin</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product that works exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This cream is better than those and located on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> , you deserve a top notch shaving cream!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, smells great, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This being my first foray into this type of shaving cream I must say it is very pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> this cream is AMAZING.... smells so goooooood....  </li>
            <li> Product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the lather this cream produced.</li>
            <li> Gives me a really nice shave.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers well.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> It may be an effective soap, but the aroma is</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream is nice,  lathers up well.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my face, leaves it very moisturized, prevents almost all irritation and smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff kind of burns when you leave it on your face</li>
            <li> Nice aroma to it, lather nicely as well.</li>
            <li> cream.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it.</li>
            <li> Works well with any kind of brush (boar, badger, horsehair).  </li>
            <li> Lather is nice but you need about 2X to 3X the amount they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice protective lather</li>
            <li> Provides a nice rich lather that does a great job of protecting the skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li> This shaving cream is very good but falls short of great.  </li>
            <li> The seller was also great, fast shipping and good pricing.</li>
            <li> Razor glides over face very easily with this cream.</li>
            <li> It smells ok, kind of like a spicy citrus with a hint of mint smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good shaving cream, that when rubbed onto your brush, gives a nice lather and a smooth shave, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of cream to achieve a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, very clean and manly.</li>
            <li> A good product, but I find I enjoy a soap puck better.  </li>
            <li> This has been the best product for my skin...does not dry out, smooth finish, smells good, has reduced the razor burn as well...</li>
            <li> First off, great business plan.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up good with a brush and provides decent lubrication, but not as good IMO as T&amp;H, Trumpers or TOBS.</li>
            <li> This Shaving Cream is great, very rich smooth and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li> Scent is citrus and herbal and very light.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream - froths up nicely, clean and classic smell.  </li>
            <li> love the smell..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I shave my face and head, and have tried many products in search of the ones that work.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It applies well, forming a nice smooth lather on the face that is invigorating, but also quite soothing.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get the best shave unless you also use a brush, and this jar will last you six months.</li>
            <li> Better than shaving cream for sure.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more of it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get many shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> I have been on a search for several years now, looking for the best shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I like it but just have a feeling there could be better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> more creams are a better value and better performer.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I use it with a badger-hair brush, though the tin says it&#x27;s ok to use with just your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this shaving cream many years ago.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, overall...</li>
            <li> It is ok, I have used better</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shaving cream on the market have tried numerous others but this one is way beyond them all..</li>
            <li> This product is extremely OK but is overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> I used just my hands while traveling but using a shaving cup and brush at home produced an outstanding lather that I wasn&#x27;t able to obtain with my hands alone.</li>
            <li> However, the TOBS is the better deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more for the money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think the ingredients are too safe.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li> Need more than this to justify $24.00 purchase of shaving cream, fellas. - JS</li>
            <li> It works as well or better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> A great scent and absolutely &amp;#34;goodness&amp;#34; shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Simply one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> so it is overpriced, but I&#x27;ll probably get more anyway.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it more than two days in a row without getting a bunch of ingrowns.</li>
            <li> out- imagine a donut with a glaze on top hiding the hole.  </li>
            <li> Co Bigelow is cheaper and much better.</li>
            <li> The DREADNOUGHT products are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I have many scents and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> defiantly not overpowering.this is one of the better shaving creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The slickness that the cream provided was top notch.  </li>
            <li> I could have skipped using an aftershave, because my face was so felt so healthy and</li>
            <li> Really glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff overall.  </li>
            <li> It will foam up creating a very rich lather.</li>
            <li> Forms a very rich lather when used with either my boar bristle or badger brush.</li>
            <li> an almond sized dab is needed to create a nice rich lather.</li>
            <li> I feel well groomed, and after adding some classic after shave, it&#x27;s a great experience.</li>
            <li> but it was decent and smelled great.</li>
            <li> Not too frou frou, but just a nice clean smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> When i first opened dreadnought, it smelled so good</li>
            <li> Very good modern scent and lathers like no other best I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> The shaving cream is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So very much better than what is available at the drug store, market, etc.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent but</li>
            <li> Creates a creamy, pleasant smelling lather, that has excellent glide, and left my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This is will be my go to cream due to the excellent scent and close shave.</li>
            <li> with my brush and bowl I can easily whip up 3 applications using an almond size dollop</li>
            <li> Really, this cream is silky smooth and easy to work up into a good lather.</li>
            <li> Rinses easily from the brush.</li>
            <li> (albeit the scent is too strong for my preferences).</li>
            <li> for the shave itself, I was impressed - the cream brushes on very well, the blade glided without effort, and my face was soft and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has pretty much no scent, but if that&#x27;s what you want than great.</li>
            <li> The stuff works fine.  </li>
            <li> I used my Fine Accoutrements shaving bowl (with anti-static technology</li>
            <li> but never the less obtain an excellent, smooth, nick-free shave.</li>
            <li> us experienced guys of returning to classic shaving with a  real razor!  </li>
            <li> Rich, smooth lather with a mild scent great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this shaving cream allows mistake free shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and I never cut myself.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> There is a light tingling, but that is the product activating.</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely smooth and I&#x27;m always receiving compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave</li>
            <li> I have a fairly light and sparse beard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if I had used an after shave balm or light after shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li> T&amp;H was $31 for 6.7 oz and the tub was completely filled.</li>
            <li> Using my Parker shaving brush, I lightly covered the bristle tips with the cream.  </li>
            <li> I do not take showers prior to shaving , this stuff works great without shower --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how good the reviews are.</li>
            <li> TLDR; Nowhere near as good as Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Duke Cannon shaving cream for over a year now and kept hearing about Dreadnought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth the cost over cheaper creams!</li>
            <li> just a dab is all you need to get a rich lather going.  </li>
            <li> I love the sent and how little you need to you for a great shave.</li>
            <li> TOBS is a great cream as well, although I get a little more irritation with it than I do with Dreadnought.</li>
            <li> No nicks, no razor burns, just a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have used dreadnought many times and I have discovered that it both soothes the skin and softens the beard so that you will have the fastest and smoothest shave in a style reminiscent of those classic shaves delivered by an experienced barber.</li>
            <li> It produces a lot of the rich, long-lasting lather that is essential for a good shave.  </li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t able to pack my tube of Proraso due to TSA barriers) and was delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> Pure foamy magic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great product and all, though upon opening it up for the first time, it already looked as though a third of the product was already gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting use to the whole badger hair brush and shaving thing, but I love the smell of this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I got a shaving brush too - and it seems like a pain, but it really does work better.</li>
            <li> The most lubricating of all creams and soaps that I&#x27;ve tried, at a very premium price.  </li>
            <li> If that isn&#x27;t good enough, the company selling Dreadnought was a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is top notch and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I lathers easily, has great cusion and glide, and left my face feeling new and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, I am now able to get twice as many shaves from the same blade (I use feather blades in my DE razor).  </li>
            <li> AND for a luxury/premium shave cream it is super well priced</li>
            <li> The lather builds quickly and holds up well.</li>
            <li> you do the above, it will work about as well as Edge Gel albeit at the expense of more effort and greater cost.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, but the packaging needs to be better.</li>
            <li> I recommend it most highly.</li>
            <li> Price is a bit high, but not outrageously so for the quality.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the lid for the first time, I noticed a light, clean, fresh laundry scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They claim 50 shaves, but based on how much I&#x27;ve used so far, I expect to get many more.  </li>
            <li> After using shaving cream in a can for years this is my new favorite</li>
            <li> In my book this is a good characteristic since it means that I do not need to be concerned about my shaving cream scent mixing/clashing with my deodorant or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to using a double-edge razor</li>
            <li> and, when paired with my brush, really does a good job getting in and around my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the renaissance movement among young men as well as</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Old Bond Street, which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> By the time most people have achieved that duration, most nascent DE shavers will be skilled enough that everything seems easier (of they have gone back to cartridge).    </li>
            <li> I like it as well as or maybe even better than Taylor of Old Bond Street creams.</li>
            <li> Duke cannon wins.</li>
            <li> My better half has a bathroom full of shaving creams from piroso to nivea, and he says they are all better than this.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas as he was looking for a higher end shaving cream that was still reasonably priced and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> The shave is extremely close and the scent is so good i refuse to use an aftershave balm (until i receive the dreadnought aftershave)</li>
            <li> I have a large rotation of creams and soaps, and love trying out new ones all the time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and smooth after every shave without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> I was able to take 3 easy passes across my face with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the JAck Black</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get a rice, creamy lather, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> first is that you don&#x27;t get very much</li>
            <li> soon as you open the tin, you just smell the very fresh, clean scent of the cream.  </li>
            <li> The stuff works exactly like you&#x27;ve always hoped</li>
            <li> Smooth skin, feels baby soft for hours, soothing to the skin if cuts or razor burns.</li>
            <li> I am just getting back into shaving with a safety razor and am really enjoying the experience.  </li>
            <li> I just got some of this shaving cream as a gift and from the first shave</li>
            <li> The same size dollop of Proraso gives me more lather.</li>
            <li> I have only been using dreadnought for 3 days and have fallen in love.</li>
            <li> used it exactly according to instructions and</li>
            <li> I like to re-lather several times as I shave, and that means cleaning my brush and re-applying more product in this case.</li>
            <li> *wink*)</li>
            <li> Just a few swishes of the brush over the TOBS cream and you&#x27;re good to</li>
            <li> F. Trumpers for less money, each with a nice lather and a distinct scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is &amp;#34;sporty,&amp;#34; and while I still enjoy traditional scents like coconut, almond, or sandalwood for my age (40), this scent is not too young for my taste (or my wife&#x27;s); it is a mild and clean scent.  </li>
            <li> You use a very very small amount on a brush and it creates great lather.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but easily the best overall shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Colonel Conks Bay Rum shave soap (not very good), and Taylor of Old Bond Street St. James shaving creams and Dreadnought gives me the best shave so far.</li>
            <li> Great product lathers well use very little so it does last very long time would recommend it to anybody who wants a good shave</li>
            <li> This cream smells fantastic, lathers fantastic, goes on smooth and thick.</li>
            <li> I like the small jar, which makes this product good for traveling.</li>
            <li> It gives me an alright shave, but no better than a good supermarket aerosol cream.</li>
            <li> Very HIGH quality product.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best shaving creams I have used.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little of the product on the brush to shave,&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use to much and waste a lot.</li>
            <li> It also lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the answer to my shaving problems because over the counter shaving creams and gels don&#x27;t help me much ....</li>
            <li> I use a brush to apply it, also from Dreadnought, and the two work very well</li>
            <li> But he really like the dreadnought post shave balm.</li>
            <li> Too much product is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to my cheap store</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really it.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up really well</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this cream to anyone looking to enhance their shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proraso and Art of shaving, and Dreadnought holds up really well.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and leaves my face with a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need much at all to cover your beard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell really &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Talk about a very close shave when using this cream with a brush.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have known from the marketing copy, but the scent is very ah, manly, in a dudebro sort of way.</li>
            <li> Another plus for the TOBS cream over Dreadnought is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to make a lot of lather.</li>
            <li> Tried it once, too much residue on my razor for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Decelerine also provides a gentle moisturizing effect to the skin</li>
            <li> After the reviews, I expected a bit more.</li>
            <li> They should really consider dropping the nonsensical dribble on the box</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into straight razor shaving, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> It foams really nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially when I can get a bit more Taylor of old Bond street or Geo.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually had better experience with the cream by lathering it up directly on my face using a brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually had better experience with the cream by lathering it up directly on my face using a brush.</li>
            <li> Again use a proper razor, either a straight razor or a safety razor, or you will just plug up the modern crappy razors this is maybe the most expensive of the best shave cremes but a little goes a long way, it gives a closer and closer shave the more you use it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better shaves with this product than any other cream or foam I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> there are plenty of creams for a great wet shave for half the price</li>
            <li> A good choice if you do not need or want the extra smell of typical shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have no allergies that I am aware, and I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is overly sensitive, so I have to believe it is a chemical in the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and I have had almost no nicks since using this with my Merkur Futur with Feather blades.</li>
            <li> at half the price, better shave, no residue.</li>
            <li> Most recently I have been using Malin+Goetz Vitamin E shaving cream, and before that, Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li> It creates a thick, rick lather when combined with a shaving brush, and provides a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Considering dreadnought is just OK and actually more expensive than T&amp; H  </li>
            <li> Decent shave.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I decided, as I reached 44 years of age, that maybe I&#x27;d try something a little more &amp;#34;old school.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I use Geo F. Trumpers, Proraso, and other more traditionally scented shave creams, and I prefer the consistency and feel of Dreadnought Luxury Shaving Cream better than any other shave cream product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Have now re-ordered it a few times and am extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This just means that if I use enough Dreadnought to get a good lather for three passes I&#x27;ll go through the already small tub even faster.</li>
            <li> Nice thick lather.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; I have some other expensive creams in my cabinet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this one yielded the smoothest shave with my straight razor (to date).</li>
            <li> I have a new paperweight in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Just a small dab on your brush gives you lots of lather and a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it allows the razor to work smoothly with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> In both cases I had a thick lather that maintained a good texture without collapsing during my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dreadnought cream has a neutral soapy scent that does not linger beyond the actual shave.</li>
            <li> This is not the average old school shave creme there is cool science here!</li>
            <li> Their premium shaving cream is delivered in a small 100ml container with a screw top as opposed to a tube.</li>
            <li> and WOW!</li>
            <li> love this stuff, but also use Proraso on a regular basis due to the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice cream and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Lathers quickly with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it quite as full a lather as I get from some other products</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be possible to use it without a shaving brush, but I think that would be far less satisfying.  </li>
            <li> That, of course, makes the apparent high cost of a bottle justifiable.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the struggle is to find a shaving cream that preforms like the classics, but that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you&#x27;re 80 years old.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and won&#x27;t make you smell like soap or an old man who&#x27;s been bathing in moth balls.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it helps my beard not grow as much.  </li>
            <li> WOW is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my head and again WOW.</li>
            <li> I also just got a tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street (aka TOBS)</li>
            <li> I used this for a complete week</li>
            <li> There was a considerable amount of cream &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34;, the air pocket was visible from outsider the tub.</li>
            <li> I have many of the grandpa scents as well as the mints,  limes,  bay rums (this sucks btw.)  </li>
            <li> Bought some, tried it out and initial impressions were promising.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and used to have irritation all the time, once I started using this stuff  no irritation at all</li>
            <li> Good viscosity, quite expensive</li>
            <li> Works well but is more time consuming and more expensive than other products that will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can agree that items settle during shipment but the jar i received was half full.</li>
            <li> So basically i am assuming for $19 you get a jar half full.</li>
            <li> The smell is not notable or strong.  </li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and today was the first time I wasn&#x27;t red from the irritation.</li>
            <li> However, for those few who pursue the ancient and noble art of shaving in the manly fashion of a proper gentleman with a straight razor will find that it enhances an everyday experience and makes it transcend to the realm of relaxation and tranquility.</li>
            <li> I have a rough face that is hard to shave, this is like a miracle to me, I love to shave with this!</li>
            <li> All I need is a small blog on the brush and it provides ample cream for two passes, if need be.or light after shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much lather so little cream was  capable of making.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product settled during shipment from England, to Chicago, to New york and the its final destination.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will have to try the English brands I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about next.</li>
            <li> This old school type shave creme uses technology that will thin the stubble the more you use it.</li>
            <li> I think if you can either get Dreadnought as a gift or keep it in a rotation with other creams so it can last longer, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The tub of TOBS will last a long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much cream for each shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried giving it a couple of weeks to see if my skin just needed to get used to it, but eventually ended up going back to my old standby, Proraso.</li>
            <li> I have many creams and soaps and never experienced this.</li>
            <li> It is just a bit softer than the tube cream and packs a truly rich cushion of lather so that I hardly feel the blade anymore</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side, but as most of the other reviews explain, very little product is needed to produce a great lather.</li>
            <li> It was thick, luxurious, rich, and seemed to lubricate my face well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other positive reviews, so it&#x27;s very possible</li>
            <li> Lest I forget, a significant secondary benefit is that the Dreadnought Cream is must lest costly than the last two I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> final drawback is that the small tub came only about 2/3 to 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> This works really well and has cut down on my razor burn quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a safety razor (about 3 months).</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this premium product and will definitly keep a jar of it in my shaving rotation (and look forward to trying there other products).</li>
            <li> Makes the dry skin on my legs really soft.</li>
            <li> I typically rotate my creams, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use this one for a month straight and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have no trouble going 12 hours without a second shave on a long day.  </li>
            <li> I got an extremely close shave with my (new) merkur slant with feather blade in only 2 passes (WTG, XTG).</li>
            <li> when I don&#x27;t use this, I find it hard to resist cracking it open and smelling it; fresh and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to add a little bit of TOBS to my brush this morning on my third pass to make a decent lather to finish with.</li>
            <li> I know the price is a little high, but this jar should last you about 2 months (50 shaves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste time reading this or looking at other products, just try it.</li>
            <li> Overall not a bad cream, but not great.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount of this shaving cream goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use a shaving brush (highly recommended) with a small amount of Dreadnought, and with a smaller amount than other products, enjoy a slick lather that does not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; during the shave like other products.  </li>
            <li> The other major issue I had was that it makes my skin almost tacky while shaving.</li>
            <li> but I do like to try new shaving products once in a while to see what I&#x27;m missing.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, and the cream stung slightly after sitting on my skin for a moment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no scientist but as I understand it, Decelerine, over time, works within the hair follicles to eventually weaken new hair formation resulting in less dense, softer and generally  less noticeable facial hair.</li>
            <li> Combined with some pre shave oil, using a Merkur 180 long</li>
            <li> and whipped up a very sizeable amount of thick lather.</li>
            <li> Rich and thick with very little scent.</li>
            <li> You do not really need a cup anymore to create your foam, simple  add a bit on a wet shaving  brush and work it into your face.  </li>
            <li> That means this little bottle will last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I will find the lid loose and shaving cream all over the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wildly fond of the fragrance, but on the other hand, it is not offensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other shaving creams but holy cow!</li>
            <li> I usually get nor does it last as long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proraso Green tube, Proraso Red tube,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks</li>
            <li> but the biggest reason I stopped using this is a lot people who&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see if the Decelerine does what it says...</li>
            <li> Instructions say to work it into a lather, and maybe I&#x27;m just used to a faster shave--but after a minute and not much happening, I&#x27;ve concluded that it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> In that time I have tried a few different creams and soaps (proraso, omega, TOBS sandalwood soap, Col. conk bay rum, and cremo).</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a wet shaving fan, you should give Dreadnought shaving cream a try.</li>
            <li> Use a shaving mug and a wet shaving brush to make the lather&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Which meant any shaving cream left in the brush was now wasted.</li>
            <li> Not really my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent, certainly NOT flowery.</li>
            <li> I recently got tired of paying lots of money for garbage aerosol shaving creams that don&#x27;t actually help and just make a big mess.  </li>
            <li> Each small jar can last 45 days, if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Razor burn and cuts are a thing of past, unless I am late for work and in real hurry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> St. James shaving cream, which is a much bigger tub for a few dollars less than Dreadnought.</li>
            <li> Not interested in buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it consistently caused my skin to breakout.  </li>
            <li> For such a small tub they should be filling those things almost to the brim.</li>
            <li> usually shave every other day, and I plan to use a different cream of the three or four in my rotation for each shave.</li>
            <li> one side of my face had the lather drying before the other side was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every other brand I have purchased is jam packed with cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this issue with any other creams.</li>
            <li> Due to work schedule constraints  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, so be careful how much you use with each shave.  </li>
            <li> Received the item promptly but upon opening half the jar was empty and looked as if fingers had been in it.</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive for what you get (nothing bad, but nothing remarkable).  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to help the face.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Still expensive considering how much you get (100 mL)</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Will keep the cover off for a period and see if the smell tones down.</li>
            <li> Extremely responsive (within minutes!).</li>
            <li> I am a mid-50&#x27;s dark skinned white guy with a heavy beard infused with those tough grey beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> instructions on the bottle say to use an almond-sized dab on your brush, but I&#x27;ve found that about half that amount--</li>
            <li> This cream, while expensive for the jar size, is a high quality item.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li> a little on the pricey side for the amount you get</li>
            <li> The initial pull when shaving is fine, but follow up passes are awful because of the lack of lubricity.</li>
            <li> Quite a few shaves per jar, too.</li>
            <li> The brush allows you to work up a heavy lather and to spread it around evenly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like an old, downtown post office which smells like decades of stale cigar smoke!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> He has tried Art of Shaving and others but disliked the difficulty in ordering them.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work, my hair does seem a lil thinner and takes a few days to grow.</li>
            <li> Wastes a lot of water removing the whisker studded cream after I shave.  </li>
            <li> everyone else had a tub that was not completely filled?</li>
            <li> opinion is this shaving cream is not a value and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The jar is a little small</li>
            <li> Cremo is EXTREMELY slick but smells a little funky (citrus).</li>
            <li> I did however get a few extremely small nicks probably attributed to my lack of experience and using an aggressive razor/blade.</li>
            <li> After using for a couple years I&#x27;m still amazed how little is needed to produce thick soap.</li>
            <li> which doesn&#x27;t matter cause there is very little if any irritation.</li>
            <li> Very little smell, but</li>
            <li> Could not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> The razor slides along my skin like it never has before, no more bumps and nicks.  </li>
            <li> The tin is small.  </li>
            <li> I usually bowl-lather with this cream</li>
            <li> All I need is a small blog on the brush and it provides ample cream for two passes, if need be.</li>
            <li> Total Game changer!</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount and rub .  </li>
            <li> after virtually painting the lather on to my face, I got an unbelievably close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst skin you could imagine and this has done more to save my face than any prescription ever has.</li>
            <li> Boy this stuff lathers up thick and with very little product used.</li>
            <li> bad the seller wouldn&#x27;t offer a new jar or let me return what i bought.</li>
            <li> less expensive soaps/creams include Proraso (green tub soap) and Cella.</li>
            <li> I am sucker for trying shave creams, so i bought this when the price went south of $14 for a day.  </li>
            <li> Their response was defensive and rude in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another wasted $18!!  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously</li>
            <li> I got this to try because I was getting serious razor burn while shaving.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> The amount of cream for the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously this was made in the UK?  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the product contains no paraben which has proven to be nasty</li>
            <li> Not so heavy that it&#x27;s difficult to rinse from the razor.  </li>
            <li> Dreadnought is a shaving cream for a tough guy, I mean, it&#x27;s practically in the name and the label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proraso Shaving Cream for sometime and have not been disappointed with that brand, however I was recently introduced to Dreadnought while visiting some friends</li>
            <li> Like to say for tough hair, but with a badger brush, my skin has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> It is bad that one must pay this much for a shave but if need one to take care of razor irritation this may not be bad at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the box writing was generated off the island as the sentence structure is poor and the logic is non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Too bad you cannot test smell products like these before you waste your money!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with either although L&#x27;Occitane</li>
            <li> The only way to wet shave!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Fairly expensive per shave.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it comes from the UK</li>
            <li> Dreadnought shaving cream is a product that will go unappreciated by the casual shaver.</li>
            <li> So we&#x27;ll all use a &#x27;secret ingredient&#x27; on our face without a consideration of its impact, but paraben is bad?    </li>
            <li> Plus, totally devoid of the nasty chemical preservative Paraben.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s this s***e about paraben being bad because, in surfer parlance, &#x27;Dreadnought is also totally devoid of the thought to be possibly nasty chemical preservative Paraben&#x27;?  </li>
            <li> it shaving feels like I&#x27;m not using shaving cream at all which is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lathers well with a brush, but after sitting for a couple minutes, trying to get it to re-lather on the brush was impossible.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> but I hate having to put it on with the badger hair brush</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great what else can I say</li>
            <li> I liked the lather this cream produced. It was thick, luxurious, rich, and seemed to lubricate my face well. But there is some ingredient or chemical in this that didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. It felt irritated throughout the day. I have no allergies that I am aware, and I wouldn&#x27;t say my skin is overly sensitive, so I have to believe it is a chemical in the product.</li>
            <li> Rich and thick with very little scent. I like the small jar, which makes this product good for traveling. Quite a few shaves per jar, too.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to help the face.  Each small jar can last 45 days, if you are careful.</li>
            <li> A very good product. The shaving cream is great for sensitive skin. It also lathers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is occasionally when this comes in the packaging has been tampered with. I will find the lid loose and shaving cream all over the box. I highly recommend this product, but the packaging needs to be better.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream period!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great. You use a very very small amount on a brush and it creates great lather. One tub will last me 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very HIGH quality product. I have problems shaving.. this cream is AMAZING.... smells so goooooood....  love the smell.. the answer to my shaving problems because over the counter shaving creams and gels don&#x27;t help me much ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not worth the price.  I&#x27;ll go back to using my $1.50 gillette foamy.</li>
            <li> I use Geo F. Trumpers, Proraso, and other more traditionally scented shave creams, and I prefer the consistency and feel of Dreadnought Luxury Shaving Cream better than any other shave cream product I&#x27;ve tried.  I shave my face and head, and have tried many products in search of the ones that work.  I use a shaving brush (highly recommended) with a small amount of Dreadnought, and with a smaller amount than other products, enjoy a slick lather that does not &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; during the shave like other products.  The scent is &amp;#34;sporty,&amp;#34; and while I still enjoy traditional scents like coconut, almond, or sandalwood for my age (40), this scent is not too young for my taste (or my wife&#x27;s); it is a mild and clean scent.  Of note, this travels by air in a carry on bag in the US by meeting the 3.4oz liquids restriction imposed by the TSA.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It seems like the struggle is to find a shaving cream that preforms like the classics, but that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you&#x27;re 80 years old. This is that cream. Preforms just as well or better than TOBS, but yet smells great. Not overpowering and won&#x27;t make you smell like soap or an old man who&#x27;s been bathing in moth balls.</li>
            <li> good quality  nice scent</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  After using for a couple years I&#x27;m still amazed how little is needed to produce thick soap. Best shaving product I have ever used.  Arrived quickly.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting use to the whole badger hair brush and shaving thing, but I love the smell of this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Dreadnought is an excellent shave cream with a nice clean scent.  At $18 per 100ml, however, its vastly more expensive than comparable brands such as Truefitt and Hill, Geo. Trumper, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size of the jar makes it difficult to put the brush in without getting more cream than you had intended, making the jar disappear proportionately faster as well.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream ever. If you use this, you will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing. Makes the dry skin on my legs really soft. Smells great as well.</li>
            <li> All my life, I&#x27;ve shaved with canned shaving foam.  I decided, as I reached 44 years of age, that maybe I&#x27;d try something a little more &amp;#34;old school.&amp;#34;  However, I didn&#x27;t want to faff around with powders, so I looked around and decided to try Dreadnought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit that part of my choice was that this product is made by a British company (I&#x27;m an unabashed Anglophile) that doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously (I&#x27;m often called irreverent).  But I have to say that the product lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies well, forming a nice smooth lather on the face that is invigorating, but also quite soothing.  I use a brush to apply it, also from Dreadnought, and the two work very well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better shaves with this product than any other cream or foam I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Dreadnought has a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream period. You won&#x27;t get the best shave unless you also use a brush, and this jar will last you six months.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband the Dreadnought shaving kit for Christmas, and he is hooked! He said that he will never buy another disposable razor again! He loves Dreadnought products!</li>
            <li> A good shaving cream, that when rubbed onto your brush, gives a nice lather and a smooth shave, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of cream to achieve a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Not inexpensive, but with a good bristle brush and Harry&#x27;s razor/blades I am very pleased.  So very much better than what is available at the drug store, market, etc.</li>
            <li> Gives me a really nice shave. Better than shaving cream for sure.</li>
            <li> Nice thick lather. Good cushion. Great shave. Would recommend. Scent is citrus and herbal and very light. Not too flowery.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more of it. The jar is a little small so you don&#x27;t get many shaves out of it. Smells nice, lathers well.</li>
            <li> My better half has a bathroom full of shaving creams from piroso to nivea, and he says they are all better than this. But he really like the dreadnought post shave balm.</li>
            <li> Could not get past the smell. Tried it this morning. Shaved one side of my face and washed it off. In my opinion it was not citrusy as another reviewer commented but had a flower like scent to it. Not a keeper. Will keep the cover off for a period and see if the smell tones down.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and pleasant on the skin</li>
            <li> I have been on a search for several years now, looking for the best shaving cream.  Most recently I have been using Malin+Goetz Vitamin E shaving cream, and before that, Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream.  Both of these are among the best I have used in many years.  However, Dreadnought is now my ultimate.  The razor slides along my skin like it never has before, no more bumps and nicks.  Moreover, I am now able to get twice as many shaves from the same blade (I use feather blades in my DE razor).  The shave is the closest I have ever had and I have no trouble going 12 hours without a second shave on a long day.  Lest I forget, a significant secondary benefit is that the Dreadnought Cream is must lest costly than the last two I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount of this shaving cream goes a long way.  My skin feels super soft and smooth after every shave without any irritation.  It&#x27;s expensive, so be careful how much you use with each shave.  Follow the directions and use an \\&quot;almond size\\&quot; amount.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. A little goes a long way. I like it but just have a feeling there could be better stuff out there. Ah, still searching for the ultimate shave. Will have to try the English brands I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about next.</li>
            <li> Over hyped.  Too much product is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many more creams are a better value and better performer.  Stay away and try a different cream.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Great smell. A little on the expensive side, but as most of the other reviews explain, very little product is needed to produce a great lather.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.  It won&#x27;t lather with a brush or on my hand even with water.  When does go on my face soaks in within seconds and it shaving feels like I&#x27;m not using shaving cream at all which is very uncomfortable.  I am going back to my cheap store bought shaving cream that actually does something.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it helps my beard not grow as much.  It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding shaving cream.  It produces a lot of the rich, long-lasting lather that is essential for a good shave.  That&#x27;s really it.  The stuff works exactly like you&#x27;ve always hoped shaving cream would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the bottle say to use an almond-sized dab on your brush, but I&#x27;ve found that about half that amount-- maybe a pencil eraser-sized dab-- does the trick.  That means this little bottle will last a long, long time.  They claim 50 shaves, but based on how much I&#x27;ve used so far, I expect to get many more.  That, of course, makes the apparent high cost of a bottle justifiable.  On a per-shave basis, it&#x27;s a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be possible to use it without a shaving brush, but I think that would be far less satisfying.  The brush allows you to work up a heavy lather and to spread it around evenly.  Definitely buy a brush if you&#x27;re using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This is an EXCELLENT product that works exactly as it should.  I recommend it most highly.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used!  A perfect blend of ingredients.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth the cost over cheaper creams! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I recently got tired of paying lots of money for garbage aerosol shaving creams that don&#x27;t actually help and just make a big mess.  I did some reviewing online and kept coming across Dreadnought Shaving Cream.  After seeing the competitive price, I decided to try it out.  I use it with a badger-hair brush, though the tin says it&#x27;s ok to use with just your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you open the tin, you just smell the very fresh, clean scent of the cream.  It lathers up really well and, when paired with my brush, really does a good job getting in and around my facial hair.  I have been continuing to use my Gillette Fusion Proglide with this cream with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this cream to anyone looking to enhance their shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Read article evaluating several creams like this for the brush and thought I&#x27;d try it based on the writers recommendation. Have now re-ordered it a few times and am extremely satisfied with the product. Try it...you&#x27;ll like it. I did.</li>
            <li> I have used every shaving cream under the Sun and this one is great ! The price is great as well. I love the sent and how little you need to you for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and today was the first time I wasn&#x27;t red from the irritation. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone. AND for a luxury/premium shave cream it is super well priced</li>
            <li> Rich, smooth lather with a mild scent great for sensitive skin. I have tried several market competitors and for the money you just can&#x27;t beat it. Not interested in buying any other brand. Razor burn and cuts are a thing of past, unless I am late for work and in real hurry. But even then it&#x27;s almost unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip, I use Aveeno&#x27;s and L&#x27;Occitane aftershave balms both are great, not greasy although L&#x27;Occitane &amp;#62; Aveeno. Smooth skin, feels baby soft for hours, soothing to the skin if cuts or razor burns. Can&#x27;t go wrong with either although L&#x27;Occitane it&#x27;s suppose to be all organic but I have had a great experience with Aveeno.</li>
            <li> this shaving cream allows mistake free shaving.  It is smooth and I never cut myself.  It leaves my face feeling smooth. Closest shave I have had in years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proraso and Art of shaving, and Dreadnought holds up really well. You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get a rice, creamy lather, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving cream because of the good reviews. When I put it on my face felt burning while I was shaving. After the shave my face kept burning for awhile. I have many creams and soaps and never experienced this. Would not buy or use again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other shaving creams but holy cow! This is the best! I can&#x27;t tell you how smooth and wonderful my skin feels after shaving. I will definitely continue using this brand!!!!</li>
            <li> Another wasted $18!!  It may be an effective soap, but the aroma is repulsive!&lt;br /&gt;It smells like an old, downtown post office which smells like decades of stale cigar smoke!&lt;br /&gt;And that smell will linger on your face for hours!  I will not buy another DREADNAUGHT  product!  Too bad you cannot test smell products like these before you waste your money!</li>
            <li> Smooth shave. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This has been the best product for my skin...does not dry out, smooth finish, smells good, has reduced the razor burn as well...Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am just getting back into shaving with a safety razor and am really enjoying the experience.  I am a mid-50&#x27;s dark skinned white guy with a heavy beard infused with those tough grey beard hairs.  I love the renaissance movement among young men as well as us experienced guys of returning to classic shaving with a  real razor!  This cream, while expensive for the jar size, is a high quality item. One website I found rated it as the #1 shaving cream.  Combined with some pre shave oil, using a Merkur 180 long handle razor, and finishing with the Dreadnought post shave balm, I have experienced the closest shave I have enjoyed in years.  I actually find myself rubbing my face throughout the day.  I feel well groomed, and after adding some classic after shave, it&#x27;s a great experience.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but easily the best overall shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.  Excellent viscosity, non-irritating, pleasant manly-to-neutral scent.</li>
            <li> This being my first foray into this type of shaving cream I must say it is very pleasant to use.  Lathers well and leaves my face with a very close shave. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> From all the shaving reviews about what shaving cream to use, this ranks #1. I purchased a brush and case to mix and whala...an awesome shave!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream and a little goes a long ways. with my brush and bowl I can easily whip up 3 applications using an almond size dollop</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas as he was looking for a higher end shaving cream that was still reasonably priced and easy to find.  He has tried Art of Shaving and others but disliked the difficulty in ordering them.  This cream is better than those and located on Amazon!  It smells wonderful and feels so light but delivers a great shave!</li>
            <li> Dreadnought is a shaving cream for a tough guy, I mean, it&#x27;s practically in the name and the label. Really, this cream is silky smooth and easy to work up into a good lather. I&#x27;ve been using it with a brush and you really don&#x27;t need much at all to cover your beard. This is a really great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how good the reviews are. It gives me an alright shave, but no better than a good supermarket aerosol cream. I tried both by hand and with a good shaving brush. Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream is nice,  lathers up well.  The smell is not notable or strong.  The tin is small.  Somewhat expensive for what you get (nothing bad, but nothing remarkable).  Overall not a bad cream, but not great.</li>
            <li> Great product lathers well use very little so it does last very long time would recommend it to anybody who wants a good shave</li>
            <li> Great for legs. There is a light tingling, but that is the product activating. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve tried this one</li>
            <li> I got this to try because I was getting serious razor burn while shaving.  I had tried just about everything.  This works really well and has cut down on my razor burn quite a bit.  It doesn&#x27;t smell really &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m sure it would work great on men as well.  I got a shaving brush too - and it seems like a pain, but it really does work better.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this shaving cream many years ago. Talk about a very close shave when using this cream with a brush. WOW is all I can say. I also use it on my head and again WOW. Nothing but great things to say about it. I will never use the aerosol cans again. Dreadnought is the only way to shave. If you use this cream, Harry&#x27;s Razors and a good badger brush you will be amazed at the closeness of the shave. You could take it a step further and use a Merkur 34c. Dreadnought...... The only way to wet shave!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  The most lubricating of all creams and soaps that I&#x27;ve tried, at a very premium price.  I&#x27;m not wildly fond of the fragrance, but on the other hand, it is not offensive.  Excellent product, overall...</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this product!</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely smooth and I&#x27;m always receiving compliments on the scent. A little goes a long way, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the JAck Black I usually get nor does it last as long</li>
            <li> It is ok, I have used better</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shaving cream on the market have tried numerous others but this one is way beyond them all..A GREAT PURCHASE..</li>
            <li> This is a quality shaving cream.  It creates a thick, rick lather when combined with a shaving brush, and provides a smooth and comfortable shave. Unfortunately for me, it consistently caused my skin to breakout.  I tried giving it a couple of weeks to see if my skin just needed to get used to it, but eventually ended up going back to my old standby, Proraso.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have known from the marketing copy, but the scent is very ah, manly, in a dudebro sort of way. Think clubs and asymmetric t-shirt designs featuring skulls and angel&#x27;s wings. In addition, it lingers, and I can still smell it on my face an hour after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and the cream stung slightly after sitting on my skin for a moment. I suppose it must have been the Decelerine doing its thing all over my face, but it wasn&#x27;t especially pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave itself, I was impressed - the cream brushes on very well, the blade glided without effort, and my face was soft and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus the stingy bits and scent, I&#x27;d continue using Dreadnought, but as it is, this one is being shelved after the one use.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely OK but is overpriced for what it is. Nice scent, good lather but $18.00? seriously. there are plenty of creams for a great wet shave for half the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaving cream.  The seller was also great, fast shipping and good pricing.</li>
            <li> The best on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proraso Shaving Cream for sometime and have not been disappointed with that brand, however I was recently introduced to Dreadnought while visiting some friends (I wasn&#x27;t able to pack my tube of Proraso due to TSA barriers) and was delighted with the results. It is just a bit softer than the tube cream and packs a truly rich cushion of lather so that I hardly feel the blade anymore but never the less obtain an excellent, smooth, nick-free shave. I used just my hands while traveling but using a shaving cup and brush at home produced an outstanding lather that I wasn&#x27;t able to obtain with my hands alone. The jar contains just over 3 oz so that I can now carry it along in my travel bag. As good as Proraso is, Dreadnought beats it hands-down.</li>
            <li> I just got some of this shaving cream as a gift and from the first shave I noticed its quality. I use a DE safety razor and badger brush. It feels great on my face, leaves it very moisturized, prevents almost all irritation and smells great. I&#x27;ve tried Proraso Green tube, Proraso Red tube, Colonel Conks Bay Rum shave soap (not very good), and Taylor of Old Bond Street St. James shaving creams and Dreadnought gives me the best shave so far. However, there are three drawbacks in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first is that you don&#x27;t get very much and it&#x27;s expensive. I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget. I also just got a tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street (aka TOBS) St. James shaving cream, which is a much bigger tub for a few dollars less than Dreadnought. TOBS is a great cream as well, although I get a little more irritation with it than I do with Dreadnought. The tub of TOBS will last a long time because it doesn&#x27;t take much cream for each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second drawback is that the recommended almond size dollop of Dreadnought is barely enough for my three passes. The same size dollop of Proraso gives me more lather. I had to add a little bit of TOBS to my brush this morning on my third pass to make a decent lather to finish with. This just means that if I use enough Dreadnought to get a good lather for three passes I&#x27;ll go through the already small tub even faster. Another plus for the TOBS cream over Dreadnought is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to make a lot of lather. Just a few swishes of the brush over the TOBS cream and you&#x27;re good to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final drawback is that the small tub came only about 2/3 to 3/4 full. For such a small tub they should be filling those things almost to the brim. Frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shave every other day, and I plan to use a different cream of the three or four in my rotation for each shave. So they should all last me quite a while. However, the TOBS is the better deal for the money. I think if you can either get Dreadnought as a gift or keep it in a rotation with other creams so it can last longer, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it as my only shaving cream because of the cost.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is good, builds a nice lather and all, but that&#x27;s about it. It has pretty much no scent, but if that&#x27;s what you want than great. I was expecting more for the money. Especially when I can get a bit more Taylor of old Bond street or Geo. F. Trumpers for less money, each with a nice lather and a distinct scent.</li>
            <li> A good product, but I find I enjoy a soap puck better.  Fairly expensive per shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream for those who use a shaving brush. I usually bowl-lather with this cream but I have also used it to face lather while traveling. In both cases I had a thick lather that maintained a good texture without collapsing during my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dreadnought cream has a neutral soapy scent that does not linger beyond the actual shave. In my book this is a good characteristic since it means that I do not need to be concerned about my shaving cream scent mixing/clashing with my deodorant or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to using a double-edge razor, this has become my daily go-to shaving cream. It is dependable, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff kind of burns when you leave it on your face, so I assume that&#x27;s the product working. It smells ok, kind of like a spicy citrus with a hint of mint smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks and it seems to work, my hair does seem a lil thinner and takes a few days to grow. So I assume its doing its job as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad but the biggest reason I stopped using this is a lot people who&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years don&#x27;t think the ingredients are too safe. So this got me weary, especially because this is the only shaving cream that burns/tingles when left on your face for a minute. So that&#x27;s probably not the best sign. So it&#x27;s up to your discretion.</li>
            <li> I combine this with TBS Macca Root shaving cream.  Close shave, moisturized face, great scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering!  This is good stuff, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma to it, lather nicely as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, smells great, works as advertised.  Like to say for tough hair, but with a badger brush, my skin has cleared up.  Dump the Gillette.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product delivered promply in good condition.  Just a small dab on your brush gives you lots of lather and a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Tried it once, too much residue on my razor for my tastes.  Wastes a lot of water removing the whisker studded cream after I shave.  For the price, get Harry&#x27;s gel foam......at half the price, better shave, no residue. You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best shaving creams I have used.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little of the product on the brush to shave,&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use to much and waste a lot.The only bad thing is,&lt;br /&gt;the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; I have some other expensive creams in my cabinet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this one yielded the smoothest shave with my straight razor (to date). I&#x27;m curious to see if the Decelerine does what it says... I typically rotate my creams, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use this one for a month straight and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I don&#x27;t use this, I find it hard to resist cracking it open and smelling it; fresh and invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have TOBS Eton, Trumper&#x27;s coconut and T&amp;H 1805 as my &#x27;top-shelf&#x27; creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My less expensive soaps/creams include Proraso (green tub soap) and Cella.</li>
            <li> Neutral smell, excellet lather.  A good choice if you do not need or want the extra smell of typical shaving cream. Geat for all over shave, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for an alternative to Barbasol. Packaging is excellent, and it smells great. Can&#x27;t get it to foam up without using a lot of it, though. Instructions say to work it into a lather, and maybe I&#x27;m just used to a faster shave--but after a minute and not much happening, I&#x27;ve concluded that it&#x27;s not for me. I&#x27;ve seen other positive reviews, so it&#x27;s very possible I&#x27;m not the target. It works, but didn&#x27;t lather well for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  Pure foamy magic.</li>
            <li> Suds up great. Use with a brush for best longevity. A little dab will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions and follow for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Nice aroma and tingle as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;More of a shaving soap than a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it.</li>
            <li> Great product and all, though upon opening it up for the first time, it already looked as though a third of the product was already gone. Need more than this to justify $24.00 purchase of shaving cream, fellas. - JS</li>
            <li> Good viscosity, quite expensive but it lasts. It works as well or better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream - froths up nicely, clean and classic smell.  Will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a safety razor (about 3 months). In that time I have tried a few different creams and soaps (proraso, omega, TOBS sandalwood soap, Col. conk bay rum, and cremo). My go to has been preshave with cremo followed by mix of proraso and cremo. Cremo is EXTREMELY slick but smells a little funky (citrus). When i first opened dreadnought, it smelled so good i was determined to use with it without mixing it with cremo. I got an extremely close shave with my (new) merkur slant with feather blade in only 2 passes (WTG, XTG). I did however get a few extremely small nicks probably attributed to my lack of experience and using an aggressive razor/blade. I never nick myself with cremo/proraso but it takes me 3 passes and I don&#x27;t get as close. I have only been using dreadnought for 3 days and have fallen in love. The shave is extremely close and the scent is so good i refuse to use an aftershave balm (until i receive the dreadnought aftershave) which doesn&#x27;t matter cause there is very little if any irritation. This is will be my go to cream due to the excellent scent and close shave. If I could find a cologne that matched this scent I&#x27;d be very happy.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I have used!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. The lather builds quickly and holds up well. Very little smell, but what smell there is is very pleasant. Razor glides over face very easily with this cream.</li>
            <li> A great scent and absolutely &amp;#34;goodness&amp;#34; shave cream.  One of my favorites!  Very reasonably priced with great results!!  Plus, totally devoid of the nasty chemical preservative Paraben.</li>
            <li> Bought it twice and will buy again.  One jar lasts about a month.  Absolutely great product goes on well with a badger hair brush.  I use Harry&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> just a dab is all you need to get a rich lather going.  Lubricates well, no odoriferous smell.  Simply one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave; I use the Escali brush and one almond size dollop of this stuff is enough to lather twice. I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> Dreadnough&#x27;s shaving cream is great! No nicks, no razor burns, just a close, clean shave. If that isn&#x27;t good enough, the company selling Dreadnought was a pleasure to deal with. Extremely responsive (within minutes!). After using shaving cream in a can for years this is my new favorite and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2VW0DIMK72VGG]]I&#x27;ve got my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; shaving creams that I use all the time but I do like to try new shaving products once in a while to see what I&#x27;m missing. I was offered a sample of the new-to-the-USA Dreadnought Shaving Cream and welcomed the opportunity to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreadnought is a UK based company and have just started selling their stuff in the USA. Their premium shaving cream is delivered in a small 100ml container with a screw top as opposed to a tube. It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the product contains no paraben which has proven to be nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim to fame of this shaving cream is their patented \\&quot;secret\\&quot; ingredient, Decelerine. I&#x27;m no scientist but as I understand it, Decelerine, over time, works within the hair follicles to eventually weaken new hair formation resulting in less dense, softer and generally  less noticeable facial hair. Decelerine also provides a gentle moisturizing effect to the skin so it&#x27;s sort of like a shaving cream and after shave balm all wrapped up into one product. I have a fairly light and sparse beard so I&#x27;ve not noticed any noticeable difference in the month or so that I&#x27;ve been using the product but it does take a while for the effect to be noticed according to the information I received from Dreadnought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an almond sized dab is needed to create a nice rich lather. I didn&#x27;t find it quite as full a lather as I get from some other products but it was decent and smelled great. Not too frou frou, but just a nice clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t give this stuff away but it is a premium shaving cream after all and comes all the way from the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a wet shaving fan, you should give Dreadnought shaving cream a try. You might like it as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 8/26/2012 - I do not use this cream every time I shave, but when I do, I definitely notice a moisturizing effect on my skin that lasts hours, if not all day. It&#x27;s almost as if I had used an after shave balm or light after shaving cream on my face. I noticed one reviewer mentioned his face broke out after using it and maybe it&#x27;s that moisturizing effect. For me, I like it. I&#x27;ve not had any issues using it and I&#x27;ve actually had better experience with the cream by lathering it up directly on my face using a brush. All I need is a small blog on the brush and it provides ample cream for two passes, if need be.or light after shaving cream on my face.

            <li> This is not the average old school shave creme there is cool science here! This old school type shave creme uses technology that will thin the stubble the more you use it. Again use a proper razor, either a straight razor or a safety razor, or you will just plug up the modern crappy razors this is maybe the most expensive of the best shave cremes but a little goes a long way, it gives a closer and closer shave the more you use it! I like this one</li>
            <li> After being offered a sample to try from Dreadnought USA (known as Bluebeards Revenge in UK) I jumped at the oppertunity. I have a large rotation of creams and soaps, and love trying out new ones all the time. I used this for a complete week and WOW! I lathers easily, has great cusion and glide, and left my face feeling new and moisturized. Their customer service is top notch and shipping was fast. I highly recomend this premium product and will definitly keep a jar of it in my shaving rotation (and look forward to trying there other products).</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream.  Lathers quickly with minimal effort.  Works well with any kind of brush (boar, badger, horsehair).  Provides a nice rich lather that does a great job of protecting the skin while shaving.  Not so heavy that it&#x27;s difficult to rinse from the razor.  Rinses easily from the brush.</li>
            <li> After the reviews, I expected a bit more. Lather is nice but you need about 2X to 3X the amount they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;I used it exactly according to instructions and one side of my face had the lather drying before the other side was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this will work well if you do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Use about 2X the \\&quot;almond sized\\&quot; amount suggested by the directions&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a shaving mug and a wet shaving brush to make the lather&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply the lather liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do the above, it will work about as well as Edge Gel albeit at the expense of more effort and greater cost. One advantage to&lt;br /&gt;using it is you have enough lather to go over an area a second time if required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Works well but is more time consuming and more expensive than other products that will work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use it up and return to using Edge Gel as it is quicker and cheaper and just as good, shave-wise</li>
            <li> Nice scent, very clean and manly. Lathers up good with a brush and provides decent lubrication, but not as good IMO as T&amp;H, Trumpers or TOBS. What turned me off was that the tub was not fully packed. There was a considerable amount of cream &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34;, the air pocket was visible from outsider the tub. The tub claims to hold 100 ml (3.38 oz) - is there 100 ml in there ? Every other brand I have purchased is jam packed with cream. I paid $18 for the 3.38 oz. T&amp;H was $31 for 6.7 oz and the tub was completely filled. Considering dreadnought is just OK and actually more expensive than T&amp; H  I probably will not be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has everyone else had a tub that was not completely filled? Big PR problem for the manufacturer - either fill it completly or get a smaller tub.</li>
            <li> I have a rough face that is hard to shave, this is like a miracle to me, I love to shave with this! Total Game changer!</li>
            <li> Do not waste time reading this or looking at other products, just try it. You will love it. I did.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have used. My skin is pretty sensitive and I have had almost no nicks since using this with my Merkur Futur with Feather blades. Unfortunately it comes from the UK so it is overpriced, but I&#x27;ll probably get more anyway.</li>
            <li> This cream smells great and whips up a nice lather, but that&#x27;s about all the praise I have. I can&#x27;t use it more than two days in a row without getting a bunch of ingrowns. I haven&#x27;t had this issue with any other creams. The amount of cream for the price is ridiculous. I have a new paperweight in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Dreadnought shaving cream is a product that will go unappreciated by the casual shaver. However, for those few who pursue the ancient and noble art of shaving in the manly fashion of a proper gentleman with a straight razor will find that it enhances an everyday experience and makes it transcend to the realm of relaxation and tranquility. I have used dreadnought many times and I have discovered that it both soothes the skin and softens the beard so that you will have the fastest and smoothest shave in a style reminiscent of those classic shaves delivered by an experienced barber. To quote Beadle Bamford:&amp;#34; the fastest smoothest shave is the winner&amp;#34; and with that in mind only a winner shaves with dreadnought</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is very good but falls short of great.  It does produce a good lather, but with me, at least,&lt;br /&gt;the lather requires two almond size dollops, not just one.  Also it does not produce as good a lather as Taylor&lt;br /&gt;of Old Bond Street, which is my favorite. However, if you are going to be traveling, this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> Received this today- the middle is hollowed out- imagine a donut with a glaze on top hiding the hole.  Paid for 100 ml of shaving cream, not a100 ml container with 30 ml of cream.  Ripoff!</li>
            <li> I am sucker for trying shave creams, so i bought this when the price went south of $14 for a day.  Still expensive considering how much you get (100 mL) First off, great business plan.  Claim the stuff will make shaving easier after months of use.  By the time most people have achieved that duration, most nascent DE shavers will be skilled enough that everything seems easier (of they have gone back to cartridge).    Now read the packaging.  Seriously this was made in the UK?  I think the box writing was generated off the island as the sentence structure is poor and the logic is non-existent.  Don&#x27;t trust me - see for yourself in the attached pic.    What&#x27;s this s***e about paraben being bad because, in surfer parlance, &#x27;Dreadnought is also totally devoid of the thought to be possibly nasty chemical preservative Paraben&#x27;?  So we&#x27;ll all use a &#x27;secret ingredient&#x27; on our face without a consideration of its impact, but paraben is bad?    The stuff works fine.  For the money, I go for GFT or T&amp;H over this stuff.  They should really consider dropping the nonsensical dribble on the box</li>
            <li> Decent shave. Not worth the price. Co Bigelow is cheaper and much better. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The DREADNOUGHT products are outstanding. Wonderful lather softens whiskers and creates excellent surface if using a straight razor. DE shavers will find it superior also. Smells great and has nice texture. If you&#x27;re into straight razor shaving, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> Very good modern scent and lathers like no other best I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Received the item promptly but upon opening half the jar was empty and looked as if fingers had been in it. Appears to me this was a return item and had been used. Won&#x27;t order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I contacted the seller, requested a return,and received the below reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We do not open our products or put fingers in the items. The product settled during shipment from England, to Chicago, to New york and the its final destination.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First i didn&#x27;t accuse them of opening the product or putting fingers in it. I can agree that items settle during shipment but the jar i received was half full. So basically i am assuming for $19 you get a jar half full. Not seeing the value in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad the seller wouldn&#x27;t offer a new jar or let me return what i bought. Their response was defensive and rude in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is this shaving cream is not a value and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I shave 5 days out of 7 and this stuff lasts for 6 months.  It has a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent, certainly NOT flowery. You do NOT need a brush to apply.  Just use a small amount and rub .  It will foam up creating a very rich lather. All of the packaging for this item can be recycled.</li>
            <li> This is the best all around shaving cream you can buy and has the best reviews anywhere you that you read on the web.Need I say more? I will never go back to a lesser shaving product!</li>
            <li> It is bad that one must pay this much for a shave but if need one to take care of razor irritation this may not be bad at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star because  I am still looking for that perfect one</li>
            <li> I have many scents and this one is my favorite.  I have many of the grandpa scents as well as the mints,  limes,  bay rums (this sucks btw.)  I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Boy this stuff lathers up thick and with very little product used. Creates a creamy, pleasant smelling lather, that has excellent glide, and left my skin feeling soft and clean. I don&#x27;t know if I buy into the sales pitch regarding the additive that decreases beard growth, but as a shaving cream I was impressed. Price is a bit high, but not outrageously so for the quality.</li>
            <li> Forms a very rich lather when used with either my boar bristle or badger brush. Nice fresh scent but defiantly not overpowering.this is one of the better shaving creams I&#x27;ve used. I like it as well as or maybe even better than Taylor of Old Bond Street creams.</li>
            <li> TLDR; Nowhere near as good as Duke Cannon&#x27;s shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Duke Cannon shaving cream for over a year now and kept hearing about Dreadnought. Bought some, tried it out and initial impressions were promising. Lathers up really nice, smells good (albeit the scent is too strong for my preferences). However, some things I don&#x27;t like became obvious as I started shaving. This stuff lathers well with a brush, but after sitting for a couple minutes, trying to get it to re-lather on the brush was impossible. Which meant any shaving cream left in the brush was now wasted. I like to re-lather several times as I shave, and that means cleaning my brush and re-applying more product in this case. The other major issue I had was that it makes my skin almost tacky while shaving. The initial pull when shaving is fine, but follow up passes are awful because of the lack of lubricity. After shaving with this for a week I tried out my Duke Cannon shave cream again to compare and it&#x27;s not even a competition. Duke cannon wins.</li>
            <li> Lathers well with a shaving brush.  I have sensitive skin and it allows the razor to work smoothly with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Having researched this cream for about 2 weeks, I finally pulled the trigger.  Upon opening the lid for the first time, I noticed a light, clean, fresh laundry scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lather:  Using my Parker shaving brush, I lightly covered the bristle tips with the cream.  I used my Fine Accoutrements shaving bowl (with anti-static technology *wink*) and whipped up a very sizeable amount of thick lather. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much lather so little cream was  capable of making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave: after virtually painting the lather on to my face, I got an unbelievably close shave.  The slickness that the cream provided was top notch.  I was able to take 3 easy passes across my face with absolutely no irritation.  I could have skipped using an aftershave, because my face was so felt so healthy and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about pulling the trigger on this shaving cream, just do it.  I know the price is a little high, but this jar should last you about 2 months (50 shaves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, you deserve a top notch shaving cream!</li>
            <li> Not really my cup of tea. The shaving cream works well but I hate having to put it on with the badger hair brush I bought separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just stick with me Value brand white foam in a can</li>
            <li> History:&lt;br /&gt;About 1 year ago I switched tio DE shaving and will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup:&lt;br /&gt;I use DE Razor with Astra  Superior Platinum Blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priort to Dreadnought I tried several shaving creams:&lt;br /&gt;1) Proraso Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;2) Taylor of Old Bond Street&lt;br /&gt;3) L&#x27;Occitane CADE Shaving Cream for Men, 5.2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff  worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;1) You do not really need a cup anymore to create your foam, simple  add a bit on a wet shaving  brush and work it into your face.  It foams really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;2) Due to work schedule constraints  I do not take showers prior to shaving , this stuff works great without shower -- no cuts/no irritations.&lt;br /&gt;3) I have sensitive skin and used to have irritation all the time, once I started using this stuff  no irritation at all</li>
            <li> Have been using this since before it was called Dreadnought (BB Revenge). It is easily the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It foams well, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, and it has no irritants in it. I have the worst skin you could imagine and this has done more to save my face than any prescription ever has.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Always good to good, close shave. Will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> This cream smells fantastic, lathers fantastic, goes on smooth and thick. Great addition to the rotation! Really glad I tried it out. Check out YouTube demonstrations on it, too.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I got this I love it and my wife loves the smell</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products and this is the best shaving cream I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great Scent&lt;br /&gt;- Nice protective lather&lt;br /&gt;-  Close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a little on the pricey side for the amount you get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, but also use Proraso on a regular basis due to the price.  This is the best stuff overall.  Proraso is the best for the price.</li>
            <li> This Shaving Cream is great, very rich smooth and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome best shave cream I have ever used.</li>
