            <li>Yes, some peoples eyes are more sensitive and might tear up.</li>
            <li>This product helped me so much it was easy and the instructions are very informative.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and very lightly colored eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It looked so funny and needed to darken it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;07/06/15 I always like reading a positive follow up because it means people felt strongly about the product to log back in. !</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has last up to a month</li>

            <li>My aesthetician said to leave hers on as long as possible, color will fix better, I guess.</li>
            <li>i used the natural black, it colored my eyelashes by 70% i would need to reapply one more time..</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and definitely darkens your lashes and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Just adding a tip-I&#x27;ve  found that using those little dental picks that have small teeth is a great way to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a ginger - a busy one at that - and have sensitive</li>
            <li>and I must not be the sensitive type.</li>
            <li>It burns a bit when washing off but no more than soap in the eye does, and it stops quickly.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t need to much mascara because they are already black.</li>

            <li> Have to be extremely careful not to get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Directions tell you eyes must be closed for the 10 minute period that the dye sits to color lashes.</li>
            <li> As long as you use common sense, don&#x27;t rub them or get them wet, this product is the same consistency</li>
            <li> product would not blend so there were lumps...not black, more like an ugly gray.  </li>
            <li> The color was dark and made a noticeable difference in my eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes dark without the clumping of mascara.</li>
            <li> This product does burn the eyes a little</li>
            <li> I was a little leery after reading the directions.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few applications included</li>

            <li> Not very good!</li>
            <li> Sorry JoAnne, I&#x27;m lost to you as a lash tinting client.</li>
            <li> SOoooooo difficult to use!</li>
            <li> I am still crazy about this product!</li>
            <li> very disappointing</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I really like this product.  It looks amazing for a little under a month, but no worries there is plenty to apply again and again.  It burns a bit when washing off but no more than soap in the eye does, and it stops quickly. Love this!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So, I naturally have dark brown hair..meaning my lashes and brows are dark already. Unfortunatly, recently I was bleaching my hair and some strands around my face touched my brows and lashes during the process. It looked so funny and needed to darken it. This product helped me so much it was easy and the instructions are very informative. I did get a tiny tiny bit in my eye by accident but it didnt sting like i thought it would, it felt like as if u got soap in ur eye. (Prob even more gentle then that). Anyway honestly my lashes have never looked fuller and darker before. When I washed it off and let it dry it looked like I had mascara on. It was amazing. I highley recommend this product. It&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve done and I have no complaints. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> This eyelash dye works great!!! I mixed it as directed and then applied using a disposable, clean mascara brush, I coated the lashes repeatedly and let sit for ten minutes. The color is great, better than results I have had from a salon. There are quite a few applications included so I assume this will last for awhile. I will definitely buy more when I need it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great. Love that I look like I have eyelashes now. Mine are so blonde that without makeup you can&#x27;t tell they are there. Now I don&#x27;t need to much mascara because they are already black. This product does burn the eyes a little but I think its the fumes or something from being so close to the eye. Its not horribly painful just uncomfortable. Have to be extremely careful not to get it in your eyes. I did watch several YouTube videos before doing this. I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This eyelash color was remarkably easy to apply. Was not irritating to my eyes at all. The color was dark and made a noticeable difference in my eyelashes and eyebrows. Now I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara. Will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Works great and really easy to apply yourself!</li>
            <li> This product burned my eyes although I followed the instructions. Not very good!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Very satisfied with the results and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Darkened my lashes on the first try!!!!</li>
            <li> horrible product!  product would not blend so there were lumps...not black, more like an ugly gray.  very disappointing</li>
            <li> This is amazing!! Did it with contacts in and eyes open. No stinging and the result is amazing. So much better than Swiss o par. Worth the price difference x 10. P I used natural black. I want to try blue black next. Fabulous.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has last up to a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for several years. I have been happy with the results, and I did a bunch of research and it appears many others also find this one of the best products on the market.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.... great color.... last for a long while. Highly recommended for anyone with blond or white eyelashes who are tired of applying alot of mascara.</li>
            <li> i used the natural black, it colored my eyelashes by 70% i would need to reapply one more time.. The applicator was hard to apply on lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a ginger - a busy one at that - and have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried and loved the first time!! A week later and I haven&#x27;t worn mascara at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 minutes every 4 weeks or so - stings when washing off... but otherwise no daily chemicals! And other than the sting initially - no other side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY customer</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and definitely darkens your lashes and lasts a long time. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have red hair and very lightly colored eyelashes. The Natural Black 1000Hour works great! It makes your lashes dark without the clumping of mascara. I recommend using Vaseline around your eyes to protect the skin from being tinted.</li>
            <li> After having my lashes done at a salon for years, I then tried home tinting with Roux, worked but  it was a little bit more difficult to put on. I bought Natural Black, I have streaked brown hair and blue eyes. The color is just dark enough to look like I have mascara on, but not oddly black. This product is very similar to the product my aesthetician uses. I was a little leery after reading the directions. Yes, do be carful applying. Yes, some peoples eyes are more sensitive and might tear up. I have no problems with getting things in close to my eyes and I must not be the sensitive type. Directions tell you eyes must be closed for the 10 minute period that the dye sits to color lashes. I still have mine on after 45 minutes, and I don&#x27;t plan to take it off until I shower later this morning. My aesthetician said to leave hers on as long as possible, color will fix better, I guess. As long as you use common sense, don&#x27;t rub them or get them wet, this product is the same consistency and I&#x27;m leaving it on as long as possible@&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/06/15 I always like reading a positive follow up because it means people felt strongly about the product to log back in. !000 Hour is truly the closest I&#x27;ve come to recreating at home a salon visit eyelash tinting. My lashes have held the color after 2 weeks. Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2/16 I am still crazy about this product! Sorry JoAnne, I&#x27;m lost to you as a lash tinting client. Just adding a tip-I&#x27;ve  found that using those little dental picks that have small teeth is a great way to apply. It also helps to combine the peroxide and tint. I use a small shot glass, I find I have a much easier time combining the two. If you&#x27;ve mixed the amounts properly, it will go on evenly and the bristles help separate and coat the lash well. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> SOoooooo difficult to use! I did not like it!</li>
