            <li>My sons love both polo that was purchase from this site ..</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find this size bottle many places</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>

            <li>I am going to buy one more as soon as I am out of this one.</li>
            <li>The product came promptly in appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li>and I love the shell also.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes</li>
            <li>I love love love the smell on my husband.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, dont want anything else.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and been questioned where did I get this cologne- such a great smelling cologne for a very cheap price compared to big box stores!</li>
            <li>Polo Blue at a Good price</li>
            <li>&quot; actually they said smell - but they meant it in a good way.</li>
            <li>I can wear this scent as a woman and it smells fresh and clean not flowery or musky.</li>
            <li>This cologne shipped quickly and with no damage.  </li>
            <li>Polo Blue perfume spray, I totally love the smell of it , it stays on me  for alil more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always what I go back to when it&#x27;s time to buy more.</li>
            <li>They are colognes that I use daily so I can keep the ones that I really love longer.</li>
            <li>not that he wants to!</li>
            <li>After all, all colognes are pretty much subjective...</li>
            <li>Have used it in the past and is still as good as ever.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very unsatisfied</li>
            <li>This is not the real POLO cologne.....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the real deal...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li>Or it may be that it ain&#x27;t the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product, however, seemed to be much \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; than many previous purchases.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to have that day-long effect of the older bottles I have.  </li>
            <li>It may be that I&#x27;m getting older.  </li>
            <li>Although the product may have been \\&quot;normal strength\\</li>
            <li>I believe this to be very old, or a counterfeit.</li>
            <li>azz\\&quot; the old bottles had.  </li>
            <li>shipped fast, big bottle.</li>
            <li>but...this apparently is not the REAL thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked it.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li>It required a larger application and certainly did not last as long as the other products I used.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately this product is not genuine&lt;br /&gt;I am very unsatisfied&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon gift cards make great gifts for all occasions.  My son received the gift card within minutes on his e-mail after ordering it.  Plan to continue to use Amazon Gift cards</li>
            <li> This is not the real POLO cologne..... It&#x27;s an imposter, I have used this cologne for years and it&#x27;s not the real deal...Do not buy this product. Extremely disappointed that this shipped direct from AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I tried to use other colognes, but people always commented about &amp;#34;my scent,&amp;#34;. People identify this great cologne as &amp;#34;mine&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and been questioned where did I get this cologne- such a great smelling cologne for a very cheap price compared to big box stores!</li>
            <li> I can wear this scent as a woman and it smells fresh and clean not flowery or musky. Great clean scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT AND SELLER!!&lt;br /&gt;Do explain why you liked or disliked it.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li> Love the Polo, great price from what I was paying at Dillard&#x27;s, looks like I will smell great for a while. Polo Blue is my fav of all their line but it was the price that brought me to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used it in the past and is still as good as ever.  Will buy it again when this is used up</li>
            <li> This cologne shipped quickly and with no damage.  You can&#x27;t find this size bottle many places so I&#x27;m happy to have found here.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite perfume. He is in love with it. I never used it but now like it too and so does my in-laws. I am going to buy one more as soon as I am out of this one.</li>
            <li> Last Christmas I was given a gift. Polo Blue perfume spray, I totally love the smell of it , it stays on me  for alil more than 8 hours. That&#x27;s why I bought a 4.2 Oz bigger than my gift. But, I&#x27;m disappointed the scent/concentration is NOT as good as I thought, maybe a knock off but I couldn&#x27;t prove that. Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow me to return it because of flammable liquids, SUCK for me I&#x27;m OUT $60.00 lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Just was not what I thought it would be.  the scent does not stay very long.  I guess it will be one that I put into my work colognes.  They are colognes that I use daily so I can keep the ones that I really love longer.</li>
            <li> The serial number on the bottle and box don&#x27;t match. The scent holds for maybe 45 minutes. I believe this to be very old, or a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I received this promptly and am very satisfied with this price and product. I would recommend it for any man wishing to smell good!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great smell.</li>
            <li> this is the best out there</li>
            <li> The product came promptly in appropriate packaging. The product, however, seemed to be much \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; than many previous purchases. It required a larger application and certainly did not last as long as the other products I used. Although the product may have been \\&quot;normal strength\\&quot; I will not purchase again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve bought Polo Blue now for a few years... but...this apparently is not the REAL thing.  It seems to have some of the qualities of the stuff I got years ago (smells the same) and maybe it is - but - it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;pizz-azz\\&quot; the old bottles had.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have that day-long effect of the older bottles I have.  It may be that ol&#x27; Ralph has changed the formula.  It may be that I&#x27;m getting older.  Or it may be that it ain&#x27;t the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;.  It could be just me.  After all, all colognes are pretty much subjective...</li>
            <li> This one was for my speacl friend, he loves it and I love the shell also. Abig one for a speacl man in my life</li>
            <li> This is Great,The smell is wonderful...It is one of Ralph Lauren Polo&#x27;s Greatest sprays. I love the way it makes my&lt;br /&gt;husband smell.</li>
            <li> amo esta colonia huele muy rico y atrae a las mujeres sin palabra Excelente producto  lo &amp;uacute;nico e que la presentaci&amp;oacute;n que me enviaron era mas peque&amp;ntilde;a que la de las fotos</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain!</li>
            <li> Now my boyfriend will NEVER run out of &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;. His last bottle was smaller and lasted him 10+ years!! YES!</li>
            <li> This cologne makes me melt. I love love love the smell on my husband. I won&#x27;t let him wear anything else...not that he wants to!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, dont want anything else. I am always told by ladies that the smell warms their engines, their lady engines. shipped fast, big bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried to use other colognes, but people always commented about \\&quot;my scent,\\&quot; actually they said smell - but they meant it in a good way. I asked. Some people make me hug them, so that they can pick up the scent and I&#x27;ve had several who say they like to walk behind me and smell the Polo Blue.</li>
