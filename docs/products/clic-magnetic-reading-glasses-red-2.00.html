            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t received the item, I acn&#x27;t really review.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have longer hair, the back interferes and the glasses don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>

            <li>Wish it were able to adjust even smaller beyond it current ability to adjust.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another unexpected positive is that you can adjust the bows so that they don&#x27;t have to rest on your nose.  </li>

            <li> love these. I never have to ask where my glasses are. The only downside is you can&#x27;t really travel with them in your pocket book they&#x27;re too big.they are just a full front to back and they last I&#x27;m really happy with them</li>
            <li> My wife bought a pair on vacation a year ago. She lost them in Europe this year. She had to get replacements immediately. She loves them.</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t received the item, I acn&#x27;t really review.  I&#x27;m not impressed with the Purple Caravan&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> Love these magnetic readers! I used to loose my readers on a regular basis because I am just not old enough to wear them around my neck on a cord! These solve my vanity issue and my eyesight issues while looking cool to boot!</li>
            <li> They are great.  You always have your glasses.  My husband and I were always looking for our reading glasses.  With the Clic glasses, we wear them around our necks and they are accessible whenever we need them.</li>
            <li> great glass hard to lose these</li>
            <li> These are great. Never lose your glasses again!</li>
            <li> Great color and we really enjoy them</li>
            <li> Picked up my glasses yesterday and the lens fell out. Also, if you have longer hair, the back interferes and the glasses don&#x27;t fit correctly. If You place them over the hair, they will fit but you sure don&#x27;t want to see yourself in a mirror, lol. For working outside, they were convenient when having to exchange sunglasses for readers to replace weed eater string, etc. I would have rated them 4 star, had it not been for the glass falling out and only 30 return policy</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Clics.  They are extremely functional and I haven&#x27;t lost a pair of glasses since I got them.  I also get lots of compliments on how cool they are.  Makes having to wear readers fun.</li>
            <li> These work great. I have had a neck fusion so I&#x27;m unable to bend or flex to look up.  With the correction in the entire lense I don&#x27;t have to try get a bifocal lined up to look overhead. Have had these a while &amp; I really like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my glasses , before I bot this glasses I owe one par a week, know I have my glasses with me all the time , and no lose any more !!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a very very good deal</li>
            <li> This vendor ships FAST. These are the best glasses: convenient, good quality and cool looking.  If you need reading glasses for close up only these are the best.  You never have to search for them and they don&#x27;t get in the way like the string holders.</li>
            <li> I love my click readers! They are terrific for people who work with young children. The kids can&#x27;t tear them off my face and run away with them!  I&#x27;m a preschool teacher and I LOVE my Clic Readers! No more lost reading glasses!!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I need. Delibery just in time. Pacage easy to open. Good bussiness. Good quality. Good service. I loved the color.</li>
            <li> love  the glasses.  work great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them.  Too cool! Have had lots of complements already.  Would highly recommend them to all.  You will be pleased.</li>
            <li> They are too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I must have a tiny head. The headband was huge and stuck way out behind the back of my head. Looked ridiculous and they get no smaller. The petites only come in 3.0 so I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
            <li> I forget that I have it around my neck sometimes It is very lightweight. For non prescription lenses, it is of good quality.</li>
            <li> These are great for going shopping, I never lose them.</li>
            <li> Purchased a pair of these for myself and love them...  Then friends and relatives started asking for them.. so these were a gift. They look a bit geek-y... but they are highly functional.  No more lost glasses</li>
            <li> It may sound a bit dramatic to say this, but Clics have &amp;#34;changed my life.&amp;#34;  My most frequently used phrase was &amp;#34;let me find my reading glasses,&amp;#34; but now Clics are always at the ready.  Does away with the Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love these things!  I&#x27;ve been really hard on them and am actually surprised I haven&#x27;t managed to break them.  Accidentally took them backpacking (Hadn&#x27;t planned to because I was afraid I&#x27;d break them handling the pack, etc) and it was the best mistake ever.  Handy for map reading and I just clipped them to my pack when not in use.  Didn&#x27;t break as hard as I was with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lenses have never popped out (I only include this comment because some reviews have said otherwise).&lt;br /&gt;I find them especially handy when doing activities that require me to lean over (working with tools, etc) because they don&#x27;t fall off like my other glasses do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another unexpected positive is that you can adjust the bows so that they don&#x27;t have to rest on your nose.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to give your nose a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus there is a definite fun factor... more interesting than your average readers.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend them in your reading glasses arsenal.</li>
            <li> They work great if you want to leave them around your neck. Not easy to pack up. They could provide a special case.</li>
            <li> very practical, but we have to be used to it.  the back string sometimes is unconfortable, mainly when you have a pillow behind your head</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  Wish it were able to adjust even smaller beyond it current ability to adjust.</li>
            <li> Great keeps you from loosing them and always case by</li>
            <li> Easy to have them right where you need them. And you look so very cool. I needed five more words.</li>
