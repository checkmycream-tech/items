            <li>It is mild but effective.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for dry skin.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic stuff, and the bottle lasts me about 3-4 months when I use it every day, so don&#x27;t be put off by the cost.  </li>

            <li>Martha is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This product is very healing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>i love Yonka, but questioned the whole idea of using a toner.</li>
            <li>The Yonka lotion is a very mild astringent, but because it is alcohol free, it does not dry out your skin - feels awesomely refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh uplifting clean smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling fresh &amp; clean and I like that</li>
            <li>Love this product especially on a hot day to add extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I love the Yonka line and look forward to adding more of their products into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I use this toner twice daily and even made myself a mini spray bottle to carry with me while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Finding the right toner is not always the easiest search like all beauty products considering there are So many and many of them are drying.</li>
            <li>YOU LIGHTLY \\&quot;MIST\\&quot; YOUR FACE AFTER CLEANSING AND GENTLY PAT INTO THE SKIN.      </li>
            <li>Does such a great job at maintaining my sensitive, break-out prone skin.</li>
            <li>Deleivered everything promised plus - the product is great and the savings vs buying in Canada are unbelievable.</li>
            <li>If you love true natural ingredients and true essential oils: you will love Yonka Lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Its not only refreshing, cooling and even calming for red patches, sunburns or inflammations...</li>
            <li>I have had moderate breakouts for many years and was hoping this would be the solution to the problem (an esthetician recommended them to me).</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several years and it&#x27;s still my favorite product to put on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for dry skin because it does not contain alochol which further dries skin.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it feels really refreshing when you spray the toner on, but it&#x27;s just not worth the cost since there are other (cheaper) products I&#x27;ve found since that are a lot more effective overall.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend it to those that travel/fly!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so much of a toner as it is a hydrating spray lotion.  </li>
            <li>But even if this was just pink fragranced water...I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s just so refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating to my face.</li>
            <li>Very healing, soothing.</li>
            <li>Gentle, non stripping toner.  </li>
            <li>I was using witch hazel from time to time to cut cost in effect which the alcohol in it would dry out my skin causing acne an fine lines.</li>
            <li>the non-synthetic, natural, fresh essential oils smell is calming your whole system.&lt;br /&gt;Big fan!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 and get told all the time I look like I just graduated high school.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly.</li>

            <li>A MUST HAVE, NO MATTER IF YOU ARE OLD OR YOUNG</li>
            <li>(AND I&#x27;M YOUNG).</li>
            <li>Recommended for anyone looking for a natural product that is non-drying.</li>
            <li>It is a constant-spray type bottle, so rather than putting it on a cotton pad, you apply directly to the face by spraying it on.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the refrigerator to add to its invigorating natural elements and smell.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, Martha Stewart uses this on the set whenever she needs an added touch of hydration and moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin, so am hesitant to use a regular toner, yet I still get pimples, so sometimes need something extra.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin on my face, and when I shave with a razor, I used to get red bumps every single time the next day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It cleans your face, when you already think your face is clean. I have washed my face then used this product with a cotton ball to remove excess dirt. It is great at keeping pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin, so am hesitant to use a regular toner, yet I still get pimples, so sometimes need something extra. I am an addict for Yonka products and also use their day lotion, night creme, eye contour, hydration mask, and fruit peel....their products are excellent! Gentle but extremely effective. This toner is perfect. I spray on a cotton square after washing, and before my creme, and it cleans up any extra goop without any drying at all!!! Try it, and it will be your toner for life!</li>
            <li> If you add only one beauty item to your daily regimen, this should be it. It&#x27;s a spa treatment in itself.</li>
            <li> Love this product especially on a hot day to add extra moisture. Just a quick spray and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Refreshing. Smells amazing. Hydrating. Love this product!</li>
            <li> THIS \\&quot;LOTION\\&quot; IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LOTION.  IT IS MORE LIKE A MIST.  BUT IT DEFINITELY WORKS LIKE A LOTION MINUS THE FEELING OF A HEAVY OR EVEN LIGHT LOTION.  I USED TO USE A PRODUCT BY SOTHY&#x27;S FOR MY DAILY MOISTURIZER, BUT THIS HAS TAKEN ITS PLACE.  YOU LIGHTLY \\&quot;MIST\\&quot; YOUR FACE AFTER CLEANSING AND GENTLY PAT INTO THE SKIN.      THIS IS A MUST HAVE, NO MATTER IF YOU ARE OLD OR YOUNG (AND I&#x27;M YOUNG).</li>
            <li> for your skin.  No Drying, cracking or tightness results from this able toner.  Even for on the spot fixes, Yonka brings us a product that dissolves acne and speeds healing.  Recommended for anyone looking for a natural product that is non-drying.</li>
            <li> Product is good, however, it arrived leaking out of its container.  I&#x27;ve rated it prior to this invitation and was told the vendor would send a replacement. It has never arrived</li>
            <li> I used this stuff when I was a teenager and then when I had to start paying my own way I went to the drugstore options.  At one point in my twenties I got something from Neutrogena and I broke out in these tiny little flesh colored bumps that itched.  I figured it was time.  So I got this toner with the Pamplemousse and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  This brand is so reliable.  Everything I get works wonders.  I also use the skin repair oil in the winter.  I just can&#x27;t say enough great stuff about Yonka!  My mother used Yonka too and she always looked younger than her age and had great radiant skin.  Five stars aren&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> Will never live without this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with a number of other Yon-Ka products for about a year. I have had moderate breakouts for many years and was hoping this would be the solution to the problem (an esthetician recommended them to me). They weren&#x27;t. Granted, my use of them was not always the twice-a-day regimen I was supposed to do, but even when I was really good at doing the regimen like I was supposed to for weeks at a time, the results were mediocre at best. Not super encouraging. I will say that it feels really refreshing when you spray the toner on, but it&#x27;s just not worth the cost since there are other (cheaper) products I&#x27;ve found since that are a lot more effective overall.</li>
            <li> goes well with the Yonka Lait Nettoyant Cleansing Milk Face -- since it balances the skin afterwards. Really great product</li>
            <li> I have been Yonka lotion for years and although I have tried others I keep going back to Yonka.  It is mild but effective.  What else what you want?  Try it!</li>
            <li> Deleivered everything promised plus - the product is great and the savings vs buying in Canada are unbelievable. Totally recommended</li>
            <li> Does such a great job at maintaining my sensitive, break-out prone skin. And I love the way it smells. It is a constant-spray type bottle, so rather than putting it on a cotton pad, you apply directly to the face by spraying it on. Expect that some will get on your top and in your hair.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this product in one of my recent Living magazine issues.  Apparently, Martha Stewart uses this on the set whenever she needs an added touch of hydration and moisture.  So, what&#x27;s good enough for Martha is good enough for me.  Well, it&#x27;s absolutely FANTASTIC!  I leave the bottle on my desk at work and whenever I need a touch of hydration and moisture, I give myself a spritz!  I look forward to using this product and trying other Yonka products as well!) for a very long time.  Highly recommend it to those that travel/fly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray lotion for 15 years.  It isn&#x27;t so much of a toner as it is a hydrating spray lotion.  I spray it on under my facial cream 2-3 times a day and I always get compliments on how dewy and hydrated my skin looks.  I even pour a little in a small plastic bottle for when I travel.  Love this stuff and like one viewer said it really takes your facial lotion/cream to a new level.</li>
            <li> Hydrating. But does don&#x27;t replace a toner for me</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how much I love this product. It&#x27;s a spray moisturizer, but it makes your skin feel like heaven when you use it. I love the light fragrance and the way it mists my face after cleansing. I use it every morning and night. I feel like I&#x27;ve had less breakouts because my face isn&#x27;t as dry. But even if this was just pink fragranced water...I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s just so refreshing. ;)</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.  Red bumps all over my arms and legs.  The company will not accept returns and will not refund my money.  I gave it to my daughter but she won&#x27;t use it because of the strange smell it has.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Absolutely the best toner ever!!! Natural ingredients with a lovely scent!! Will use over and over!  Great procuct, great price!</li>
            <li> I am crazy about the fragrance of this product.  It&#x27;s a fresh uplifting clean smell.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I thought it had a weird smell but I kept using it and now I look forward to that smell. It is very hydrating to my face. It&#x27;s just a refreshing product. I&#x27;m 32 and get told all the time I look like I just graduated high school. I love the Yonka line and look forward to adding more of their products into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Yonka LOTION for as long as I remember. It&#x27;s one of the only staples I have in my vanity that has never changed. I use it every morning before the gym, and then again after a shower before moisturizer and make-up. I think I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner. I use this toner twice daily and even made myself a mini spray bottle to carry with me while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Finding the right toner is not always the easiest search like all beauty products considering there are So many and many of them are drying. I was using witch hazel from time to time to cut cost in effect which the alcohol in it would dry out my skin causing acne an fine lines. This product is very healing and refreshing. I have noticed my larger pores shrink and tighten. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several years and it&#x27;s still my favorite product to put on my skin.  My daughter uses it, too, and her first comment to me was that she loved how it smells - it&#x27;s all herbal.  I use it morning and night and can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I honestly was unsure of using this stuff. i love Yonka, but questioned the whole idea of using a toner. Why seriously??? Okay, now I get it!! This is freaken amazing and you HAVE to use it!! It is the base that makes all the moisturizers go to the next level! promise you this! INVALUABLE!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Been using it for years. And, it&#x27;s $10 cheaper on Amazon than through my aesthetician.</li>
            <li> If you love true natural ingredients and true essential oils: you will love Yonka Lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Its not only refreshing, cooling and even calming for red patches, sunburns or inflammations...it also leaves you with a moisturized feeling - and the non-synthetic, natural, fresh essential oils smell is calming your whole system.&lt;br /&gt;Big fan!</li>
            <li> I use Yonka Lotion every day.  This product is great for dry skin because it does not contain alochol which further dries skin.  Every aging lady should use Yonka.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Love Yonka!</li>
            <li> As a guy, I love this stuff.  I have fairly sensitive skin on my face, and when I shave with a razor, I used to get red bumps every single time the next day. It didn&#x27;t matter what aftershave I used - however, I use this after I shave and NEVER see a single red bump anymore.  It&#x27;s fantastic stuff, and the bottle lasts me about 3-4 months when I use it every day, so don&#x27;t be put off by the cost.  It lasts a LONG time! I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Very healing, soothing. Excellent product for dry skin. Spray before you use your serum / cream and it makes your product go further.</li>
            <li> She loves it, and this is one of the cheapest places you can find it!  She has beautiful skin and a lot of allergies!!</li>
            <li> Gentle, non stripping toner.  I especially like it that it can be sprayed on, hate to use cotton balls with toner.</li>
            <li> I have used this toner for many years and would not be without it.  It is great for under your moisturizer and makes your skin feel so smooth.  It is not greasy and does not have alcohol.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yonka&#x27;s products do what they say they do. This toner is almost as good as coffee at waking you up in the morning and it&#x27;s more refreshing!  I keep it in the refrigerator to add to its invigorating natural elements and smell.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Have used Yonka products for the past five years and absolutely love it.  The Yonka lotion is a very mild astringent, but because it is alcohol free, it does not dry out your skin - feels awesomely refreshing.</li>
            <li> Not drying at all. Finishes the cleansing process feeling really clean. Smells great too</li>
            <li> A refreshing way to start the day or revive your skin anytime.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell &amp; it came with broken box ~ make me wondered if it is used !</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling fresh &amp; clean and I like that I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer before make up. Try it.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin well:</li>
