            <li>I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
            <li>For the best result I use a toner right after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>This face wash is so lovely!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Pleasant and safe to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great with my very mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>The price is also amazing because like I said, it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it is good for my skin</li>
            <li>and it is so nice.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture of this cleanser (creamy but foams up really nicely) and feel that it does a good job of cleansing and removing sunscreen/makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it time to work but loving the trial period.</li>
            <li>I just use it as my morning cleanser and use a more effective cleanser in the evening.</li>
            <li>I have been using this before the Acure sensitive face cream and am noticing wonderful results in my skin.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the more amazing my skin feels.</li>
            <li>it just is kind of has a medicinal smell which isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li>This was ok for me.  </li>
            <li>FINALLY I found a perfect face wash.</li>
            <li>Smell ok.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and you can&#x27;t beat the ingredients (although the token ingredients aren&#x27;t even close to the top of the list).  </li>
            <li>I finally found the one fricken face wash that won&#x27;t irritate my face and make me look like a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;The BEST thing about this product: the value.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t EVER stop making this stuff; this has got to have been crafted by magical face fairies.</li>
            <li>You guys have the magic touch.</li>
            <li>Having read many of the reviews, I ordered this face cleaner.</li>
            <li>I use Acure&#x27;s face cream and love it</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is the best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li>, many have burned my skin or caused hives.</li>
            <li>I have used Retin-A on my face for many years, and have made the mistake of falling for all the exfoliating cleansers, scrubs, etc.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t made me break out as so many things do.</li>
            <li>My favorite, and now I&#x27;ve got my bf hooked too.</li>
            <li>It is truly organic which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like it and am sure I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>After a month of using this product, I wish I had more</li>
            <li>I have been using this product line for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I had used this for a month against my better judgement.</li>
            <li>Love this line of products.</li>
            <li>This my way :).</li>
            <li>I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>Love it, will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS CLEANSER.</li>
            <li>I have so many allergies including to products that smell.</li>
            <li>It keeps me from breaking out a lot better than this soap does.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Works good and clears the face right up.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product after reading the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>Acure is a wonderful complement to the economical bottle of high quality</li>
            <li>It leaves my face nice and clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to burn or itch</li>
            <li>i use a pea size to wash my face and neck and it lathers up amazingly and leave your skin bright, silky soft.  </li>
            <li>great for sensitive skin love it</li>
            <li>Great smell, keeps skin clear, safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am also so happy to find a product that is made from natural ingredients and that works as well as this does.</li>
            <li>Gentle and seems good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Good gentle lather.</li>
            <li>It certainly exceeds the results of some of the more popular and</li>
            <li>I have ordered some other organic skin care products that I will be trying but for now, this is the BEST!</li>
            <li>Just smells like a cleanser, not bad at all!</li>
            <li>I easily can have the reaction to products ofI</li>
            <li>Also rinsed off quite easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or citrus, etc and it isn&#x27;t strong......</li>
            <li>this cleanser has a strong and acrid stink, like fermented cabbage.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good product for others, but it did nothing for my skin, which is normal for me.</li>
            <li>and you really get a nice, clean, non-stripped face!</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference on my face</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Acure Organics products, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>and I already notice a huge difference in the texture and condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>Acne has never been a HUGE problem for me, but acure caused it to be a huge problem.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in my skin from those three.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that works for my face (after trying out a million things for years) and keeps it acne free for good unless I start eating a bunch of junk, in which case, no organic or chemical-laden face wash will be able to control.</li>
            <li>But I do noticed that it feels so smooth after washing my face.</li>
            <li>It makes our faces feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s fragrance free, but I believe that just means they don&#x27;t add any perfumes or fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and silky afterwards too.</li>
            <li>If you have dry/sensitive skin this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nice cleanser... being natural makes me love it.</li>
            <li>very easy and leaves my skin very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I started using it about 5 days ago and have noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I just did not feel my face was getting fully clean.</li>
            <li>It works well to clean the face of sebum, dirt and makeup without drying the skin.</li>
            <li>and it is great, very gentle and has helped my healing ever since I switched from regular soap.</li>
            <li>Not kidding, this is the best facial cleanser I have ever used, including some pretty high end brands.</li>
            <li>but I knew she was telling the truth, my skin felt fine after moisturizing, but right out of the shower</li>
            <li>Another great Acure product, my skin changed, I always had red blotches and now they are gone, my skin is silky and smooth!the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t have much if any foam.</li>
            <li>Try Acure if you are looking for an affordable, effective, natural skincare regime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sensitive skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>Even my fiance noticed how smooth and fresh my skin looked without being prompted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honestly, my sons skin is extremely sensitive and I even used it in his hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted a paraben-free cleanser without a ton of ingredients from the &amp;#34;Dirty Dozen&amp;#34; and I have also had great experiences using other Acure products.  </li>
            <li>As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days</li>
            <li>Very sensitive, pure, free and effective.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, light smelling, and does what it says it will do without using completely harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely super drying.</li>
            <li>Goes on well and is creamy, does a great job of cleansing, it says unscented but does have a slight clay like smell to it</li>
            <li>The natural fragrance is tolerable, where most natural products have a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it seems like a fine cleanser, but it didn&#x27;t really stand out except for the fact that it is biodegradable.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and my face feels so smooth when I get done washing my face.</li>
            <li>These companies try to lure you in claiming the products are safe and natural and your skin will be better off for using them, but in fact a lot of natural products include shea butter, or some type of wax or butter derived from a plant.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really truly only good</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled better, but It washes off completely so the scent never lingers.</li>
            <li>I love it and follow up with the Acure sensitive moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>Honestly, Not so crazy about the scent</li>
            <li>I love how soft this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Great sensitive facial</li>
            <li>Works great for my dry, sensitive skin!.</li>
            <li>I use a pea sized amount, rub it in my hands with some water and it lathers right up.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With this product, you do not need a whole bunch of it to wash your entire face which is nice since it is a bit pricey for 4 ounces.</li>
            <li>I was using it over few weeks from now and this  is the best facial cleanser ever.</li>
            <li>It cleans without stripping your face and leaves it very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>It feels luxurious and soft going on, there is no fragrance (huge plus since even a lot of natural products are strongly scented for some reason), and the price is on point.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed fine after cleansing, with no inflammation, but I would be hesitant to recommend this product to someone with really sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way AND cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;pretty and simple\\&quot; look of this product make you not want to try it if you&#x27;re a dude because this stuff is GODLIKE.</li>
            <li>Defying facial cleanser and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>it will probably take a week or so of consistent use for the problem to go away.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first tube from a health food store.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve gone back to Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Tea Tree Oil Soap (the orange bottle).</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and clean after using it and it seems to plump up my skin</li>
            <li>The price is OK for the amount of product you get, but for daily cleansing, I&#x27;ll stick to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and Cerave Foaming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, lovely facial and super mild, every day exfoilator later, I added this creamy goodness as my cleanser</li>
            <li>I keep having to remember that less is sometimes more!  </li>
            <li>It is gentle yet has a sudsy/foamy consistency which leaves my&lt;br /&gt;complexion, clean, moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and its mild.</li>
            <li>It left mine feeling smooth and looking clean and refreshed and even young.  </li>
            <li>I went searching for something that was really pure and wouldn&#x27;t cause another episode.</li>
            <li>This one has a scent but it must be purely organic because I do not react to it.</li>
            <li>Cleanses my skin of 99% of my makeup (nothing seems to get it off completely the first time!)</li>
            <li>It works well on my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use the whole range and from cleanser, moisturizer and serum.  </li>
            <li>It really does lower the sensitivity of my skin.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;the gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say so much about the benefits.</li>
            <li>The breakouts around my mouth have fully cleared up and my skin seems to have a much cleaner feeling after I wash it in the morning and night with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It takes of makeup and leaves my skin clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream.</li>
            <li>and I get very hesitant putting anything on my face.</li>
            <li>so I am very cautious on what I use on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Gentle</li>
            <li>Usually sensitive facial cleansers (in my case) have come out really creamy with no l&amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; and it would cause more pore congestion.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend for makeup removal, but as a gentle cleanser, this is one of</li>
            <li>This smelled very funky.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really turned my skin around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of years and really does the trick.</li>
            <li>And because their creams work so well, I feel I don&#x27;t really need the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems gentle.  </li>
            <li>so I thought for sure I would like their Sensitive Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>After searching Amazon and reading many reviews, I decided to purchase Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser for my trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products.</li>
            <li>Several of Acure&#x27;s face products that claim to be safe for sensitive or acne prone skin have shea butter in them.</li>
            <li>The goodness I am putting on after cleansing is not as effective because I have a buildup of dead skins cells that the products cannot penetrate.  </li>
            <li>began this year with a really lovely facial where the aesthetician told me that I needed some major exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>But totally does the job and leaves my skin feeling clean in a normal way - much better than just water (too drying) or other cleansers that can leave residue or feel too tightening.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and not at all dry after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>and have tried basically everything from intense acne-fighting products, tea tree oil washes, a whole range of natural products, cetaphil, and on and on.</li>
            <li>Great price, as it&#x27;s a bit ore expensive at places like Whole Foods (when not on sale).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product though and will purchase again and am getting used to the scent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for basically any skin type.</li>
            <li>It is highly concentrated and I literally use a pea size amount twice a day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, will purchase</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser and the Acure product line.</li>
            <li>-- It&#x27;s far better than more expensive products that claim too</li>
            <li>The sales staff at Whole Foods turned me onto the Acure sensitive line.</li>
            <li>and so have probably a month&#x27;s worth of product left.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really suds up, more of a slick cream.</li>
            <li>So I totally feel that those creams are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>No heavy scent, nice texture, no big lathering, leaves my skin soft and ready for a moisturizer, and absolutely NO irritation!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this product if you have acne prone sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li>Acure Organics Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Argan Oil, from my very first application, seems to be just&lt;</li>
            <li>product had a nice, slightly thick, but easy to spread consistency and little to no scent.</li>
            <li>Also, I used it to wash my ear because I got a new piercing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to this product</li>
            <li>I have tried various organic cleansers and this by far is my favorite due to the quality and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, aging skin with mild rosacea</li>
            <li>Really like this cleanser as I have difficulty finding a cleanser gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed how my lips were very very soft, a must for before applying lipstick.</li>
            <li>It is very soft feeling on my skin</li>
            <li>and it last a good while as you only need a little.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so calming and hydrating, and keeps my skin clear and glowing!</li>
            <li>I think that this Acure face wash was just a little too strong for my face.</li>
            <li>I love that my skin feels less irritated and never dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice and you only need a small amount to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>but instead I found that it&#x27;s only been okay, but not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, uneven skin that becomes easily inflamed</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I cannot think of any while using such a pure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle and seems to be removing my long wear liquid foundation quite well.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use frequently.</li>
            <li>cleanser has a slight floral scent, not perfume-y though, just clean.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li>be for sensitive skin and don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin (adult acne, a bit of dryness, redness, etc.)</li>
            <li>I have been cursed with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and have used all sorts of products over the years</li>
            <li>and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I was using the Neutrogena Natural facewash which was \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but not all natural, which I wanted.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Since the waste water from the boat went directly into the ocean, I wanted to make sure I was being environmentally conscious and use only biodegradable products.</li>
            <li>When I applied the product to my face, I was surprised that it made my skin tingle a bit.</li>
            <li>Once in a while I will use a Cetaphil cleanser because of how sensitive it is on my skin.</li>
            <li>Anybody who has sensitive and acne prone skin should stay away from acure products.</li>
            <li>am 35 years old</li>
            <li>I have mature, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, but also NATURALLY suds up</li>
            <li>so the transformation was totally unexpected.</li>
            <li>The lack of chemicals is really the only reason I would consider using it after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I was with their face creams,</li>
            <li>I tried the sensitive skin body wash, and it seemed to irritate my skin too.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean without being tight or over dry.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>However, being blessed with hormonal acne, the creamy formula is too heavy to clean my pores out.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I applied it to my whole face, didn&#x27;t like the texture AT ALL, got in the shower, added water and realized I had just wasted a lot of it.</li>
            <li>The body wash (in the green tube) is too strong for me too, made my arms and back break out.</li>
            <li>I have been back to my normal cleansing regimen for a while now</li>
            <li>The smell is overpowering and for a facial cleanser to be listed for sensitive skin and then to be so completely drying, flabbergasts me.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to be gentle enough, though I did worry a little about the foaming agent.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and usually only let the water beads wash my face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t break out with it on, it makes my skin so smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe.</li>
            <li>I have since stopped using the SFS at night and now only use the sensitive cleanser.</li>
            <li>I bought this organic sensitive facial cleanser for my acne prone sensitive skin because I have been breaking out along my mouth recently.</li>
            <li>I have been using Acure Organic&#x27;s Sensitive Facial Cleanser for about a week</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful with my products, too much</li>
            <li>, I feel like I have a nice arsenal of products without a lot of the scary additives.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting worse, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.</li>
            <li>If you want to use something natural in your face regimen get the DoTERRA family physician kit that has pure tea tree oil, frankensense, and other essential oils that are PURE and UNDILUTED with crap and are good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I normally have dry flaky skin</li>
            <li>but after a month of using this and changing nothing else in my skincare routine, my skin is SUPER flaky and dry and feels really tight after washing.</li>
            <li>(please excuse my spelling, it is too early to look things</li>
            <li>Very expensive and does not work any better than Cetaphil which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Sorry for the long review, I just wanted to warm people about these products, and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to think I didn&#x27;t give it a chance.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this cleanser for those with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin doesn&#x27;t have bad reaction after using it for 2 weeks which is a good sign.</li>

            <li> I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
            <li> For the best result I use a toner right after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> This face wash is so lovely!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Pleasant and safe to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great with my very mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> The price is also amazing because like I said, it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it is good for my skin</li>
            <li> and it is so nice.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture of this cleanser (creamy but foams up really nicely) and feel that it does a good job of cleansing and removing sunscreen/makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it time to work but loving the trial period.</li>
            <li> I just use it as my morning cleanser and use a more effective cleanser in the evening.</li>
            <li> I have been using this before the Acure sensitive face cream and am noticing wonderful results in my skin.</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the more amazing my skin feels.</li>
            <li> it just is kind of has a medicinal smell which isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li> This was ok for me.  </li>
            <li> FINALLY I found a perfect face wash.</li>
            <li> Smell ok.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and you can&#x27;t beat the ingredients (although the token ingredients aren&#x27;t even close to the top of the list).  </li>
            <li> I finally found the one fricken face wash that won&#x27;t irritate my face and make me look like a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;The BEST thing about this product: the value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER stop making this stuff; this has got to have been crafted by magical face fairies.</li>
            <li> You guys have the magic touch.</li>
            <li> Having read many of the reviews, I ordered this face cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use Acure&#x27;s face cream and love it</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> , many have burned my skin or caused hives.</li>
            <li> I have used Retin-A on my face for many years, and have made the mistake of falling for all the exfoliating cleansers, scrubs, etc.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t made me break out as so many things do.</li>
            <li> My favorite, and now I&#x27;ve got my bf hooked too.</li>
            <li> It is truly organic which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like it and am sure I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this product, I wish I had more</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I had used this for a month against my better judgement.</li>
            <li> Love this line of products.</li>
            <li> This my way :).</li>
            <li> I love this brand.  </li>
            <li> Love it, will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CLEANSER.</li>
            <li> I have so many allergies including to products that smell.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from breaking out a lot better than this soap does.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Works good and clears the face right up.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after reading the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> Acure is a wonderful complement to the economical bottle of high quality</li>
            <li> It leaves my face nice and clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to burn or itch</li>
            <li> i use a pea size to wash my face and neck and it lathers up amazingly and leave your skin bright, silky soft.  </li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin love it</li>
            <li> Great smell, keeps skin clear, safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am also so happy to find a product that is made from natural ingredients and that works as well as this does.</li>
            <li> Gentle and seems good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Good gentle lather.</li>
            <li> It certainly exceeds the results of some of the more popular and</li>
            <li> I have ordered some other organic skin care products that I will be trying but for now, this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Just smells like a cleanser, not bad at all!</li>
            <li> I easily can have the reaction to products ofI</li>
            <li> Also rinsed off quite easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or citrus, etc and it isn&#x27;t strong......</li>
            <li> this cleanser has a strong and acrid stink, like fermented cabbage.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and made my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product for others, but it did nothing for my skin, which is normal for me.</li>
            <li> and you really get a nice, clean, non-stripped face!</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference on my face</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Acure Organics products, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> and I already notice a huge difference in the texture and condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Acne has never been a HUGE problem for me, but acure caused it to be a huge problem.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my skin from those three.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for my face (after trying out a million things for years) and keeps it acne free for good unless I start eating a bunch of junk, in which case, no organic or chemical-laden face wash will be able to control.</li>
            <li> But I do noticed that it feels so smooth after washing my face.</li>
            <li> It makes our faces feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s fragrance free, but I believe that just means they don&#x27;t add any perfumes or fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and silky afterwards too.</li>
            <li> If you have dry/sensitive skin this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser... being natural makes me love it.</li>
            <li> very easy and leaves my skin very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I started using it about 5 days ago and have noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just did not feel my face was getting fully clean.</li>
            <li> It works well to clean the face of sebum, dirt and makeup without drying the skin.</li>
            <li> and it is great, very gentle and has helped my healing ever since I switched from regular soap.</li>
            <li> Not kidding, this is the best facial cleanser I have ever used, including some pretty high end brands.</li>
            <li> but I knew she was telling the truth, my skin felt fine after moisturizing, but right out of the shower</li>
            <li> Another great Acure product, my skin changed, I always had red blotches and now they are gone, my skin is silky and smooth!the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t have much if any foam.</li>
            <li> Try Acure if you are looking for an affordable, effective, natural skincare regime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sensitive skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> Even my fiance noticed how smooth and fresh my skin looked without being prompted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Honestly, my sons skin is extremely sensitive and I even used it in his hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a paraben-free cleanser without a ton of ingredients from the &amp;#34;Dirty Dozen&amp;#34; and I have also had great experiences using other Acure products.  </li>
            <li> As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, pure, free and effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, light smelling, and does what it says it will do without using completely harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely super drying.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and is creamy, does a great job of cleansing, it says unscented but does have a slight clay like smell to it</li>
            <li> The natural fragrance is tolerable, where most natural products have a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it seems like a fine cleanser, but it didn&#x27;t really stand out except for the fact that it is biodegradable.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and my face feels so smooth when I get done washing my face.</li>
            <li> These companies try to lure you in claiming the products are safe and natural and your skin will be better off for using them, but in fact a lot of natural products include shea butter, or some type of wax or butter derived from a plant.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really truly only good</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better, but It washes off completely so the scent never lingers.</li>
            <li> I love it and follow up with the Acure sensitive moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Honestly, Not so crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Great sensitive facial</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry, sensitive skin!.</li>
            <li> I use a pea sized amount, rub it in my hands with some water and it lathers right up.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With this product, you do not need a whole bunch of it to wash your entire face which is nice since it is a bit pricey for 4 ounces.</li>
            <li> I was using it over few weeks from now and this  is the best facial cleanser ever.</li>
            <li> It cleans without stripping your face and leaves it very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> It feels luxurious and soft going on, there is no fragrance (huge plus since even a lot of natural products are strongly scented for some reason), and the price is on point.</li>
            <li> My skin seemed fine after cleansing, with no inflammation, but I would be hesitant to recommend this product to someone with really sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way AND cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;pretty and simple\\&quot; look of this product make you not want to try it if you&#x27;re a dude because this stuff is GODLIKE.</li>
            <li> Defying facial cleanser and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> it will probably take a week or so of consistent use for the problem to go away.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first tube from a health food store.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve gone back to Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Tea Tree Oil Soap (the orange bottle).</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and clean after using it and it seems to plump up my skin</li>
            <li> The price is OK for the amount of product you get, but for daily cleansing, I&#x27;ll stick to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and Cerave Foaming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, lovely facial and super mild, every day exfoilator later, I added this creamy goodness as my cleanser</li>
            <li> I keep having to remember that less is sometimes more!  </li>
            <li> It is gentle yet has a sudsy/foamy consistency which leaves my&lt;br /&gt;complexion, clean, moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and its mild.</li>
            <li> It left mine feeling smooth and looking clean and refreshed and even young.  </li>
            <li> I went searching for something that was really pure and wouldn&#x27;t cause another episode.</li>
            <li> This one has a scent but it must be purely organic because I do not react to it.</li>
            <li> Cleanses my skin of 99% of my makeup (nothing seems to get it off completely the first time!)</li>
            <li> It works well on my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use the whole range and from cleanser, moisturizer and serum.  </li>
            <li> It really does lower the sensitivity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;the gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say so much about the benefits.</li>
            <li> The breakouts around my mouth have fully cleared up and my skin seems to have a much cleaner feeling after I wash it in the morning and night with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It takes of makeup and leaves my skin clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> 60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> and I get very hesitant putting anything on my face.</li>
            <li> so I am very cautious on what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Gentle</li>
            <li> Usually sensitive facial cleansers (in my case) have come out really creamy with no l&amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; and it would cause more pore congestion.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend for makeup removal, but as a gentle cleanser, this is one of</li>
            <li> This smelled very funky.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really turned my skin around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of years and really does the trick.</li>
            <li> And because their creams work so well, I feel I don&#x27;t really need the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems gentle.  </li>
            <li> so I thought for sure I would like their Sensitive Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> After searching Amazon and reading many reviews, I decided to purchase Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser for my trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products.</li>
            <li> Several of Acure&#x27;s face products that claim to be safe for sensitive or acne prone skin have shea butter in them.</li>
            <li> The goodness I am putting on after cleansing is not as effective because I have a buildup of dead skins cells that the products cannot penetrate.  </li>
            <li> began this year with a really lovely facial where the aesthetician told me that I needed some major exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> But totally does the job and leaves my skin feeling clean in a normal way - much better than just water (too drying) or other cleansers that can leave residue or feel too tightening.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and not at all dry after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> and have tried basically everything from intense acne-fighting products, tea tree oil washes, a whole range of natural products, cetaphil, and on and on.</li>
            <li> Great price, as it&#x27;s a bit ore expensive at places like Whole Foods (when not on sale).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product though and will purchase again and am getting used to the scent.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for basically any skin type.</li>
            <li> It is highly concentrated and I literally use a pea size amount twice a day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, will purchase</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser and the Acure product line.</li>
            <li> -- It&#x27;s far better than more expensive products that claim too</li>
            <li> The sales staff at Whole Foods turned me onto the Acure sensitive line.</li>
            <li> and so have probably a month&#x27;s worth of product left.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really suds up, more of a slick cream.</li>
            <li> So I totally feel that those creams are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> No heavy scent, nice texture, no big lathering, leaves my skin soft and ready for a moisturizer, and absolutely NO irritation!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this product if you have acne prone sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li> Acure Organics Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Argan Oil, from my very first application, seems to be just&lt;</li>
            <li> product had a nice, slightly thick, but easy to spread consistency and little to no scent.</li>
            <li> Also, I used it to wash my ear because I got a new piercing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to this product</li>
            <li> I have tried various organic cleansers and this by far is my favorite due to the quality and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, aging skin with mild rosacea</li>
            <li> Really like this cleanser as I have difficulty finding a cleanser gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed how my lips were very very soft, a must for before applying lipstick.</li>
            <li> It is very soft feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> and it last a good while as you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so calming and hydrating, and keeps my skin clear and glowing!</li>
            <li> I think that this Acure face wash was just a little too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> I love that my skin feels less irritated and never dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is so nice and you only need a small amount to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> but instead I found that it&#x27;s only been okay, but not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, uneven skin that becomes easily inflamed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I cannot think of any while using such a pure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very gentle and seems to be removing my long wear liquid foundation quite well.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use frequently.</li>
            <li> cleanser has a slight floral scent, not perfume-y though, just clean.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li> be for sensitive skin and don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin (adult acne, a bit of dryness, redness, etc.)</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and have used all sorts of products over the years</li>
            <li> and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I was using the Neutrogena Natural facewash which was \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but not all natural, which I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Since the waste water from the boat went directly into the ocean, I wanted to make sure I was being environmentally conscious and use only biodegradable products.</li>
            <li> When I applied the product to my face, I was surprised that it made my skin tingle a bit.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I will use a Cetaphil cleanser because of how sensitive it is on my skin.</li>
            <li> Anybody who has sensitive and acne prone skin should stay away from acure products.</li>
            <li> am 35 years old</li>
            <li> I have mature, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, but also NATURALLY suds up</li>
            <li> so the transformation was totally unexpected.</li>
            <li> The lack of chemicals is really the only reason I would consider using it after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I was with their face creams,</li>
            <li> I tried the sensitive skin body wash, and it seemed to irritate my skin too.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean without being tight or over dry.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> However, being blessed with hormonal acne, the creamy formula is too heavy to clean my pores out.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I applied it to my whole face, didn&#x27;t like the texture AT ALL, got in the shower, added water and realized I had just wasted a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The body wash (in the green tube) is too strong for me too, made my arms and back break out.</li>
            <li> I have been back to my normal cleansing regimen for a while now</li>
            <li> The smell is overpowering and for a facial cleanser to be listed for sensitive skin and then to be so completely drying, flabbergasts me.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to be gentle enough, though I did worry a little about the foaming agent.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and usually only let the water beads wash my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t break out with it on, it makes my skin so smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I have since stopped using the SFS at night and now only use the sensitive cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this organic sensitive facial cleanser for my acne prone sensitive skin because I have been breaking out along my mouth recently.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acure Organic&#x27;s Sensitive Facial Cleanser for about a week</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with my products, too much</li>
            <li> , I feel like I have a nice arsenal of products without a lot of the scary additives.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting worse, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better.</li>
            <li> If you want to use something natural in your face regimen get the DoTERRA family physician kit that has pure tea tree oil, frankensense, and other essential oils that are PURE and UNDILUTED with crap and are good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I normally have dry flaky skin</li>
            <li> but after a month of using this and changing nothing else in my skincare routine, my skin is SUPER flaky and dry and feels really tight after washing.</li>
            <li> (please excuse my spelling, it is too early to look things</li>
            <li> Very expensive and does not work any better than Cetaphil which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review, I just wanted to warm people about these products, and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to think I didn&#x27;t give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this cleanser for those with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t have bad reaction after using it for 2 weeks which is a good sign.</li>
            <li> A gentle cleanser that actually foams (a little) and takes all of your makeup off!</li>
            <li> I use the scrub about 2-3 times a week and this sensitive cleanser the other days.</li>
            <li> While they are pricey - a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Truly natural, rather than the label saying &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; only to read a hidden list of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> no regrets buy the product with your eyes closed.</li>
            <li> The combination of ingredients has done wonders for my dry winter skin and actually makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive combination skin with some little acne problem.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to break out with my oily skin but everything seems to be better, no breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few mild breakouts on my forehead and chin while using this, nothing too serious, but I didn&#x27;t seem to have issue with the last soap I was using.</li>
            <li> The face creams give me zero trouble as far as breaking out goes.</li>
            <li> I had contacted acure 2 weeks in and they assured me that it takes a while for your pores to &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; the toxic build up from previous cleansers.. I used it for another 2 weeks and send another email to the company, and it was word for word the same answer, different person.</li>
            <li> Also comes out of the tube quickly, at least when it&#x27;s full, so it makes it hard to ration the tiny bottle!</li>
            <li> Despite the thickness and feeling of greasiness while washing my face, it leaves it feeling rather dry, which I like.</li>
            <li> it was a dry, patchy</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing during the cold winter months!</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 bottles so far in the past 6ish months and have no plans of using another face wash product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin less red and irritated.</li>
            <li> For the same results I could use something like cetaphil and spend half the amount.</li>
            <li> Everything they make is free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives, mineral oil and artificial colors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently spent a week vacation on a yacht cruise.</li>
            <li> But not much to write about otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now in conjunction with the facial cream</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as they say.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels tight or dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I have to remind myself that I need to put my serums and moisturizer on because I&#x27;m so used to my dry skin feeling tight and pulled.</li>
            <li> Only thing is not sure about how the sensitivity in my face changed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;more of it and any other Acure products I come across.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother me on the other side.</li>
            <li> I went back to my usual skin care product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even wash my face easily with a face cloth because the pimples are so painful.</li>
            <li> After a week of use my skin became dry and almost stiff.  </li>
            <li> which is a bit frustrating, but it&#x27;s not too hard to gently wipe off with a cloth while my face is still wet.</li>
            <li> a small amount goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> My skin is so touchy and in the past I would wash my face with the sensitive face cleanser, then moisturize with the seriously firming serum.</li>
            <li> It lasts a while as well, because you only have to use a very small amount of it each time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still not even half empty.&lt;br /&gt;Now,</li>
            <li> Fewer bumps and redness after less than a week of use.</li>
            <li> typically use Andalou Age</li>
            <li> Less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have to keep it simple with moisturizing and cleansing-  hard to find these days!  </li>
            <li> Organics products are made without all the bad for you chemicals, which is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is mild and non offensive.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and you only need a smudge on your forehead and chin - add water and it lathers up fantastically.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and doesn&#x27;t try out my skin.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, I am anti-parabens, phalates, etc., etc in my everyday products</li>
            <li> After using it for two or three days, I had dry patches and small hard bumps on my chin.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty bad and makes my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I got it randomly when looking for a face wash that had as few chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have clear skin and hate when it gets red and irritated</li>
            <li> I like it but not love it, its creamy not foamy.</li>
            <li> I use this after I scrub to get any excessive makeup or skin off.</li>
            <li> When I say it takes off makeup, it takes it off with very little effort and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind (like stubborn eyeliner or mascara, which I usually have to remove after I wash my face).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> I have perioral dermatitis which only flares up in the cold winters here in Utah.</li>
            <li> the ingredients as usual with the Acure Organics brand!</li>
            <li> no more chemicals and toxins for me!</li>
            <li> Seriously THANK YOU, Acure.</li>
            <li> Usually by now, every other face wash just stops working, gives me a bunch of disgusting white heads, or turns my face into a prune.</li>
            <li> I have never had such bad breakouts as what I had after using acure.</li>
            <li> These are not good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any negative comments concerning the smell but woof!</li>
            <li> Again not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> I trusted the staff as they assured me this was the purging process, but it went on and got worse with time.</li>
            <li> the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non irritating, non drying for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acure</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s no harsh nasty stuff in it, and</li>
            <li> Well, I was WAY wrong.</li>
            <li> I have had such a terrible experience with this product and the company that I feel like I need to share.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this cleanser and cannot go without it.</li>
            <li> I have a makeup that feels grainy when I put it on and hated it because it hurt a little.  </li>
            <li> In my research into skincare products, I&#x27;ve read that a tingle from a cleanser is usually a bad thing, as it is a sign of an ingredient that irritates the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells really bad.</li>
            <li> So bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff literally smells awful.</li>
            <li> as well as all the anti-aging creams that contain things I don&#x27;t need because of the Retin-A- always with terrible results.</li>
            <li> What happened to my skin was disgusting.</li>
            <li> but my skin is still recovering from these terrible products.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience, and if you have acne</li>
            <li> I did, and it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was ok for me.  I just did not feel my face was getting fully clean.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin at all.  Also a great value -- It&#x27;s far better than more expensive products that claim too be for sensitive skin and don&#x27;t work as well.  It lasts a while as well, because you only have to use a very small amount of it each time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful face cleanser and it takes off eye makeup better than any eye makeup remover I have used.</li>
            <li> Gentle and seems good for my skin. Pleasant and safe to use.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t have much if any foam. It works well on my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth. My skin never feels tight or dry after using it. The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for is the scent. I can&#x27;t describe it actually. It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or citrus, etc and it isn&#x27;t strong......it just is kind of has a medicinal smell which isn&#x27;t strong. I highly recommend this product though and will purchase again and am getting used to the scent.</li>
            <li> FINALLY I found a perfect face wash. I have combination skin (adult acne, a bit of dryness, redness, etc.) and have tried basically everything from intense acne-fighting products, tea tree oil washes, a whole range of natural products, cetaphil, and on and on. This is the first product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way AND cleans thoroughly. It feels luxurious and soft going on, there is no fragrance (huge plus since even a lot of natural products are strongly scented for some reason), and the price is on point. I have gone through 3 bottles so far in the past 6ish months and have no plans of using another face wash product. I would highly recommend for basically any skin type.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and seems to be removing my long wear liquid foundation quite well. Leaves my face feeling clean without being tight or over dry.&lt;br /&gt;Love the ingredients as usual with the Acure Organics brand!</li>
            <li> This cleaned my face well and always removed my makeup. Had no issues.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and its mild. Smell ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with all Acure products. This is the only facial cleanser I&#x27;ll use. Great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost nine months and so have probably a month&#x27;s worth of product left. It works well to clean the face of sebum, dirt and makeup without drying the skin. Also, it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all, and you can&#x27;t beat the ingredients (although the token ingredients aren&#x27;t even close to the top of the list).  However, being blessed with hormonal acne, the creamy formula is too heavy to clean my pores out. I just use it as my morning cleanser and use a more effective cleanser in the evening. I don&#x27;t regret buying at all, but might buy the Acure Superfruit when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I finally found the one fricken face wash that won&#x27;t irritate my face and make me look like a pizza.&lt;br /&gt;The BEST thing about this product: the value. It is highly concentrated and I literally use a pea size amount twice a day. I bought this months ago and it&#x27;s still not even half empty.&lt;br /&gt;Now, don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;pretty and simple\\&quot; look of this product make you not want to try it if you&#x27;re a dude because this stuff is GODLIKE. It has made a huge difference on my face and I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now. Usually by now, every other face wash just stops working, gives me a bunch of disgusting white heads, or turns my face into a prune. Don&#x27;t EVER stop making this stuff; this has got to have been crafted by magical face fairies. This company knows what it&#x27;s doing. The price is also amazing because like I said, it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;I initially decided to try this because I got an e-mail with a coupon. This is the only thing that works for my face (after trying out a million things for years) and keeps it acne free for good unless I start eating a bunch of junk, in which case, no organic or chemical-laden face wash will be able to control. Speaking of chemical-laden, this doesn&#x27;t have ANY of that junk in it and it&#x27;s really truly only good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5; will continue to buy forever as I don&#x27;t need anything else because this just simply works in all aspects. Seriously THANK YOU, Acure. You guys have the magic touch.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser and make up remover.....</li>
            <li> Performance is excellent! Smell is so-so. This is a very gentle and effective cleanser. My face feels soft and clean after using it and it seems to plump up my skin so it doesn&#x27;t sag. I wish it smelled better, but It washes off completely so the scent never lingers. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin love it no break out etc</li>
            <li> Works good and clears the face right up. Only thing is not sure about how the sensitivity in my face changed.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night and it is a wonderful product! My skin is so touchy and in the past I would wash my face with the sensitive face cleanser, then moisturize with the seriously firming serum. I have since stopped using the SFS at night and now only use the sensitive cleanser. My face feels so great, and even though I don&#x27;t put a moisturizer on after, my face still feels moisturized. Great product/s!</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with sensitive skin. Having read many of the reviews, I ordered this face cleaner. After using it for two or three days, I had dry patches and small hard bumps on my chin. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to Christina Moss face wash.</li>
            <li> a small amount goes a long way!  i use a pea size to wash my face and neck and it lathers up amazingly and leave your skin bright, silky soft.  I use the whole range and from cleanser, moisturizer and serum.  no regrets buy the product with your eyes closed.</li>
            <li> I loving this!  I got it randomly when looking for a face wash that had as few chemicals as possible.  It really does lower the sensitivity of my skin.  I have a makeup that feels grainy when I put it on and hated it because it hurt a little.  But after I used this was it did not bother me at all to put on that makeup.  I will keep buying for now.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it an likes it.</li>
            <li> Great wash and skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> A gentle cleanser that actually foams (a little) and takes all of your makeup off! I love that my skin feels less irritated and never dry. I have been using this before the Acure sensitive face cream and am noticing wonderful results in my skin. Fewer bumps and redness after less than a week of use. Try Acure if you are looking for an affordable, effective, natural skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I use Acure&#x27;s face cream and love it so I thought for sure I would like their Sensitive Facial Cleanser. Well, I was WAY wrong. This stuff literally smells awful. The smell is overpowering and for a facial cleanser to be listed for sensitive skin and then to be so completely drying, flabbergasts me. I would not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use Andalou Age Defying facial cleanser and absolutely love it. I just wanted to give me skin a break, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> Very nice lather with this exfoliating cleanser.  It is gentle enough to use frequently.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best facial cleanser on the market. It&#x27;s an extra bonus that it is so affordable too. I have incredibly sensitive skin and have used all sorts of products over the years, many have burned my skin or caused hives. After the formulation was changed on my last skin care regimen causing me a severe allergic reaction (dermoligica) I went searching for something that was really pure and wouldn&#x27;t cause another episode. The sales staff at Whole Foods turned me onto the Acure sensitive line. However, my store does not always have in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser has a slight floral scent, not perfume-y though, just clean. It doesn&#x27;t really suds up, more of a slick cream. I love it and follow up with the Acure sensitive moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facial cleanser. I use it every day. Despite the thickness and feeling of greasiness while washing my face, it leaves it feeling rather dry, which I like.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! It actually gets all my makeup off, even mascara, yet leaves my skin moisturized and soothed. Not kidding, this is the best facial cleanser I have ever used, including some pretty high end brands.</li>
            <li> Washes off makeup. Smells like nothing. Makes my skin less red and irritated. Less breakouts. Found my perfect face wash!</li>
            <li> Cleanses my skin of 99% of my makeup (nothing seems to get it off completely the first time!) and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I have to remind myself that I need to put my serums and moisturizer on because I&#x27;m so used to my dry skin feeling tight and pulled.</li>
            <li> Again not happy with the smell. I am getting picky with the acure products but some of the products are awesome!!</li>
            <li> I am 60+ though feel and look much younger.  I have used Retin-A on my face for many years, and have made the mistake of falling for all the exfoliating cleansers, scrubs, etc. as well as all the anti-aging creams that contain things I don&#x27;t need because of the Retin-A- always with terrible results. I keep having to remember that less is sometimes more!  I easily can have the reaction to products ofI my face puffing up, or my eyes watering, my face burns, etc. because it&#x27;s already sensitized. I have to keep it simple with moisturizing and cleansing-  hard to find these days!  I ordered this because of the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; label but had my doubts.  I now find after one tube (and now re-ordering) that it is perfect for me!  No heavy scent, nice texture, no big lathering, leaves my skin soft and ready for a moisturizer, and absolutely NO irritation!  Truly natural, rather than the label saying &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; only to read a hidden list of chemicals.  A good find- I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> Acure Organics Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Argan Oil, from my very first application, seems to be just&lt;br /&gt;the gentle cleanser I had been seeking.  It is gentle yet has a sudsy/foamy consistency which leaves my&lt;br /&gt;complexion, clean, moist and soft.  It certainly exceeds the results of some of the more popular and&lt;br /&gt;expensive cleansers of today.  Acure is a wonderful complement to the economical bottle of high quality&lt;br /&gt;argan oil I purchased from another company on Amazon. I highly recommend this product, will purchase&lt;br /&gt;more of it and any other Acure products I come across.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after reading the rave reviews.  I did not notice any negative comments concerning the smell but woof! this cleanser has a strong and acrid stink, like fermented cabbage.</li>
            <li> Another great Acure product, my skin changed, I always had red blotches and now they are gone, my skin is silky and smooth!the first time I used it I noticed how my lips were very very soft, a must for before applying lipstick. I was afraid to break out with my oily skin but everything seems to be better, no breakouts at all. After washing my face I use the Acure argan oil, its been wonderful. Also, I used it to wash my ear because I got a new piercing and it is great, very gentle and has helped my healing ever since I switched from regular soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to this product and I can&#x27;t say so much about the benefits. But I do noticed that it feels so smooth after washing my face. I used it twice a day. Honestly, Not so crazy about the scent and it doesn&#x27;t bother me on the other side. and my skin doesn&#x27;t have bad reaction after using it for 2 weeks which is a good sign. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It feels and smells very good, is light.  Hasn&#x27;t made me break out as so many things do.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser. It is very thick and you only need a smudge on your forehead and chin - add water and it lathers up fantastically. The first time I used it, I applied it to my whole face, didn&#x27;t like the texture AT ALL, got in the shower, added water and realized I had just wasted a lot of it. Just use a tiny bit. Try with a pea size dab and go from there. It makes my skin incredibly soft. I have ordered some other organic skin care products that I will be trying but for now, this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Goes on well and is creamy, does a great job of cleansing, it says unscented but does have a slight clay like smell to it but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great smell, keeps skin clear, safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and does not work any better than Cetaphil which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> My favorite, and now I&#x27;ve got my bf hooked too. It makes our faces feel smooth. One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least a week.  It is very gentle on my skin.  The smell is not too pungent.  I know it&#x27;s fragrance free, but I believe that just means they don&#x27;t add any perfumes or fragrances.  The natural fragrance is tolerable, where most natural products have a very strong smell.  It is very soft feeling on my skin and I like the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this organic sensitive facial cleanser for my acne prone sensitive skin because I have been breaking out along my mouth recently. I have perioral dermatitis which only flares up in the cold winters here in Utah. I was using the Neutrogena Natural facewash which was \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but not all natural, which I wanted. I decided to switch to this cleanser after reading all the great reviews about it. It is truly organic which I absolutely love. I started using it about 5 days ago and have noticed a significant difference in my skin. The breakouts around my mouth have fully cleared up and my skin seems to have a much cleaner feeling after I wash it in the morning and night with this cleanser. However, it does not get 100% of my mascara off which is a bit frustrating, but it&#x27;s not too hard to gently wipe off with a cloth while my face is still wet. With this product, you do not need a whole bunch of it to wash your entire face which is nice since it is a bit pricey for 4 ounces. I use a pea sized amount, rub it in my hands with some water and it lathers right up.  I would highly recommend buying this product if you have acne prone sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleanser.  It leaves my face nice and clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to burn or itch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product for others, but it did nothing for my skin, which is normal for me. It has a light scent and feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Acure Organics products, and this is no exception. I love how soft this makes my skin feel. I am also so happy to find a product that is made from natural ingredients and that works as well as this does. And it&#x27;s unscented...yay! Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I recently spent a week vacation on a yacht cruise. Since the waste water from the boat went directly into the ocean, I wanted to make sure I was being environmentally conscious and use only biodegradable products. After searching Amazon and reading many reviews, I decided to purchase Acure Sensitive Facial Cleanser for my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product had a nice, slightly thick, but easy to spread consistency and little to no scent. When I applied the product to my face, I was surprised that it made my skin tingle a bit. In my research into skincare products, I&#x27;ve read that a tingle from a cleanser is usually a bad thing, as it is a sign of an ingredient that irritates the skin. My skin seemed fine after cleansing, with no inflammation, but I would be hesitant to recommend this product to someone with really sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it seems like a fine cleanser, but it didn&#x27;t really stand out except for the fact that it is biodegradable. The price is OK for the amount of product you get, but for daily cleansing, I&#x27;ll stick to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and Cerave Foaming.</li>
            <li> I wanted a paraben-free cleanser without a ton of ingredients from the &amp;#34;Dirty Dozen&amp;#34; and I have also had great experiences using other Acure products.  This face wash is so lovely! It takes of makeup and leaves my skin clean but not dry.  When I say it takes off makeup, it takes it off with very little effort and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind (like stubborn eyeliner or mascara, which I usually have to remove after I wash my face).  The smell is so nice and you only need a small amount to get the job done.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!! I just use a teeny bit and it lathers up my face and feels wonderful! I have 3 eye diseases in my eyes...I need a product that will not add to the problem so I reasearch and found this one.....no more chemicals and toxins for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, light smelling, and does what it says it will do without using completely harsh chemicals.  I like it and am sure I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> --------&lt;br /&gt;INTRO&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;Love Acure products and their purity, that is by far the most critical piece in Acure products. As natural becomes more and more sought-after, pure and clean without sacrificing quality is almost required these days and that&#x27;s where Acure excels and makes their products exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;About 60-65% of whatever goes on your skin also goes straight through to your bloodstream. People often forget that our skin is our largest organ and we need to protect it just as we need to protect our internal organs. There are zero harmful ingredients in their line of products and they travel the globe in search for the highest quality ingredients. Everything they make is free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives, mineral oil and artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Acure products are also gluten-free, 100% vegan and free from animal cruelty, which should be huge for any consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and usually only let the water beads wash my face. Once in a while I will use a Cetaphil cleanser because of how sensitive it is on my skin. I received this product to test and review and I get very hesitant putting anything on my face. I have clear skin and hate when it gets red and irritated so I am very cautious on what I use on my face. After a month of using this product, I wish I had more so I will be buying a bottle or two. Its that good. Very sensitive, pure, free and effective. It does not make my face irritated in any way, shape or form nor does it break my skin out or cause it to become dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;* sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben free&lt;br /&gt;* Gluten free&lt;br /&gt;* PEG free&lt;br /&gt;* Petroleum free&lt;br /&gt;* Phthalate free&lt;br /&gt;* Silicone free&lt;br /&gt;* Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;* 100% biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;* All skin types&lt;br /&gt;* Recyclable packaging&lt;br /&gt;* Unscented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I cannot think of any while using such a pure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.------  DISCLOSURE  ------------  I was supplied a sample of this product for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. A little bit goes a long way. It is very creamy and my face feels so smooth when I get done washing my face. I use the scrub about 2-3 times a week and this sensitive cleanser the other days. Love!!</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone skin. Good gentle lather. Lasts a long time. Creamy texture</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and doesn&#x27;t try out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for 2 years and love it. It cleans without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acure Organic&#x27;s Sensitive Facial Cleanser for about a week and I already notice a huge difference in the texture and condition of my skin.I am in my mid-thirties and have begun to notice signs of aging and dryness. I have tried various organic cleansers and this by far is my favorite due to the quality and reasonable price.  The combination of ingredients has done wonders for my dry winter skin and actually makes my skin glow. This cleanser is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped. The smell is pleasant and the texture is foamy and luxurious. I would definitely recommend this cleanser for those with dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did not like this facial cleaner...it was creamier than I like.</li>
            <li> I have had such a terrible experience with this product and the company that I feel like I need to share. Anybody who has sensitive and acne prone skin should stay away from acure products. I had used this for a month against my better judgement. I had contacted acure 2 weeks in and they assured me that it takes a while for your pores to &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; the toxic build up from previous cleansers.. I used it for another 2 weeks and send another email to the company, and it was word for word the same answer, different person. They&#x27;re told what to say to you to get you to buy the product. What happened to my skin was disgusting. Acne has never been a HUGE problem for me, but acure caused it to be a huge problem. It clogged every pore in my face. Visibly clogged. There were white dots and spots all over my face. I also NEVER got cystic acne but 2 weeks into using this product I began to get it... a tiny pimple here and there turned into cystic pimples all over my face with this product. I trusted the staff as they assured me this was the purging process, but it went on and got worse with time. I have been back to my normal cleansing regimen for a while now but my skin is still recovering from these terrible products. I have never had such bad breakouts as what I had after using acure. I can&#x27;t even wash my face easily with a face cloth because the pimples are so painful. I have had a terrible experience, and if you have acne prone skin STAY AWAY. These companies try to lure you in claiming the products are safe and natural and your skin will be better off for using them, but in fact a lot of natural products include shea butter, or some type of wax or butter derived from a plant. These are not good for acne prone skin. Several of Acure&#x27;s face products that claim to be safe for sensitive or acne prone skin have shea butter in them. If you want to use something natural in your face regimen get the DoTERRA family physician kit that has pure tea tree oil, frankensense, and other essential oils that are PURE and UNDILUTED with crap and are good for acne prone skin. Sorry for the long review, I just wanted to warm people about these products, and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to think I didn&#x27;t give it a chance. I did, and it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry, sensitive skin!. Love this line of products.</li>
            <li> I was using it over few weeks from now and this  is the best facial cleanser ever. It is removes my make up(not waterproof mascara!) very easy and leaves my skin very clean and soft. For the best result I use a toner right after cleansing my face. And now I use Acure Marula oil after toner. This my way :). My skin looks perfect now.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I am 35 years old and I have sensitive combination skin with some little acne problem.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to be gentle enough, though I did worry a little about the foaming agent.  After a week of use my skin became dry and almost stiff.  I went back to my usual skin care product it will probably take a week or so of consistent use for the problem to go away.  I have mature, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle and it&#x27;s great with my very mild rosacea. I highly recommend this cleanser and the Acure product line.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.  I love that it is good for my skin and it&#x27;s no harsh nasty stuff in it, and I can see an improvement in my complexion.  I use this twice a day and it last a good while as you only need a little.  A little goes a long way as they say.</li>
            <li> Love it, will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser... being natural makes me love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sensitive skin cleanser. But not much to write about otherwise. No break-outs. Not itchy. Creamy cleanser. Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I like it but not love it, its creamy not foamy.</li>
            <li> I use this after I scrub to get any excessive makeup or skin off. Very gentle. Usually sensitive facial cleansers (in my case) have come out really creamy with no l&amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; and it would cause more pore congestion. I LOVE THIS CLEANSER. It leaves my skin soft, but also NATURALLY suds up and you really get a nice, clean, non-stripped face!</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing during the cold winter months!</li>
            <li> Really like this cleanser as I have difficulty finding a cleanser gentle enough for my very sensitive skin. It has a pleasant scent and made my skin feel very soft. Also rinsed off quite easily. Will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive/dry skin during the winter</li>
            <li> I have dry, aging skin with mild rosacea so I have to be careful with my products, too much and the rosacea acts up.  On the flip side, I am anti-parabens, phalates, etc., etc in my everyday products (please excuse my spelling, it is too early to look things up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began this year with a really lovely facial where the aesthetician told me that I needed some major exfoliation.  The goodness I am putting on after cleansing is not as effective because I have a buildup of dead skins cells that the products cannot penetrate.  Gross, but I knew she was telling the truth, my skin felt fine after moisturizing, but right out of the shower it was a dry, patchy mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, lovely facial and super mild, every day exfoilator later, I added this creamy goodness as my cleanser and it is so nice.  My skin feels so smooth and not at all dry after cleansing.  Even my fiance noticed how smooth and fresh my skin looked without being prompted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am psyched to find the Acure line, I feel like I have a nice arsenal of products without a lot of the scary additives.  Splurge on a facial for diagnosis and then trust Acure.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this cleanser (creamy but foams up really nicely) and feel that it does a good job of cleansing and removing sunscreen/makeup but it&#x27;s definitely super drying. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient causes that but after a month of using this and changing nothing else in my skincare routine, my skin is SUPER flaky and dry and feels really tight after washing. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This cleanser feels great and smells great! I&#x27;m still giving it time to work but loving the trial period. Honestly, my sons skin is extremely sensitive and I even used it in his hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot sing the praises of Acure as a brand enough. I am obsessed with this cleanser and cannot go without it. It&#x27;s so calming and hydrating, and keeps my skin clear and glowing! I keep receiving compliments on my skin ever since I began using this line. It&#x27;s a life-changer!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I bought my first tube from a health food store. It is amazing on my skin. I have so many allergies including to products that smell. This one has a scent but it must be purely organic because I do not react to it. It smells really good to me. My face is so smooth and silky afterwards too. I normally have dry flaky skin so the transformation was totally unexpected. The more I use it, the more amazing my skin feels. Now if I can just find a body lotion that works the same way.</li>
            <li> Great sensitive facial cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend for makeup removal, but as a gentle cleanser, this is one of the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non irritating, non drying for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acure Organics products are made without all the bad for you chemicals, which is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is mild and non offensive. Just smells like a cleanser, not bad at all!</li>
            <li> If you have dry/sensitive skin this product is fantastic. It cleans without stripping your face and leaves it very soft and smooth. Great price, as it&#x27;s a bit ore expensive at places like Whole Foods (when not on sale).</li>
            <li> This cleanser does wonders for the skin.  It left mine feeling smooth and looking clean and refreshed and even young.  However, even though, I did my best and never got it in my eyes as I was washing my face, it would just burn my eyes something awful.  I&#x27;d wakeup with my eyes all bloodshot from the sting of this lotion.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the scent causing it or what.  But this stuff burns my eyes.  So I no longer use it.</li>
            <li> Smells really bad. So bad. But totally does the job and leaves my skin feeling clean in a normal way - much better than just water (too drying) or other cleansers that can leave residue or feel too tightening. Also comes out of the tube quickly, at least when it&#x27;s full, so it makes it hard to ration the tiny bottle!</li>
            <li> This smelled very funky.  I did not bother returning it but will not be using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now in conjunction with the facial cream and I&#x27;m overall unimpressed. I have sensitive, uneven skin that becomes easily inflamed and I was hoping these products would help. While I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin getting worse, it hasn&#x27;t gotten any better. The label suggests that it evens skin tone and reduces redness but this hasn&#x27;t been the case for me. It also smells pretty bad and makes my skin feel greasy. For the same results I could use something like cetaphil and spend half the amount. The lack of chemicals is really the only reason I would consider using it after this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I have super super sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using the Acure eye cream, day cream, and night cream now for months. If you haven&#x27;t tried those, you should definitely give them a chance. They&#x27;ve really turned my skin around. While they are pricey - a little really does go a long way. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I don&#x27;t break out with it on, it makes my skin so smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe. So I totally feel that those creams are worth every penny. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin from those three. The results of those is what made me try this wash. I bought and used two tubes of this wash, so I feel after two tubes that my review is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I was with their face creams, but instead I found that it&#x27;s only been okay, but not worth the price in my opinion. I&#x27;ve had a few mild breakouts on my forehead and chin while using this, nothing too serious, but I didn&#x27;t seem to have issue with the last soap I was using. So I&#x27;ve gone back to Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Tea Tree Oil Soap (the orange bottle). It keeps me from breaking out a lot better than this soap does. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of years and really does the trick. And because their creams work so well, I feel I don&#x27;t really need the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I found the perfect balance using Dr Bronner&#x27;s tea tree wash, and then using the Acure face creams. The face creams give me zero trouble as far as breaking out goes. I think that this Acure face wash was just a little too strong for my face. At any rate, I don&#x27;t like fighting the forehead pimples if I don&#x27;t need to. The body wash (in the green tube) is too strong for me too, made my arms and back break out. I tried the sensitive skin body wash, and it seemed to irritate my skin too. So I went back to Kiss My Face olive oil soap. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Seems gentle.  It has only been two days of use on my face, so I cannot see results yet, but as soon as I do I will let you all know.</li>
