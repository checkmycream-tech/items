    <ol>
            <li>perfect for ladies AND gentlemen!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great to keep in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>It is a great camping brush and mirror in a pinch though.</li>
            <li>As someone who is always on a plane, this brush fit perfectly in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>Compact but folds out nicely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>very compact and great for travel</li>
            <li>It \\&quot;could\\&quot; be designed much better.</li>
            <li>I would love to find one that doesn&#x27;t REEK of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Thinking that it was because it was enclosed in the packaging the strong odor would go away, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>After 5 days the odor was still as strong.</li>
            <li>Otherwise brush portion works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of cheap smelly plastic.  </li>
            <li>Anyway still handy and able to fit in my tiny purse.</li>
            <li>This brush is the perfect size for small purses, but the chemical smell was over powering.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money but without rubberized balls on the end</li>
            <li>Handle broke off very first time used.</li>
            <li>Unusable, smelled like they were right out of an oil can.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The second one isn&#x27;t holding up any better.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for - the mirror is the bonus.</li>
            <li>How can something have such a strong smell, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>As I like to travel a light as possible.</li>
            <li>Sigh... and to think I was originally so excited to order this since I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it in my local stores to replace another faithful compact brush I&#x27;d had for years.</li>
            <li>Strong rubber smell as noted in other reviews.</li>
            <li>well.. a new goodyear tire.  </li>
            <li>If they&#x27;d just put a small metal pin in there it would be much better design.</li>
            <li>Just the brush half works fine on</li>

            <li> Just the brush half works fine on</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth driving to the PO to mail it back.  </li>
            <li> I have used these brushes in the past but couldn&#x27;t find them in the local stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth contacting the seller</li>
            <li> I chucked the handle part and just carry the brush half in my backpack.</li>
            <li> this is a little uncomfortable if you have a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> The bristles broke off when you folded the brush for travel and the handle portion that has the mirror broke off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad of chemicals that I would not dare use it and certainly won&#x27;t put it in my purse.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell is awful and penetrates into everything in the bag you decide to carry it in, as well as on your hands after touching it.</li>
            <li> I was very unsatified and disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I only bothered to use it in desperate times because of this smell.</li>
            <li> Because of the poor pivot design the handle and brush halves come apart every time I open/close it.</li>
            <li> This product is not that bad.</li>
            <li> It stunk so bad I had to put it in my workshop so it wouldn&#x27;t stink up my shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> They reeked of rubber/car tires so bad that now my dopt kit and everything in it smells.</li>
            <li> I will use it until I find one it doesn&#x27;t smell this bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Strong rubber smell as noted in other reviews. Also handle came off/apart after opening and closing only 3 times. Otherwise brush portion works fine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Handle broke off very first time used.</li>
            <li> This product is not that bad. I was thinking that when u open the item it will automatically open the brizzle of the comb but you have to fold it back and forth. Anyway still handy and able to fit in my tiny purse. thanks</li>
            <li> very compact and great for travel but it smells rubber! I will use it until I find one it doesn&#x27;t smell this bad!</li>
            <li> It smells like petroleum!</li>
            <li> I had no problem with the seller but the product stunk...literally.  It stunk so bad I had to put it in my workshop so it wouldn&#x27;t stink up my shaving kit.  It&#x27;s made of cheap smelly plastic.  If the foul odor doesn&#x27;t dissipate, I&#x27;ll just throw it out.  It&#x27;s not worth contacting the seller and it&#x27;s not worth driving to the PO to mail it back.  Lesson learned.  You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Six months later, I threw it out.  Junk.</li>
            <li> If combs are not working for you, consider trying one of these folding pocket hair brushes. I have used these brushes in the past but couldn&#x27;t find them in the local stores so I was happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Compact but folds out nicely. Great to keep in pocket or purse. Designed for men or women.</li>
            <li> I was very unsatified and disappointed in this product. The bristles broke off when you folded the brush for travel and the handle portion that has the mirror broke off after a few uses. I see why they are sold in a pack of two. The second one isn&#x27;t holding up any better.</li>
            <li> The design is what I was looking for, but it smells like.. well.. a new goodyear tire.  I&#x27;m hoping the smell goes away soon!</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect size for small purses, but the chemical smell was over powering. Thinking that it was because it was enclosed in the packaging the strong odor would go away, it didn&#x27;t. I even tried washing it and leaving it out side to air out. After 5 days the odor was still as strong. The only place this brush ever ended up traveling was to the trash bin.</li>
            <li> I bought four and returned them all. They reeked of rubber/car tires so bad that now my dopt kit and everything in it smells. How can something have such a strong smell, I don&#x27;t know. I did notice a gooey substance inside the ribber struts leeching out, but smell seems to eminate from entire back. Two of the hinges don&#x27;t work. These are junk.</li>
            <li> As someone who is always on a plane, this brush fit perfectly in my shaving kit. As I like to travel a light as possible. This brush does the trick.</li>
            <li> Flimsy but at this price part of the disposable economy.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money but without rubberized balls on the end this is a little uncomfortable if you have a sensitive scalp.  It is a great camping brush and mirror in a pinch though.</li>
            <li> Because of the poor pivot design the handle and brush halves come apart every time I open/close it. If they&#x27;d just put a small metal pin in there it would be much better design. I chucked the handle part and just carry the brush half in my backpack. Just the brush half works fine on it&#x27;s own. It \\&quot;could\\&quot; be designed much better.</li>
            <li> Unusable, smelled like they were right out of an oil can.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for - the mirror is the bonus. perfect for ladies AND gentlemen!</li>
            <li> The chemical smell is awful and penetrates into everything in the bag you decide to carry it in, as well as on your hands after touching it. I only bothered to use it in desperate times because of this smell. Even so, after the 10th or so time of using it after buying it 7 months ago, it broke apart at the hinge when I opened it. Sigh... and to think I was originally so excited to order this since I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it in my local stores to replace another faithful compact brush I&#x27;d had for years.</li>
            <li> This brush and the packaging smells like it has been stored in a car shop or soaked in motor oil for years. I tried soaking it in a bleach/detergent/warm water solution that did nothing. I rubbed it with peppermint oil and let it sit for hours, but that also did nothing to help the smell. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I have waited to make comments...hoping the smell would go away.  It smells so bad of chemicals that I would not dare use it and certainly won&#x27;t put it in my purse. You can smell it sitting on the table when just walking by it in the room. I DO NOT recommend this item. I would love to find one that doesn&#x27;t REEK of chemicals.</li>
