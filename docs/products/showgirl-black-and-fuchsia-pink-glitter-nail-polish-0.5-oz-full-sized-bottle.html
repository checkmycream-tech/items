    <ol>
            <li>The purple hue it gives off is very attractive.</li>
            <li>When you see it in person you will be so happy!  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the price you pay for great nails!</li>
            <li>I got this for my best friend, and she loved it!</li>
            <li>This glitter polish is even more gorgeous in person!  </li>
            <li>If you love glitter and beautiful colors then u need to buy these polishes.</li>
            <li>another very nice color can do so many things with this color.</li>
            <li>Love club colors!</li>
            <li>The application takes some patience, but the end result is nice.</li>
            <li>I am super Happy and will buy more of these</li>
            <li>love thid polish kb never fails me and its as easy to apply and as beautiful as the pictures shown</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of KBShimmer polishes for Christmas presents this year and love how packed they are with glitter.</li>
            <li>As most glitter polishes, it will take a couple of coats and and top coat.</li>
            <li>Wonderful semi sheer black background with awesome pink and silver chunky glitters</li>
            <li>It also looks good with a matte top coat -- the glitter really pops against a matte black background.</li>
            <li>Wow, I love this mixture.</li>
            <li>so you have to kind of get a big glob and spread it around, but its a pretty color.</li>
            <li>It is super cute, and even though I normally don&#x27;t wear black, this is something I would defiantly consider putting on!</li>
            <li>I LOVE using one coat over black gel polish for a subtle pop and see so many uses in the future.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I&#x27;m very pleased with this polish.</li>
            <li>It can be a little hard to get on, but you just need to warm it up a bit</li>
            <li>I put a coat of plain black polish underneath, so I wouldn&#x27;t need too many coats.</li>

            <li> However, in order to get it opaque as shown in the picture, you either have to apply four coats or else apply two coats of black or dark red first, then two coats of this color.</li>
            <li> I like that flecks are oddly shaped and doesn&#x27;t look like regular glitter.</li>
            <li> NOT what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really a dark purple with multicolored flecks.  </li>
            <li> Time to explore other colors!</li>
            <li> I already had a coat of black on my nails</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s black and fuchsia</li>
            <li> Its hard to get the sparkles on your nails</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I like this shade a lot. However, in order to get it opaque as shown in the picture, you either have to apply four coats or else apply two coats of black or dark red first, then two coats of this color.</li>
            <li> This glitter polish is even more gorgeous in person!  I put a coat of plain black polish underneath, so I wouldn&#x27;t need too many coats. Everywhere I went, people were grabbing my hand to look at my nails. It also looks good with a matte top coat -- the glitter really pops against a matte black background.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this mixture. I&#x27;m not one who paints her nails often, but I wanted to try something different. I already had a coat of black on my nails and I felt that one coat of this polish was enough. I like that flecks are oddly shaped and doesn&#x27;t look like regular glitter. The purple hue it gives off is very attractive. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my nails which I never get. Needless to say I&#x27;m very pleased with this polish. Time to explore other colors!</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s black and fuchsia but it&#x27;s really a dark purple with multicolored flecks.  NOT what I expected.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my best friend, and she loved it! It is super cute, and even though I normally don&#x27;t wear black, this is something I would defiantly consider putting on! It can be a little hard to get on, but you just need to warm it up a bit (instructions should come with bottle). Defiantly something I am going to get for myself sometime!</li>
            <li> Wonderful semi sheer black background with awesome pink and silver chunky glitters</li>
            <li> The polish was quite sticky and definitely didn&#x27;t spread well. The application takes some patience, but the end result is nice. Definitely apply as a topcoat, and not as a jelly.</li>
            <li> If you love glitter and beautiful colors then u need to buy these polishes. The pictures do no justice. When you see it in person you will be so happy!  I am super Happy and will buy more of these</li>
            <li> Its hard to get the sparkles on your nails so you have to kind of get a big glob and spread it around, but its a pretty color.</li>
            <li> another very nice color can do so many things with this color.</li>
            <li> As most glitter polishes, it will take a couple of coats and and top coat. And is also time consuming when removing. But that&#x27;s the price you pay for great nails! Love club colors!</li>
