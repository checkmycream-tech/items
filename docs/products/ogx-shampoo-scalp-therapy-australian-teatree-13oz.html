            <li>Love this shampoo works great!</li>
            <li>After doing some research I learned that tea tree was a good treatment for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light, the lather is the perfect amount, and this also does double-duty with hydrating from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Then I found this brand and their amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has amazing ingredients in it</li>
            <li>Also, the minty smell and the soothing feeling of the shampoo in your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing gets rid of dandruff amazingly</li>
            <li>Even those without problems loved how it feels and how much better their hair looked and all liked the affordable price.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how nice my hair looked after using this shampoo along with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I still haven&#x27;t seen results for my dandruff..</li>
            <li>Though to be honest I didn&#x27;t expect to.</li>
            <li>Worked great first time!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and its consistency.</li>
            <li>I have a type of scalp condition that makes my hair produce a yucky type of oil that most shampoos won&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li>Some were impressed enough to order online before heading home.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it has given me more volume to my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell makes a much better product that works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo so much better.</li>
            <li>and I love that they put them on the front of the bottle with it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has willow bark in it.</li>
            <li>this is a favorite shampoo at our house.</li>
            <li>have bought many bottles and will buy some more.</li>
            <li>but i felt like i was putting in so many chemicals in my hair with this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just more marketing...</li>
            <li>And I love OGX products.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>We will see more this winter when my skin worsens how the shampoo does.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good, but I had to use a lot.</li>
            <li>(I used to be able to go two days without washing), but it&#x27;s worth it to get more moisture to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and find that this is really a great one.</li>
            <li>This one lathers nicely, and is gentle on my kiddos hair!</li>
            <li>However it works fine on my hair</li>
            <li>So my take on it is that it works fine as a shampoo and might be providing me some health benefits to my scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has scalp psoarisis, and it has really helped to heal her scalp, plus it smells great and makes her hair feel so soft and healthy</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that was also sulfate free (since I do color my hair) and learned that Organix products are sulfate free.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fantastic to</li>
            <li>After using this, my hair stays smooth and does not react to the humidity.  </li>
            <li>Either the shampoo fairy stole it or one of my children liked it so much they are hogging it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t affect my allergies too much.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good but my scalp is sensitive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for certain that Tea Tree oil is as great as some people claim, but this OGX shampoo was recommended by my Ophthalmologist (which I thought was kind of strange).  </li>
            <li>Clean, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really clean, and it lathers well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with dandruff like the head and shoulders does.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner just as much as the shampoo and can also recommend using the Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Creme.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus: It leaves my hair soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
            <li>After doing lots of research found that the most beneficial products for such a scalp are all in this lovely product.  </li>
            <li>I used it and my hair was oil free and smelled great and was light and fluffy for the first time in YEARS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first time ever, my scalp is comfortable in winter.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, this new one I&#x27;m trying will be a bit more helpful..</li>
            <li>I did take away one star because it isn&#x27;t great on the whole dry scalp thing.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjuction with OGX&#x27;s morrocan conditioner, which helps keep my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>, i had to switch to a much more natural shampoo that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Winter here can be so drying to skin, and this clears it right up.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle though, my hair enjoys it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the first product that has given me the results I needed.</li>
            <li>First, no it is not organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different things from Head and Shoulders to T-Gel to Burt&#x27;s Bees to homemade concoctions, nothing has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.</li>
            <li>my teen boys love it.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be exactly what I need to treat my scalp and thinning hair problems.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it have a pleasant scent, but even after only about a month of use, I can already see the difference in the quality of my hair!</li>
            <li>Also it didn&#x27;t completely dry out my hair which I love.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells subtle but nice, and feels refreshing to my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo certainly took care of that issue.  </li>
            <li>I gave this shampoo a five star rating because it not only made my scalp and hair look better, soft and shiny the first time I used it, but after a month of using both the shampoo and conditioner, my scalp looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for it</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for this.</li>
            <li>When lathering, it is very soothing,</li>
            <li>One of OGX&#x27;s only cone free &#x27;poos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using H&amp;S almost my whole life</li>
            <li>I really would recommend this shampoo because it helps if you have ichy flacky scalp.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My whole family uses the OGX shampoos and condtioners.</li>
            <li>Just not seeing much difference in that area.</li>
            <li>it left my hair soft and more manageable without using conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it clean my scalp and hair</li>
            <li>This particular one is for dryer scalp.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and suggest the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buy this along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>While this made my hair soft, it didn&#x27;t do much for my scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more manageable (I&#x27;m African American and my hair is almost completely natural</li>
            <li>Love OGX, but this shampoo dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>I had some build up on my scalp and oily, course hair, however, this shampoo removed all the build up on my scalp and made my hair very soft without it looking oily.</li>
            <li>My daughter has allergies to sulfates and has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have mild dandruff enough that if I use regular shampoo my scalp gets itchy.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I have a naturally dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month now (October to November) and for the first time in a long time, my scalp is flake-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it completely cleared up her dandruff.  </li>
            <li>And my hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I also read some research that indicates Tea Tree oil might have medicinal qualities, so at least I feel like I&#x27;m using something better than the run-of-the-mill chemical concoctions sold as shampoo.  </li>
            <li>While the tea tree and neem oils feel refreshing on your scalp, the willow bark seems to be missing, so [technically] there is nothing in this shampoo that is exfoliating your scalp.</li>
            <li>I followed up with the ogx keratin oil conditioner and the ogx macadamia oil intensive moisture mask and a little sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>This shampoo hasn&#x27;t really helped by dry scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li>I just  figured I would have to deal with my gross hair until it fixed itself.</li>
            <li>The bottle can last a long time, especially if you are conscious about how much you use.</li>
            <li>During the fall/winter months, my dry scalp is particularly unmanageable.</li>
            <li>we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I can use that helps my scalp calm down.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, so I have dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li>I only used this shampoo once so far, but I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li>Not only does this shampoo, in combination with the conditioner, moisturize my scalp like no other, it heals any chapping or cracking that does</li>
            <li>My hair was squeaky clean and no more itching!</li>
            <li>The absolute rock bottom price I&#x27;ve found is less than six bucks at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Works wonders for dry scalp and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Teatree oil is the new upcoming active ingredient (they even have a H&amp;S variety with it now)</li>

            <li> I really would recommend this shampoo because it helps if you have ichy flacky scalp.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the OGX shampoos and condtioners.</li>
            <li> Just not seeing much difference in that area.</li>
            <li> it left my hair soft and more manageable without using conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it clean my scalp and hair</li>
            <li> This particular one is for dryer scalp.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and suggest the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buy this along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> While this made my hair soft, it didn&#x27;t do much for my scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more manageable (I&#x27;m African American and my hair is almost completely natural</li>
            <li> Love OGX, but this shampoo dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I had some build up on my scalp and oily, course hair, however, this shampoo removed all the build up on my scalp and made my hair very soft without it looking oily.</li>
            <li> My daughter has allergies to sulfates and has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have mild dandruff enough that if I use regular shampoo my scalp gets itchy.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I have a naturally dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now (October to November) and for the first time in a long time, my scalp is flake-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it completely cleared up her dandruff.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I also read some research that indicates Tea Tree oil might have medicinal qualities, so at least I feel like I&#x27;m using something better than the run-of-the-mill chemical concoctions sold as shampoo.  </li>
            <li> While the tea tree and neem oils feel refreshing on your scalp, the willow bark seems to be missing, so [technically] there is nothing in this shampoo that is exfoliating your scalp.</li>
            <li> I followed up with the ogx keratin oil conditioner and the ogx macadamia oil intensive moisture mask and a little sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> This shampoo hasn&#x27;t really helped by dry scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li> I just  figured I would have to deal with my gross hair until it fixed itself.</li>
            <li> The bottle can last a long time, especially if you are conscious about how much you use.</li>
            <li> During the fall/winter months, my dry scalp is particularly unmanageable.</li>
            <li> we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I can use that helps my scalp calm down.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so I have dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I only used this shampoo once so far, but I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this shampoo, in combination with the conditioner, moisturize my scalp like no other, it heals any chapping or cracking that does</li>
            <li> My hair was squeaky clean and no more itching!</li>
            <li> The absolute rock bottom price I&#x27;ve found is less than six bucks at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for dry scalp and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Teatree oil is the new upcoming active ingredient (they even have a H&amp;S variety with it now)</li>
            <li> While Organix shampoo isn&#x27;t exactly organic, this formula (no SLS, but a few similar ingredients) has done wonders for my incurably dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works on my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> so a lot of it is tightly coiled) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the breakage has lessened considerably.</li>
            <li> My hair seems healthier than it has in a long time even though I haven&#x27;t had a trim in months.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to buying anything other.</li>
            <li> I do not wash my hair daily due to it</li>
            <li> I guess, the shampoo made it dry and flaky, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Now, I have no problems with dry scalp, and my hair has plenty of volume.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve found ways to overcome dry skin on the rest of my body, my scalp has always been a problem.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a shampoo for itchy scalp since my head really started itching pretty badly this winter from the dry conditions.</li>
            <li> This is the time of year when my scalp usually decides that even though it is not snowing outside, there must be white flakes atop my head</li>
            <li> I was using the super expensive Wen tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I go to put this in my wet hair my hair feels rough and dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking dried out at all, even on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> I also apply  Moroccan oil on my hair while its still wet and that helps as well but even so, without the shampoo my hair would still frizz to some degree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen Organix products in various grocery, drug, and big box stores and am super disappointed that Amazon isn&#x27;t offering this via Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> If you have a dry scalp and want moisture without weighing your hair down, try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands with different active ingredients, and nothing has helped.</li>
            <li> Tired it for a few weeks first without conditioner then with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different dandruff shampoos and products recommended by dermatologist without relief and usually lackluster results - plus ruining my hair color.</li>
            <li> It just leaves my hair a little dry</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis so during the cold dry months, my scalp gets very itchy and flakey.</li>
            <li> i had not used this product previously but it did job well.  </li>
            <li> I do however like that my scalp is a lot less itchy and how my hair smells after I use it.</li>
            <li> I am still using this shampoo for my hair because of how it helps my scalp feel less itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li> getting really dried out when I do</li>
            <li> but we found out that 4 pieces to this puzzle are missing.  </li>
            <li> I took them with me this past December and shared with some family members.</li>
            <li> that we can move past that</li>
            <li> so much so, I almost hate to rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I have an angry dry psoriasis scalp that is difficult to deal with.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with an itchy scalp or medium to thin hair since mine is curly  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, this shampoo made my dandruff so uncontrollable</li>
            <li> A bit of a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> In the winter, it gets so bad that it can even crack and bleed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> i had not used this product previously but it did job well.  i was showing signs of an  allergy  and used this product to both heal and stop itching.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has scalp psoarisis, and it has really helped to heal her scalp, plus it smells great and makes her hair feel so soft and healthy</li>
            <li> I have mixed reviews on this shampoo. I love the smell of it and its consistency. When I go to put this in my wet hair my hair feels rough and dry. I wash it out and my hair is in tangles. I have to use a different conditioner from the one that goes with this to bring the moisture back to my hair. I do however like that my scalp is a lot less itchy and how my hair smells after I use it. I am still using this shampoo for my hair because of how it helps my scalp feel less itchy and irritated. I would recommend this product to anyone with an itchy scalp or medium to thin hair since mine is curly  and it didn&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li> Clean, shiny hair. No sulfates or parabens.</li>
            <li> I only used this shampoo once so far, but I will definitely keep using it. I had some build up on my scalp and oily, course hair, however, this shampoo removed all the build up on my scalp and made my hair very soft without it looking oily. This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great product....we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  This one lathers nicely, and is gentle on my kiddos hair!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Tired it for a few weeks first without conditioner then with. Tried daily use and shampooing ever two or three days. Didn&#x27;t work. In fact condition ended up worst than before I started using this product.  I bought Neutrogena&#x27;s  t/sal. Worked great first time!</li>
            <li> I have a type of scalp condition that makes my hair produce a yucky type of oil that most shampoos won&#x27;t get rid of. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologist after dermatologist, trying different creams and prescription strength shampoos. I just  figured I would have to deal with my gross hair until it fixed itself. Until I stumbled upon this at my friends house. I used it and my hair was oil free and smelled great and was light and fluffy for the first time in YEARS. I will never go back to buying anything other.</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo a five star rating because it not only made my scalp and hair look better, soft and shiny the first time I used it, but after a month of using both the shampoo and conditioner, my scalp looks and feels healthier. I suffer from rosecea outbreaks that began going to my scalp and are painful bumps, also causing my scalp to become itchy and scaly. This shampoo not only helped lessen the bumps but the scaly/itchiness has gone. My hair has shine and looks great even though I color it, which I attribute some to using the conditioner in conjunction. I noticed neither strip the hair color. I&#x27;ve tried different dandruff shampoos and products recommended by dermatologist without relief and usually lackluster results - plus ruining my hair color. It may not be organic but it&#x27;s the first product that has given me the results I needed. I LOVE both products! I took them with me this past December and shared with some family members. Even those without problems loved how it feels and how much better their hair looked and all liked the affordable price. Some were impressed enough to order online before heading home.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and suggest the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells subtle but nice, and feels refreshing to my sensitive scalp. The bottle can last a long time, especially if you are conscious about how much you use.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo works great!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a shampoo for itchy scalp since my head really started itching pretty badly this winter from the dry conditions. After doing some research I learned that tea tree was a good treatment for itchy scalp. I was looking for a product that was also sulfate free (since I do color my hair) and learned that Organix products are sulfate free. so I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and I knew I the 1st use that I loved it! Not only has it made my head stop itching it has given me more volume to my curly hair. I do not wash my hair daily due to it getting really dried out when I do and since I have used this product I have seen such a difference in my hair on the 2nd day! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking dried out at all, even on the 2nd day. I have now found the product that I hope I can use forever and never have to switch again. Love the conditioner just as much as the shampoo and can also recommend using the Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Creme. I think I have finally found the combination that works for my hair and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good but my scalp is sensitive I guess, the shampoo made it dry and flaky, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a pleasant scent, but even after only about a month of use, I can already see the difference in the quality of my hair! It&#x27;s much more manageable (I&#x27;m African American and my hair is almost completely natural so a lot of it is tightly coiled) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the breakage has lessened considerably. I think I&#x27;ll be using this shampoo for awhile now.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, so I have dry scalp issues. Before this shampoo, I was always scratching my itchy scalp. Now, I have no problems with dry scalp, and my hair has plenty of volume. I do notice that my hair seems greasier the next day (I used to be able to go two days without washing), but it&#x27;s worth it to get more moisture to my scalp. I use it in conjuction with OGX&#x27;s morrocan conditioner, which helps keep my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shampoo hasn&#x27;t really helped by dry scalp and flakes. A bit of a disappointment for me. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> First, no it is not organic. This product doesn&#x27;t claim to be organic but the name is misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we can move past that, I&#x27;d like to say that I&#x27;ve had problems with my skin since I was in the basinet with cradle cap. While I&#x27;ve found ways to overcome dry skin on the rest of my body, my scalp has always been a problem. I&#x27;ve tried so many different things from Head and Shoulders to T-Gel to Burt&#x27;s Bees to homemade concoctions, nothing has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. During the fall/winter months, my dry scalp is particularly unmanageable. This is the time of year when my scalp usually decides that even though it is not snowing outside, there must be white flakes atop my head 24/7. I have been using this product for a month now (October to November) and for the first time in a long time, my scalp is flake-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: It leaves my hair soft and smelling nice. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo in combination with Organix Macadamia conditioner and the results are something out of a fairy tale.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I have a naturally dry, itchy scalp.  In the winter, it gets so bad that it can even crack and bleed.  Not only does this shampoo, in combination with the conditioner, moisturize my scalp like no other, it heals any chapping or cracking that does develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time ever, my scalp is comfortable in winter.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing again and again.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works on my dry scalp.  Winter here can be so drying to skin, and this clears it right up.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for this. Paul Mitchell makes a much better product that works a lot better. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was using the super expensive Wen tea tree oil shampoo. It was pretty good, but I had to use a lot. I like this shampoo so much better. My hair seems healthier than it has in a long time even though I haven&#x27;t had a trim in months. If you have a dry scalp and want moisture without weighing your hair down, try this.</li>
            <li> I have mild dandruff enough that if I use regular shampoo my scalp gets itchy. I hate using dandruff shampoo though so I used to go back and forth for a while. Then I found this brand and their amazing shampoo and conditioner. I love it! It has amazing ingredients in it and I love that they put them on the front of the bottle with it&#x27;s purpose. I also love that it has willow bark in it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has allergies to sulfates and has very sensitive skin.  This shampoo is the only shampoo I have found that does not flare up her eczema.  Plus it completely cleared up her dandruff.  If she uses another brand of shampoo just one time she has a flare up.  Please do not stop making this shampoo.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fantastic to me.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of my hairs don&#x27;t disappear anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
            <li> My hair feels really clean, and it lathers well, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with dandruff like the head and shoulders does.</li>
            <li> This product is really awesome!  I have an angry dry psoriasis scalp that is difficult to deal with.  After doing lots of research found that the most beneficial products for such a scalp are all in this lovely product.  I was amazed at how nice my hair looked after using this shampoo along with the conditioner.  The smell is organic with a menthol note, not offensive.  When lathering, it is very soothing, so much so, I almost hate to rinse it out.  I have tried many different products and find that this is really a great one.</li>
            <li> I purchased a puzzle called &amp;#34;Buffalo games audurbon birds&amp;#34;  Humming bird.  It took a while to put the puzzle  together but we found out that 4 pieces to this puzzle are missing.  We were so dissappointed because the puzzle is so beautiful.  Can anything be  done about this?  I appreciate what you can do for me......................................Nancy Schechterly  willnanfl@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Wish it was mintier, or tea tree-er. It&#x27;s almost nonexistent in those departments. Very gentle though, my hair enjoys it. One of OGX&#x27;s only cone free &#x27;poos.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo for my curly hair that frizzes on the summer.  After using this, my hair stays smooth and does not react to the humidity.  I also apply  Moroccan oil on my hair while its still wet and that helps as well but even so, without the shampoo my hair would still frizz to some degree.</li>
            <li> While the tea tree and neem oils feel refreshing on your scalp, the willow bark seems to be missing, so [technically] there is nothing in this shampoo that is exfoliating your scalp.</li>
            <li> this is a favorite shampoo at our house. my teen boys love it. have bought many bottles and will buy some more.</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction to hair dye.  This is the only product I can use that helps my scalp calm down. And my hair is soft and manageable.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Got this in winter when my head was itchy.  This shampoo certainly took care of that issue.  Results continue to improve hair and scalp with continued use.</li>
            <li> Works Great will have to order more wish I could find in stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, this shampoo made my dandruff so uncontrollable i had to throw it away before i could finish all of it. I had very high hopes for it but i felt like i was putting in so many chemicals in my hair with this one, i had to switch to a much more natural shampoo that I&#x27;ve found. Hopefully, this new one I&#x27;m trying will be a bit more helpful..</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I still haven&#x27;t seen results for my dandruff.. Though to be honest I didn&#x27;t expect to. I&#x27;ve been using H&amp;S almost my whole life and it&#x27;s never helped, and I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands with different active ingredients, and nothing has helped. Teatree oil is the new upcoming active ingredient (they even have a H&amp;S variety with it now) but for me it hasn&#x27;t helped. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just more marketing...</li>
            <li> Love OGX, but this shampoo dried my hair out. Will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> While this made my hair soft, it didn&#x27;t do much for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this shampoo because it helps if you have ichy flacky scalp. Also, the minty smell and the soothing feeling of the shampoo in your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great price on here! And I love OGX products. This is a great clarifying shampoo</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I am African american so I always use moisturizers in my hair. Well after about about a week my hair beings to buildup with product. This shampoo worked wonders! My hair was squeaky clean and no more itching! Also it didn&#x27;t completely dry out my hair which I love. I followed up with the ogx keratin oil conditioner and the ogx macadamia oil intensive moisture mask and a little sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived the next day!! Wow! And a great shampoo to boot!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be exactly what I need to treat my scalp and thinning hair problems.  I am using it and a Biotin supplement and am seeing great results.  I&#x27;d recommend the shampoo to anyone with my problems.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Its okay!! shipping and packaging was good!! thanks</li>
            <li> great product for my itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s amazing gets rid of dandruff amazingly</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.  Not only did it clean my scalp and hair it left my hair soft and more manageable without using conditioner.  Only problem is my bottle has disappeared.  Either the shampoo fairy stole it or one of my children liked it so much they are hogging it.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> While Organix shampoo isn&#x27;t exactly organic, this formula (no SLS, but a few similar ingredients) has done wonders for my incurably dry scalp. The scent is nice and light, the lather is the perfect amount, and this also does double-duty with hydrating from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen Organix products in various grocery, drug, and big box stores and am super disappointed that Amazon isn&#x27;t offering this via Subscribe and Save. The absolute rock bottom price I&#x27;ve found is less than six bucks at Walmart. Great product if you can find it at a fair price!!</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the OGX shampoos and condtioners. They just give great results. This particular one is for dryer scalp. I only use it once or twice a week. It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t affect my allergies too much. Cleans my hair well. I did take away one star because it isn&#x27;t great on the whole dry scalp thing. Just not seeing much difference in that area. We will see more this winter when my skin worsens how the shampoo does.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo  keep  my  hair  from  flying  and when I  sleep  I wake  up  and my hair is the  same as when I went to bed  .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo.  I have psoriasis so during the cold dry months, my scalp gets very itchy and flakey. If u use it on a regular basis, it makes my head feel so relieved and hydrated. I highly recommend it. It just leaves my hair a little dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for certain that Tea Tree oil is as great as some people claim, but this OGX shampoo was recommended by my Ophthalmologist (which I thought was kind of strange).  However it works fine on my hair and I like the smell.  I also read some research that indicates Tea Tree oil might have medicinal qualities, so at least I feel like I&#x27;m using something better than the run-of-the-mill chemical concoctions sold as shampoo.  So my take on it is that it works fine as a shampoo and might be providing me some health benefits to my scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for dry scalp and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. I highly recommend buy this along with the shampoo.</li>
