            <li>Perfect transaction, order was exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>Great product, I love love love this soap!</li>
            <li>Triclosan is not an effective antibacterial...</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for keeping your piercings clean.</li>
            <li>The product is great, and as others have mentioned, you don&#x27;t have to use much to get a good lather</li>
            <li>MUST&#x3D;&#x3D; BE USED CORRECTLY IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE &amp; SAFE</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s doing a good job to keep my piercing clean.</li>
            <li>It works really good to keep your piercing clean from bacteria.</li>
            <li>It is an antimicrobial rather than just an antibacterial because it kills more than just bacteria.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not the best at removing physical dirt from hands.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li>I have had multiple cartilage piercings, and this has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>The soap smells nice, is very moisturizing, and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>My favorite and was delivered in a timely manner</li>
            <li>most soaps&lt;br /&gt;leave</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and this is great.</li>
            <li>If I just need to clean dirt off my hands, there&#x27;s no reason I need an antimicrobial scrub for this, and so a regular soap works best here</li>

            <li>These properties give it great versatility in that this product is appropriate for many different situations that mandate the need for an antimicrobial scrub.</li>

            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it smells so clean!</li>
            <li>The liquid leaks easily during transit.</li>
            <li>I use this soap for a variety of reasons, but mostly it is used to clean my piercings.</li>
            <li>one does not always need a disinfectant, my preference has been to have two soaps on-hand for selective usage: one with excellent physical cleaning action &amp; no antimicrobial, and a separate antimicrobial scrub with an effective, wide-spectrum antimicrobial.</li>
            <li>one with excellent physical cleaning action &amp; no antimicrobial, and a separate antimicrobial scrub with an effective, wide-spectrum antimicrobial.</li>
            <li>Mild but antimicrobial so perfect to use after washing hair to clean entire ear areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to clean these sensitive areas and keep bacteria to a minimum.</li>
            <li>But the product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>This soap works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Disinfectants such as povidone-iodine (Betadine), isopropyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, etc. are indeed very effective antimicrobials.</li>
            <li>Disinfectants such as povidone-iodine (Betadine), isopropyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, etc. are indeed very effective antimicrobials.</li>
            <li>This particular line of Antimicrobial Lotion Soap is really the bread &amp; butter of Provon and the epitome of a great antimicrobial scrub.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for daily cleaning of new peirced ears.</li>
            <li>This time the Provon was very light in color, thinner than normal in consistency, and it takes more of the product to produce adequate lathering.</li>
            <li>It contains an antimicrobial which, when used correctly, is fast, effective, safe, and gentle.</li>
            <li>It contains an antimicrobial which, when used correctly, is fast, effective, safe, and gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, however, it was not packaged well and arrived with a significant amount of product having leaked into the packaging.</li>
            <li>&amp; my hands feel really clean when I have to clean my piercing</li>
            <li>I use Provon for cleaning healed body piercings and to clean the jewelry as well.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my piercings and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and keeps the healing skin from getting dry and getting pulled when you move.</li>
            <li>Great product for new piercings, clears up new infection in a day or so.</li>
            <li>It is way more gentle than Dial</li>
            <li>I have 2 body piercings and two ear piercings and it has been great and has left all of them pretty much infection free.</li>
            <li>This has honestly prevented/cured so much infection, especially because my hair (with leave in conditioner and mousse) lays on top of it.</li>
            <li>I had to wash the bottle off before I used it, and at that point it was only filled just below the top edge of the label rather than the full 16 oz shown.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild but still strong enough to help with my navel piercing when it got infected</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s certainly not a cheap product, this soap is worth every penny as it is a superior product.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s certainly not a cheap product, this soap is worth every penny as it is a superior product.&amp;#34; That is, the antimicrobial agent does not kill pathogens on immediate contact, but rather a certain period of time is required for the product to work to its intended degree of effectiveness.</li>
            <li>have used this product for decades, and I use it for many different applications.</li>
            <li>have used this product for decades, and I use it for many different applications.</li>
            <li>The location where I most recently got my cartilage piercing had given me a sample of this to use, and there is no way I can go without it now.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I found this soap at my doctors office; first use I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also important to note that incorrect use of this kind of product not only renders the product less effective (and possibly outright ineffective), but it can also encourage the development of resistant pathogens.</li>
            <li>wash with this and hot water, then bandage it up with some antibiotic cream and it heals very well.  </li>
            <li>This Provon line (by Gojo) is one which offers various antimicrobial products containing effective &amp; safe ingredients (note that Provon makes a wide variety of products, including ones with triclosan and ones without any antimicrobial agent.)</li>
            <li>With ANY AND ALL antimicrobial soaps, correct usage means respect must be given to the &amp;#34;set time.&amp;#34; That is, the antimicrobial agent does not kill pathogens on immediate contact, but rather a certain period of time is required for the product to work to its intended degree of effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t blame the seller.</li>
            <li>Thanks to various moisturizers, this soap delivers effective antimicrobial action without the harshness of many other antimicrobials.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved using the provon anti lotion everyday for my new belly piercing.</li>
            <li>This antimicrobial has a relatively short set time compared to others, is effective in killing various resistant pathogens, is relatively easy on skin, and has a very low toxicity to both humans and pet animals.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about ready to deal with Amazon because it wasn&#x27;t fulfilled by them</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>It also wasn&#x27;t filled all the way and had a different odor.</li>
            <li>Bought to clean my ear piercings, but would recommend using something more natural as this may be too harsh for piercings.</li>
            <li>If you have piercings to clean and maintain, I cannot recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to people who have new piercings and want to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I will most likely try and find it locally next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like i am going to have a high risk of getting it infected.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you are stretching or have a lot of new piercings.</li>
            <li>It was a total bummer that such a large amount had gotten out of the bottle and that I had to clean it.</li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t a completely new discovery...</li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t a completely new discovery...</li>
            <li>Purchased this to care for a new piercing.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap for the purpose of cleaning new piercings.</li>
            <li>in fact, it has no advantages over the exact same soap without triclosan, and long-term exposure is now believed to have health-hazards.</li>
            <li>this soap is far more gentle on skin (and wound beds) than most other antimicrobial scrubs, and 4) the moisturizers in this soap moisturize skin without clogging pores, leaving residue, or disturbing wound</li>
            <li>the active ingredient of chloroxylenol (also known as PCMX), this soap has a very capable and very wide-spectrum antimicrobial.</li>
            <li>professional piercers have known this for ages.</li>
            <li>professional piercers have known this for ages.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh and works well.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that I was expecting the whole thing to be full when I received it, but it looks exactly the way it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash out my piercings and it seems to be gentle enough.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this same product from this same seller many times previously.</li>
            <li>Product ended up being a different color than the normal orangeish tent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different soaps trying to find one to help with healing since I&#x27;m a slow healer.</li>
            <li>I use it when they flare up a bit (if my immune system is engaged or if I wore a metal earring I was allergic to) and it calms them right down.  </li>
            <li>As of right now, the US FDA is attempting to ban manufacturers from labeling their product as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; if it only contains triclosan as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>Now I was my face and back with it to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>But while it is effective &amp; wide-spectrum, it is expensive and means having to scrub &amp; let sit for a longer period.</li>
            <li>But while it is effective &amp; wide-spectrum, it is expensive and means having to scrub &amp; let sit for a longer period.</li>
            <li>And unlike many other antimicrobials, when used to disinfect wounds, this soap does not have an intense burning sensation and, despite having moisturizers, it does not leave a residue behind.</li>

            <li>The outcome has been no short of a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that many effective antimicrobial hand scrubs, which use a wide range of active ingredients, exist, but they are generally expensive and standard stores generally do not carry these products.</li>
            <li>The short version of why I recommend this product is because, 1) the active ingredient in this soap (PCMX) is a wide-spectrum &amp; fast-acting antimicrobial that is effective against a wide range of pathogens, including resistant ones, 2) the active ingredient has a very low toxicity, 3)</li>
            <li>very* clean with no residue left behind, but</li>
            <li>There is a reason this product is frequently sold at professional piecing establishments and why professionals advocate NOT using other products...</li>
            <li>There is a reason this product is frequently sold at professional piecing establishments and why professionals advocate NOT using other products...</li>
            <li>It is different then the old provon white bottles, but it works the same.</li>
            <li>The big bottle came with the pump cracked but still working and about 1/4 of the bottle spilled all over the box due to tight fit pacakging.</li>
            <li>These set times can sometimes be quite long, but chloroxylenol tends to have a shorter set time and generally scrubbing (once you have worked the lather) for 30-60 seconds is considered acceptable</li>

            <li> have used this product for decades, and I use it for many different applications.</li>
            <li> have used this product for decades, and I use it for many different applications.</li>
            <li> The location where I most recently got my cartilage piercing had given me a sample of this to use, and there is no way I can go without it now.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I found this soap at my doctors office; first use I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also important to note that incorrect use of this kind of product not only renders the product less effective (and possibly outright ineffective), but it can also encourage the development of resistant pathogens.</li>
            <li> wash with this and hot water, then bandage it up with some antibiotic cream and it heals very well.  </li>
            <li> This Provon line (by Gojo) is one which offers various antimicrobial products containing effective &amp; safe ingredients (note that Provon makes a wide variety of products, including ones with triclosan and ones without any antimicrobial agent.)</li>
            <li> With ANY AND ALL antimicrobial soaps, correct usage means respect must be given to the &amp;#34;set time.&amp;#34; That is, the antimicrobial agent does not kill pathogens on immediate contact, but rather a certain period of time is required for the product to work to its intended degree of effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t blame the seller.</li>
            <li> Thanks to various moisturizers, this soap delivers effective antimicrobial action without the harshness of many other antimicrobials.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved using the provon anti lotion everyday for my new belly piercing.</li>
            <li> This antimicrobial has a relatively short set time compared to others, is effective in killing various resistant pathogens, is relatively easy on skin, and has a very low toxicity to both humans and pet animals.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about ready to deal with Amazon because it wasn&#x27;t fulfilled by them</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> It also wasn&#x27;t filled all the way and had a different odor.</li>
            <li> Bought to clean my ear piercings, but would recommend using something more natural as this may be too harsh for piercings.</li>
            <li> If you have piercings to clean and maintain, I cannot recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to people who have new piercings and want to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I will most likely try and find it locally next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel like i am going to have a high risk of getting it infected.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you are stretching or have a lot of new piercings.</li>
            <li> It was a total bummer that such a large amount had gotten out of the bottle and that I had to clean it.</li>
            <li> But this isn&#x27;t a completely new discovery...</li>

            <li> Purchased this to care for a new piercing.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for the purpose of cleaning new piercings.</li>
            <li> in fact, it has no advantages over the exact same soap without triclosan, and long-term exposure is now believed to have health-hazards.</li>
            <li> this soap is far more gentle on skin (and wound beds) than most other antimicrobial scrubs, and 4) the moisturizers in this soap moisturize skin without clogging pores, leaving residue, or disturbing wound</li>
            <li> the active ingredient of chloroxylenol (also known as PCMX), this soap has a very capable and very wide-spectrum antimicrobial.</li>

            <li> It is not harsh and works well.</li>

            <li> I use it to wash out my piercings and it seems to be gentle enough.</li>

            <li> I use it when they flare up a bit (if my immune system is engaged or if I wore a metal earring I was allergic to) and it calms them right down.  </li>
            <li> As of right now, the US FDA is attempting to ban manufacturers from labeling their product as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; if it only contains triclosan as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Now I was my face and back with it to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> But while it is effective &amp; wide-spectrum, it is expensive and means having to scrub &amp; let sit for a longer period.</li>

            <li> Well, mine was a leaker too!  I had several items in my order and it leaked saturatating a corner of the box all the way through.  I could immediately smell it when I brought it in.  The bottle was all the way wrapped up so I give them credit for trying to fix this issue, but even so, it leaked.  I removed the wrap and washed the goopy mess.  I did lose some of the contents (which is not cheap), but just sucked it up rather than go through the hassle of returning.  I will most likely try and find it locally next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the actual product:  My daughter and I had our noses pierced at the same time and I read on the internet that is is great for helping piercings  heal without infection.  I also use on some of my ear piecings that had not been used in a long time, that I reinserted hoops.  Worked like a charm! Smell is no big deal and washes off.  We use a very small amount on a cotton ear swab and let it sit while washing the rest of our face, then wash it off.  I have had zero problems and it actually helped take the slight pain and redness away.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It took longer then I thought it would but still happy with the product! &amp; my hands feel really clean when I have to clean my piercing, I don&#x27;t feel like i am going to have a high risk of getting it infected.</li>
            <li> Very expensive. Purchased it because it was recommended by the tattoo place (had nose pierced). The scent is awful! Don&#x27;t understand the difference between this product and any other anti bacterial soap.  Piercing did not get infected, so I guess the product worked</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I will not use anything else for my tattoo&#x27;s and piercings. This stuff is less drying for the skin and is rated up there with what doctors use before going into surgery!!</li>
            <li> Nice stuff! Keeps your body piercings from getting infected. Good to keep using even after the piercings have heeled, to keep the germs at bay. The bottle design stinks though. The liquid leaks easily during transit. From reading other customer reviews, obviously I&#x27;m not the only one saying this!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for keeping your piercings clean. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so this lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I highly recommend it. The short version of why I recommend this product is because, 1) the active ingredient in this soap (PCMX) is a wide-spectrum &amp; fast-acting antimicrobial that is effective against a wide range of pathogens, including resistant ones, 2) the active ingredient has a very low toxicity, 3) this soap is far more gentle on skin (and wound beds) than most other antimicrobial scrubs, and 4) the moisturizers in this soap moisturize skin without clogging pores, leaving residue, or disturbing wound beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long version...&lt;br /&gt;ANTIMICROBIAL SOAPS, THE CASE OF TRICLOSAN, AND THE REPUTATION MEDICATED SOAP HAS DEVELOPED&lt;br /&gt;Soaps with antimicrobial ingredients have recently gotten a bad reputation. This has been made worse due to the media sensation that does not recognize the difference between products, and now we often see things like, &amp;#34;antibacterial soap is ineffective, creates antibiotic resistance, and is dangerous to health.&amp;#34; This scare came about because many makers have extensively used a specific ingredient called triclosan to make inexpensive soap they can market as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34;. Triclosan is not an effective antibacterial...in fact, it has no advantages over the exact same soap without triclosan, and long-term exposure is now believed to have health-hazards. As of right now, the US FDA is attempting to ban manufacturers from labeling their product as &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; if it only contains triclosan as the active ingredient. With triclosan soap comprising the bulk of antimicrobial soap sold (and how almost all antibacterial soap sold in stores is triclosan-based), it seems a misunderstanding has developed that fails to recognize how the active ingredient in an antibacterial and/or antimicrobial varies by product. This issue has been worsened by incorrect usage of antimicrobial products, which indeed is ineffective and does contribute to antibiotic resistance. The outcome has been no short of a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that many effective antimicrobial hand scrubs, which use a wide range of active ingredients, exist, but they are generally expensive and standard stores generally do not carry these products. This Provon line (by Gojo) is one which offers various antimicrobial products containing effective &amp; safe ingredients (note that Provon makes a wide variety of products, including ones with triclosan and ones without any antimicrobial agent.) This particular line of Antimicrobial Lotion Soap is really the bread &amp; butter of Provon and the epitome of a great antimicrobial scrub. Not surprisingly, it has a commanding presence in the healthcare setting as well as in tattoos and piercing businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT MAKES THIS PROVON SOAP SO GREAT???&lt;br /&gt;Containing the active ingredient of chloroxylenol (also known as PCMX), this soap has a very capable and very wide-spectrum antimicrobial. It is an antimicrobial rather than just an antibacterial because it kills more than just bacteria. It is a bactericide, virucide, and fungicide (and, to some degree, a sporicide.) This antimicrobial has a relatively short set time compared to others, is effective in killing various resistant pathogens, is relatively easy on skin, and has a very low toxicity to both humans and pet animals. With correct usage, the concern for encouraging antibiotic resistance is relatively low. Thanks to various moisturizers, this soap delivers effective antimicrobial action without the harshness of many other antimicrobials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SOAP, AND --ALL-- ANTIMICROBIAL SOAP, &#x3D;&#x3D;MUST&#x3D;&#x3D; BE USED CORRECTLY IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE &amp; SAFE&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to note that incorrect use of this kind of product not only renders the product less effective (and possibly outright ineffective), but it can also encourage the development of resistant pathogens. With ANY AND ALL antimicrobial soaps, correct usage means respect must be given to the &amp;#34;set time.&amp;#34; That is, the antimicrobial agent does not kill pathogens on immediate contact, but rather a certain period of time is required for the product to work to its intended degree of effectiveness. These set times can sometimes be quite long, but chloroxylenol tends to have a shorter set time and generally scrubbing (once you have worked the lather) for 30-60 seconds is considered acceptable (some recommendations go as low as 15 seconds.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY USES OF PROVON&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for decades, and I use it for many different applications. One of the applications is wound care. Disinfectants such as povidone-iodine (Betadine), isopropyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, etc. are indeed very effective antimicrobials. However, recent years have seen healthcare providers advise less frequent (or zero) usage of these products because they are relatively harsh and can disturb a wound bed, actually slowing the healing process. But this isn&#x27;t a completely new discovery...professional piercers have known this for ages. There is a reason this product is frequently sold at professional piecing establishments and why professionals advocate NOT using other products...this Provon soap gives satisfactory disinfecting, but it disturbs the wound bed less and allows optimal healing. And unlike many other antimicrobials, when used to disinfect wounds, this soap does not have an intense burning sensation and, despite having moisturizers, it does not leave a residue behind. I also frequently use this product if I have been out and touched various surfaces, or if I was handling raw meats, such as chicken. I have also used this product to treat various wounds on my rabbit over the years, and I think it has played a big role in avoiding infections as well as reducing the discomfort that other antimicrobial scrubs can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS: KEEPING BOTH A REGULAR GENERAL-USE SOAP AND AN ANTIMICROBIAL SOAP&lt;br /&gt;As one does not always need a disinfectant, my preference has been to have two soaps on-hand for selective usage: one with excellent physical cleaning action &amp; no antimicrobial, and a separate antimicrobial scrub with an effective, wide-spectrum antimicrobial. My antimicrobial scrub of choice is this Provon. But while it is effective &amp; wide-spectrum, it is expensive and means having to scrub &amp; let sit for a longer period. It&#x27;s also not the best at removing physical dirt from hands. If I just need to clean dirt off my hands, there&#x27;s no reason I need an antimicrobial scrub for this, and so a regular soap works best here given it&#x27;s faster, cheaper, and use of the antimicrobial isn&#x27;t necessary. So having both of these soaps allows me to get the best physical cleaning, the best disinfecting, and to choose which one I want based on the application/situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Provon&#x27;s PCMX Antimicrobial Lotion Soap is a great product. It contains an antimicrobial which, when used correctly, is fast, effective, safe, and gentle. These properties give it great versatility in that this product is appropriate for many different situations that mandate the need for an antimicrobial scrub. While it&#x27;s certainly not a cheap product, this soap is worth every penny as it is a superior product.&amp;#34; That is, the antimicrobial agent does not kill pathogens on immediate contact, but rather a certain period of time is required for the product to work to its intended degree of effectiveness.

            <li> I like the hospital smell it seems to have and it&#x27;s doing a good job to keep my piercing clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to care for a new piercing. The product is great, and as others have mentioned, you don&#x27;t have to use much to get a good lather so it lasts along time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, however, it was not packaged well and arrived with a significant amount of product having leaked into the packaging. I had to wash the bottle off before I used it, and at that point it was only filled just below the top edge of the label rather than the full 16 oz shown. Call me stingy, but this stuff is expensive for soap, and if I order 16 oz, I want to be able to use all 16 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping I can find this product locally so I don&#x27;t have to purchase form this seller again...</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have had no issues with my helix piercing since using this and you only need a little so it goes a long way. I have no complaints about the smell either. I actually find the smell to be a clean/fresh smell. I would definitely recommend this product to people who have new piercings and want to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Great product for new piercings, clears up new infection in a day or so. The big bottle came with the pump cracked but still working and about 1/4 of the bottle spilled all over the box due to tight fit pacakging. It&#x27;ll still last eons but be forwarned</li>
            <li> Smells extremely sterile. Bought to clean my ear piercings, but would recommend using something more natural as this may be too harsh for piercings.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my piercings. I use it when they flare up a bit (if my immune system is engaged or if I wore a metal earring I was allergic to) and it calms them right down.  I&#x27;ve also used it when I&#x27;ve had road-rash from bicycle accidents and for occasional scrapes: wash with this and hot water, then bandage it up with some antibiotic cream and it heals very well.  The bottle lasts for ever too.</li>
            <li> I started using the antimicrobial soap when I had some piercings done.  Now I was my face and back with it to keep my skin clear.  It is not harsh and works well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. I have had multiple cartilage piercings, and this has worked the best for me. The location where I most recently got my cartilage piercing had given me a sample of this to use, and there is no way I can go without it now. This has honestly prevented/cured so much infection, especially because my hair (with leave in conditioner and mousse) lays on top of it. The only complaint I have is that I was expecting the whole thing to be full when I received it, but it looks exactly the way it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> I use Provon for cleaning healed body piercings and to clean the jewelry as well. I think its a great product and this size and pump work fantastically. When I received the product about 3/4 to 1 oz. of the product was not in the bottle and instead all over the inside of the bag. It was a total bummer that such a large amount had gotten out of the bottle and that I had to clean it. I wasn&#x27;t about ready to deal with Amazon because it wasn&#x27;t fulfilled by them so I just accepted that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this same product from this same seller many times previously. This time the Provon was very light in color, thinner than normal in consistency, and it takes more of the product to produce adequate lathering. Not sure what happened here. I certainly don&#x27;t blame the seller. Perhaps the quality of the product is not as it was. I will purchase this again, however. Provon is a superior product for tattoo healing.</li>
            <li> This soap is a must have for any piercing or tattoo. I never ever have any problems after I started to use this soap. I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Provon antimicrobial lotion soap is excellent in cleaning my hand and cleaning my ear piercing.&lt;br /&gt;No infection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to one of the ingredients</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I use this product on all of our piercings.The tattoo parlors used to carry it but now I purchase it from Amazon only.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily on my belly button and nose piercing. It does a great job cleaning and it has helped me to not get any infections in my piercings.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. I use it for cleaning healing piercings and existing ones as well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like some other products out there and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Watered down. Bottle wasn&#x27;t full and substance seemed very weak. Appears doctored.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great to wash piercings!</li>
            <li> I use this soap for a variety of reasons, but mostly it is used to clean my piercings. It&#x27;s a great way to clean these sensitive areas and keep bacteria to a minimum. I will continue to use it. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> does wonders for piercing</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for the purpose of cleaning new piercings. The soap smells nice, is very moisturizing, and seems to do a good job. A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> My favorite and was delivered in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I found this soap at my doctors office; first use I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling *very* clean with no residue left behind, but also&lt;br /&gt;it leaves skin feeling hydrated rather than the dry and tight feeling most soaps&lt;br /&gt;leave my skin requiring lotion after washing.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent soap and I pray they never alter the formula.</li>
            <li> I use it for piercings. It is different then the old provon white bottles, but it works the same. Highly recommended if you are stretching or have a lot of new piercings.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my industrial piercing. I&#x27;ve used many different soaps trying to find one to help with healing since I&#x27;m a slow healer. This soap works fantastic. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the area either. My husband and I agree it smells like band aids but it is not an issue for me. Packaging was great and had no problems with it leaking or opening.</li>
            <li> I loved using the provon anti lotion everyday for my new belly piercing. It works really good to keep your piercing clean from bacteria.</li>
            <li> Product ended up being a different color than the normal orangeish tent. It also wasn&#x27;t filled all the way and had a different odor. Made me wonder if the product had been altered by the seller. I won&#x27;t be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love love love this soap! Perfect transaction, order was exactly as specified. I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers meant when they complained about the smell... I am very sensitive to smells and this is great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s very mild but still strong enough to help with my navel piercing when it got infected</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I use it to wash out my piercings and it seems to be gentle enough. The only problem I had was with the packaging. The nozzle pump was broken but I didn&#x27;t want to go through hassle of returning it. In order to use it, I have to screw the cap loose and pour it out. But the product itself is fine.</li>
            <li> This was a mess!  The contents of the bottle spilled all over the packaging.  I only received half a bottle and the other half a mess</li>
            <li> I use this soap for cleaning my piercings. It is way more gentle than Dial and I find that my piercings get way less dried out and irritated from it. Also, this 16 oz bottle lasted me almost a year when using pea size amounts for each piercing.</li>
            <li> If you have piercings to clean and maintain, I cannot recommend this highly enough. I have 2 body piercings and two ear piercings and it has been great and has left all of them pretty much infection free.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! !! I had a bump next to my navel piercing known as a keloid.or hypotrophic scar for over a month. It wasn&#x27;t going away with the sea salt soaks. I bought this soap and in three days it was almost gone! ! I can swear by this this soap! Definitely recommend it for poercings!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect product for piercing and tattoo aftercare! I use it to clean my piercings and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I used dial on my naval piercing for about a month until I found this product. It&#x27;s great and keeps the healing skin from getting dry and getting pulled when you move. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with infections since I started using this. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it smells so clean! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who just got a piercing!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described! Great seller! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for daily cleaning of new peirced ears. Mild but antimicrobial so perfect to use after washing hair to clean entire ear areas. No stinging.</li>
