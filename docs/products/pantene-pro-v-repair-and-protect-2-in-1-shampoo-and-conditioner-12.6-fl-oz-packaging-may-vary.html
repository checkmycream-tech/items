            <li>Pantene always has the best</li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners are long-standing favorites of mine but this one, the Repair &amp; Protect, is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Great 2 in 1 shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film!</li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted to use it in the gym, but it wasn&#x27;t a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Got this for my mother and I and it made our hair feel really good!</li>
            <li>This is a very good shampoo which I feel has helped my hair start to come around and repair damaged hair and make it feel real good and make it nice and shinny after  your shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>Great for our rental property.</li>
            <li>i bought this product because it was good price.</li>
            <li>Smells good too without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Works good and smooths out my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair smelling &amp; looking awesome and if I rinse my hair under cool/cold water right before I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shampoo in that it really does repair your hair.  </li>
            <li>Loving Pantene products for years, I returned to this 2 in 1 -</li>
            <li>The scent is the signature Pantene scent, nice as always.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo --it</li>
            <li>This was even more drying than the shine-enhancing 2 in 1</li>
            <li>I get the wonderful Pantene shine and super soft hair without the break outs or the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Pantene to me is better than what is available to me.</li>
            <li>I really like 2-1&#x27;s and this one is really good.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon as the seller… It works just fine, but explodes in the box.</li>
            <li>This made my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>Cleans, conditions, leaves my hair feeling smooth but not slippery like some formulas.</li>
            <li>So great for my long hair !</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>We have all been using this shampoo for several months and agree that it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>it is super shiny too.</li>
            <li>I usually get the Volumizing kind as my hair is very fine and has no natural lift, but the Repair &amp; Protect seems to be the perfect level of conditioning I need without weighing my hair down at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also sensitive to scent, and it has a light, fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>My favorite daily shampoo!</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo along with leave in smoothing product, works great on my normal, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I get the shiny and super soft hair as if i used shampoo and then conditioner.</li>
            <li>Apparently they knew this and put it in it&#x27;s own separate bag, but they weren&#x27;t smart enough to tape</li>
            <li>This is light enough for all day, every day usage and a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it conditions as much as i&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Really like how my hair feels after I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent 2-in-1, but I miss the old Pantene Hydrating Curls, that Pantene discontinued for some reason</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is chemically treated and just need more conditioning than others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner to anyone who wants to eliminate the extra step of conditioner without sacrificing cleanliness, style-ability or repair/protection.</li>
            <li>that leave my hair as soft as hydrating curls.  </li>
            <li>keeps my long, fine hair in tip-top condition without weighing it down, and keeps it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and it is long lasting for the whole day, which actually saves me the need of using it twice daily.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo in that it really does repair your hair.  Would recommend for anyone needing conditioning.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother and I and it made our hair feel really good! :) I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This made my hair so smooth. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair over five times, so this is a miracle for such a standard shampoo.</li>
            <li> not very good. will get just the conditioner next time.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo along with leave in smoothing product, works great on my normal, thick hair. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Pantene always has the best</li>
            <li> My favorite daily shampoo! I love this shampoo --it keeps my long, fine hair in tip-top condition without weighing it down, and keeps it soft and shiny. I&#x27;m also sensitive to scent, and it has a light, fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Great for our rental property.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of 2-in-1&#x27;s in general, because for me personally, I usually have a break out after prolonged usage. Not with Pantene. I get the wonderful Pantene shine and super soft hair without the break outs or the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; flatness from over conditioning. This is light enough for all day, every day usage and a bargain for the price. Anything that saves time in your daily routine is a boost. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use 2-in-1&#x27;s ,Because i feel that it doesn&#x27;t do the same job and it&#x27;s also over conditioned because of the relatively big amount of conditioner being used - as usually shampoo is used in a bigger quantity than conditioner. But with  Pantene the story is all different. I get the shiny and super soft hair as if i used shampoo and then conditioner. and it is long lasting for the whole day, which actually saves me the need of using it twice daily. Highly recomended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent 2-in-1, but I miss the old Pantene Hydrating Curls, that Pantene discontinued for some reason -- I have yet to find a 2-in-1, or even 2 products, that leave my hair as soft as hydrating curls.  Anyway, the fragrance on this one was neutral and non-offensive, so I do recommend it after all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it conditions as much as i&#x27;d like. I still have to put on conditioner after using it if I want my hair to feel softer. Not sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is chemically treated and just need more conditioning than others.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and I am way way way too lazy to wash, condition &amp; reapeat. Pantene&#x27;s 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioners are long-standing favorites of mine but this one, the Repair &amp; Protect, is the best one yet. I usually get the Volumizing kind as my hair is very fine and has no natural lift, but the Repair &amp; Protect seems to be the perfect level of conditioning I need without weighing my hair down at all. This shampoo leaves my hair smelling &amp; looking awesome and if I rinse my hair under cool/cold water right before I get out of the shower it is super shiny too. I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner to anyone who wants to eliminate the extra step of conditioner without sacrificing cleanliness, style-ability or repair/protection.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because it was good price. Just was trying to restock on the home product for shampoo with conditioner</li>
            <li> Loving Pantene products for years, I returned to this 2 in 1 - No, no, no, no, no! I had a terrible time trying to comb through my wet hair, and after it dried, it was WAY dry texture. Cannot use this. Absolutely horrible for my fine, mid-length nat blond hair. Had to return it. This was even more drying than the shine-enhancing 2 in 1 I also returned.</li>
            <li> Great 2 in 1 shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film!</li>
            <li> So great for my long hair !</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem as nourishing as the Pantene of years ago. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My two girls use this on their hair (one has thick and the other has thin) and it leaves their hair soft!</li>
            <li> Really like how my hair feels after I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted to use it in the gym, but it wasn&#x27;t a very good conditioner. My hair&#x27;s a mess......</li>
            <li> This is a very good shampoo which I feel has helped my hair start to come around and repair damaged hair and make it feel real good and make it nice and shinny after  your shampoo.</li>

The scent is the signature Pantene scent, nice as always.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it...says it lathers up well and the scent is pleasing.</li>
            <li> Am a patient in VA Community Living &amp; needed Pantene hair conditioner &amp; shampoo same as I have at home. Pantene to me is better than what is available to me.</li>
            <li> I really like 2-1&#x27;s and this one is really good. Cleans, conditions, leaves my hair feeling smooth but not slippery like some formulas. Rinses clean and leaves my hair nice and soft.  Smells good too without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Works good and smooths out my hair. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon as the seller… It works just fine, but explodes in the box. Apparently they knew this and put it in it&#x27;s own separate bag, but they weren&#x27;t smart enough to tape it shut I guess</li>
