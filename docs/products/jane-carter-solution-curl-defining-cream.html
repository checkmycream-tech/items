            <li>and I think she has done a great job with the curl defining cream.  </li>

            <li>this stuff is great for restoring moisture.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cute my hair looks!!  </li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I wish the company would have given more information on what hair types get the best results from the product.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product would be good for my truly ethnic nappy/kinky (non curly) hair.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>it is a good investment.</li>
            <li>People noticed a difference (good difference) when I started using this product.</li>

            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Great  products works  perfect for my  naturally curly  hair.</li>
            <li>This is so precious!</li>
            <li>Phenomenal products!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I think it is the best thing since sliced, whole grain bread!  </li>
            <li>Makes my scalp itchy but curls look amazing</li>
            <li>I am always getting compliments on how nice my hair looks .</li>
            <li>The best product I have used is from Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>and I figured I could mix up my own leave-in moisturizer/conditioner from my leftover</li>
            <li>I believe you have to try the products for yourself, then make YOUR OWN CONCLUSION.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent.</li>
            <li>I love it and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>great stuff and worth the price, will buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as moisturinzing as I would like it to be, hence why it gets 4 stars, but nevertheless it is a good product and worth trying.</li>
            <li>and I was quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it s</li>
            <li>my curly hair is going better and better.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;d get better results if I tried it that way.</li>
            <li>I find Shea Moisture Curling Souffle to work much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the Jane Carter products.</li>
            <li>but I found it better elongated the curls when sitting under a hair dryer with this product on, or using a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I love this product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever use another product on our hair. :)</li>
            <li>This works so much better.</li>
            <li>I plan on giving the product two more attempts and if it works better I will update this review.  </li>
            <li>want to revisit this review because after I permanently shelved the JCS, I began using the Kinky Curly products and found that the gel products work better for my hair than the creams.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love the texture.  </li>
            <li>You will pay 5 dollars more.</li>
            <li>or  feel like  wax like  most products do.  </li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this product does the trick, no need to apply gel as i see most of my sisters using on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Since I work inside an (overly) air-conditioned office, I am confident I can put this hair style into a once or twice a week rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do well with the 3a hair, it seems to have done better with the 3b.  </li>
            <li>I can see much more of my length now.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing else was able to even \\&quot;touch\\&quot; all my hair.</li>
            <li>Love Jane and her products.</li>
            <li>mango-ey, coconut-ty scents that most hair products marketed towards African-American hairtypes have to them.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product on more than one occasion</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the store where I purchased the products (NOT Target - they will not let you return opened beauty care products - product junkies beware!)</li>
            <li>Received my product on time,  in a box that was perfect on the outside.  </li>
            <li>ok my order is expedited and I&#x27;m issued a credit...GREAT and depending on what e-mail I read...</li>
            <li>Considering that the 16oz is at most $34, paying $20 for 6oz is a joke.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I met a hairstylist who used this on my hair and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>ok as the title says...if i were shipwrecked...this would be one of those products i would try to save off the boat.</li>
            <li>i love Jane Carter</li>
            <li>One of the best products I have ever used for my coarse hair</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>It has a citrusy smell, very sweet</li>
            <li>Enjoy your naturalness-it&#x27;s better for you.</li>
            <li>It was an okay product, but when I did detailed overnight styles, it did nothing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Must apply to really wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li>I recomend to all that wants to keep her curlies in good shape.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use too much at a time to get a good effect.  </li>
            <li>I was actually quite impressed with the results, my hair was moisturized, it produced soft defined curls and it had the best sheen I have ever had in any product this far.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but makes your curls look rich and healthy.</li>
            <li>the smell is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>but when I section my hair and lather/coat the strands with this product, it hydrates my strands and gives me springy, beautiful curls instantly!</li>
            <li>It gave me great curl definition (4B), and my hair felt moisturized and looked healthy all day long.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>might make for a frizz free twist-out.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Her hair was very shiny, had a nice flexible \\&quot;not crunchy\\&quot; hold, and</li>
            <li>I love the scent, smells fresh and citrusy.  </li>
            <li>Jane Carter is a good product for natural hair</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the seller is well aware that the 6 can be easily mistaken for a 16 because the 16 oz is in the photo.</li>
            <li>After reading so many great reviews I thought this product would solve my hair shrinkage problems, so I hurried to get the product into my very wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Oh it was frizz free AND FULL OF FLAKES.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting a ton of compliments on how healthy and pretty my curly hair looks.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that I could use this product without much preparation: no washing, no water spritzing, no oiling, nothing!</li>
            <li>And, the smell is a clean herbal/floral scent, not \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; as some reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>Leaves curls soft, shiny, and healthy looking and feeling!</li>
            <li>It made my hair way more shiny than Mizani and defined my curls very well.  </li>
            <li>In the back and tighter curls on sides) but that became impractical as my hair began to grow, so I needed a good product that would decrease shrinkage and add some moisture to my curls.</li>
            <li>should say I didn&#x27;t read the instructions, haha, but I am pleased with the results I got with this method:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>absolutely frzz free!</li>
            <li>allowed me to return them for a full refund.</li>
            <li>but it will DEFINE your beautiful tight curls.</li>
            <li>It looked like the creamy consistency of Miss Jessies Quick Curls.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works super well after I have washed and conditioned my hair -</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best product I have used so far, and I have a complete hair products store under my sink!</li>
            <li>Yep, I may have gotten something for free, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for that in the first place.</li>
            <li>When you first start to use it, go easy until you learn the right amount for you.  </li>
            <li>It keeps our curls in tact and moisturizes at the same time, it&#x27;s phenomenal!     </li>
            <li>After a wash, i put this on with my Shea Moisture Leave in Conditioner (not too much!!)</li>
            <li>love this product because the smell is not excessive, it delivers what is promises: curls defined (never promised to elongate curls).</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t happy that my hair seemed to harden (again, felt like straw) as it dried, so I may not even try it with the hood dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out with a great curl that holds for a few days, or til I hit the gym and shower it out.</li>
            <li>Eventually the smell wears out (not too long after you apply it) and you have wonderful curls all day long.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to wear my natural hair out, but I wanted to define my curl pattern a bit more, so it just didn&#x27;t look like a q-tip on my head.</li>
            <li>Overall effective.</li>
            <li>but, not really that good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to master the right amount to use.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been trying to order the right size of the product and seem to keep having problems.  </li>
            <li>so I end up with these really defined, shiny, healthy, soft curls!</li>
            <li>This was rely nice and has my son hair looking moist for a very long time...</li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream is like a conditioner with a mild scent that is not my absolute favourite -</li>
            <li>It leaves my very curly hair super shinny, lossenes the curlys, and gives it a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to strong smells, do not buy.</li>
            <li>just pretty twists.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time over the weekend and...</li>
            <li>I only wish I had a personal consultation with Jane herself to make sure I was getting the most out of her products.</li>
            <li>I use a leave-in conditioner in my hair first, then seal with an oil before applying the product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the look it gives me so far.</li>
            <li>this product makes my curls pattern look consistent throughout my head</li>
            <li>To be fair, I think this product is to be applied and then dried by sitting under a hood dryer.</li>
            <li>hair is nice and soft, but not curly enough for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is not that coarse--it&#x27;s medium texture, has a nice curl/wave pattern when wet and is easily straightened with a blow drier and flat iron.</li>
            <li>The best styling product for my hair has only been Kinky Kurly Curling Custard, but due to its high cost, I wanted to try an alternative natural product in the Curl Defining Cream.</li>
            <li>I used JC&#x27;s other products, and had great results, but this cream I&#x27;m totally sold on.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so super soft.  </li>
            <li>Just nice tight twists.  </li>
            <li>Her products cost a little more, but I have found that they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Jane.</li>
            <li>If too much is used, it can give the hair that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feeling...  </li>
            <li>It really defined my curls</li>
            <li>It relaxed it just a bit, but you couldn&#x27;t really tell, it just looked</li>
            <li>Thanks Jane Carter.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very deceptive</li>
            <li>It really stretches the curls but also gives them volume</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as a Curly Hair STAPLE!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that I got lightly sprinkled on for about 1 minute outside with rain.</li>
            <li>I know that Jane has a real science and technology infrastructure</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable, I use for my children&#x27;s hair also.</li>
            <li>This really helps to detangle my hair</li>
            <li>BUT....if I separate too much my hair becomes frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It has a good texture that coats my wet hair and has enough hold to set my unruly hair.    </li>
            <li>Yes, it is thick but it is best to put it on while the hair is completely wet.  </li>
            <li>She sat under warm dryer for about 10 mins then air dried the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>, i love that the products are natural and not extra profumy...</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I ran into a lady at work with natural hair that looked really defined and similar in texture to mine who told me about Jane Carter Solutions products.</li>
            <li>Very defined curls are the results from using The new Jane Carter Solution Curl Defining Cream.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for my slightly dry banana/large corkscrew Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I used gel and water to define my natural curls (very loose waves in the crown and top, ringlets</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have also used a hooded dryer after applying the product and did notice that you get more shine, but similar effects can be had from air drying or a quick black with the dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had to go to bed soon so to speed up the drying process I sat under my dryer for 15 min on high.</li>
            <li>I also have high praise for JCS Nourish &amp; Shine.</li>
            <li>The price is also a little steep, but if it works for you, you will love it.</li>
            <li>if these individuals like their naturally textured hair and are not seeking to achieve a very altered hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s all organic and doesn&#x27;t leave our hair oily or heavy.</li>
            <li>Better to get a small size and try before spending money to get the 16oz pump jar which cost me $33 at Whole</li>
            <li>in my opinion, this product has a mild, musky scent which (gratefully) fades away as my hair dries.(I don&#x27;t like scents on my hair products, as I prefer them to be non-existent, very minimal, or have a super lovely scent like fredrik fekkai protein RX products, but this is hard to find in the types of products I need to use for my hair type!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had more luck with just plain old water and gel.  </li>
            <li>but my second jar when i  am  finished with the first one.</li>
            <li>First, if you look at the AMAZON,LLC  order picture, over the course of the last week</li>
            <li>The first thing that happens is they send my product out regular mail.  </li>
            <li>First time I actually bought from one of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; options and it was ligit!!!</li>
            <li>It made my normally dry, brittle 4a/b hair super curly and moisturized--and soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li>I have really dry frizzy curly hair and have tried every kind of hair product on the market (both cheap and expensive).</li>
            <li>For 2nd day hair, I spritz with water and maybe I&#x27;ll apply a little more product to the ends of my hair if need be.</li>
            <li>It dries clear.</li>
            <li>but atleast the curls would stay defined and it wont look like a complete afro.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks professionally done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for over two years.  </li>
            <li>but so far have not received a response.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an all  natural  organic product which i  </li>
            <li>and you may actually be surprised.</li>
            <li>I used to get relaxers but have sinced transitioned to natural.</li>
            <li>I personally use this product on my 3c/4a virgin hair and IT ABSOLUTELY DOES WORK.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>and they are soft and in a natural curl.</li>
            <li>I even used this on my hair after just spritzing it with water and it keeps every thing soft and not GREASY.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft after it dries, no crunching.</li>
            <li>and when it comes to my natural hair detangling products are number one.  </li>
            <li>Applied to freshly washed and still wet hair and watched hair SHRINK almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li>I used a good deal of product, but not all of the twists remained twisted.  </li>
            <li>I have used no other product with CDC!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and thirsty, so I went through a tub pretty quick.</li>
            <li>have spent thousands of dollars looking for the right hair care product.  </li>
            <li>I do not comb it through, but rather cover each section from root to tip (to tame the frizz)and smooth it out with my finger tips, focusing on stretching the curls.</li>
            <li>did a second application of this product on clean, conditioned, wet hair, followed directions to the letter.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth the money and last a long time.</li>
            <li>so I slapped my old stand-by Long Aid on my head and went out looking like I had a straight up</li>
            <li>I let it air dry and am able to plump it up after it dried to the volume I wanted</li>
            <li>I either wet my hair first with water or JC revitalizing leave in to twist my hair.</li>
            <li>The only down side to this product is the smell during the original application.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s mixed, but has my heavy curls and thickness, but my husband fine texture).</li>
            <li>from there, i part my hair into 4 large sections and starting from the back of my head, i divide each section into groups of 3.</li>
            <li>and so I was concerned when I went into my local Target to get a new leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I live in europe, but i&#x27;m american</li>
            <li>i have been natural for almost 2 years, i have a mixed batch of coarse, frizzy, thick curls (3c on the bottom and sides, 4a on top, and some 4b in parts) that are about 4-5 inches long (collar bone length when straight).</li>
            <li>You could find it in the store easily, but the price will be about the same - if not more.</li>
            <li>This product does that and a small amount goes a pretty decent way.</li>
            <li>I generally wear my hair in twists or twist outs....</li>
            <li>I was introduced to it by my hair dresser (who does natural hair only).</li>
            <li>So I am about 6 months post bc and am currently entering the in between stage of my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li>I recently chopped off my hair and geared myself up to regain those natural coils.</li>
            <li>Creates soft shiny curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>i believe in keeping it simple and i like my hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>and my curls are soft and even the next day i just spritz with water</li>
            <li>Since I went natural last year after a nine month transition (now 23 months post relaxer) I have become a product junkie.  </li>
            <li>When I was newly natural I tried the products YouTubers bought or made at home with small success.</li>
            <li>The twists had a lovely, subtle shine!</li>
            <li>I was intially skeptical, but after using it only a few times, I noticed my curls and waves looked healthier, no frizz, and more importantly --</li>
            <li>and I will definitely repurchase in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have finally, after 5 years and two big chops of my natural hair, come to appreciate it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of hard to describe, but not really appealing.</li>
            <li>you could only purchase through your local general nutrition store, or hair dresser.  </li>
            <li>After trying to create my own concoctions I was always disappointed in no shine and too much grease.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair is completely dry, I use my fingers to tease the roots a little to get some fun volume.</li>
            <li>I love Jane Carters products and recommend them to people with very thick, unruly, dry and kinky/curly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like any other Jane Carter products, but this one is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li>No matter how much or how little of the product I used, I did not have the desired curl-defining results.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for those times when I just feel like sprucing up my look but didn&#x27;t prepare my hair beforehand.</li>
            <li> this product smells wonderful, however, it doesn&#x27;t keep the twists in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is product must have for me, I&#x27;ve been impressed with all the Jane Carter products I&#x27;ve purchased</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> and I think she has done a great job with the curl defining cream.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my hair and defines the curl without leaving the hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> GREAT for a curly fro.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for restoring moisture.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cute my hair looks!!  </li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I wish the company would have given more information on what hair types get the best results from the product.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product would be good for my truly ethnic nappy/kinky (non curly) hair.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> it is a good investment.</li>
            <li> People noticed a difference (good difference) when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Smells good also.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> Great  products works  perfect for my  naturally curly  hair.</li>
            <li> This is so precious!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal products!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I think it is the best thing since sliced, whole grain bread!  </li>
            <li> Makes my scalp itchy but curls look amazing</li>
            <li> I am always getting compliments on how nice my hair looks .</li>
            <li> The best product I have used is from Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> and I figured I could mix up my own leave-in moisturizer/conditioner from my leftover</li>
            <li> I believe you have to try the products for yourself, then make YOUR OWN CONCLUSION.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent.</li>
            <li> I love it and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> great stuff and worth the price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturinzing as I would like it to be, hence why it gets 4 stars, but nevertheless it is a good product and worth trying.</li>
            <li> and I was quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it s</li>
            <li> my curly hair is going better and better.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;d get better results if I tried it that way.</li>
            <li> I find Shea Moisture Curling Souffle to work much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the Jane Carter products.</li>
            <li> but I found it better elongated the curls when sitting under a hair dryer with this product on, or using a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I love this product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever use another product on our hair. :)</li>
            <li> This works so much better.</li>
            <li> I plan on giving the product two more attempts and if it works better I will update this review.  </li>
            <li> want to revisit this review because after I permanently shelved the JCS, I began using the Kinky Curly products and found that the gel products work better for my hair than the creams.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love the texture.  </li>
            <li> You will pay 5 dollars more.</li>
            <li> or  feel like  wax like  most products do.  </li>
            <li> love.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this product does the trick, no need to apply gel as i see most of my sisters using on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Since I work inside an (overly) air-conditioned office, I am confident I can put this hair style into a once or twice a week rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do well with the 3a hair, it seems to have done better with the 3b.  </li>
            <li> I can see much more of my length now.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing else was able to even \\&quot;touch\\&quot; all my hair.</li>
            <li> Love Jane and her products.</li>
            <li> mango-ey, coconut-ty scents that most hair products marketed towards African-American hairtypes have to them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product on more than one occasion</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the store where I purchased the products (NOT Target - they will not let you return opened beauty care products - product junkies beware!)</li>
            <li> Received my product on time,  in a box that was perfect on the outside.  </li>
            <li> ok my order is expedited and I&#x27;m issued a credit...GREAT and depending on what e-mail I read...</li>
            <li> Considering that the 16oz is at most $34, paying $20 for 6oz is a joke.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I met a hairstylist who used this on my hair and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> ok as the title says...if i were shipwrecked...this would be one of those products i would try to save off the boat.</li>
            <li> i love Jane Carter</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used for my coarse hair</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> It has a citrusy smell, very sweet</li>
            <li> Enjoy your naturalness-it&#x27;s better for you.</li>
            <li> It was an okay product, but when I did detailed overnight styles, it did nothing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must apply to really wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li> I recomend to all that wants to keep her curlies in good shape.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use too much at a time to get a good effect.  </li>
            <li> I was actually quite impressed with the results, my hair was moisturized, it produced soft defined curls and it had the best sheen I have ever had in any product this far.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but makes your curls look rich and healthy.</li>
            <li> the smell is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say it is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> but when I section my hair and lather/coat the strands with this product, it hydrates my strands and gives me springy, beautiful curls instantly!</li>
            <li> It gave me great curl definition (4B), and my hair felt moisturized and looked healthy all day long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> might make for a frizz free twist-out.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Her hair was very shiny, had a nice flexible \\&quot;not crunchy\\&quot; hold, and</li>
            <li> I love the scent, smells fresh and citrusy.  </li>
            <li> Jane Carter is a good product for natural hair</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the seller is well aware that the 6 can be easily mistaken for a 16 because the 16 oz is in the photo.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews I thought this product would solve my hair shrinkage problems, so I hurried to get the product into my very wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Oh it was frizz free AND FULL OF FLAKES.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a ton of compliments on how healthy and pretty my curly hair looks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that I could use this product without much preparation: no washing, no water spritzing, no oiling, nothing!</li>
            <li> And, the smell is a clean herbal/floral scent, not \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; as some reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Leaves curls soft, shiny, and healthy looking and feeling!</li>
            <li> It made my hair way more shiny than Mizani and defined my curls very well.  </li>
            <li> In the back and tighter curls on sides) but that became impractical as my hair began to grow, so I needed a good product that would decrease shrinkage and add some moisture to my curls.</li>
            <li> should say I didn&#x27;t read the instructions, haha, but I am pleased with the results I got with this method:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> absolutely frzz free!</li>
            <li> allowed me to return them for a full refund.</li>
            <li> but it will DEFINE your beautiful tight curls.</li>
            <li> It looked like the creamy consistency of Miss Jessies Quick Curls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works super well after I have washed and conditioned my hair -</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best product I have used so far, and I have a complete hair products store under my sink!</li>
            <li> Yep, I may have gotten something for free, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for that in the first place.</li>
            <li> When you first start to use it, go easy until you learn the right amount for you.  </li>
            <li> It keeps our curls in tact and moisturizes at the same time, it&#x27;s phenomenal!     </li>
            <li> After a wash, i put this on with my Shea Moisture Leave in Conditioner (not too much!!)</li>
            <li> love this product because the smell is not excessive, it delivers what is promises: curls defined (never promised to elongate curls).</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t happy that my hair seemed to harden (again, felt like straw) as it dried, so I may not even try it with the hood dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out with a great curl that holds for a few days, or til I hit the gym and shower it out.</li>
            <li> Eventually the smell wears out (not too long after you apply it) and you have wonderful curls all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to wear my natural hair out, but I wanted to define my curl pattern a bit more, so it just didn&#x27;t look like a q-tip on my head.</li>
            <li> Overall effective.</li>
            <li> but, not really that good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to master the right amount to use.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been trying to order the right size of the product and seem to keep having problems.  </li>
            <li> so I end up with these really defined, shiny, healthy, soft curls!</li>
            <li> This was rely nice and has my son hair looking moist for a very long time...</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is like a conditioner with a mild scent that is not my absolute favourite -</li>
            <li> It leaves my very curly hair super shinny, lossenes the curlys, and gives it a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to strong smells, do not buy.</li>
            <li> just pretty twists.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time over the weekend and...</li>
            <li> I only wish I had a personal consultation with Jane herself to make sure I was getting the most out of her products.</li>
            <li> I use a leave-in conditioner in my hair first, then seal with an oil before applying the product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the look it gives me so far.</li>
            <li> this product makes my curls pattern look consistent throughout my head</li>
            <li> To be fair, I think this product is to be applied and then dried by sitting under a hood dryer.</li>
            <li> hair is nice and soft, but not curly enough for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is not that coarse--it&#x27;s medium texture, has a nice curl/wave pattern when wet and is easily straightened with a blow drier and flat iron.</li>
            <li> The best styling product for my hair has only been Kinky Kurly Curling Custard, but due to its high cost, I wanted to try an alternative natural product in the Curl Defining Cream.</li>
            <li> I used JC&#x27;s other products, and had great results, but this cream I&#x27;m totally sold on.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so super soft.  </li>
            <li> Just nice tight twists.  </li>
            <li> Her products cost a little more, but I have found that they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Jane.</li>
            <li> If too much is used, it can give the hair that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feeling...  </li>
            <li> It really defined my curls</li>
            <li> It relaxed it just a bit, but you couldn&#x27;t really tell, it just looked</li>
            <li> Thanks Jane Carter.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very deceptive</li>
            <li> It really stretches the curls but also gives them volume</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as a Curly Hair STAPLE!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I got lightly sprinkled on for about 1 minute outside with rain.</li>
            <li> I know that Jane has a real science and technology infrastructure</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable, I use for my children&#x27;s hair also.</li>
            <li> This really helps to detangle my hair</li>
            <li> BUT....if I separate too much my hair becomes frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It has a good texture that coats my wet hair and has enough hold to set my unruly hair.    </li>
            <li> Yes, it is thick but it is best to put it on while the hair is completely wet.  </li>
            <li> She sat under warm dryer for about 10 mins then air dried the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> , i love that the products are natural and not extra profumy...</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when I ran into a lady at work with natural hair that looked really defined and similar in texture to mine who told me about Jane Carter Solutions products.</li>
            <li> Very defined curls are the results from using The new Jane Carter Solution Curl Defining Cream.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my slightly dry banana/large corkscrew Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I used gel and water to define my natural curls (very loose waves in the crown and top, ringlets</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have also used a hooded dryer after applying the product and did notice that you get more shine, but similar effects can be had from air drying or a quick black with the dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to go to bed soon so to speed up the drying process I sat under my dryer for 15 min on high.</li>
            <li> I also have high praise for JCS Nourish &amp; Shine.</li>
            <li> The price is also a little steep, but if it works for you, you will love it.</li>
            <li> if these individuals like their naturally textured hair and are not seeking to achieve a very altered hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s all organic and doesn&#x27;t leave our hair oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> Better to get a small size and try before spending money to get the 16oz pump jar which cost me $33 at Whole</li>
            <li> in my opinion, this product has a mild, musky scent which (gratefully) fades away as my hair dries.(I don&#x27;t like scents on my hair products, as I prefer them to be non-existent, very minimal, or have a super lovely scent like fredrik fekkai protein RX products, but this is hard to find in the types of products I need to use for my hair type!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had more luck with just plain old water and gel.  </li>
            <li> but my second jar when i  am  finished with the first one.</li>
            <li> First, if you look at the AMAZON,LLC  order picture, over the course of the last week</li>
            <li> The first thing that happens is they send my product out regular mail.  </li>
            <li> First time I actually bought from one of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; options and it was ligit!!!</li>
            <li> It made my normally dry, brittle 4a/b hair super curly and moisturized--and soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have really dry frizzy curly hair and have tried every kind of hair product on the market (both cheap and expensive).</li>
            <li> For 2nd day hair, I spritz with water and maybe I&#x27;ll apply a little more product to the ends of my hair if need be.</li>
            <li> It dries clear.</li>
            <li> but atleast the curls would stay defined and it wont look like a complete afro.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks professionally done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over two years.  </li>
            <li> but so far have not received a response.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an all  natural  organic product which i  </li>
            <li> and you may actually be surprised.</li>
            <li> I used to get relaxers but have sinced transitioned to natural.</li>
            <li> I personally use this product on my 3c/4a virgin hair and IT ABSOLUTELY DOES WORK.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> and they are soft and in a natural curl.</li>
            <li> I even used this on my hair after just spritzing it with water and it keeps every thing soft and not GREASY.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft after it dries, no crunching.</li>
            <li> and when it comes to my natural hair detangling products are number one.  </li>
            <li> Applied to freshly washed and still wet hair and watched hair SHRINK almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li> I used a good deal of product, but not all of the twists remained twisted.  </li>
            <li> I have used no other product with CDC!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and thirsty, so I went through a tub pretty quick.</li>
            <li> have spent thousands of dollars looking for the right hair care product.  </li>
            <li> I do not comb it through, but rather cover each section from root to tip (to tame the frizz)and smooth it out with my finger tips, focusing on stretching the curls.</li>
            <li> did a second application of this product on clean, conditioned, wet hair, followed directions to the letter.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth the money and last a long time.</li>
            <li> so I slapped my old stand-by Long Aid on my head and went out looking like I had a straight up</li>
            <li> I let it air dry and am able to plump it up after it dried to the volume I wanted</li>
            <li> I either wet my hair first with water or JC revitalizing leave in to twist my hair.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is the smell during the original application.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s mixed, but has my heavy curls and thickness, but my husband fine texture).</li>
            <li> from there, i part my hair into 4 large sections and starting from the back of my head, i divide each section into groups of 3.</li>
            <li> and so I was concerned when I went into my local Target to get a new leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I live in europe, but i&#x27;m american</li>
            <li> i have been natural for almost 2 years, i have a mixed batch of coarse, frizzy, thick curls (3c on the bottom and sides, 4a on top, and some 4b in parts) that are about 4-5 inches long (collar bone length when straight).</li>
            <li> You could find it in the store easily, but the price will be about the same - if not more.</li>
            <li> This product does that and a small amount goes a pretty decent way.</li>
            <li> I generally wear my hair in twists or twist outs....</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it by my hair dresser (who does natural hair only).</li>
            <li> So I am about 6 months post bc and am currently entering the in between stage of my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li> I recently chopped off my hair and geared myself up to regain those natural coils.</li>
            <li> Creates soft shiny curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> i believe in keeping it simple and i like my hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> and my curls are soft and even the next day i just spritz with water</li>
            <li> Since I went natural last year after a nine month transition (now 23 months post relaxer) I have become a product junkie.  </li>
            <li> When I was newly natural I tried the products YouTubers bought or made at home with small success.</li>
            <li> The twists had a lovely, subtle shine!</li>
            <li> I was intially skeptical, but after using it only a few times, I noticed my curls and waves looked healthier, no frizz, and more importantly --</li>
            <li> and I will definitely repurchase in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have finally, after 5 years and two big chops of my natural hair, come to appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> Kind of hard to describe, but not really appealing.</li>
            <li> you could only purchase through your local general nutrition store, or hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> After trying to create my own concoctions I was always disappointed in no shine and too much grease.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair is completely dry, I use my fingers to tease the roots a little to get some fun volume.</li>
            <li> I love Jane Carters products and recommend them to people with very thick, unruly, dry and kinky/curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like any other Jane Carter products, but this one is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> No matter how much or how little of the product I used, I did not have the desired curl-defining results.</li>
            <li> The outside of my hair was dry and crunchy, but the inner parts of my hair was not dry at all, so I took my blow dryer and held it over the still damp parts.</li>
            <li> This cream left my curls defined, shiny, and a little looser than normal</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it kinda smelled like windex when I first smelled it</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I bought his product - and it was not cheap.</li>
            <li> It is not made for tight coiled super thick and coarse hair types because 4b/4c hair does not have a natural loose curl pattern.</li>
            <li> No weird oils to clog hair follicles, stinky smells, hard to wash out residue.</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be soaking wet in order for it to work and you have to twist and define each curl and let it dry completely before you can start messing with it.</li>
            <li> , I purchased the JCS product over Goddess Curls, African Pride hair dress and a few other options because the smell was naturally light (and like a green pine [I don&#x27;t go for overly floral or musky stuff])</li>
            <li> I have used it as a wash-and-go product and also for a flat twist-out.</li>
            <li> use the hair has to be wet and the amount of creamy gook that it takes for combing it in is a little too much.  </li>
            <li> I oiled my hands with a mix of grapeseed oil, Caudalie dry oil and extra virgin olive oil and released the twists</li>
            <li> I squeeze about 1-2 tablespoon into my hand, work it through my strands and ends, then blow dry or sit under a bonnet hair dryer (yes totally old-fashioned).</li>
            <li> but in its natural condition, it looks like half an inch.  </li>
            <li> No change in the results from the first time, hair when dry was hard, slightly crunchy and had considerable shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> at first it is time consuming, but with a few weeks you can get it down to a 20 minute process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have what some of the reviewers are calling type 4 hair (pen-spring size coils, fine strands, densely packed, frizzy or Z shaped twists in some random places)</li>
            <li> The product left my hair undefined and very dry after one day.</li>
            <li> My only criticism (which does deserve a 1 star deduction) is that it is really not moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Curls were defined, but no more than they are normally sans product.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> To conclude, the JCS Curl Defining Cream is absolutely NOT for coarse textured 4b/4c hair types.  </li>
            <li> You can buy the 6oz for roughly 15 dollars at your local Target.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons for going natural is not having to put harsh chemicals in my hair.</li>
            <li> everyone saying that the product did nothing for their hair, i recommend only using it on soaking wet hair</li>
            <li> although, in contrast to other curl-defining products i&#x27;ve tried, it seemed to keep my hair from being dripping wet when I left the house, it also left my hair feeling like straw with shrinkage.</li>
            <li> when complete, i usually blow dry all over for 90 seconds (i like big hair) and let it air dry out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will not give you long flowing ringlets if you have 4a 4b kinky hair!</li>
            <li> I was always looking to have it stretched, wavy or loosely curled.  </li>
            <li> my hair also loves natural raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> Eventually at the end of the day my hair would dry and not have the wet/wavy look anymore</li>
            <li> With my hair being as dry as it is, I will probably need to find another product OR mix it with an oil or cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way JCS makes my hair feel when it is dry and</li>
            <li> My hair could be dry as the DESERT</li>
            <li> Sometimes i blow dry</li>
            <li> I use this when I keep wearing my curly hair weave, and sometimes achieve the same look with mousse, but the mouse is a little drying and make my weave stiff while the Jane Carter cream keeps it soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a very long way so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product helps me to give my hair less of a tight curly look when it dries naturally.</li>
            <li> but it actually reminds me of Fruit Loops cereal, and the scent becomes less noticeable as the hair dries.  </li>
            <li> to apply to hair when hair is wet vs. dry.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it to do wet and dry twist out.  </li>
            <li> My hair had shrunken back to a tight semi- TWA.</li>
            <li> It usually last me for abut 2 months and that includes using it on my 8 year old who has very thick (if she wore a bra) bra strap lengh wavy hair .</li>
            <li> It smells like peppery sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li> I used this product by dividing my hair in sections and smoothing it through wet hair (as described in the directions).  </li>
            <li> On moderately wet hair we applied the Curl Definer in sections of hair (about a nickel sized amount to each section).</li>
            <li> I need something that dries harder and that can keep the curls.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several stylers and I will say that this one is one of the few that I would repurchase.  </li>
            <li> I almosst hated to wash it; it looked and felt so good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its really for people with stiff and thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I personally recommend applying the cream to small sections that are soaking wet to work the product in and I diffuse from that point after 30 minutes of airdrying.</li>
            <li> However, since my hair is so coarse and thick when dry and wet, I don&#x27;t believe the product will work as advertised for my hair</li>
            <li> A little of the product goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> a little bit of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of the Curl Defining cream goes a long way on very wet hair.</li>
            <li> If someone else smells it, they are extremely close to you-almost to sniff your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the other JCS products (conditioner, shampoo, leave in), and will review those.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because it did not elongate my curls, other than that it&#x27;s a STAPLE product of mine now.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mention the smell being bother some, but the smell doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;make or break\\</li>
            <li> I twisted my hair into about 30 twists that were bigger or smaller than a regular pencil&lt;</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the Jane Carter Defining Cream is just as the other users have said.  </li>
            <li> I choose to apply it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet and untangled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overseas, and my hair was damaged due to the water.  </li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair, I applied it on very wet hair and sealed it with carrot oil.  </li>
            <li> It did not work for me - my hair felt heavy and dry.</li>
            <li> It is still less pricey than some other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Also to add, when I retwist my hair, I have a lot less breakage than with other products.  </li>
            <li> Have used a few other products like KCCC, Miss Jessie&#x27;s, and other conditioners with no solution to reducing puffiness in rain and humidity.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to take</li>
            <li> I am of hispanic descent and my hair is extremely thick, coarse, curly/kinky/wavy.</li>
            <li> a somebody threw this stuff down and cracked it type appearance.</li>
            <li> Because it is so expensive, and my hair is so thick causing me to use a lot in one session, I do not use it everyday, I reserve it for the really desperate times lol.</li>
            <li> Jane uses natural ingredients that won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, weighed-down, hard and crunchy or dull from build-up.</li>
            <li> I can get the defined curly look using Knot Today and Eco-Styler Gel and these products don&#x27;t cause as much shrinkage as JCS and they definitely don&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> The deciding factor in purchasing this product was the reviews on Amazon as well as the fact that it was half the price of Miss Jessie&#x27;s.    </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I have very thick and long hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product in an attempt to finally style my hair naturally after years of boring buns or straight hair.</li>
            <li> my hair was a matted, tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick colored 4a hair.  </li>
            <li> i detangle each subsection of 3 with a denman brush and apply a little less than a dime size to each.</li>
            <li> I have coily, tightly wound hair ...</li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t dry hard on the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t keep the curl either.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;(4) I stretched each twist downward, twisted it with the next twist it ran into in the column, and pinned with bobby pin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its a one day thing, but what little bit it did  </li>
            <li> little pricey.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing Mandy&#x27;s hair, we sprayed on the Revitalizing Leave In Conditioner, and a little of Jane&#x27;s Wrap and Roll.</li>
            <li> and they last at least two or three days!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair or make it stiff, hard, or flaky.</li>
            <li> I was let down - AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Before using this product my hair, as it dried, would shrink.</li>
            <li> Now it stays at the length I want even after it has air dried.</li>
            <li> Work well in humidity- too crunchy for everyday</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used a few curl definers, and I must say that this one is definately an all in one product, giving you hold, shine, definition and moisture.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not as thick as Curls Whipped Cream and doesn&#x27;t keep your hair wet like the Kinky Curly Curling Custard.  </li>
            <li> I tried this before and somehow the product for this price was not available.  </li>
            <li> No strong smells.</li>
            <li> leave me with little ringlets (4a or 4b whatever you want to call kinky and thick hair)</li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t be fooled, I use a small amount per section of hair.  </li>
            <li> I twisted up my hair when I came back in thinking the two products together</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions on the jar, but apply a small amount to the hair section as I twist it.  </li>
            <li> , it reminds me of the old fashion lemon cold cream scent.  </li>
            <li> If I had been using Curl Styling Milk and the Gel Souffle from Shea Moisture, my style would&#x27;ve frizzed out into my multi-puff afro style I usually wear from the moment of untwist.</li>
            <li> I used just a small amount on 5 braids and sat under the dryer for 20mins on Sunday.</li>
            <li> Usually I have lots of shrinkage but this product put a stop to that.</li>
            <li> Shingle the product in small sections.</li>
            <li> that they even sold this product as in the past</li>
            <li> i would  recommend it  to  anyone who is  looking for a  product that would not  make your curls hard  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would give me a couple of days at least.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve spent a bunch of money looking for the product that works with my hair.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes i airdry, but i have thick hair</li>
            <li> I also applied a very small amount to the twist as I untwisted it.</li>
            <li> It dried and looked dull and felt like straw!!</li>
            <li> and I seriously want a refund.</li>
            <li> i seriously eat, sleep, breathe this product.</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but it takes very little product.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is VERY THICK (reminds of Elmer&#x27;s glue but a tad bit thicker).</li>
            <li> but I have tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, Eco-styler and have had poor results too.</li>
            <li> I twisted my hair and unraveled the twist in the morning.  </li>
            <li> So ... for those who commented that the product is awful ... I only wonder</li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair every 10 days, but my schedule got crazy and it was</li>
            <li> I am not too crazy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about a cold weather crack..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews just try it for yourself..</li>
            <li> Don;t be swayed by the bad reviews, try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> And, had I not looked, I would have cut my hand badly.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed in Amazon because of this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely dreadful.</li>
            <li> Horrible use of fragrance.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product helps me to give my hair less of a tight curly look when it dries naturally. Before using this product my hair, as it dried, would shrink. Now it stays at the length I want even after it has air dried.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  I thought this product would be good for my truly ethnic nappy/kinky (non curly) hair.&lt;br /&gt;For use the hair has to be wet and the amount of creamy gook that it takes for combing it in is a little too much.  It has a&lt;br /&gt;high price for the eventual outcome on my kinky type hair.  I want to stop relaxing my hair but this does not seem&lt;br /&gt;to be the answer.</li>
            <li> This product, as some others mentioned, does what it says-moisturizes, defines your curl pattern (FYI-it does not create curls), and is not tacky (sticky).  A little goes a long way, and I have very thick and long hair.  Now, don&#x27;t be fooled, I use a small amount per section of hair.  When you first start to use it, go easy until you learn the right amount for you.  The aromatic scent will go away.  If someone else smells it, they are extremely close to you-almost to sniff your hair.  I&#x27;ve ordered the other JCS products (conditioner, shampoo, leave in), and will review those.  This product is worth the money and last a long time. Enjoy your naturalness-it&#x27;s better for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a week and I have to say it is pretty amazing. It does what it says it will do so it is a good investment. This cream left my curls defined, shiny, and a little looser than normal (I have 3c/4a curls). The texture of the cream is VERY THICK (reminds of Elmer&#x27;s glue but a tad bit thicker). It&#x27;s not as moisturinzing as I would like it to be, hence why it gets 4 stars, but nevertheless it is a good product and worth trying. Also, a little goes a very long way so it will last for a long time. I personally recommend applying the cream to small sections that are soaking wet to work the product in and I diffuse from that point after 30 minutes of airdrying. People noticed a difference (good difference) when I started using this product. I love it and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my curls defined throughout the day like it said it would. Eventually at the end of the day my hair would dry and not have the wet/wavy look anymore but atleast the curls would stay defined and it wont look like a complete afro. The only down side to this product is the smell during the original application. It smells like peppery sunflower seeds. Kind of hard to describe, but not really appealing. Eventually the smell wears out (not too long after you apply it) and you have wonderful curls all day long.</li>
            <li> If you like kinky curly curling custard for a defining curl, you will not like this. It&#x27;s neither moisturizing nor defining. I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in an attempt to finally style my hair naturally after years of boring buns or straight hair. The deciding factor in purchasing this product was the reviews on Amazon as well as the fact that it was half the price of Miss Jessie&#x27;s.    I have to say that this is a great product.  I used it for a twist out and I was quite pleased with the results.  It has a good texture that coats my wet hair and has enough hold to set my unruly hair.    My only criticism (which does deserve a 1 star deduction) is that it is really not moisturizing.  With my hair being as dry as it is, I will probably need to find another product OR mix it with an oil or cream.</li>
            <li> I love it, it s second time I buy it and my curly hair is going better and better.  I recomend to all that wants to keep her curlies in good shape.</li>
            <li> I order this product because I&#x27;m such a product junkie. I was actually quite impressed with the results, my hair was moisturized, it produced soft defined curls and it had the best sheen I have ever had in any product this far. A little of the product goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use a lot. I gave it four stars because it did not elongate my curls, other than that it&#x27;s a STAPLE product of mine now. Don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews just try it for yourself..</li>
            <li> I tried air drying my hair with this product and although, in contrast to other curl-defining products i&#x27;ve tried, it seemed to keep my hair from being dripping wet when I left the house, it also left my hair feeling like straw with shrinkage. My hair is not that coarse--it&#x27;s medium texture, has a nice curl/wave pattern when wet and is easily straightened with a blow drier and flat iron. To be fair, I think this product is to be applied and then dried by sitting under a hood dryer. Perhaps I&#x27;d get better results if I tried it that way. However, I wasn&#x27;t happy that my hair seemed to harden (again, felt like straw) as it dried, so I may not even try it with the hood dryer. I find Shea Moisture Curling Souffle to work much better.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It is not too watery or too pasty. It dries clear. I can apply it daily without any problems. My hair is thick and thirsty, so I went through a tub pretty quick. I&#x27;m still trying to master the right amount to use. I actually like the scent of the cream. It&#x27;s pricey for what you get though. Oh, and I should mention I have 4b/c hair. The kinkiest type. (damn genetics)</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. Finally found my gem. I have long, thick colored 4a hair.  Have used a few other products like KCCC, Miss Jessie&#x27;s, and other conditioners with no solution to reducing puffiness in rain and humidity.  This is my god-send.  It will be my mainstay.  Love it.  Thanks Jane.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the Jane Carter products. Everything they promised was provided. My hair always looks professionally done. I am always getting compliments on how nice my hair looks .</li>
            <li> I like Jane Carter&#x27;s line so I was hoping for the best with this product.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s in a pump container and you don&#x27;t have to use too much at a time to get a good effect.  If too much is used, it can give the hair that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feeling...  I used this product by dividing my hair in sections and smoothing it through wet hair (as described in the directions).  It really defined my curls but I found it better elongated the curls when sitting under a hair dryer with this product on, or using a diffuser.  It has a citrusy smell, very sweet but it actually reminds me of Fruit Loops cereal, and the scent becomes less noticeable as the hair dries.  All in all, I love this product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I was introduced to it by my hair dresser (who does natural hair only). I was intially skeptical, but after using it only a few times, I noticed my curls and waves looked healthier, no frizz, and more importantly -- my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled!    I use this for my daughter as well (she&#x27;s mixed, but has my heavy curls and thickness, but my husband fine texture). It works wonders for hers and mine. I love the fact that it&#x27;s all organic and doesn&#x27;t leave our hair oily or heavy. It keeps our curls in tact and moisturizes at the same time, it&#x27;s phenomenal!     I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever use another product on our hair. :)</li>
            <li> Nothing this good out there!  Leaves curls soft, shiny, and healthy looking and feeling! Woo Hoo!&lt;br /&gt;Best to apply to hair when hair is wet vs. dry.  My sister recommended this product, and she was right!&lt;br /&gt;I have spent thousands of dollars looking for the right hair care product.  My search is over...this is it!!!</li>
            <li> Great for a wash and go. It gave me great curl definition (4B), and my hair felt moisturized and looked healthy all day long.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my 4A hair at all. I have had more luck with just plain old water and gel.  My hair was sticky and I had to wash it out the very next day. This product may work miracles for others so please try it but I have tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, Eco-styler and have had poor results too. The best product I have used is from Whole Foods.  It is fair trade and it works!~</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it&#x27;s supposed to take but this didn&#x27;t work for me and I don&#x27;t like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to wear my natural hair out, but I wanted to define my curl pattern a bit more, so it just didn&#x27;t look like a q-tip on my head. Also wanted to see if it would give my hair some movement. I applied it like the label said and I had to go to bed soon so to speed up the drying process I sat under my dryer for 15 min on high. The outside of my hair was dry and crunchy, but the inner parts of my hair was not dry at all, so I took my blow dryer and held it over the still damp parts. It relaxed it just a bit, but you couldn&#x27;t really tell, it just looked like I finger combed it a lot to get the bit of stretch that I had.  It also made my hair look ashy, so I had to put some oil in my hair. I don&#x27;t know if its a one day thing, but what little bit it did  was not there the next morning.  My hair had shrunken back to a tight semi- TWA. I was hoping that it would give me a couple of days at least. I don&#x27;t think its really for people with stiff and thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this CDC yesterday after using Mizani Moisture Stretch for a while.  I LOVE IT!!!!! It made my hair way more shiny than Mizani and defined my curls very well.  Yes, it is thick but it is best to put it on while the hair is completely wet.  I let it air dry and am able to plump it up after it dried to the volume I wanted but it looks beautiful and smells great.  The jar is going to last me a while.  Thanks Jane Carter.  After trying to create my own concoctions I was always disappointed in no shine and too much grease.  This works so much better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely dreadful. Applied to freshly washed and still wet hair and watched hair SHRINK almost instantaneously. Curls were defined, but no more than they are normally sans product. It dried and looked dull and felt like straw!! I had to go out so I slapped my old stand-by Long Aid on my head and went out looking like I had a straight up Jheri curl. I twisted up my hair when I came back in thinking the two products together might make for a frizz free twist-out. Oh it was frizz free AND FULL OF FLAKES. A complete waste of money and I seriously want a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over two years.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ve spent a bunch of money looking for the product that works with my hair.  And I&#x27;ve finally found it!!!  I generally wear my hair in twists or twist outs....and nothing has ever resulted in the look I was hoping for.  Jane Carter Solution Curl Defining Cream is amazing!!  Yes, it does elongate my hair. Yes, the twists hold for days and days...no fuzzing; no puffing.  Just nice tight twists.  I left the twists in for 3 days before doing a twist out.  I can&#x27;t believe how cute my hair looks!!  No puffing up, no fuzzing; just pretty twists.  My hair is softer than I can remember.  And there is no product buildup.  I try to wash my hair every 10 days, but my schedule got crazy and it was two weeks before I did a co-wash.  I almosst hated to wash it; it looked and felt so good.  It even keeps my scalp moisturized.  Yes, it is expensive, but it takes very little product.  I follow the instructions on the jar, but apply a small amount to the hair section as I twist it.  I also applied a very small amount to the twist as I untwisted it. I have used no other product with CDC!!  I&#x27;m probably a combination 4a/b hair type if you use Andre Walker&#x27;s system.  I know no product works for everyone; but after two years, I&#x27;ve finally found the one that works for me!!</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews I thought this product would solve my hair shrinkage problems, so I hurried to get the product into my very wet hair.  It does not work for kinky coiled hair, forget about defined curls.  All I got was oily hair with a lot of shrinkage.  I attempted a two strand twist on my hair and when I removed the twists, and sprayed the hair with water, the shrinkage returned.  It is not made for tight coiled super thick and coarse hair types because 4b/4c hair does not have a natural loose curl pattern. I wish the company would have given more information on what hair types get the best results from the product.  I emailed the company twice but so far have not received a response.  I plan on giving the product two more attempts and if it works better I will update this review.  However, since my hair is so coarse and thick when dry and wet, I don&#x27;t believe the product will work as advertised for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a second application of this product on clean, conditioned, wet hair, followed directions to the letter.  I definitely don&#x27;t like the smell, it reminds me of the old fashion lemon cold cream scent.  Horrible use of fragrance.  No change in the results from the first time, hair when dry was hard, slightly crunchy and had considerable shrinkage.  To conclude, the JCS Curl Defining Cream is absolutely NOT for coarse textured 4b/4c hair types.  Better to get a small size and try before spending money to get the 16oz pump jar which cost me $33 at Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to revisit this review because after I permanently shelved the JCS, I began using the Kinky Curly products and found that the gel products work better for my hair than the creams.  I don&#x27;t like the way JCS makes my hair feel when it is dry and the smell is too strong for me.  I can get the defined curly look using Knot Today and Eco-Styler Gel and these products don&#x27;t cause as much shrinkage as JCS and they definitely don&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  This is so precious! It makes my hair so super soft.  I&#x27;ve used it for wash and go and I&#x27;ve used it to do wet and dry twist out.  This product along with castor oil are my staple.  I  have 4a/4b hair. Also, I love the smell and I love the texture.  It absorbs well.  Leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but makes your curls look rich and healthy. I would recommend using this product. You could find it in the store easily, but the price will be about the same - if not more.</li>
            <li> So I am about 6 months post bc and am currently entering the in between stage of my natural hair journey. In the beginning I used gel and water to define my natural curls (very loose waves in the crown and top, ringlets In the back and tighter curls on sides) but that became impractical as my hair began to grow, so I needed a good product that would decrease shrinkage and add some moisture to my curls. This product does that and a small amount goes a pretty decent way. Other reviewers mention the smell being bother some, but the smell doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;make or break\\&quot; this product for me and I will definitely repurchase in the near future.</li>
            <li> Work well in humidity- too crunchy for everyday</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. It works well on my hair, however the picture they used to identify it is deceptive. The picture shown is of the 16 oz Curl Defining Cream; however this is the 6 oz. You can buy the 6oz for roughly 15 dollars at your local Target. Do not buy it here if you can buy it locally. You will pay 5 dollars more. That&#x27;s very deceptive and I&#x27;m very disappointed in Amazon because of this.</li>
            <li> Great  products works  perfect for my  naturally curly  hair. i would  recommend it  to  anyone who is  looking for a  product that would not  make your curls hard  or  feel like  wax like  most products do.  it&#x27;s an all  natural  organic product which i  love. i can&#x27;t wait to  but my second jar when i  am  finished with the first one.</li>
            <li> great stuff and worth the price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently chopped off my hair and geared myself up to regain those natural coils. Let me tell you, this product does the trick, no need to apply gel as i see most of my sisters using on YouTube. I will definitely upgrade to the pump size once my fro grows longer.</li>
            <li> little pricey.  but it does give you curls</li>
            <li> I have really dry frizzy curly hair and have tried every kind of hair product on the market (both cheap and expensive). This has been the best product for my hair type. It really stretches the curls but also gives them volume so I end up with these really defined, shiny, healthy, soft curls! Your hair has to be soaking wet in order for it to work and you have to twist and define each curl and let it dry completely before you can start messing with it. Once my hair is completely dry, I use my fingers to tease the roots a little to get some fun volume. I&#x27;ve been getting a ton of compliments on how healthy and pretty my curly hair looks.</li>
            <li> Before I start I must indicate that the only draw back with this product is the fragrance/scent/smell- I am not too crazy this. However, this product is my &#x27;Go-To&#x27; Styling Cream!!! My hair could be dry as the DESERT but when I section my hair and lather/coat the strands with this product, it hydrates my strands and gives me springy, beautiful curls instantly! I LOVE the fact that I could use this product without much preparation: no washing, no water spritzing, no oiling, nothing! It&#x27;s perfect for those times when I just feel like sprucing up my look but didn&#x27;t prepare my hair beforehand. I would highly recommend this product as a Curly Hair STAPLE! Because it is so expensive, and my hair is so thick causing me to use a lot in one session, I do not use it everyday, I reserve it for the really desperate times lol. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time over the weekend and...WOW!!!  It made my normally dry, brittle 4a/b hair super curly and moisturized--and soft, not sticky. This will definitely become a staple for me. I also have high praise for JCS Nourish &amp; Shine. Phenomenal products!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m sold! I have what some of the reviewers are calling type 4 hair (pen-spring size coils, fine strands, densely packed, frizzy or Z shaped twists in some random places) and so I was concerned when I went into my local Target to get a new leave-in conditioner. I know, I know--this isn&#x27;t a leave-in! But I didn&#x27;t want to buy Shea Moisture&#x27;s Hair Milk anymore. It was an okay product, but when I did detailed overnight styles, it did nothing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I purchased the JCS product over Goddess Curls, African Pride hair dress and a few other options because the smell was naturally light (and like a green pine [I don&#x27;t go for overly floral or musky stuff]) and I figured I could mix up my own leave-in moisturizer/conditioner from my leftover products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say I didn&#x27;t read the instructions, haha, but I am pleased with the results I got with this method:&lt;br /&gt;(1) I dampened my hair (I only had day-old Shea Moisture smoothie and some Coconut Oil in it)&lt;br /&gt;(2) I liberally applied 2 x pea-size dollop to each section I was going to twist&lt;br /&gt;(3) I twisted my hair into about 30 twists that were bigger or smaller than a regular pencil&lt;br /&gt;(4) I stretched each twist downward, twisted it with the next twist it ran into in the column, and pinned with bobby pin&lt;br /&gt;(5) Any spare, short hair that was frizzing I used a mini perm rod on, 8 hours passed...&lt;br /&gt;(6) I oiled my hands with a mix of grapeseed oil, Caudalie dry oil and extra virgin olive oil and released the twists&lt;br /&gt;(7) Lifted my roots with my pick and BAM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair isn&#x27;t crunchy or sticky. The twists had a lovely, subtle shine! It&#x27;s been raining all day, the humidity is at 83% and it&#x27;s about 74 degrees outside...yet my hair was still defined in the twists for 6 hours. Keep in mind that I got lightly sprinkled on for about 1 minute outside with rain. At hour 8, only the ends of my twists are still defined, the rest has puffed up into waves at the roots outward. If I had been using Curl Styling Milk and the Gel Souffle from Shea Moisture, my style would&#x27;ve frizzed out into my multi-puff afro style I usually wear from the moment of untwist. Since I work inside an (overly) air-conditioned office, I am confident I can put this hair style into a once or twice a week rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find someone to sample this off of, please try that. I understand hair-typing, but everyone&#x27;s strands are different. Try it for yourself like I did and you may actually be surprised.</li>
            <li> Very defined curls are the results from using The new Jane Carter Solution Curl Defining Cream. After shampooing Mandy&#x27;s hair, we sprayed on the Revitalizing Leave In Conditioner, and a little of Jane&#x27;s Wrap and Roll. On moderately wet hair we applied the Curl Definer in sections of hair (about a nickel sized amount to each section). She sat under warm dryer for about 10 mins then air dried the rest of the way. Her hair was very shiny, had a nice flexible \\&quot;not crunchy\\&quot; hold, and absolutely frzz free! We&#x27;ve used a few curl definers, and I must say that this one is definately an all in one product, giving you hold, shine, definition and moisture.  It looked like the creamy consistency of Miss Jessies Quick Curls.  It was also tried on 4c texturized hair. Results were good, her hair was also very well moisturised and defined!!!!!!!!!!!  I definelty give this product 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great product. I haven&#x27;t tried it using dryer but it works in keeping curls still. Smells good also. Overall effective.</li>
            <li> this product smells wonderful, however, it doesn&#x27;t keep the twists in my hair.  I have 3a hair in the front and 3b hair in the back.  it didn&#x27;t do well with the 3a hair, it seems to have done better with the 3b.  but, not really that good.  I used a good deal of product, but not all of the twists remained twisted.  the product doesn&#x27;t dry hard on the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t keep the curl either.  I will use up the product and not buy again.  I need something that dries harder and that can keep the curls.  hair is nice and soft, but not curly enough for me.</li>
            <li> This is product must have for me, I&#x27;ve been impressed with all the Jane Carter products I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best product I have used so far, and I have a complete hair products store under my sink! This product has surpassed Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, and Curls Whipped Cream products. I have 3b/3c hair and it defines the curls and is a great moisturizer. I have used it as a wash-and-go product and also for a flat twist-out. The cream is not as thick as Curls Whipped Cream and doesn&#x27;t keep your hair wet like the Kinky Curly Curling Custard.  I don&#x27;t particularly like any other Jane Carter products, but this one is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I used just a small amount on 5 braids and sat under the dryer for 20mins on Sunday. Today, Tuesday, my hair is still shiny, moist and curly. Usually I have lots of shrinkage but this product put a stop to that. I can see much more of my length now.  My hair is not greasy or sticky. The best part is the shine to the curls and the moist feeling. I thought it was pricey but I&#x27;m happy with the results. I know that Jane has a real science and technology infrastructure and I think she has done a great job with the curl defining cream.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It feels great on my hair and defines the curl without leaving the hair crunchy. The only complaint is that it kinda smelled like windex when I first smelled it</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am of hispanic descent and my hair is extremely thick, coarse, curly/kinky/wavy. I used to get relaxers but have sinced transitioned to natural. This is the best product for my hair. Nothing else was able to even \\&quot;touch\\&quot; all my hair. I love Jane Carters products and recommend them to people with very thick, unruly, dry and kinky/curly hair. Love it! 4 stars for me. I only wish I had a personal consultation with Jane herself to make sure I was getting the most out of her products. Transitioning takes time, patience and (for me) a lot of trial and error to find what works. Her products cost a little more, but I have found that they are worth it. No weird oils to clog hair follicles, stinky smells, hard to wash out residue. One of the reasons for going natural is not having to put harsh chemicals in my hair. Jane uses natural ingredients that won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, weighed-down, hard and crunchy or dull from build-up. Love Jane and her products. (Is it just me or does she resemble Maya Rudolph from SNL/Bridesmaids?!)</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my slightly dry banana/large corkscrew Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> I personally use this product on my 3c/4a virgin hair and IT ABSOLUTELY DOES WORK. And, the smell is a clean herbal/floral scent, not \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; as some reviewers have said. I personally do not like the fruity, sugary scents ie: mango-ey, coconut-ty scents that most hair products marketed towards African-American hairtypes have to them. I believe you have to try the products for yourself, then make YOUR OWN CONCLUSION. A little of the Curl Defining cream goes a long way on very wet hair. Shingle the product in small sections. I use a leave-in conditioner in my hair first, then seal with an oil before applying the product. For 2nd day hair, I spritz with water and maybe I&#x27;ll apply a little more product to the ends of my hair if need be. I do agree that this product may not work for every hair type, but I do have three textures on one scalp myself and it works well for me. The price is also a little steep, but if it works for you, you will love it. It is still less pricey than some other products on the market. Don;t be swayed by the bad reviews, try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Jane Carter is a good product for natural hair I enjoy the look it gives me so far. I have purchased this product on more than one occasion so it works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am a bit of a product junkie. After trying Shea Moisture (2-3 stars), Kinky Curly (2-3 stars), and Mixed Chicks (1 star) I was really excited when I ran into a lady at work with natural hair that looked really defined and similar in texture to mine who told me about Jane Carter Solutions products. I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, curl defining cream, and the condition and sculpt. I was let down - AGAIN! No matter how much or how little of the product I used, I did not have the desired curl-defining results. Fortunately, the store where I purchased the products (NOT Target - they will not let you return opened beauty care products - product junkies beware!) allowed me to return them for a full refund. If you have type 4 hair, don&#x27;t buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the Jane Carter Defining Cream is just as the other users have said.  However, I&#x27;ve been trying to order the right size of the product and seem to keep having problems.  First, if you look at the AMAZON,LLC  order picture, over the course of the last week or so they have changed it!  I ordered the 16oz. Received my product on time,  in a box that was perfect on the outside.  However, when I opened the box all of the Jane Carter products were cracked.  I&#x27;m not talking about a cold weather crack..I&#x27;m talking about a somebody threw this stuff down and cracked it type appearance. The creme was all over the box inside.  And, had I not looked, I would have cut my hand badly. So, I get in touch with Amazon.  The first thing that happens is they send my product out regular mail.  Now that&#x27;s the way I ordered it.  However, it&#x27;s not my fault the product arrived damaged.  When  I realise it&#x27;s going to take forever for it to get here I contact AMAZON again and ok my order is expedited and I&#x27;m issued a credit...GREAT and depending on what e-mail I read...I either keep or return the box when it arrives.  I don&#x27;t care at this point I just need my stuff.  Today, the expedited order arrives.AND IT&#x27;S..WRONG.  I paid for the 16 oz.  They sent me the 6oz and if you look at the picture, it&#x27;s the 16 oz.  I call back today and the only place I can get the 16 oz is not from AMAZON, but someplace I have to pay shipping for!  I tried this before and somehow the product for this price was not available.  Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on, don&#x27;t care....just be warned.  I&#x27;ll see what I get when my order arrives and post.  I don&#x27;t feel I should have to pay for postage.  Yep, I may have gotten something for free, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for that in the first place.</li>
            <li> Creates soft shiny curls that last all day. Leaves the hair soft and managable. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair or make it stiff, hard, or flaky.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the 16oz product in the photo. Considering that the 16oz is at most $34, paying $20 for 6oz is a joke. I&#x27;m sure the seller is well aware that the 6 can be easily mistaken for a 16 because the 16 oz is in the photo.</li>
            <li> I bought this curl definer b/c my hair stylist uses it on my curly, human hair weave. The consistency of the cream is like a conditioner with a mild scent that is not my absolute favourite - in my opinion, this product has a mild, musky scent which (gratefully) fades away as my hair dries.(I don&#x27;t like scents on my hair products, as I prefer them to be non-existent, very minimal, or have a super lovely scent like fredrik fekkai protein RX products, but this is hard to find in the types of products I need to use for my hair type!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works super well after I have washed and conditioned my hair - I squeeze about 1-2 tablespoon into my hand, work it through my strands and ends, then blow dry or sit under a bonnet hair dryer (yes totally old-fashioned). My hair comes out with a great curl that holds for a few days, or til I hit the gym and shower it out. I use this when I keep wearing my curly hair weave, and sometimes achieve the same look with mousse, but the mouse is a little drying and make my weave stiff while the Jane Carter cream keeps it soft, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I will continue to use ! The price is very affordable, I use for my children&#x27;s hair also.</li>
            <li> Great product. It leaves my very curly hair super shinny, lossenes the curlys, and gives it a lot of moisture. I love it and I have gotten tuns of compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp itchy but curls look amazing</li>
            <li> This was rely nice and has my son hair looking moist for a very long time... And it gives the curls... First time I actually bought from one of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; options and it was ligit!!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so moisturized with this.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good product. I choose to apply it on my hair when it&#x27;s wet and untangled!</li>
            <li> Love it! When I was newly natural I tried the products YouTubers bought or made at home with small success. I met a hairstylist who used this on my hair and it&#x27;s lovely. I like it</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I bought his product - and it was not cheap. It did not work for me - my hair felt heavy and dry. I&#x27;m still looking for something though.</li>
            <li> ok as the title says...if i were shipwrecked...this would be one of those products i would try to save off the boat. i&#x27;m not a big fan of putting alot of products in my hair. i believe in keeping it simple and i like my hair soft and touchable. my wash and go&#x27;s with this leave me with little ringlets (4a or 4b whatever you want to call kinky and thick hair) After a wash, i put this on with my Shea Moisture Leave in Conditioner (not too much!!) and my curls are soft and even the next day i just spritz with water and they are soft and in a natural curl. Sometimes i blow dry and sometimes i airdry, but i have thick hair so airdrying takes forever. This will not give you long flowing ringlets if you have 4a 4b kinky hair! but it will DEFINE your beautiful tight curls. GREAT for a curly fro. I tend to not use my comb often, just my hands, to work the curls and they last at least two or three days! I live in europe, but i&#x27;m american and i always have this with me. I get compliments all the time. I even used this on my hair after just spritzing it with water and it keeps every thing soft and not GREASY. So just to recap. i try to keep things simple. Noursh and shine for my twists and braids and twist outs etc. and this Curl Defining cream when i want the piecy fro. my hair also loves natural raw shea butter. i love Jane Carter, i love that the products are natural and not extra profumy...oh and THEY WORK!</li>
            <li> No strong smells. Loved it. Must apply to really wet hair for best results. Has no residue and it adds shine to hair. Hair is soft after it dries, no crunching.</li>
            <li> This puts beautiful waves in your hair.  No too oily.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent. If you are sensitive to strong smells, do not buy.</li>
            <li> i seriously eat, sleep, breathe this product. i have been natural for almost 2 years, i have a mixed batch of coarse, frizzy, thick curls (3c on the bottom and sides, 4a on top, and some 4b in parts) that are about 4-5 inches long (collar bone length when straight). this product makes my curls pattern look consistent throughout my head and i always get compliments about how my hair looks \\&quot;extra curly\\&quot; on days that i use the cream during wash outs. i do not use the shampoo or conditioner (i prefer paul mitchell auwapuhi line), but i apply Wen as a leave in (2-3 pumps) all over my head and then spritz some of the Jane Carter leave-in all over as well. from there, i part my hair into 4 large sections and starting from the back of my head, i divide each section into groups of 3. i detangle each subsection of 3 with a denman brush and apply a little less than a dime size to each. I do not comb it through, but rather cover each section from root to tip (to tame the frizz)and smooth it out with my finger tips, focusing on stretching the curls. i can immediately see a difference in how the curls spring into place. when complete, i usually blow dry all over for 90 seconds (i like big hair) and let it air dry out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for everyone saying that the product did nothing for their hair, i recommend only using it on soaking wet hair (i keep a spray bottle on hand while working through my head) and taking your time with each section. at first it is time consuming, but with a few weeks you can get it down to a 20 minute process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have also used a hooded dryer after applying the product and did notice that you get more shine, but similar effects can be had from air drying or a quick black with the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me know if you have any questions!</li>
            <li> Since I went natural last year after a nine month transition (now 23 months post relaxer) I have become a product junkie.  I have 4b, 4c, coarse hair.  I have tried several stylers and I will say that this one is one of the few that I would repurchase.  This really helps to detangle my hair and I have tried multiple detanglers that did nothing.  I had left my hair in a donut bun for two weeks and when I removed the donut bun my hair was a matted, tangled mess.  I tried all the detanglers in my cabinet and nothing worked. I had just bought this but did not think it would detangle...OMG. This saved my hair (plus finger detangling.  Since it worked so well in that emergency, I have been using it to twist my hair. I love the scent, smells fresh and citrusy.  It gives me a defined twist out....BUT....if I separate too much my hair becomes frizzy.  However, I still gave this product 5 stars because it detangled my hair so well and when it comes to my natural hair detangling products are number one.  Also to add, when I retwist my hair, I have a lot less breakage than with other products.  I either wet my hair first with water or JC revitalizing leave in to twist my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overseas, and my hair was damaged due to the water.  So I had my barber cut my hair short, and I grab this product from the shelf at my local CVS while on leave to my surprise that they even sold this product as in the past you could only purchase through your local general nutrition store, or hair dresser.  I love this product!!!! I used JC&#x27;s other products, and had great results, but this cream I&#x27;m totally sold on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product one month ago and decided to try it last night.  After washing and conditioning my hair, I applied it on very wet hair and sealed it with carrot oil.  Minutes after, I could see the difference in the hair pattern.  I twisted my hair and unraveled the twist in the morning.  Wonderful. My twist out has never been so defined before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because the smell is not excessive, it delivers what is promises: curls defined (never promised to elongate curls). Contrary to Kinky curly curling custard, it leaves no flake in your hair and does not feel muddy. Plus, it makes your hair shine.  So far, so good. 5 stars for JCS curl defining cream</li>
            <li> Product is as described. I have 4a hair this stuff is great for restoring moisture.</li>
            <li> The best styling product for my hair has only been Kinky Kurly Curling Custard, but due to its high cost, I wanted to try an alternative natural product in the Curl Defining Cream. I even read the product reviews on YouTube and thought this should work on my hair. I was dead wrong. It was the product reviews that also convinced me to give it a second try. That was foolish. The product left my hair undefined and very dry after one day. This despite the fact I used only Jane Carter products with this Defining Cream. My hair hates this product so there is no way I could recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used for my coarse hair and it does not feel greasy  and a little bit of this product goes a long way.It usually last me for abut 2 months and that includes using it on my 8 year old who has very thick (if she wore a bra) bra strap lengh wavy hair .</li>
            <li> I have finally, after 5 years and two big chops of my natural hair, come to appreciate it.  I was always looking to have it stretched, wavy or loosely curled.  My hair will not do that and I&#x27;m fine with it.  I have about 2.5 to three inches of \\&quot;stretched\\&quot; hair ... but in its natural condition, it looks like half an inch.  And I like that.  The Curl Defining Cream does not loosen my hair or alter its texture but it does keep it moisturized.  I have coily, tightly wound hair ... and I think it is the best thing since sliced, whole grain bread!  So ... for those who commented that the product is awful ... I only wonder if these individuals like their naturally textured hair and are not seeking to achieve a very altered hairstyle.  I do not have hair like Jane Carter (as photographed on her products)  ... but the Jane Carter product works well for my hair.</li>
