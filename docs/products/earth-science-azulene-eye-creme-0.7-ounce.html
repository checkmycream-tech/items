    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use this in the morning and night and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>It feels great upon application and does a great job hydrating the area around your eyes.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>This cream is quite good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth: Good value.</li>
            <li>product also says it is good for combating redness of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Outstanding eye cream!  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to wear make-up for over 3 months now.</li>
            <li>no irritations...wanted more ..looked it up on amazon</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I am just sure to use a bit of powder under my eye after putting it on along with corrector</li>
            <li>Make you sure you want the Cream before you buy.</li>
            <li>Great cream at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>Since most people guess my age a decade or more youthful than my biological age, I&#x27;ll continue to use. :)</li>
            <li>Love the nice clean scent and helps my under eyes.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have used for dark circles.</li>
            <li>I had used this cream for a year and my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li>I hope this is genuine.</li>
            <li>I am not quite certain that there is a cream that cures all lines around the eyes, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Excellent all natural facial product.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes became bright red, swollen and cracked--blood formed in the cracks around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used the eye cream three days ago and within minutes they turned bright red and started to swell.  </li>
            <li>This product is not bad.</li>
            <li>but it goes quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>So unlike a lot of other eye creams, I didn&#x27;t think my eyes looked better and better with repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the one I used (Thicker blue content; didn&#x27;t felt any oily; yet left more moisture in skin)</li>
            <li>but really good for the dark circles.</li>
            <li>I use it paired with another eyecream and apply this one first.</li>
            <li>It does however sink in pretty fast.</li>
            <li>this product still gets 3 stars simply because it is a decent (if fairly oily) facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I had used this eye cream for 3 years with much satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I feel like this helps my other cream absorb better and helps to reduce my under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it in the mornings under my makeup.</li>
            <li>I went to many doctors and I stopped using it for a while, then I started to us it only under my eyes and the problem presented only in the area where I used the product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But something a little bit lighter would probably be better.</li>
            <li>but I know from experience they won&#x27;t be normal anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Purchased a new jar around Thanksgiving and went on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I love so many Earth Science products--this is REALLY disappointing.</li>
            <li>My eyes itched the first day and continued to swell and get red</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this eye cream for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li>I assumed I had developed allergies to pollen as this was peak pollen season.</li>
            <li>and they went back to normal.</li>
            <li>At 10$ the jar arrives full and I only need a tiny tiny amount, so it should last quite awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is different (thin blue content; more creamy like mixed regular more lotion/cream; yet dry).</li>
            <li>After using Azulene Eye Treatment for about a month, I developed a red, swollen eyelid -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second: it does work to diminish my dark circles, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist says I have a long way to go before my eyes are back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It works fairly well in winter when the air is dry and cold.</li>

            <li> Prior to that I used and eye cream from a mainstream drugstore brand, and this works better with far less scary ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Even the blue color doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just looking for a product which will considerably improve my dark circle.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have to be careful not to get it too</li>

            <li> The swelling is gone down</li>
            <li> I saw a little improvement on my dark circle and puffiness, and it seems moisturizing.</li>
            <li> A little bit too thick</li>

            <li> I used Azulene for 2 years and suddenly I started to develop an awful allergy.</li>
            <li> Wrong item in photo!  </li>

            <li> This cream is quite good.  I am not quite certain that there is a cream that cures all lines around the eyes, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I had used this eye cream for 3 years with much satisfaction. Then this summer my local store was out and I bought some on Amazon. The skin around my eyes became bright red, swollen and cracked--blood formed in the cracks around my eyes. During the worst of it, it looked like I had been hit in both eyes. I work in a school and everybody was asking me what had happened. Initially my dermatologist and I did not know what I was reacting too, but after 3 months of healing I applied the eye cream (still not knowing what the culprit was) and within 5 hours my eyes were swollen and red again. I have not been able to wear make-up for over 3 months now. My dermatologist says I have a long way to go before my eyes are back to normal.  I wonder if they changed the formula or if somebody tampered with it...just unbelievable what happened to my eyes. I love so many Earth Science products--this is REALLY disappointing.</li>
            <li> my sister had bought this cream years ago for me...i used it religiously...no irritations...wanted more ..looked it up on amazon and yeah there it was...thank you amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked the one I used (Thicker blue content; didn&#x27;t felt any oily; yet left more moisture in skin) but this is different (thin blue content; more creamy like mixed regular more lotion/cream; yet dry). I hope this is genuine.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used for dark circles. It helps the bags and the wrinkles but really good for the dark circles. I was concerned about the blue but it doesnt show blue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on February 25 and as of now, I like how the cream feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ive used this eye cream for 2+ months and it does work some but there are pluses and minuses for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: its blue and goes on blue.  It does however sink in pretty fast. I have deep skin tone but in a lighter skinned person, I think it may take a minute to fully sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: it does work to diminish my dark circles, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. I use it morning and night and by the time between my applications, I can tell it&#x27;s stopped working. So unlike a lot of other eye creams, I didn&#x27;t think my eyes looked better and better with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: it&#x27;s thick but it still seeps into my eyes and it irritates them a bit. I have to be careful not to get it too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth: Good value. At 10$ the jar arrives full and I only need a tiny tiny amount, so it should last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll finish the jar but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase as I&#x27;m looking for a product with a cumulative effect.</li>
            <li> I used this product all summer, no problem.  Purchased a new jar around Thanksgiving and went on vacation.  My eyes itched the first day and continued to swell and get red, I thought I was allergic to something in the hotel or my environment.  I had to ice my eyes every morning and wear sunglasses indoors because I looked like I had been punched in both eyes, they peeled and itched.  I had an opthamologist appt. when I returned home and he recommended I try some aquaphor which I used for a couple of weeks and they improved after the burned skin all peeled off.  I used the eye cream three days ago and within minutes they turned bright red and started to swell.  It was like bee stings and I could feel the skin stretching and swelling. I took benadryl and have had to ice them every couple of hours.  The swelling is gone down but I know from experience they won&#x27;t be normal anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Please pay attention to the reviews that state this caused an allergic reaction. I had used this cream for a year and my eyes were fine. Suddenly I started noticing my eyes were slightly puffy in the morning. I assumed I had developed allergies to pollen as this was peak pollen season. One day my eyes just started swelling during the day- and practically swelled shut. When someone develops allergies it can take some time to find out what it is. I went to the hospital because this was happening at least once a week. Big puffy eyes- cracking and peeling for days after- it was all I could do not to scratch my eyes out of my head. Finally stopped using anything on my face for months and they went back to normal. Then one night I found the eye cream again, and put it on. BOOM. In the morning my eyes are swollen shut again. There is something in this cream that people have been found to develop an allergy to. I don&#x27;t know what it is because they don&#x27;t list the ingredients on the label. NO ONE HAS GOTTEN BACK TO ME FROM THE COMPANY. DO NOT BUY THIS- there are plenty of other creams out there that have not produced this reaction.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for puffiness and dark circles.  It is greasy &amp; burns.  I like to have pros and cons for products but i have no pros for this one. When I find something that works I will include it in this review.</li>
            <li> Outstanding eye cream!  You might expect a product like this to cost $25 and up for this eye cream. It feels great upon application and does a great job hydrating the area around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and night and have been very happy with it. I use it paired with another eyecream and apply this one first. It has a cooling sensation and a little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t be scared by the blue color because that does not show up on your skin. I feel like this helps my other cream absorb better and helps to reduce my under eye puffiness. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is not bad. I saw a little improvement on my dark circle and puffiness, and it seems moisturizing. But I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t tell if it you help or not. I&#x27;m just looking for a product which will considerably improve my dark circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the texture, it&#x27;s okay. A little bit too thick but it goes quickly into your skin. Even the blue color doesn&#x27;t last long at all. But something a little bit lighter would probably be better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream now for at least 5 years and I highly recommend it. It really helps reduce the bags under my eyes. I mainly use it in the mornings under my makeup. I am just sure to use a bit of powder under my eye after putting it on along with corrector so my eye makeup stays on.</li>
            <li> Excellent all natural facial product.  Delievered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> The item in the photo is the \\&quot;Eye Treatment\\&quot; (which is what I actually wanted), but ended up with the \\&quot;Eye Cream.\\&quot; They are two different products. Make you sure you want the Cream before you buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this eye cream for the past couple of years.  Prior to that I used and eye cream from a mainstream drugstore brand, and this works better with far less scary ingredients.  I will continue to purchase.  The color goes on blue, but absorbs in a matter of a minute or two.  You don&#x27;t need much either, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great cream at a reasonable price.  Been using it for years.  Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I got this in an attempt to decrease some dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This did nothing for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also says it is good for combating redness of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This did nothing for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product still gets 3 stars simply because it is a decent (if fairly oily) facial moisturizer. It works fairly well in winter when the air is dry and cold.</li>
            <li> I only wear it at night because of the thickness and the color. I just slather this on and in the morning the blue seems to be gone, I don&#x27;t think I rub it off in the night but perhaps it sinks in. Anyways, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wrong item in photo!  This eye cream is NOT/NOT eye treatment!</li>
            <li> Works as described. Love the nice clean scent and helps my under eyes. It is yumminess...It arrived as promised. Would order again. ++++ Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used Azulene for 2 years and suddenly I started to develop an awful allergy. One morning, when I woke up, I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes. I never imagine that the problem was this cream. I went to many doctors and I stopped using it for a while, then I started to us it only under my eyes and the problem presented only in the area where I used the product. I don&#x27;t know if the product was contaminated or I started to develop the allergy. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> After using Azulene Eye Treatment for about a month, I developed a red, swollen eyelid - I stopped using this product, but since it was only on the one eye, I decided to try again in case my swollen eye was due to something else. Following a 2 month break from the eye cream, I tried it again and within 5 hours both my eyelids were red and puffed up. Bummer!</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years. Since most people guess my age a decade or more youthful than my biological age, I&#x27;ll continue to use. :)</li>
