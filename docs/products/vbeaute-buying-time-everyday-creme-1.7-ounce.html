    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;To judge a product fairly, it&#x27;s best to use it as part of a system, and</li>
            <li>and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>I then added this cream, as a moisturizer, to my routine and my skin looks almost flawless.</li>
            <li>And it isn&#x27;t that I have an especially acute sense of smell that nobody else has.</li>
            <li>the formulation perfect?  </li>
            <li>Another thing I like about this product is the beautiful triangular purple jar it comes in being that purple</li>
            <li>And the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li>cream is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The product does a great job of moisturizing without the greasiness...</li>
            <li>Its a very nice luxurious feel.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not all that pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a purple, triangular shaped container with a mirror bright top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I replaced Dr. P&#x27;s stinky fishy smelling cream that comes in a tube with this product, and I&#x27;m delighted with the difference.  </li>
            <li>- you need to wait a good five minutes for it to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is good at \\&quot;preventing premature aging\\&quot;</li>
            <li>There are a lot of good things in this creme.</li>
            <li>The fact that there is no fragrance is good and that they state they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li>because I got it for free, let me just say that I&#x27;ve been using, and am perfectly happy with Dr. Perricone&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with this cream and interested in buying the serum that is to be used after washing the face and neck and before application of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ounce of prevention and pampering come in this beautiful jar</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel to it, not greasy, and glides on well.  </li>
            <li>If you like to keep your bottles and jars out, it will make a nice decorative feature in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>liked this cream a lot and would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for one thing: this creme has a chemical odor that is quite perceptible.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>She feels that it is light and has a pleasant texture.</li>
            <li>However, I really like that consistency for its incredible moisturizing affects.</li>
            <li>My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The bonus is the vibrant purple jar with a silver V shaped top, so nicely done that it would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>The pamphlet inside (to sum it up) says this product (which includes Alpine Rose Botanical Technology ARBT, and BioCellular Peptide BCP) \\&quot;helps to promote firmness and elasticity while visibly diminishing the appearance of fine lines and</li>
            <li>Love the weight &amp; feel of the cream</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as though I have stumbled upon the perfect moment yet, though I have slathered it on at various points throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top of the cream can be used as a mirror.</li>
            <li>I love trying out face creams</li>
            <li>is a favorite color of mine.  </li>
            <li>The jar itself appears as though you are getting more than the 1.7 ounces that your truly get.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this cream for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li>She always applies it before bedtime and many times before going to to work in the morning.</li>
            <li>She finds that it is cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>So it means you&#x27;ll have to spend more to get the desirable results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan and will continue to use it for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>My skin is softer and my complexion is looking better.  </li>
            <li>and I like it ok -</li>
            <li>most products burn my skin or cause it to break out.  </li>
            <li>Most people may think that this product was directed to women, but it didn&#x27;t appear that it wouldn&#x27;t work for a man too, so I decided to give it a try when I saw it on the Amazon Vine List.</li>
            <li>Once a day was about the most I could manage.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure that I didn&#x27;t put it on every day, since I skip shaving on weekends at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have experienced no negative results from the cream, I will continue to use it, and if anything changes, I&#x27;ll amend what would otherwise be a one-star review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always up for trying new skin care products, so was happy to have a chance to give the vbeaut&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li>/&gt;To elaborate, &#x27;Buying Time&#x27; is of a mid-higher end in its texture, and easily absorbs either over or under existing makeup.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the consistency and how smoothly it applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make my skin smooth, but it is not so much better than Oil of Olay that I would pay the difference.  </li>
            <li>And while it&#x27;s a nice moisturizing cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not that &#x27;Buying Time&#x27; isn&#x27;t a good product; it&#x27;s biggest enemy is the outrageously high price point.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to rid yourself of fine lines and wrinkles, then this product alone does not appear to do the job.</li>
            <li>&quot; This being said, if I were to judge the product on \\&quot;diminishing fine lines and</li>
            <li>She claims that the cream smooths out fine lines on her face.</li>
            <li>but once you start to smooth it in it spreads and will easily cover all of your face.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth, and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I don&#x27;t know much about fancy creams, but I can say that I love this one!</li>
            <li>The cr&amp;egrave;me states that it is paraben free, fragrance free (although I do smell a light scent), dermatologist tested and NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fast and effective beauty regime that produces maximum results with a minimum of amount of time.  </li>
            <li>like the fact that this cream is paraben free, fragrance free, dermatologist tested, and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>The product has a light scent, nothing overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great products though quite pricy.</li>
            <li>It claims to be fragrance free, but there&#x27;s a hint of odor to it</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the product for a month and a half, if you are looking for an excellent moisturizer and cost is not an issue, this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the price tag that makes it feel amazing, but it is very nice.</li>
            <li>First, even though it moisturized my face well, I did not find it any better than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, feels cool to the skin, and absorbs without an oily residue.</li>
            <li>so it lasts - worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>While it seems to be a good product, I am not convinced yet that there isn&#x27;t one out there that is just as nice and a little friendlier to my wallet.</li>
            <li>This is why I only used it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue (that I hope will soon be fixed), this is a very impressive product.</li>
            <li>so special.  </li>
            <li>I just didin&#x27;t find anything overwelming special from this creme that would make me want to go out and buy it for the price listed.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bright white cream.</li>
            <li>we opened the package, I have to say the container was quite cool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing, and VERY moisturizing.</li>
            <li>A good face cream needs to be applied only once after washing the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I tried some on myself, it goes on cool and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>the morning you will note a lovely soft feel to your skin and diminished fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced this odd smell before with unscented creams, and I suspect it is a somewhat chemical smell from whatever was used to neutralize the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As an herbalist I recognize a good many botanicals that would be helpful to one&#x27;s skin: grape seed oil, calendula and helianthus, to name a few.</li>
            <li>and I also had a few too many pimples (at my age I shouldn&#x27;t have many at all), but that&#x27;s cleared up after a couple more days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does come in a very pretty purple bottle.  </li>
            <li>Its unusual shape makes it easy to locate if you&#x27;re looking for it with your hands instead of your eyes, for example, if you put on cream while you drive.</li>
            <li>I had to put on the readers as well as holding the box under a bright light to manage reading it at all, but since I don&#x27;t understand half of what the ingredients are, why I bothered...</li>
            <li>vBeaute Buying Time Everyday Creme is a pleasant, light weight moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is too much to hope to see a difference in six weeks, but after using it, I can see no difference in the fine lines on my wife&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It melts right in and my face feels very smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>First, it costs quite a bit of money, much more than I would normally spend on face creme.</li>
            <li>The concept of using rare botanicals in a skincare formula is not novel.  </li>
            <li>As the manufacture mentioned, it only work best when used with other products.</li>
            <li>(just something I noticed right away).  </li>
            <li>It claims to make you wake up even more beautiful than you were when you went to bed which, of course, is an absurd statement.  </li>
            <li>The texture is perfect - smooth, not too thick but definitely has weight to it.</li>
            <li>I did not see any diminishing of any fine lines and although my face feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>It lacks the distinct and positive &#x27;glow&#x27; of the arguably better Philosophy product, one where contributions to skin quality are obvious.</li>
            <li>I look for a velvety feel that leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth - not greasy.  </li>
            <li>And my skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My face and neck became smooth, soft and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first impression was grateful for the fact that there is no scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to apply it to my entire face (including eyelids) and it did not bother my eyes like some creams do.</li>
            <li>The cream seemed to be excellent in one aspect and failed in another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have extra money and wanna give it a try, that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The smell fades, but it is definitely not scented to be appealing.  </li>
            <li>far all I can say is that, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed such a huge improvement that I would spend $100 more on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I have more to report later, I&#x27;ll update this.</li>
            <li>This program does NOT compensate nor reward for positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works pretty fast, too.</li>
            <li>This cream is light enough to be used during the day and offers significant benefits.</li>
            <li>Buying Time Everyday Creme by vbeaute comes in a beautiful purple glass jar with silver colored lid that instantly makes you feel like it will indeed hold the secrets which would help erase wrinkles, moisturize aging skin and even out skin tones.</li>
            <li>But if using something will cut down on the prospect of my aging, I&#x27;d just as soon lightly scrub my face with a little salt, lavender and camoumile, wash it with rose water and sleep with a light coating of coconut oil or aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I am 35 and have recently noticed fine lines around my eyes and reddening cheeks.</li>
            <li>My wife gave the product very high marks in this aspect.  </li>
            <li>I just received this cream &amp; tried it on the back of hand (I know, not an accurate trial)</li>
            <li>On the bright side, it&#x27;s made in Switzerland (at least it&#x27;s not from China).</li>
            <li>but I found the smell of this cream very off putting.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell really</li>
            <li>, I could not hit the button fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin,</li>
            <li>It really leaves skin velvety smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to me...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like smelling like a chemical factory for almost an hour after applying the product.</li>
            <li>for me, I really do want to age.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d feel much safer with this group than what I found in the creme.s group than what I found in the creme.</li>
            <li>, does it work really well as is claimed by the maker?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me goes on smooth and a bit sticky / greasy at first, but quickly penetrates skin to add a noticeable level of hydration.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The creme itself is white and has a slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>You have to use lasers, derma rollers, or other more invasive tactics to trigger collagen.  </li>
            <li>I used the creme daily first thing in the morning and right before bedtime for three straight weeks.</li>
            <li>is unnecessary and is easily replaced by safe substitutes.</li>
            <li>As it is, this seems to work as well as the much lower priced products I normally use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this product to do anything more than your average drug store product.</li>
            <li>but after it absorbed for a few minutes, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>I experienced a slight burn when I applied the cream for the first time, but this also faded after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give one more negative example, dimethicone, which is a man-made polymer \\&quot;popularly used in industrial lubricants\\&quot; and can cause allergic reactions such as \\&quot;hives, sudden respiratory problems and swelling in the mouth or face,\\&quot; according to research done on wisegeek.com website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But having neither of these and not being able to afford to purchase either product perhaps I had expected too much for using only 1/3 of the prescribed process.</li>
            <li>The second star is for hope, which is always worth something.</li>
            <li>Not ten years worth, but nothing&#x27;s going to do that.  </li>
            <li>I did not find my face to be any more firm, just softer.</li>
            <li>It is in a triangular shaped bottle, which makes getting the top off easier than for round bottles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed by the skin quickly and the effects do last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire vbeaute product line produces extraordinary results on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A cream should either have a pleasant smell or, ideally, no smell at all.</li>
            <li>However, that is easy to look past considering many packages look larger than what is actually inside</li>
            <li>I put about a bean sized lump on the back of my hand &amp; my hand still feels smooth hours later -</li>
            <li>Second, the description says light creme, I found this just the opposite</li>
            <li>The basis of this moisturizing cream is a botanical and multi-vitamin complex consisting of alpine rose botanical technology and bio cellular peptides along with \\&quot;ceramides 2 and 3.\\&quot; The ceramides are naturally occurring skin lipid molecules that assist with  water-retention capacity and cell regulation.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now, and the first two my cheeks were a bit reddish</li>
            <li>At first it may not seem like enough</li>
            <li>I was in fact using another creme prior to receiving this sample of \\&quot;Buying Time\\&quot; that was working much better for me and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li>really liked that the product doesn&#x27;t have any parabens and is not tested on animals, but frankly, I didn&#x27;t find the quality any better than much less expensive products.  </li>
            <li>product itself is a pure white in the container and has an opaque look when you dab some on your finger.  </li>
            <li>Empirical data:  </li>
            <li>With this cream, my skin still feels soft even after washing.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t looking for a moisturizer, and yet, it was the moisturing part that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>The cream offers 24 hour  and you do feel and see results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and absorbs fast enough where I could snap my fingers on the hand I used to apply it within 15 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me by Vbeaute is a fabulous skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked as a cosmetologist for over 35 years, I handle products all day, and I&#x27;m really sensitive to fragrance and the chemicals that touch my skin.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I know the natural aging signs are going to start showing up soon.  </li>
            <li>Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce]] which is one favorite of mine but is not as thick.  </li>
            <li>Since I did not have the other products, I could only guess where this should fit into my arsenal.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and because I have never smoked, I do not drink alcohol but on very rare occasions, and I do not go outdoors for prolonged sun exposure without sunscreen, I have not done a lot of past damage to my skin.  </li>
            <li>price of $135 for 1.7 ounces is a lot of money, unless the stuff lasts a long time and works really well.</li>
            <li>First, there is not much cream in this crème package.  </li>
            <li>I suspect the intent is to psychologically impact the consumer by providing a tiny amount of product for a relatively large price.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement one way or the other as far as younger looking skin, but I&#x27;ll report back if I see anything significant after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>I use a tiny dot and it&#x27;s enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li>The cream is on the thick-ish side, although I didn&#x27;t find it greasy feeling, and went on smoothly, but it is heavy enough that you can&#x27;t put makeup immediately over it</li>
            <li>It is  a thick cream, which applies easily.</li>
            <li>jar itself is a dark purple with an odd triangle shape (being artsy and stylish</li>
            <li>I could see this cream going very quickly because the container is small!</li>
            <li>The container is typical of high end cr&amp;egrave;mes; the jar is huge and fancy but there is little product inside.  </li>
            <li>My combo skin has been extra oily near my cheeks</li>
            <li>However, the cream has left my wife&#x27;s face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer barely has a fragrance, and it never changed on my skin</li>
            <li>and less dramatic disclaimer is that while my skin can always use a nice glow, this was reviewed by the much fairer of the Stuart sexes.</li>
            <li>This cream has the consistency of good old Pond&#x27;s cold cream and it&#x27;s totally unscented.  </li>
            <li>I am very particular about the lotion I use on my face due to sweating and not mixing well with makeup.  </li>
            <li>It opened easily enough, and I was happy to find it unscented since heavily perfumed products make me ill.</li>
            <li>The directions do say that the user is to first use vbeaute&#x27;s cleanser and then serum before using the Buying Time Everyday Creme.</li>
            <li>No bad, but not amazing.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a bad cream by any means, but IMHO it isn&#x27;t a great one either, particularly not at the listed price.</li>

            <li> /&gt;To judge a product fairly, it&#x27;s best to use it as part of a system, and</li>
            <li> and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> I then added this cream, as a moisturizer, to my routine and my skin looks almost flawless.</li>
            <li> And it isn&#x27;t that I have an especially acute sense of smell that nobody else has.</li>
            <li> the formulation perfect?  </li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this product is the beautiful triangular purple jar it comes in being that purple</li>
            <li> And the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> cream is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The product does a great job of moisturizing without the greasiness...</li>
            <li> Its a very nice luxurious feel.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not all that pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a purple, triangular shaped container with a mirror bright top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced Dr. P&#x27;s stinky fishy smelling cream that comes in a tube with this product, and I&#x27;m delighted with the difference.  </li>
            <li> - you need to wait a good five minutes for it to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is good at \\&quot;preventing premature aging\\&quot;</li>
            <li> There are a lot of good things in this creme.</li>
            <li> The fact that there is no fragrance is good and that they state they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> because I got it for free, let me just say that I&#x27;ve been using, and am perfectly happy with Dr. Perricone&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with this cream and interested in buying the serum that is to be used after washing the face and neck and before application of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ounce of prevention and pampering come in this beautiful jar</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel to it, not greasy, and glides on well.  </li>
            <li> If you like to keep your bottles and jars out, it will make a nice decorative feature in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> liked this cream a lot and would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for one thing: this creme has a chemical odor that is quite perceptible.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> She feels that it is light and has a pleasant texture.</li>
            <li> However, I really like that consistency for its incredible moisturizing affects.</li>
            <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The bonus is the vibrant purple jar with a silver V shaped top, so nicely done that it would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> The pamphlet inside (to sum it up) says this product (which includes Alpine Rose Botanical Technology ARBT, and BioCellular Peptide BCP) \\&quot;helps to promote firmness and elasticity while visibly diminishing the appearance of fine lines and</li>
            <li> Love the weight &amp; feel of the cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as though I have stumbled upon the perfect moment yet, though I have slathered it on at various points throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top of the cream can be used as a mirror.</li>
            <li> I love trying out face creams</li>
            <li> is a favorite color of mine.  </li>
            <li> The jar itself appears as though you are getting more than the 1.7 ounces that your truly get.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this cream for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li> She always applies it before bedtime and many times before going to to work in the morning.</li>
            <li> She finds that it is cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> So it means you&#x27;ll have to spend more to get the desirable results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan and will continue to use it for many years to come.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and my complexion is looking better.  </li>
            <li> and I like it ok -</li>
            <li> most products burn my skin or cause it to break out.  </li>
            <li> Most people may think that this product was directed to women, but it didn&#x27;t appear that it wouldn&#x27;t work for a man too, so I decided to give it a try when I saw it on the Amazon Vine List.</li>
            <li> Once a day was about the most I could manage.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure that I didn&#x27;t put it on every day, since I skip shaving on weekends at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have experienced no negative results from the cream, I will continue to use it, and if anything changes, I&#x27;ll amend what would otherwise be a one-star review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying new skin care products, so was happy to have a chance to give the vbeaut&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li> /&gt;To elaborate, &#x27;Buying Time&#x27; is of a mid-higher end in its texture, and easily absorbs either over or under existing makeup.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the consistency and how smoothly it applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does make my skin smooth, but it is not so much better than Oil of Olay that I would pay the difference.  </li>
            <li> And while it&#x27;s a nice moisturizing cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to massage into the skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not that &#x27;Buying Time&#x27; isn&#x27;t a good product; it&#x27;s biggest enemy is the outrageously high price point.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to rid yourself of fine lines and wrinkles, then this product alone does not appear to do the job.</li>
            <li> &quot; This being said, if I were to judge the product on \\&quot;diminishing fine lines and</li>
            <li> She claims that the cream smooths out fine lines on her face.</li>
            <li> but once you start to smooth it in it spreads and will easily cover all of your face.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth, and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know much about fancy creams, but I can say that I love this one!</li>
            <li> The cr&amp;egrave;me states that it is paraben free, fragrance free (although I do smell a light scent), dermatologist tested and NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fast and effective beauty regime that produces maximum results with a minimum of amount of time.  </li>
            <li> like the fact that this cream is paraben free, fragrance free, dermatologist tested, and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> The product has a light scent, nothing overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great products though quite pricy.</li>
            <li> It claims to be fragrance free, but there&#x27;s a hint of odor to it</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product for a month and a half, if you are looking for an excellent moisturizer and cost is not an issue, this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the price tag that makes it feel amazing, but it is very nice.</li>
            <li> First, even though it moisturized my face well, I did not find it any better than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly, feels cool to the skin, and absorbs without an oily residue.</li>
            <li> so it lasts - worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> While it seems to be a good product, I am not convinced yet that there isn&#x27;t one out there that is just as nice and a little friendlier to my wallet.</li>
            <li> This is why I only used it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue (that I hope will soon be fixed), this is a very impressive product.</li>
            <li> so special.  </li>
            <li> I just didin&#x27;t find anything overwelming special from this creme that would make me want to go out and buy it for the price listed.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bright white cream.</li>
            <li> we opened the package, I have to say the container was quite cool.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing, and VERY moisturizing.</li>
            <li> A good face cream needs to be applied only once after washing the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tried some on myself, it goes on cool and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> the morning you will note a lovely soft feel to your skin and diminished fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced this odd smell before with unscented creams, and I suspect it is a somewhat chemical smell from whatever was used to neutralize the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an herbalist I recognize a good many botanicals that would be helpful to one&#x27;s skin: grape seed oil, calendula and helianthus, to name a few.</li>
            <li> and I also had a few too many pimples (at my age I shouldn&#x27;t have many at all), but that&#x27;s cleared up after a couple more days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come in a very pretty purple bottle.  </li>
            <li> Its unusual shape makes it easy to locate if you&#x27;re looking for it with your hands instead of your eyes, for example, if you put on cream while you drive.</li>
            <li> I had to put on the readers as well as holding the box under a bright light to manage reading it at all, but since I don&#x27;t understand half of what the ingredients are, why I bothered...</li>
            <li> vBeaute Buying Time Everyday Creme is a pleasant, light weight moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is too much to hope to see a difference in six weeks, but after using it, I can see no difference in the fine lines on my wife&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It melts right in and my face feels very smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> First, it costs quite a bit of money, much more than I would normally spend on face creme.</li>
            <li> The concept of using rare botanicals in a skincare formula is not novel.  </li>
            <li> As the manufacture mentioned, it only work best when used with other products.</li>
            <li> (just something I noticed right away).  </li>
            <li> It claims to make you wake up even more beautiful than you were when you went to bed which, of course, is an absurd statement.  </li>
            <li> The texture is perfect - smooth, not too thick but definitely has weight to it.</li>
            <li> I did not see any diminishing of any fine lines and although my face feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> It lacks the distinct and positive &#x27;glow&#x27; of the arguably better Philosophy product, one where contributions to skin quality are obvious.</li>
            <li> I look for a velvety feel that leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth - not greasy.  </li>
            <li> And my skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My face and neck became smooth, soft and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first impression was grateful for the fact that there is no scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to apply it to my entire face (including eyelids) and it did not bother my eyes like some creams do.</li>
            <li> The cream seemed to be excellent in one aspect and failed in another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you have extra money and wanna give it a try, that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The smell fades, but it is definitely not scented to be appealing.  </li>
            <li> far all I can say is that, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed such a huge improvement that I would spend $100 more on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I have more to report later, I&#x27;ll update this.</li>
            <li> This program does NOT compensate nor reward for positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works pretty fast, too.</li>
            <li> This cream is light enough to be used during the day and offers significant benefits.</li>
            <li> Buying Time Everyday Creme by vbeaute comes in a beautiful purple glass jar with silver colored lid that instantly makes you feel like it will indeed hold the secrets which would help erase wrinkles, moisturize aging skin and even out skin tones.</li>
            <li> But if using something will cut down on the prospect of my aging, I&#x27;d just as soon lightly scrub my face with a little salt, lavender and camoumile, wash it with rose water and sleep with a light coating of coconut oil or aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have recently noticed fine lines around my eyes and reddening cheeks.</li>
            <li> My wife gave the product very high marks in this aspect.  </li>
            <li> I just received this cream &amp; tried it on the back of hand (I know, not an accurate trial)</li>
            <li> On the bright side, it&#x27;s made in Switzerland (at least it&#x27;s not from China).</li>
            <li> but I found the smell of this cream very off putting.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell really</li>
            <li> , I could not hit the button fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin,</li>
            <li> It really leaves skin velvety smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to me...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like smelling like a chemical factory for almost an hour after applying the product.</li>
            <li> for me, I really do want to age.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d feel much safer with this group than what I found in the creme.s group than what I found in the creme.</li>
            <li> , does it work really well as is claimed by the maker?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me goes on smooth and a bit sticky / greasy at first, but quickly penetrates skin to add a noticeable level of hydration.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The creme itself is white and has a slight, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> You have to use lasers, derma rollers, or other more invasive tactics to trigger collagen.  </li>
            <li> I used the creme daily first thing in the morning and right before bedtime for three straight weeks.</li>
            <li> is unnecessary and is easily replaced by safe substitutes.</li>
            <li> As it is, this seems to work as well as the much lower priced products I normally use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to do anything more than your average drug store product.</li>
            <li> but after it absorbed for a few minutes, it was fine.  </li>
            <li> I experienced a slight burn when I applied the cream for the first time, but this also faded after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give one more negative example, dimethicone, which is a man-made polymer \\&quot;popularly used in industrial lubricants\\&quot; and can cause allergic reactions such as \\&quot;hives, sudden respiratory problems and swelling in the mouth or face,\\&quot; according to research done on wisegeek.com website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But having neither of these and not being able to afford to purchase either product perhaps I had expected too much for using only 1/3 of the prescribed process.</li>
            <li> The second star is for hope, which is always worth something.</li>
            <li> Not ten years worth, but nothing&#x27;s going to do that.  </li>
            <li> I did not find my face to be any more firm, just softer.</li>
            <li> It is in a triangular shaped bottle, which makes getting the top off easier than for round bottles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbed by the skin quickly and the effects do last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The entire vbeaute product line produces extraordinary results on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A cream should either have a pleasant smell or, ideally, no smell at all.</li>
            <li> However, that is easy to look past considering many packages look larger than what is actually inside</li>
            <li> I put about a bean sized lump on the back of my hand &amp; my hand still feels smooth hours later -</li>
            <li> Second, the description says light creme, I found this just the opposite</li>
            <li> The basis of this moisturizing cream is a botanical and multi-vitamin complex consisting of alpine rose botanical technology and bio cellular peptides along with \\&quot;ceramides 2 and 3.\\&quot; The ceramides are naturally occurring skin lipid molecules that assist with  water-retention capacity and cell regulation.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now, and the first two my cheeks were a bit reddish</li>
            <li> At first it may not seem like enough</li>
            <li> I was in fact using another creme prior to receiving this sample of \\&quot;Buying Time\\&quot; that was working much better for me and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> really liked that the product doesn&#x27;t have any parabens and is not tested on animals, but frankly, I didn&#x27;t find the quality any better than much less expensive products.  </li>
            <li> product itself is a pure white in the container and has an opaque look when you dab some on your finger.  </li>
            <li> Empirical data:  </li>
            <li> With this cream, my skin still feels soft even after washing.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t looking for a moisturizer, and yet, it was the moisturing part that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> The cream offers 24 hour  and you do feel and see results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and absorbs fast enough where I could snap my fingers on the hand I used to apply it within 15 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me by Vbeaute is a fabulous skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked as a cosmetologist for over 35 years, I handle products all day, and I&#x27;m really sensitive to fragrance and the chemicals that touch my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I know the natural aging signs are going to start showing up soon.  </li>
            <li> Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce]] which is one favorite of mine but is not as thick.  </li>
            <li> Since I did not have the other products, I could only guess where this should fit into my arsenal.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and because I have never smoked, I do not drink alcohol but on very rare occasions, and I do not go outdoors for prolonged sun exposure without sunscreen, I have not done a lot of past damage to my skin.  </li>
            <li> price of $135 for 1.7 ounces is a lot of money, unless the stuff lasts a long time and works really well.</li>
            <li> First, there is not much cream in this crème package.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the intent is to psychologically impact the consumer by providing a tiny amount of product for a relatively large price.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement one way or the other as far as younger looking skin, but I&#x27;ll report back if I see anything significant after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny dot and it&#x27;s enough for my whole face.</li>
            <li> The cream is on the thick-ish side, although I didn&#x27;t find it greasy feeling, and went on smoothly, but it is heavy enough that you can&#x27;t put makeup immediately over it</li>
            <li> It is  a thick cream, which applies easily.</li>
            <li> jar itself is a dark purple with an odd triangle shape (being artsy and stylish</li>
            <li> I could see this cream going very quickly because the container is small!</li>
            <li> The container is typical of high end cr&amp;egrave;mes; the jar is huge and fancy but there is little product inside.  </li>
            <li> My combo skin has been extra oily near my cheeks</li>
            <li> However, the cream has left my wife&#x27;s face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer barely has a fragrance, and it never changed on my skin</li>
            <li> and less dramatic disclaimer is that while my skin can always use a nice glow, this was reviewed by the much fairer of the Stuart sexes.</li>
            <li> This cream has the consistency of good old Pond&#x27;s cold cream and it&#x27;s totally unscented.  </li>
            <li> I am very particular about the lotion I use on my face due to sweating and not mixing well with makeup.  </li>
            <li> It opened easily enough, and I was happy to find it unscented since heavily perfumed products make me ill.</li>
            <li> The directions do say that the user is to first use vbeaute&#x27;s cleanser and then serum before using the Buying Time Everyday Creme.</li>
            <li> No bad, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad cream by any means, but IMHO it isn&#x27;t a great one either, particularly not at the listed price.</li>
            <li> Although mild,it was chemical-like, much like the smell found in hair dyes only not nearly as strong.</li>
            <li> PRO - a little goes a long way (don&#x27;t use too much or</li>
            <li> The cream is white in color, with a nice feel when applying, but it has a slightly unpleasant, off smell.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t, but what it does do is moisturize better than other, equally expensive products I&#x27;ve tried and it seems to revive my skin&#x27;s appearance a noticable amount.  </li>

            <li> At over $100 a pop, my wife says there are many less expensive alternatives.  </li>
            <li> I used the vbeaute only at night, promptly forgot about it, and one morning less than a week later</li>
            <li> My daughter said the product made her forehead break out, and I noticed other reviewers said the same.  </li>

            <li> She put this to the test for three consecutive days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Echoing other reviewers here near-verbatim</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and smooths away small imperfections of the facial skin.</li>
            <li> I asked other people and everybody agreed that the odor was perceptible.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other vbeaut&amp;eacute; creams.</li>
            <li> Not really sure I can be objective on either point.</li>
            <li> There was a thin layer of \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; that seemed to remain on my skin between applications and that I could actually wash off before applying the next application.</li>
            <li> I had to admit I was quite curious what made a cream that was $135 for less than 2 ounces</li>
            <li> I was open to eliminating the little wrinkles around the mouth and eyes and perhaps erasing the few little brown spots that have started to appear on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I can swing the money for this product in the long term - little too steep for my budget.  </li>
            <li> I applied it liberally (as I usually do with my less expensive moisturizers) and found that at first the cream was a bit sticky,</li>
            <li> Yes it was slightly greasy or tacky but this type of cream on my face (and body)</li>
            <li> Second, the price is absurd at $135 especially since it works as well as my Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, anyone who does not mind the price and likes a thick and heavy moisturizing cream that is not tested on animals, might consider giving this a try especially for the winter months up north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically use high-end drug store brands costing about $30 a jar.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive at all, and maybe this cream is just too delicate to have an impact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual cream smells odd, not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> We live in an era where, unfortunately, everything in our environment is suspect:  water, soil, food, air.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the cr&amp;egrave;me is not too obvious, but rather unpleasant if smelled directly.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive cream, but I do see it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on my face with either type of foundation, I still would not use this cream under makeup with oily</li>
            <li> Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me</li>
            <li> have been using it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> it starts feeling heavy)</li>
            <li> When this chemical odor mixes with my perfume, the result is not fantastic.</li>
            <li> Trouble is, one doesn&#x27;t know these flower extracts&#x27; country of origin or if they are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However after receving this container of \\&quot;Buying Time Everyday</li>
            <li> The odor is very slight and is not what I would call offensive.  </li>
            <li> so I was anxious to give this</li>
            <li> This product makes a claim to help reverse \\&quot;the sins of the past and protect the skin of your future\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The alternative is not appealing.</li>
            <li> Since this product has no SPF in it, it is not suitable for daytime.  </li>
            <li> Well, that is a bit hard to say.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t feel too oily (a common complaint with drugstore creams)</li>
            <li> That being said, my complaint is with the products price.  </li>
            <li> For all its strengths, this cream loses to its competitors in terms of its odor.</li>
            <li> But note: while these things are \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; there might still be negative reactions for some people.</li>
            <li> I found it to be quite thick.  </li>
            <li> While it softened my hands as I applied it, it was quite thick and greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m going to like this all over &amp; around my nose!  </li>
            <li> wrinkles\\&quot; alone I would call it a failure.  </li>
            <li> can tell you that according to the Center for Science in the Public Trust, BHT, an ingredient here, \\&quot;retards rancidity in oils .</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this cream failed miserably at diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> , I felt that the cream was very thick, however, it did absorb eventually, just didn&#x27;t care for the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Hours later, the smell is still annoying me.  </li>
            <li> An expensive purchase, but if you have the money and like creams, go for it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just shy of a month, twice a day after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not impressive and neither the effect.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s too expensive for what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
            <li> It is really to bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The entire vbeaute product line produces extraordinary results on my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s a fast and effective beauty regime that produces maximum results with a minimum of amount of time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a very deep discount on another website &amp; since I rely heavily on people&#x27;s reviews, thought I would leave a review here for others if they care...  I just received this cream &amp; tried it on the back of hand (I know, not an accurate trial) but I know my creams &amp; I know if I&#x27;m going to like them.  No cream is anti-aging.  You have to use lasers, derma rollers, or other more invasive tactics to trigger collagen.  I just don&#x27;t believe that creams can do that.  I look for a velvety feel that leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth - not greasy.  This does that.  What is bothering me about it - is the smell.  I put about a bean sized lump on the back of my hand &amp; my hand still feels smooth hours later - but I found the smell of this cream very off putting.  And I am not sensitive to smells.  Hours later, the smell is still annoying me.  Not sure if I&#x27;m going to like this all over &amp; around my nose!  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell really, maybe chemical-ly or something.  Love the weight &amp; feel of the cream but the smell might ruin it for me.</li>
            <li> vBeaute Buying Time Everyday Creme is a pleasant, light weight moisturizing cream.  I applied it liberally (as I usually do with my less expensive moisturizers) and found that at first the cream was a bit sticky, but after it absorbed for a few minutes, it was fine.  The cream is white in color, with a nice feel when applying, but it has a slightly unpleasant, off smell.  I&#x27;ve experienced this odd smell before with unscented creams, and I suspect it is a somewhat chemical smell from whatever was used to neutralize the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vBeaute Creme came in a cardboard box, so it was not over packaged, but the jar is a triangle-shaped, non-recyclable plastic, I think because it is made in Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked that the product doesn&#x27;t have any parabens and is not tested on animals, but frankly, I didn&#x27;t find the quality any better than much less expensive products.  Perhaps the performance is improved if this is used in conjunction with the other products in the line.</li>
            <li> I have the start of lines forming around my eyes. I also have combination skin on my face - dry in some areas, but oily in other areas. I used this cream on my face and neck twice a day - in the morning, before putting on my makeup and before I went to bed. After about one week, those oily patches on my face starting breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it could be because I used this cream and then put on my makeup in the morning. However, any cream I use should allow me to wear makeup without my face breaking out. To see if there was a difference, I used liquid foundation on some days and powder foundation on other days. Nope, didn&#x27;t matter, my face continued to break out. While it didn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on my face with either type of foundation, I still would not use this cream under makeup with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this cream is paraben free, fragrance free, dermatologist tested, and not tested on animals. And while it&#x27;s a nice moisturizing cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for trying new products, even those whose promises stretch the hyperbole envelope beyond recognition. So when vbeaute&#x27;s Buying Time (don&#x27;t we wish!) showed up on my Vine page, I could not hit the button fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To judge a product fairly, it&#x27;s best to use it as part of a system, and this cream, excuse me, creme, theoretically constitutes just one step of a maintenance routine. Since I did not have the other products, I could only guess where this should fit into my arsenal. Before or after the vitamin C serum? In addition to the retinol? Instead of the retin-A and obagi? I don&#x27;t feel as though I have stumbled upon the perfect moment yet, though I have slathered it on at various points throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: nothing. There&#x27;s a tiny hint of an inoffensive scent. The cream doesn&#x27;t feel too oily (a common complaint with drugstore creams) and it&#x27;s easy to massage into the skin. It left my skin feeling neither softer nor drier. It has had no effect on lines but it hasn&#x27;t made me break out either. My skin is not sensitive at all, and maybe this cream is just too delicate to have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar itself is aesthetically pleasing, and that is worth at least a star. Its unusual shape makes it easy to locate if you&#x27;re looking for it with your hands instead of your eyes, for example, if you put on cream while you drive. Not that I would do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have experienced no negative results from the cream, I will continue to use it, and if anything changes, I&#x27;ll amend what would otherwise be a one-star review. The second star is for hope, which is always worth something.</li>
            <li> Empirical data:  This cream has the consistency of good old Pond&#x27;s cold cream and it&#x27;s totally unscented.  It&#x27;s absorbed by the skin quickly and the effects do last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this cream made me look ten years younger, I&#x27;d buy it by the case.  It doesn&#x27;t, but what it does do is moisturize better than other, equally expensive products I&#x27;ve tried and it seems to revive my skin&#x27;s appearance a noticable amount.  It works pretty fast, too. I used the vbeaute only at night, promptly forgot about it, and one morning less than a week later, I did a double take at the mirror.  It made that big a difference.  Not ten years worth, but nothing&#x27;s going to do that.  My skin felt softer, smoother and plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lest any reader think I&#x27;m a shill for this product because I got it for free, let me just say that I&#x27;ve been using, and am perfectly happy with Dr. Perricone&#x27;s products.  I replaced Dr. P&#x27;s stinky fishy smelling cream that comes in a tube with this product, and I&#x27;m delighted with the difference.  I&#x27;ve got a lot of Dr. P&#x27;s stuff to use up but I would definitely order this stuff again.  It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for about 2 weeks now and I am very impressed.  I use it once a day, at night, and put the cream on sparingly.  And my skin is soft and smooth.  The cream absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, all things I like in a face cream.  But for me the ultimate test is how my skin feels after I have washed it off.  With this cream, my skin still feels soft even after washing.</li>
            <li> Buying Time Everyday Creme by vbeaute comes in a beautiful purple glass jar with silver colored lid that instantly makes you feel like it will indeed hold the secrets which would help erase wrinkles, moisturize aging skin and even out skin tones. Being 67 I was open to eliminating the little wrinkles around the mouth and eyes and perhaps erasing the few little brown spots that have started to appear on my cheeks. I really wasn&#x27;t looking for a moisturizer, and yet, it was the moisturing part that actually worked for me. I used the creme daily first thing in the morning and right before bedtime for three straight weeks. It would seep into my face and neck and indeed conquered the dry areas, especially in my eyebrows and the outer corners of my eyes. There was a thin layer of \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; that seemed to remain on my skin between applications and that I could actually wash off before applying the next application. My face and neck became smooth, soft and \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there was no reduction of wrinkles nor erasure of brown spots. The directions do say that the user is to first use vbeaute&#x27;s cleanser and then serum before using the Buying Time Everyday Creme. But having neither of these and not being able to afford to purchase either product perhaps I had expected too much for using only 1/3 of the prescribed process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks in the morning and evening before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was grateful for the fact that there is no scent.I was pleased with the consistency and how smoothly it applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning you will note a lovely soft feel to your skin and diminished fine lines. It really leaves skin velvety smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The founder of the company was looking for luxurious results in preventing the aging cycle. The cream offers 24 hour  and you do feel and see results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with this cream and interested in buying the serum that is to be used after washing the face and neck and before application of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ounce of prevention and pampering come in this beautiful jar and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have recently noticed fine lines around my eyes and reddening cheeks. My combo skin has been extra oily near my cheeks and I&#x27;ve had breakouts. Ive been using Mario Badescu&#x27;s  cellufirm drops around my eyes and his vitamin c serum to even skintone. It has been working. I then added this cream, as a moisturizer, to my routine and my skin looks almost flawless. The lines around my eyes aren&#x27;t visible and my skin appears as though I were in my 20&#x27;s. It is  a thick cream, which applies easily. I use a tiny dot and it&#x27;s enough for my whole face. This is an expensive cream, but I do see it lasting a long time. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and my skin is clearer, smoother and brighter. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. Although mild,it was chemical-like, much like the smell found in hair dyes only not nearly as strong. It faded after about 10 minutes but it still bugged me. The top of the cream can be used as a mirror.</li>
            <li> I love trying out face creams so when this came up for review I just jumped at the chance to sample it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it was almost like applying body butter on my face. I found it to be quite thick.  However, I really like that consistency for its incredible moisturizing affects. Yes it was slightly greasy or tacky but this type of cream on my face (and body) during the winter months is very soothing to me and offers me protection from the damaging affects of the wind and cold. So I did not take off any points for the body butter feel; however, I would not use this cream in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to apply it to my entire face (including eyelids) and it did not bother my eyes like some creams do. Another thing I like about this product is the beautiful triangular purple jar it comes in being that purple is a favorite color of mine.  The fact that this cream is not tested on animals is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I rate this 3 stars?  First, even though it moisturized my face well, I did not find it any better than the [[ASIN:B00005JTW8 Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce]] which is one favorite of mine but is not as thick.  Second, the price is absurd at $135 especially since it works as well as my Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, anyone who does not mind the price and likes a thick and heavy moisturizing cream that is not tested on animals, might consider giving this a try especially for the winter months up north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - This product is from Switzerland.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying new skin care products, so was happy to have a chance to give the vbeaut&amp;eacute; Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me a whirl. I have to admit that I hadn&#x27;t noticed the price tag until after a couple of trial days - I would have expected gold flakes or something at those price levels! Initial impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outside packaging is minimal, although the small white print on the dark purple box made for difficult reading for older folks with small-print challenged eyes. I had to put on the readers as well as holding the box under a bright light to manage reading it at all, but since I don&#x27;t understand half of what the ingredients are, why I bothered...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar itself is a dark purple with an odd triangle shape (being artsy and stylish I assume). It opened easily enough, and I was happy to find it unscented since heavily perfumed products make me ill. The cream is on the thick-ish side, although I didn&#x27;t find it greasy feeling, and went on smoothly, but it is heavy enough that you can&#x27;t put makeup immediately over it - you need to wait a good five minutes for it to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now, and the first two my cheeks were a bit reddish and I also had a few too many pimples (at my age I shouldn&#x27;t have many at all), but that&#x27;s cleared up after a couple more days. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement one way or the other as far as younger looking skin, but I&#x27;ll report back if I see anything significant after a longer period of time. As it is, this seems to work as well as the much lower priced products I normally use. This isn&#x27;t a bad cream by any means, but IMHO it isn&#x27;t a great one either, particularly not at the listed price. YMMV.</li>
            <li> I had to admit I was quite curious what made a cream that was $135 for less than 2 ounces so special.  I got a container of the cream and let my wife use it for roughly the last 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we opened the package, I have to say the container was quite cool.  It comes in a purple, triangular shaped container with a mirror bright top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a pure white in the container and has an opaque look when you dab some on your finger.  When I tried some on myself, it goes on cool and absorbs fairly quickly.  It is non greasy and absorbs fast enough where I could snap my fingers on the hand I used to apply it within 15 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream does have a bit of an odor to it.  The odor is very slight and is not what I would call offensive.  I cannot place what it is or what to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my wife have at it for 6 weeks.  The cream seemed to be excellent in one aspect and failed in another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a great moisturizer.  My wife gave the product very high marks in this aspect.  With winter now upon us and the furnace now running, our skin tends to dry a bit.  However, the cream has left my wife&#x27;s face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this cream failed miserably at diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  Maybe it is too much to hope to see a difference in six weeks, but after using it, I can see no difference in the fine lines on my wife&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for a month and a half, if you are looking for an excellent moisturizer and cost is not an issue, this product is worth a try.  If you are looking to rid yourself of fine lines and wrinkles, then this product alone does not appear to do the job.</li>
            <li> Here is my fianc&amp;eacute;e&#x27;s take on the cream: \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know much about fancy creams, but I can say that I love this one! Not sure if it&#x27;s the price tag that makes it feel amazing, but it is very nice. The texture is perfect - smooth, not too thick but definitely has weight to it. It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing, and VERY moisturizing. The scent is light and pleasant. I can&#x27;t comment on the age-defying nature of the cream since I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s... I&#x27;ll let you know in 20 years! I could see this cream going very quickly because the container is small! An expensive purchase, but if you have the money and like creams, go for it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Since this product has no SPF in it, it is not suitable for daytime.  It has a nice feel to it, not greasy, and glides on well.  However, I find that a half-hour after putting it on my dry areas need a second application.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this only 3 stars.  A good face cream needs to be applied only once after washing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come in a very pretty purple bottle.  If you like to keep your bottles and jars out, it will make a nice decorative feature in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me by Vbeaute is a fabulous skin moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve worked as a cosmetologist for over 35 years, I handle products all day, and I&#x27;m really sensitive to fragrance and the chemicals that touch my skin. This moisturizer barely has a fragrance, and it never changed on my skin so I didn&#x27;t notice it during the day. After using it for 10 days with no break outs or rash or sensitivity issues I&#x27;m sold. It applies smoothly, feels cool to the skin, and absorbs without an oily residue. The bonus is the vibrant purple jar with a silver V shaped top, so nicely done that it would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just shy of a month, twice a day after cleansing.  The product has a light scent, nothing overpowering.  The texture is smooth and non-greasy.  The jar itself appears as though you are getting more than the 1.7 ounces that your truly get.  However, that is easy to look past considering many packages look larger than what is actually inside (just something I noticed right away).  The cr&amp;egrave;me states that it is paraben free, fragrance free (although I do smell a light scent), dermatologist tested and NOT tested on animals.  The pamphlet inside (to sum it up) says this product (which includes Alpine Rose Botanical Technology ARBT, and BioCellular Peptide BCP) \\&quot;helps to promote firmness and elasticity while visibly diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\\&quot; This being said, if I were to judge the product on \\&quot;diminishing fine lines and wrinkles\\&quot; alone I would call it a failure.  I did not see any diminishing of any fine lines and although my face feels very soft.  I did not find my face to be any more firm, just softer. The product does a great job of moisturizing without the greasiness...but in my opinion that is about it.  The product does state it is good at \\&quot;preventing premature aging\\&quot; but at over $100 a bottle, when will you know it&#x27;s done its job?  That being said, my complaint is with the products price.  In \\&quot;my\\&quot; opinion, if I am going to pay over $100 for a face cream, I expect the product to perform miracles.  I didn&#x27;t find this product to do anything more than your average drug store product.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this cream for more than two weeks now. She always applies it before bedtime and many times before going to to work in the morning. She feels that it is light and has a pleasant texture. It is not greasy at all. She finds that it is cooling and refreshing. Her skin feels soft and smooth. She claims that the cream smooths out fine lines on her face. Overall, this is a great products though quite pricy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify the price of this cream. The smell is not impressive and neither the effect. As the manufacture mentioned, it only work best when used with other products. So it means you&#x27;ll have to spend more to get the desirable results. If you have extra money and wanna give it a try, that&#x27;s okay. For me, it&#x27;s too expensive for what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> Reviewer Disclaimer: This was received as a Review Product for the Amazon Vine Program. This program does NOT compensate nor reward for positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;Second and less dramatic disclaimer is that while my skin can always use a nice glow, this was reviewed by the much fairer of the Stuart sexes. She put this to the test for three consecutive days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Echoing other reviewers here near-verbatim, it&#x27;s not that &#x27;Buying Time&#x27; isn&#x27;t a good product; it&#x27;s biggest enemy is the outrageously high price point. Which - at what it is - finds [[ASIN:B0031NK6J8 Philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-Aging Moisturizer, 2 Ounce]] both much less expensive and better at what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To elaborate, &#x27;Buying Time&#x27; is of a mid-higher end in its texture, and easily absorbs either over or under existing makeup. It&#x27;s lack of fragrances and excessive ingredients translates to a simple application, where it blends well with even sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t contribute to or cause breakouts, likewise no heaviness to application areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still - and unlike &#x27;Miracle Worker&#x27; - Swiss-made Buying Time doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect at initial application sites nor over time. It lacks the distinct and positive &#x27;glow&#x27; of the arguably better Philosophy product, one where contributions to skin quality are obvious. Skin almost longs for the alternative creme; the same can&#x27;t be said for vbeaute&#x27;s highest priced option.</li>
            <li> I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.  Since I don&#x27;t use women&#x27;s skin care products I asked my wife and daughter to use this and evaluate.  Both were unimpressed.  It claims to make you wake up even more beautiful than you were when you went to bed which, of course, is an absurd statement.  It claims to be fragrance free, but there&#x27;s a hint of odor to it that&#x27;s not all that pleasant.  At over $100 a pop, my wife says there are many less expensive alternatives.  My daughter said the product made her forehead break out, and I noticed other reviewers said the same.  On the bright side, it&#x27;s made in Switzerland (at least it&#x27;s not from China).</li>
            <li> First, there is not much cream in this crème package.  It is in a triangular shaped bottle, which makes getting the top off easier than for round bottles.  The actual cream smells odd, not pleasant.  The smell fades, but it is definitely not scented to be appealing.  I experienced a slight burn when I applied the cream for the first time, but this also faded after a few minutes.  It does make my skin smooth, but it is not so much better than Oil of Olay that I would pay the difference.  No bad, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about the lotion I use on my face due to sweating and not mixing well with makeup.  This lotion is fantastic.  I&#x27;m a fan and will continue to use it for many years to come.  A little bit goes a long way so it lasts - worth the investment!  My skin is softer and my complexion is looking better.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I typically use high-end drug store brands costing about $30 a jar. I am no stranger to high-end department store products so I was anxious to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bright white cream. You only need a dab! A tiny dab at that. At first it may not seem like enough but once you start to smooth it in it spreads and will easily cover all of your face. It melts right in and my face feels very smooth and soft afterwards. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to me...I actually prefer that as fragrances can irritate the eyes in my experience. Its a very nice luxurious feel. Every time I put it on I feel like I just had a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far all I can say is that, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed such a huge improvement that I would spend $100 more on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one big drawback for me is that it does not contain SPF and I don&#x27;t like to have to use a separate SPF product. I am curios to see what continued use (like 3-6 months) would produce.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and because I have never smoked, I do not drink alcohol but on very rare occasions, and I do not go outdoors for prolonged sun exposure without sunscreen, I have not done a lot of past damage to my skin.  I got this product because I know the natural aging signs are going to start showing up soon.  This product makes a claim to help reverse \\&quot;the sins of the past and protect the skin of your future\\&quot;.  Its designed to help skin naturally heal itself and slow down pre-mature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it a few weeks now and I like it ok - so with that said, here are the PROS and CON for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* PRO - I have very sensitive skin - most products burn my skin or cause it to break out.  This product does not hurt my skin - I believe its claimer that it can be used on ALL skin types...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* PRO - a little goes a long way (don&#x27;t use too much or it starts feeling heavy)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* PRO - it definitely provides my skin with 24 hours of moisture (and that is a A+ for me because I have VERY DRY skin)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* CON - price.  Not sure that I can swing the money for this product in the long term - little too steep for my budget.  While it seems to be a good product, I am not convinced yet that there isn&#x27;t one out there that is just as nice and a little friendlier to my wallet.</li>
            <li> This cream is light enough to be used during the day and offers significant benefits. It moisturizes and smooths away small imperfections of the facial skin. It leaves the skin feeling peachy-smooth and well-moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this cream a lot and would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for one thing: this creme has a chemical odor that is quite perceptible. A cream should either have a pleasant smell or, ideally, no smell at all. For all its strengths, this cream loses to its competitors in terms of its odor. I don&#x27;t really feel like smelling like a chemical factory for almost an hour after applying the product. And it isn&#x27;t that I have an especially acute sense of smell that nobody else has. I asked other people and everybody agreed that the odor was perceptible. When this chemical odor mixes with my perfume, the result is not fantastic. This is why I only used it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this issue (that I hope will soon be fixed), this is a very impressive product. And the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> We live in an era where, unfortunately, everything in our environment is suspect:  water, soil, food, air. Because of that I am not about to put something on my skin that may cause further harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme may be \\&quot;Buying Time,\\&quot; but it also may be helping you run out of time. There are a lot of good things in this creme. As an herbalist I recognize a good many botanicals that would be helpful to one&#x27;s skin: grape seed oil, calendula and helianthus, to name a few. Trouble is, one doesn&#x27;t know these flower extracts&#x27; country of origin or if they are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that according to the Center for Science in the Public Trust, BHT, an ingredient here, \\&quot;retards rancidity in oils . . . is unnecessary and is easily replaced by safe substitutes. Avoid when possible.\\&quot; I learned that in some tests on animals the risk of cancer increased. No thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another ingredient is Hexyldecanol. A study noted some reaction, with a \\&quot;severe dermatitis mimicking deep vein thrombosis.\\&quot; Again, I&#x27;ll pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give one more negative example, dimethicone, which is a man-made polymer \\&quot;popularly used in industrial lubricants\\&quot; and can cause allergic reactions such as \\&quot;hives, sudden respiratory problems and swelling in the mouth or face,\\&quot; according to research done on wisegeek.com website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, some people will use this product and have no problems with it, while others will have problems, possibly severe. Do you feel lucky?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I really do want to age. The alternative is not appealing. But if using something will cut down on the prospect of my aging, I&#x27;d just as soon lightly scrub my face with a little salt, lavender and camoumile, wash it with rose water and sleep with a light coating of coconut oil or aloe vera. But note: while these things are \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; there might still be negative reactions for some people. You&#x27;ve got to do your homework and gingerly experiment. However, I&#x27;d feel much safer with this group than what I found in the creme.s group than what I found in the creme.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for new face creams, anything that says \\&quot;Buying Time\\&quot; must work well. However after receving this container of \\&quot;Buying Time Everyday Creme\\&quot; I have my doubts again. First, it costs quite a bit of money, much more than I would normally spend on face creme. Second, the description says light creme, I found this just the opposite, I felt that the cream was very thick, however, it did absorb eventually, just didn&#x27;t care for the feel of it. The fact that there is no fragrance is good and that they state they do not test on animals. I just didin&#x27;t find anything overwelming special from this creme that would make me want to go out and buy it for the price listed. I was in fact using another creme prior to receiving this sample of \\&quot;Buying Time\\&quot; that was working much better for me and cost a lot less. It is really to bad, I almost think that for this price we are paying for the fancy container and not for the product inside.</li>
            <li> The basis of this moisturizing cream is a botanical and multi-vitamin complex consisting of alpine rose botanical technology and bio cellular peptides along with \\&quot;ceramides 2 and 3.\\&quot; The ceramides are naturally occurring skin lipid molecules that assist with  water-retention capacity and cell regulation.  The expected benefits include anti-inflammatory properties (from Boswellia Serrata Extract), correction, hydration (from Grape Seed Oil) and preventative effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying Time Everyday Cr&amp;egrave;me goes on smooth and a bit sticky / greasy at first, but quickly penetrates skin to add a noticeable level of hydration.  The fragrance of the cr&amp;egrave;me is not too obvious, but rather unpleasant if smelled directly.  The container is typical of high end cr&amp;egrave;mes; the jar is huge and fancy but there is little product inside.  I suspect the intent is to psychologically impact the consumer by providing a tiny amount of product for a relatively large price.  (i.e. \\&quot;it&#x27;s rare\\&quot; or \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the formulation perfect?  No.  Does it reinvent skin care?  No. The concept of using rare botanicals in a skincare formula is not novel.  Having said that, Buying Time does provide some level of moisturization but falls short of some other products I have tried, such as similar creams sold by Lancome or L&#x27;Occitane.  I do not possess sufficient knowledge to comment on all of the ingredients, but I have not had a reaction to using the product for a period of 2 weeks.  I can say that this product does produce visible results during the time frame in which I have used it.  I look forward to trying other vbeaut&amp;eacute; creams.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product. While it softened my hands as I applied it, it was quite thick and greasy feeling on my skin. As a night cream for someone with extremely dry skin, it might possibly work. As a day cream underneath makeup? Definitely not. I have not had acne since my teen-aged years, yet this cream caused a break out on my forehead. I am putting it on my list of products to avoid.</li>
            <li> Most people may think that this product was directed to women, but it didn&#x27;t appear that it wouldn&#x27;t work for a man too, so I decided to give it a try when I saw it on the Amazon Vine List. Nobody is getting any younger and maybe it would buy me some time - a pun on the product name there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme itself is white and has a slight, pleasant smell. Not a \\&quot;lady\\&quot; smell. The texture is smooth, and it goes on easily. I&#x27;ve tried it several times, and it gave me no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, does it work really well as is claimed by the maker? Well, that is a bit hard to say. These things can be very subjective and just hard to evaluate, period. One thing to mention is that users are directed to use it twice a day. Once a day was about the most I could manage. Guys usually put moisturizer on after shaving, if at all, and not many shave more than once a day. And I&#x27;m sure that I didn&#x27;t put it on every day, since I skip shaving on weekends at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of $135 for 1.7 ounces is a lot of money, unless the stuff lasts a long time and works really well. Not really sure I can be objective on either point. Sorry, I can&#x27;t be more helpful in this review. If I have more to report later, I&#x27;ll update this.</li>
