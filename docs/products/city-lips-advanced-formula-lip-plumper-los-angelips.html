            <li>I love this lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I have found that my lips are more moist.  </li>
            <li>It was okay but wished it plumped my lips more than it did.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but you have to be consistent if you want it to work.  </li>
            <li>really like this product....feels so nice on lips and does give a plumper appearance.  </li>
            <li>Get some cheap lip gloss.</li>
            <li>notable difference with first use.</li>
            <li>It stays on longer than ordinary gloss and feels great!</li>
            <li>This is not only my favorite lip gloss but also my favorite color of lip gloss ever.</li>

            <li>Plumps lips really well and one tube lasts for a long time.</li>

            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m over 60, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Not lush.</li>
            <li> I also like the way this product brings out the pink tone in my lips when I wear it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a complete waste.  </li>
            <li> It does plump but just a little.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> I try to be, but have messed up a few times and noticed that if I didn&#x27;t use it, it made a difference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So small dont your time</li>
            <li> ever made so small</li>
            <li> Merely &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; as a gloss - not very moist or glossy.  </li>
            <li> But, alas, no.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make your lips look like Angelia Jolie, but if you have thin lips, it does plums them up a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin lips and after using this product every night for over 5 months I have not seen any plumpness to my lips.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even work worst by I</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  Keeps my lips moist and I have no need to wear lipstick.</li>
            <li> Plumps lips really well and one tube lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This really works! I like the color angel lips. notable difference with first use. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m over 60, but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  I do love the lip gloss so it&#x27;s not a complete waste.  When I was younger, I had full lips that embarrassed me.  Now I wish I had them.  Was hoping to get some of that back,  But, alas, no.</li>
            <li> The product did arrive on time, but it&#x27;s obviously way passed its shelve freshness. I have purchased this item before, from the company itself, and I was very happy with it. This one is definitely too old to be sold or used.</li>
            <li> really like this product....feels so nice on lips and does give a plumper appearance.  I am on my third tube.  Great plumper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product directly from city lips and this one is definitely NOT the same. It is more liquid than the real city lips and doesn&#x27;t plump hardly at all compared to the real product. Very disappointed! I will only buy this product directly from city cosmetics!</li>
            <li> So small dont your time and it doesn&#x27;t even work worst by I ever made so small you maybe get three uses out of it or 4</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss. It stays on longer than ordinary gloss and feels great!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Worked the first time I applied it and then did nothing.  Money wasted.</li>
            <li> This is a luxury that you have to decide is worth the money. Worth a try once.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I have very thin lips and after using this product every night for over 5 months I have not seen any plumpness to my lips.  I have found that my lips are more moist.  I also like the way this product brings out the pink tone in my lips when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Merely &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; as a gloss - not very moist or glossy.  And forget about any plumping - nil.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This has made my lips fuller and more attractive!</li>
            <li> This is not only my favorite lip gloss but also my favorite color of lip gloss ever. Stays on all day and makes my lips look beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but you have to be consistent if you want it to work.  I try to be, but have messed up a few times and noticed that if I didn&#x27;t use it, it made a difference.</li>
            <li> It does was it&#x27;s promised to do. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Something about having the color added makes it not work as well as the clear.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried this and it ACTUALLY WORKS!!!  It won&#x27;t make your lips look like Angelia Jolie, but if you have thin lips, it does plums them up a bit.  If you continue to use it during the day it works even better!!  A good product!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a real change. I had to buy and try for myself. It was okay but wished it plumped my lips more than it did. It does plump but just a little. I won&#x27;t spend money on it to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not lush. Drying and ineffective. Get some cheap lip gloss. You will be happier</li>
