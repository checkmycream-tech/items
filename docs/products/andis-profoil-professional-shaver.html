    <ol>
            <li>Had it for a great price!</li>
            <li>These are perfect!</li>
            <li>not so impressed with the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it is not returnable and I would never try to sell something I didn&#x27;t think was a good product, it&#x27;s going in the trash!</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>It has been some time since I made this purchase, but I use it every day and it is still a very effective shaver.  </li>
            <li>Shaves better than a razor!</li>
            <li>This shaver does an excellent job and is much faster than a rotary razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good and gave me a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Also, very light skin irritation if any.</li>
            <li>very light to hold...</li>
            <li>It gives me a good, quick shave.</li>
            <li>Much better than Norelcos and Remingtons that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from this razor after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it  for touching up my haircuts...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Foil came apart and cost more than shaver..</li>
            <li>My husband has been using the razor for many years and us satified with the quality and pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>i really love it, the customers are blown away.....</li>
            <li>Save your money and find a rusty razor blade, you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these shavers a while ago and really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>so many times!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>it is stunning how smooth it shaves.</li>
            <li>Easy to change blades  </li>
            <li>Price ($40 on sale) cheap replacement parts, built-in trimmer, easy to change blades  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be remiss without mentioning that yes, it does indeed sound like a wood chipper.</li>
            <li>Cheap replacement parts    </li>
            <li>I would NEVER use this as my primary shaver</li>
            <li>shaves as smooth as velvet.....</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle, close shave and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Without charging for a full beard trim.</li>
            <li>I have done a better job with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Being a full time barber I needed a durable and quick solution for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>i am a barber,  this profoil is my new favorite toy. ...</li>
            <li>This is an execllend product, well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>we use them everyday to do bald fades, clean up the line up and a foil beard shave, can&#x27;t imagine not using it in a hair cut, works great very durable.</li>
            <li>this shaver does the job nicely and holds a strong charge but the built in trimmer will sure mess up a goatee or beard if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>It does shave fairly close but leaves a lot of hair that curls down against the skin,that means using a blade razor to touch up.</li>
            <li>After charging the Profoil for about 14 hours, I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>When you first get it it takes 12-14 hrs.</li>
            <li>Gets close enough, but nothing works better than a razor blade.</li>
            <li>This is the first razor I have ever owned where the trimmer didn&#x27;t slide out of the way when not in use.</li>
            <li>When you first get the razor you have to charge it for 12-14 hours.</li>
            <li>In addition, it was loud and did not give a smooth shave, in fact to me</li>
            <li>Well, I am buying a second one because I enjoyed it, but will never use it while plugged again.</li>
            <li>The shaver gave a relatively close shave but was much slower than my rotary and required many repeated passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Great product, now its way more expensive than it use to!</li>
            <li>I use it AFTER I shave with a razor to give a baby soft , super close  shave.</li>
            <li>I certainly wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li>I had been dissatisfied with electrics before as I am very thickly-bearded, but this thing does the job.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The chin and neck were problem areas that the shaver never really was able to handle.</li>
            <li>i was really hoping it would of done the job</li>
            <li>It has a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor is very noisy</li>
            <li>For $40 on sale it gets a real close shave.</li>
            <li>I get a real close cut..</li>
            <li>leaves nothing to cleanup with the straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t want a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>By the way it really shaves well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>Considering the reasonable price and godd</li>
            <li>I have tried several pro electric shavers the wahl 5 star was the last which I still own, but it tends to irritate my skin on the face.</li>
            <li>i had owned the older model,used it in my berbar shop .That</li>
            <li>This new model works a lot better,in power and smoothness.</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the plastic feels a little cheap...</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the battery life of over two weeks between charges.</li>
            <li>This razor is loud to the point of hurting your ears sometimes.</li>
            <li>The battery power lasts far longer than they give themselves credit for.  </li>
            <li>I know it should last a while since I don&#x27;t use it as much as a barber does.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver to those that have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow its nice but a little noisy just like the wahl and covers less area.</li>
            <li>Especially for those like me that have sensitive skin around the neck and crown areas.</li>
            <li>Thus far I have cut my hair twice without a problem and with the absence of any razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>I spent a few weeks checking out the Panasonics, Norelcos, and Brauns that run from $60-$200 and everywhere in between, and also seem to be marketed to guys that get a bit of shadow on their chins toward the end of the day rather than a half-length beard, a light bulb appeared over my head.</li>
            <li>It is much louder than a typical rotary electric shaver.</li>

            <li> It is much louder than a typical rotary electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is loud as said by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> After years of ingrown hairs, razor burn, bumps, cuts, not being able to shave daily due to sensitive skin, and spending a fortune on blades that could only be used two or three times before going dull, and the overall agony of shaving that comes with having being sired by a Middle Easterner, I decided it was time to give electric a serious try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for a month and a half now and its effectiveness surprises me every time.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t mind taking an extra few minutes to shave.</li>
            <li> Like the Wahl shavers that claims to do the same thing, this shaver screams \\&quot;sham I am!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about the volume of this shaver in other reviews</li>
            <li> Also the trimmer makes it very difficult to clean the razor heads without taking them off every time.</li>
            <li> it may feel a little rough on skin.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re shaving close to your goatee and have the shaver turned wrong you can really butcher your hairy masterpiece.</li>
            <li> The biggest down side is the noise.</li>
            <li> this gave me razor bumps this made me have numerous hair bumps and made my face ugly :(...i had great expectations for this shaver</li>
            <li> But I prefer the Andis T-Liner.. less bumps..</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close shave with little irritation.</li>
            <li> The noise and the poor performance of the razor are enough to warrant a \\&quot;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The green led stays on even when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur $$  </li>
            <li> trimmer makes it difficult to shave without being scraped by the sharp metal trimmer comb as it protrudes almost above the razor head.</li>
            <li> Just a tip... use at least every other day because it does not do well with longer hairs.</li>
            <li> DO NOT press down hard on the razor or you will cut your face.</li>
            <li> I trusted the Andis name brand but as it turned out I hated everything about this shaver once it arrived; it looked and felt cheaply made.</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it but do not love it</li>
            <li> let alone on a thick stubble or beard..</li>
            <li> How ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still shocked at the price, but that&#x27;s what you get with such a no-frills product.</li>
            <li> I knew there had to be a secret weapon employed by professionals, and this is it.</li>
            <li> The noise I can tolerate, the poor design is</li>
            <li> Rotary shavers are worse.  </li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the result of using this shaver, I was forced to return to the shaver I was planning to leave behind.</li>
            <li> it felt like it was pulling my hairs out rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> /excellent cutting quality, I would recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li> but I was sooooooo disappointed</li>
            <li> It gives a lousy shave , the trimmer pulls the hair out rather than cutting and even when it is plugged in it runs out of power!!!</li>
            <li> Whether your cutting hair or shaving your face buy this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the shaver terribly noisy...</li>
            <li> This is the worst piece of junk imaginable!</li>

            <li> This shaver does an excellent job and is much faster than a rotary razor.  It holds a charge for over one week too!  Much better than Norelcos and Remingtons that I have used.  The only drawback is that it is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> After years of ingrown hairs, razor burn, bumps, cuts, not being able to shave daily due to sensitive skin, and spending a fortune on blades that could only be used two or three times before going dull, and the overall agony of shaving that comes with having being sired by a Middle Easterner, I decided it was time to give electric a serious try. I spent a few weeks checking out the Panasonics, Norelcos, and Brauns that run from $60-$200 and everywhere in between, and also seem to be marketed to guys that get a bit of shadow on their chins toward the end of the day rather than a half-length beard, a light bulb appeared over my head. A friend of mine is a barber, I&#x27;ll just ask him. Without hesitation, he told me about Andis. I knew there had to be a secret weapon employed by professionals, and this is it. I had been dissatisfied with electrics before as I am very thickly-bearded, but this thing does the job. I&#x27;m still shocked at the price, but that&#x27;s what you get with such a no-frills product. I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for a month and a half now and its effectiveness surprises me every time. I&#x27;ve read about the volume of this shaver in other reviews and I&#x27;d be remiss without mentioning that yes, it does indeed sound like a wood chipper. It works though. It works very well. The only bell and/or whistle I would like on it would be an indicator of when to let the battery run out and recharge it instead of listening to it struggle to get the last bits on my chin before it dies.</li>
            <li> After charging the Profoil for about 14 hours, I tried it for the first time. The shaver gave a relatively close shave but was much slower than my rotary and required many repeated passes to get the job done. The chin and neck were problem areas that the shaver never really was able to handle. The noise from the Profoil was akin to having a chain saw running in your ear. The noise and the poor performance of the razor are enough to warrant a \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy\\&quot; recommendation from me. I certainly wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. Since it is not returnable and I would never try to sell something I didn&#x27;t think was a good product, it&#x27;s going in the trash!</li>
            <li> this gave me razor bumps this made me have numerous hair bumps and made my face ugly :(...i had great expectations for this shaver i was really hoping it would of done the job but I was sooooooo disappointed</li>
            <li> Over all I like the shaver a lot. It has a very close shave. I am surprised at the battery life of over two weeks between charges. The biggest down side is the noise. It is much louder than a typical rotary electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Pros:Price ($40 on sale)    Cheap replacement parts    Built in trimmer     Foil cover    Easy to change blades  Cons:Charge time/indicator    Noise    Can cause irritation     Battery life   This razor is loud to the point of hurting your ears sometimes. When you first get it it takes 12-14 hrs. to charge. Doesn&#x27;t get a close shave all the time, especially when the battery is running low (which seems to be often), that can cause a cut and serve irritation. The battery seems to drain even idling.</li>
            <li> This is a grade A product. It has been some time since I made this purchase, but I use it every day and it is still a very effective shaver.  The battery power lasts far longer than they give themselves credit for.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Gets close enough, but nothing works better than a razor blade. What I like though is the charge time last for weeks. I shave in the morning and leave it in my car to use whenever that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow appears. Also, I don&#x27;t get razor bumps using this shaver which is something I got a lot when using a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I have tried several pro electric shavers the wahl 5 star was the last which I still own, but it tends to irritate my skin on the face. My barber was using this one and he told me to try it out wow its nice but a little noisy just like the wahl and covers less area. But if you don&#x27;t mind taking an extra few minutes to shave. Barber also told me he has only had to change the blades once in 2 years and the foil does not break like the wahl which I have replaced 2 times already..... I know it should last a while since I don&#x27;t use it as much as a barber does.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from this razor after reading the reviews. The noise I can tolerate, the poor design is another issue.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer makes it difficult to shave without being scraped by the sharp metal trimmer comb as it protrudes almost above the razor head. I have suffered the trimmer&#x27;s wrath several times when I forgot to have the trimmer facing up when shaving under my chin. Also the trimmer makes it very difficult to clean the razor heads without taking them off every time. This is the first razor I have ever owned where the trimmer didn&#x27;t slide out of the way when not in use. It does shave fairly close but leaves a lot of hair that curls down against the skin,that means using a blade razor to touch up. All in all I would not recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> Shame on Andis.  They have engaged here in deceptive marketing by emphasizing that this model prevents ingrown hairs and razor bumps.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  FOIL shavers do not prevent razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  They do not.  Again, they do not.  Rotary shavers are worse.  How ludicrous for this company to emphasize that just because the foil is \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot;, ingrown hairs are prevented.  It&#x27;s still a foil.  Allergic reactions to the foil don&#x27;t cause ingrown hairs.  How ridiculous.  It could be sterilized to the highest degree and still cause ingrown hairs.  Like the Wahl shavers that claims to do the same thing, this shaver screams \\&quot;sham I am!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Pros: Price ($40 on sale) cheap replacement parts, built-in trimmer, easy to change blades  Cons: Noisy, charge time/indicator, can cause irritation, battery life  The razor is very noisy it sounds like a power tool convention. If you keep going over the area that won&#x27;t cut your skin will get irritated. When you first get the razor you have to charge it for 12-14 hours. I shave once a week and I have to recharge the battery every two weeks. Instructions say you can&#x27;t overcharge the razor but it will decrease battery life also noted in the instructions. The green led stays on even when fully charged. For $40 on sale it gets a real close shave. DO NOT press down hard on the razor or you will cut your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and gave me a smooth shave and it works a gray hair like me and I am enjoying.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the result of using this shaver, I was forced to return to the shaver I was planning to leave behind. After three uses, I begun getting bumps and had to quit. It&#x27;s sitting here doing nothing.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, close shave and very affordable.  I would recommend this shaver to those that have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Had it for a great price! Great product, now its way more expensive than it use to! I&#x27;m a barber! Shaves better than a razor!</li>
            <li> we use them everyday to do bald fades, clean up the line up and a foil beard shave, can&#x27;t imagine not using it in a hair cut, works great very durable.</li>
            <li> This is an execllend product, well worth the price.  Holds the charge for quite some time as compared to others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> For Everyone using as it a razor/shaver stop. I use it AFTER I shave with a razor to give a baby soft , super close  shave. So use it in conjunction with a reg razor , and you will see and feel. smoothness. I would NEVER use this as my primary shaver&lt;br /&gt;...let alone on a thick stubble or beard.. you guys are nuts that do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it  for touching up my haircuts...I get a real close cut.. I use to maintain the closeness on my sides...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was angled like the Wahl 5 STAR.. Which I will probably purchase once this thing dies...idk though .. I have had it for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> Being a full time barber I needed a durable and quick solution for a quick shave. Without charging for a full beard trim. These are perfect! Also do a lot of skin fades. Closes shaver I have ever used. Also, very light skin irritation if any. I would refer these to anybody!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already thrown in trash. Foil came apart and cost more than shaver..No longer made thank god.&lt;br /&gt;very poor quality.</li>
            <li> found a shaver that does the job--</li>
            <li> I am a barber. Everyone should have this tool!!!! Whether your cutting hair or shaving your face buy this product!!!!! Off the charts!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the razor for many years and us satified with the quality and pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Had it for years. It gives me a good, quick shave. That&#x27;s after my skin adapted to using this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> i am a barber,  this profoil is my new favorite toy. ...it is stunning how smooth it shaves. .....i really love it, the customers are blown away.....shaves as smooth as velvet.....leaves nothing to cleanup with the straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to shave heads ....  skin fades and beard cleanup,&lt;br /&gt;when they don&#x27;t want a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;Its very light to hold...the plastic feels a little cheap...i like my tools to have substance when i hold them, i want to feel the tool will last......time will tell on reliability/durability?&lt;br /&gt;.....I don&#x27;t find the shaver terribly noisy...not so impressed with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;My co-workers and customers now also want one.&lt;br /&gt;olynxa.</li>
            <li> It lasts a week for just one time charging.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the screen foil holes are a bit large.&lt;br /&gt;So it may feel a little rough on skin.</li>
            <li> I trusted the Andis name brand but as it turned out I hated everything about this shaver once it arrived; it looked and felt cheaply made. In addition, it was loud and did not give a smooth shave, in fact to me it felt like it was pulling my hairs out rather than cutting it. I have done a better job with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> This is the worst piece of junk imaginable! It gives a lousy shave , the trimmer pulls the hair out rather than cutting and even when it is plugged in it runs out of power!!! Save your money and find a rusty razor blade, you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these shavers a while ago and really enjoyed it.  I had had the experience that I could use a rechargeable shaver while plugged to the electrical power.  This one died when I did that.  Well, I am buying a second one because I enjoyed it, but will never use it while plugged again. By the way it really shaves well and it is simple. The rest of the competitors have over complicated their shavers to charge more but this one is simply efficient.</li>
            <li> i had owned the older model,used it in my berbar shop .That shaver took the work load year after year.I just replace the foil when needed.This new model works a lot better,in power and smoothness.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close shave with little irritation. It is not the fastest but I did not bump afterwards.  I would recommend highly for those with sensitive skin. Just a tip... use at least every other day because it does not do well with longer hairs.</li>
            <li> This shaver is loud as said by other reviewers. But it give you a close shave as the more expensive shavers. After a shave I can run my fingertips along my face and feel no stubs remaining.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out a lot when using  it. Profoil shaver doesn&#x27;t  get as close as my edgers. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it. :-/ I thought I would. But I prefer the Andis T-Liner.. less bumps.. you know?</li>
            <li> this shaver does the job nicely and holds a strong charge but the built in trimmer will sure mess up a goatee or beard if you&#x27;re not careful. the trimmer is located on one side of the shaver where it cuts all the time. if you&#x27;re shaving close to your goatee and have the shaver turned wrong you can really butcher your hairy masterpiece. LOL</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur $$  this doesn&#x27;t even cut any hair. should have stuck wirh the wahl 5 star shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to cut my hair on my head.  Thus far I have cut my hair twice without a problem and with the absence of any razor bumps.  Considering the reasonable price and godd/excellent cutting quality, I would recommend this shaver.  Especially for those like me that have sensitive skin around the neck and crown areas.</li>
            <li> I does the job....but hurts a little&lt;br /&gt;You have ti rub so many times!&lt;br /&gt;Try another producto...I&#x27;ll keep it but do not love it</li>
