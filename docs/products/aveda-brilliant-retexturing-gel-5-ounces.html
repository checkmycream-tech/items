            <li> But it is way to heavy for my fine l hair and not sure it works well enowith go for its price anyway.</li>
            <li> You put in semi dry hair and finish styling and if hair falls flat, all you do is wet your hands run thru hair</li>
            <li> Only need to use a little as it goes along ways.</li>
            <li> for my thin, straight hair, this product gives it some styling body</li>
            <li> If my hair gets wet from the rain or I intentionally spray mist water on my hair, the gel continues working again.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, once I realized how easy Amazon returns are, it was too late to return it.</li>
            <li> , I rub a small amount on my hands and run them through my short hair.  </li>
            <li> The curls last at least two days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now with thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Retexturing Gel a couple of times, my hair felt weighed down,  </li>
            <li> and it is slightly damp</li>
            <li> I have the hold I want without have the greasy look I&#x27;ve had with other hair care lines in the past.  </li>
            <li> My nephew got me on to this product - leaves my hair styled and without a heavy gel feel.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes, then curl my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing my hair and leaving it slightly damp, I add a small amount of Aveda Retexturing Gel which adds body and shine to my hair .....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair dull like other products.</li>
            <li> I like to use it before drying or otherwise too stiff.</li>
            <li> have a small trial size bottle that I fill for three week</li>
            <li> May gels get hard and &amp;#34;flake.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> it was hard to wash out in the shower, and it made my hair tangle.</li>
            <li> Adds enough texture without making hair gooey, dirty or oily!</li>
            <li> but I was getting a lot of split ends and broken strands.</li>

            <li> My nephew got me on to this product - leaves my hair styled and without a heavy gel feel.  The scent is wonderful.  Can be used every day between shampooing.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; without it and would be ever so grateful to Aveda if they revived this product. There is no other product like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years.  I know that it says it is for medium to coarse hair, but my hair is fine and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It was suggested to me in the Aveda store years ago - he used it on his &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair, I tried a small sample and loved it.  After washing my hair and it is slightly damp, I rub a small amount on my hands and run them through my short hair.  Wait a few minutes, then curl my hair (it&#x27;s straight ).  The curls last at least two days and I am left with no residue on my hair and its never heavy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small trial size bottle that I fill for three week trips overseas and never run out.  This gel is the only product besides spray that I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> great product...leaves your hair conditioned and looking fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair super stiff.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  You put in semi dry hair and finish styling and if hair falls flat, all you do is wet your hands run thru hair and it is looks great again!</li>
            <li> Gel works good, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Only need to use a little as it goes along ways.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot w/hair body and fullness.</li>
            <li> Manages curls without being too sticky and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> Great hold without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> I got of sample of this gel from an Aveda salon in my area. Works exactly as I had hoped. Nice hold, smells great but not overpowering, gives my hair lots of shine. I use this along with the Brilliant Damage Control and the Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair. Really makes my hair look healthy and shiny. I was using Eufora products before but I was getting a lot of split ends and broken strands. Hoping these products help reduce the damage. Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Retexturing Gel a couple of times, my hair felt weighed down,  it was hard to wash out in the shower, and it made my hair tangle. I am switching to the Aveda Confixor Gel which is more of a liquid gel. The Confixor has good hold, great shine, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
