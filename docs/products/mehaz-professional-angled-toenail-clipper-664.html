            <li> It worked a week than it rusted n was not sharp anymore</li>
            <li> This particular model #664 is more like regular clippers.    I am unaware of any other wide jaw clippers that work as yet    MEHAZ 668 Professional Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper (Model: 9MC0668)  Get the wide Jaw version.  They work very good. I have had some mushing with these clippers instead of clipping  on very bad toenails, after a shower they work pretty good.  It is built well. This particular model #664 is more like regular clippers.    [[ASIN:B000TCXWR2 MEHAZ 668 Professional Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper (Model: 9MC0668)]]    I take care of an elderly person who has very thick toenails. Which is common.  I finally decided to look at Amazon for a solution.  This toenail clipper cuts through impossible toenails like a hot knife through butter.    The Jaws are enormous 3/16th&#x27;s of an inch.  Regular toenail clippers are 2/16th&#x27;s.  So apparently  that 1/16 makes a big difference. Made of Stainless steel from Japan and hot.    The Jaw is angled at approximately 20 degrees (by my sight), and the cutting blades are straight.  No curve at all.  On use this worked very well on problem toenails.  It&#x27;s Jaws are very sharp, it is not a toy.    Used a 300 watt light work light to see.  My grandmother can now put on her shoes.  Making a big difference in her life.    *********************************************************************************  Yaw please Grant US Wisdom  *********************************************************************************  Save some water, store some food.

            <li> my Mehaz clippers  worked well for about a cupple months then they fell apart tryng to use them, the pin/bolt  in the chrome  top part just fell out.  I  think ity;s  not well made.</li>
            <li> Durable and well-made.  Ergonomic design does make nail clipping easier; angled edge is a plus.  Hamds and fingers won&#x27;t slip with this grip.</li>
            <li> Ordered this so it would be easier to handle.  It is much easier to hang onto with the grips.  It works as designed, nothing more and nothing less.  Have used it half a dozen times with no problem.</li>
            <li> What a great product. I&#x27;ve got a bad back and other health problems,including impossible to cut toenails until now. What was an hour and a half of back breaking labor can now be done in ten to fifteen minutes. First review I&#x27;ve ever done online.</li>
            <li> had to have these and they work great</li>
            <li> I had one of these for ten years, and recently misplaced it.  I ordered two of these to replace it, from different companies, although I did not realize that at the time.  One cost $6 dollars more than the other, and two different blue colors were used.&lt;br /&gt;Neither was as efficient as the lost original.  The cutting edges have small nicks and so don&#x27;t cut cleanly in different areas.  One squeaks and needs oiling, I guess - not what you want handled around nice clothes.  Overall, I think manufacturing standards have lowered.  But finding a straight cutting ege is difficult, and I would rather have one of these than a concave or convex curve that won&#x27;t fit my nails.</li>
            <li> The right angle to trim your claws, very sharp.</li>
            <li> these do not cut all the way through the nail, resulting in jagged nails:&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> The angle on these clippers is so much easier to use when trimming your own nails.  My husband likes them as well.  The design is much easier to hold than the old-fashioned basic issue.  It&#x27;s nice that you can actually grip onto them where they won&#x27;t slip out of your hand.  The price is great.  Highly recommended.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Greatest professional quality Clipper from a German company made with excellent steel. Will recommend this store with a great low price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It was in the original packaging, but it fell to pieces when I first went to use it.  Luckily I am getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Love the angle on the clipper. That, coupled with the sharpness of the blades, makes it an almost pleasant chore where you don&#x27;t have to worry about sides of nails digging into flesh, nor any jagged edges.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these for years.  I say had because daughter found them and well...  Let&#x27;s just say that she liked them better than all of the other pairs she has.  She seems to collect the thing.  When I asked for them back, she tried to swap me for several pairs of inferior clippers.  Nope.  Just got me another pair.  These cut straight across like toenail clippers should and they even work on thick, tough nails.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I like it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sort of weird. They&#x27;re sharp and do cut my nails nicely once I get them positioned properly.  The opening seems narrower so I am finding it difficult sometimes to get the bottom up under the toenail to get a good grip on it to cut. The angled tip is different for me, too. I thought I would like this better than the traditional curved clippers but it does seem to take some getting used to. I think there may be a learning curve for those of us who are accustomed to the other kind. The big thing that is good about these clippers is that they seem to be very sturdy and I don&#x27;t think they will break. I also think that the way they&#x27;re made keeps me from cutting my toenails too short, something I&#x27;m frequently guilty of (and always regretful about.)</li>
            <li> Notice! &amp;#34;TOENAIL&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I like the shearing action of the clip, like scissors. Also fits decently in my medium sized hands, and includes a real emory board in the lever.</li>
            <li> Works very well, sharp and nail catcher works well.  Wide jaws make it easy for thicker toenails</li>
            <li> These are the best for cutting thick stubborn toe nails. Easy to use the big grips and put enough pressure to get the job done.</li>
            <li> did a good job and easy to grip</li>
            <li> These are simply a personal favorite of mine as a professional nail tech. This was the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen and they would be equally great for home use.</li>
            <li> it is hard to use and it does not cut very well unless you have very big nails. i don&#x27;t find it useful</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers ever!  The salon I go to uses them.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of thick toenails. I wish this clipper&#x27;s jaws opened wider.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail clippers!! I originally bought these at my job about 5 years ago, they have been missing for 6 months. I found that Amazon sold them and decided to buy two pair of them. They cut with ease and are easy to hold!!</li>
            <li> If you want a nail clipper with a catching, collecting, holding mechanism do NOT buy this one. The &amp;#34;angled&amp;#34; edge - that you can&#x27;t see in the pic- sticks out so far that if you clip a nail with it, the cut nail is not captured in the blue catching device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole reason I bought this was for the catching device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This catching device does not catch because the clipping mechanism sticks out of it too far.</li>
            <li> I know you get what you pay for.....but this product actually fell apart when i took it out the box.</li>
            <li> The clipper fell apart after using it only twice.  The \\&quot;connector\\&quot; that held the clipper together flew out, almost hitting me in the eye.  I put the \\&quot;connector\\&quot; back several times, but it was not working properly and kept popping out.  The last time that happened it flew down the drain of my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the manufacturer, Mehaz, at first this guy I spoke to asked me to send him the broken clipper at my own expense so the company could fix it.  Then I asked to speak with a supervisor.  The supervisor, named Marcia, acknowledged that the problem with the connector happens all the time and said that she would send me a couple of replacement after I email her the model and my mailing address.  After I emailed her, she reneged on her promise and lied by saying that she only offered to send me a couple of \\&quot;connectors\\&quot;.  I explained again that I&#x27;d already tried to put back the connector many times but it kept popping out.  She also tried to blame me for the damage, even though she admitted in our first conversation that the problem I&#x27;ve experienced \\&quot;happens all the time\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the product is worthless, and Mehaz&#x27; guarantee a joke.</li>
