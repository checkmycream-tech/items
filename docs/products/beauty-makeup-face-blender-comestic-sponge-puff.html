            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap and works so good.</li>
            <li>The sponge didn&#x27;t apply the foundation as well as I would&#x27;ve liked it to, most of the time I used my fingers to even it out.</li>
            <li>This blender works great the first couple of times you use it.</li>
            <li>However, it is better than most blenders that I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is a tool I have been waiting on the most.</li>
            <li>I love that, but I wish the bleeding egg would hurry up and get here already.</li>
            <li>I tried leaving more water in it</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the original beauty blender so BUY IT HERE for CHEAP.</li>
            <li>this product works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good quality and really affordable!</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knock off of the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>It is worth the price and does the trick just as well as the much more expense &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; brand name product.</li>
            <li>This is so useful!</li>
            <li>Love it so much I would encourage y&#x27;all to buy it!</li>
            <li>Gets the job done, not quite the same as a real one but works great for the price.</li>
            <li>The size of the product is very convenient while holding, and it it easy to work around the eyes with.</li>
            <li>The foundation doesn&#x27;t blend out right once this happens.</li>
            <li>First, I would like to say that this item arrived several weeks prior than the estimated date, which was great.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>def gonna be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste $15 more on the original.</li>
            <li>Super soft too.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot it really helps with the blending process.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>the material is really dense.</li>
            <li>If your looking for longevity, I&#x27;d just pay the actual $20 something for the original blender bulb</li>
            <li>For the low cost - it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it absorbed too much product, which I find wasteful, for that reason</li>
            <li>but its a cute little sponge.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s expected with an item that is that cheap in money.</li>
            <li>If you know of a very soft blending sponge, whether egg shaped or hour-glass shaped, please let me know.</li>
            <li>It makes it look smother and natural.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sponge Blender , and i still dont know what GOOD or BAD quality is</li>
            <li>Totally dupe for the high brand one.</li>
            <li>The sponge-like texture holds a lot of the foundation in and when later applying makeup you still have the old makeup still stuck inside.</li>
            <li>but I much prefer all the other possible methods.</li>

            <li> but I much prefer all the other possible methods.</li>
            <li> nothing too different, Its also very tiny, and it took so long to ship.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it won&#x27;t last for too long</li>
            <li> I wet the product, left it damp, and it still soaked up all of my foundation.</li>
            <li> I recommend this sponge to anyone with dry skin verses someone like me with somewhat oily skin.</li>
            <li> : I rated it a 3/5 because after my foundation i had to go back to the foundation brush and blush brush because i felt this did kinda less than expected... we shall see</li>
            <li> I tried to wet it</li>
            <li> This product got here before expected date</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t expand like the other blenders I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> also have a hard time washing it because it doesnt absorb water - it just seems to roll off the outside.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> Too firm.</li>
            <li> It was a complete fail.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I use everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely hard.</li>
            <li> This sucks up all your liquid foundation</li>
            <li> This is not a good dupe for beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Terrible, does my hold water and very dense and very hard to blend it make up, the sponge just absorbs it .</li>
            <li> It was all just completely useless.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> The sponge had an awful smell to it, it was hard to apply my makeup without holding my breath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This sponge is a terrible dupe.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received it and its a great way to put on your foundation.It makes it look smother and natural. love!</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that this item arrived several weeks prior than the estimated date, which was great. The size of the product is very convenient while holding, and it it easy to work around the eyes with. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it absorbed too much product, which I find wasteful, for that reason, I feel I can only give it 4 stars. However, it is better than most blenders that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot it really helps with the blending process. This is a tool I have been waiting on the most. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> nothing too different, Its also very tiny, and it took so long to ship. but its a cute little sponge.</li>
            <li> this product works pretty good. Only thing is it won&#x27;t last for too long but that&#x27;s expected with an item that is that cheap in money.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, not quite the same as a real one but works great for the price.Came in the mail on time also.</li>
            <li> This is so useful! I would use it for liquid foundation! Love it so much I would encourage y&#x27;all to buy it!</li>
            <li> Flawless blending. Super soft too. I&#x27;m def gonna be buying more in the future. Will recommend to friends. Thank u</li>
            <li> Terrible, does my hold water and very dense and very hard to blend it make up, the sponge just absorbs it .</li>
            <li> This is my first Sponge Blender , and i still dont know what GOOD or BAD quality is but How i determined my rating: I rated it a 3/5 because after my foundation i had to go back to the foundation brush and blush brush because i felt this did kinda less than expected... we shall see</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knock off of the beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;Its not the same quality foam, and is quite hard.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it to suck up a lot of product because it doesn&#x27;t get damp when you put it under water.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a hard time washing it because it doesnt absorb water - it just seems to roll off the outside.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even work. I tried to wet it and it didn&#x27;t do anything. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering it for a dollar lol</li>
            <li> It blends my foundation well. Totally dupe for the high brand one. It&#x27;s so cheap and works so good. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed. I haven&#x27;t even got my 3d blending egg yet. I already got my concealer tablet and I ordered it the same day. I love that, but I wish the bleeding egg would hurry up and get here already.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I use everyday! Good quality and really affordable!</li>
            <li> This blender works well.  It is worth the price and does the trick just as well as the much more expense &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; brand name product.</li>
            <li> This sponge is a terrible dupe. It doesn&#x27;t expand like the other blenders I&#x27;ve used. Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> This is not a good dupe for beauty blender. Too firm. If you know of a very soft blending sponge, whether egg shaped or hour-glass shaped, please let me know.</li>
            <li> The sponge had an awful smell to it, it was hard to apply my makeup without holding my breath. The sponge didn&#x27;t apply the foundation as well as I would&#x27;ve liked it to, most of the time I used my fingers to even it out. The sponge-like texture holds a lot of the foundation in and when later applying makeup you still have the old makeup still stuck inside. I recommend this sponge to anyone with dry skin verses someone like me with somewhat oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product got here before expected date and I was eager to use it. It was a complete fail. I wet the product, left it damp, and it still soaked up all of my foundation. -.- I tried leaving more water in it and it still sucked up my foundation. It&#x27;s also extremely hard. It was all just completely useless.</li>
            <li> This blender works great the first couple of times you use it. After a while it starts to get all funky with makeup or foundation. The foundation doesn&#x27;t blend out right once this happens. After you rinse and wash it, you basically are done with it. For the low cost - it&#x27;s not bad. If your looking for longevity, I&#x27;d just pay the actual $20 something for the original blender bulb</li>
            <li> This product arrived quicker than I thought but my only problem with it is cleaning it. Besides that it works amazing! Really gives me that flawless effortless finish!</li>
            <li> This makes no sense. Do not purchase. This sucks up all your liquid foundation whether or not you dampen it. Works somewhat with cream foundations but I much prefer all the other possible methods. I am sorry I bought this. the material is really dense. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the original beauty blender so BUY IT HERE for CHEAP. don&#x27;t waste $15 more on the original.</li>
