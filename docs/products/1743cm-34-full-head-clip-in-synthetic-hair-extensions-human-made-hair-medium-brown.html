            <li> Nice soft untangled hair for price and quality!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again</li>
            <li> I love how quick it was for the extensions to come, and I love just touching them, they look almost real. Holy cow! They are gorgeous. I&#x27;m not very thrilled with the color or the length of them, but other than that they are beautiful. I straightened them on low heat and they look fabulous. I deff recommend them üòç</li>
            <li> No complaints; It came exactly as advertised. It was longer than I needed it to be, so I trimmed it and it still looks great!</li>
            <li> Very good Quality !!i love it !thank you so much !!</li>

            <li> Very pretty but you would need at least two to look good.</li>
            <li> hair is thick and doesn&#x27;t shed. very inexpensive for the quality. hair comes curled and is easy to clip in,</li>
            <li> I loved these! theyre perfect. i ordered two different brands of extensions. i bought these and a remy one that was $40 and these extensions were by far the best ive ever had. theyre not thin and actually look better than in the picture. i loved them</li>
            <li> I love it. Looks prettier than the picture. I bought two!</li>
            <li> Its far more better than my expectations</li>
            <li> Holy! for the price this is the most fun, pretty realistic looking extension peice (and ive had both real, fake, clipin, and glue in). It snaps on really well. its really thick and the color matched pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a tiny bit shiny/plastic looking, but not so noticeable someone would say something. but seriously for less than $10! most real hair is over $100.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice piece especially for the price.  The quaility of the hair is really lovely and looks it like human hair. Very happy with these extensions.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t match what you would expect</li>
            <li> One clip was broken. The hair was fine, blends in with my hair</li>
            <li> For the price it is an excellent deal. I was worried how the color would match but I got the medium brown and it matches my hair perfectly. Everyone thats seen them says they look amazing and cant even tell their extensions. You get way more then what you pay for with three separate pieces I only use two and it gives my the full length and volume. Definitely will be buying more from this company! I ordered two other extensions from amazon and they were terrible these by far are the best ones I have received and I&#x27;m obessed. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Needed this for a play.  I did end up attaching some snap clips to the inside so I could have a ponytail look and it was great!  The hair is soft and looks real.  These are loose curls.  I have misted the hair with a spray bottle and twisted small pieces to get some extra curl.  This color matched by daughter&#x27;s hair perfectly and the color was as pictured (medium brown) so I appreciate that!!</li>
