            <li>Mom really did know best!</li>
            <li>My family finds it a handy product to have around.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was my desire to create my own go to product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for some nice anti-biotic cream, but instead got this powder, which for the life of me I thought would never stay on the wound.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as effective as hydrocortisone, peroxide or alcohol.  </li>
            <li>effective in road type burns.</li>
            <li>Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck.</li>
            <li>You have no idea how happy &amp; excited</li>
            <li>Have loved this product since I was young when my parents used it; have not been able to find it in stores for years so was very happy to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li>It is the most effective wound treatment I know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great antiseptic / first aid powder</li>
            <li>It is a great way to treat hot spots and &amp;#34;weepy&amp;#34; sores and is tolerated better by my son than aerosol or lotions.  </li>
            <li>Based on personal experience, BFI powder is an excellent antiseptic powder.</li>
            <li>THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A REVIEW SINCE I HAVEN&#x27;T PURCHASED THE PRODUCT YET.    </li>
            <li>and I still am extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have used this powder more than 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I have used this product on me, family, and pets without ever a problem.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the ointments and sprays.</li>
            <li>and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>It works like magic, healing in no time.  </li>
            <li>I am glad they still make it.</li>
            <li>If you have a rash, cut, bump, blemish, itch, or whatever, an application of this powder will make it all better.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I make sure I always have a container or two at home, because like magical fairy dust</li>
            <li>It is the best and only thing that can give relief to poison ivy.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>been guarding the last container like gold... soooo happy to have discovered it here anew!</li>
            <li>does anyone know for sure??  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to be able to find some.  </li>
            <li>It is one of those products that heals everything faster and better without leaving a scar.  </li>
            <li>boo\\&quot; powder that mom had and made all cuts and burns feel better, for generations.</li>
            <li>am most grateful for it, takes care of me.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad I found it on-line.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t intended at all for more severe injuries).</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not get it in the eyes as it will sting for sure.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to get this BFI powder for years.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for minor cuts and infections.</li>
            <li>A remarkable product that time and mega-drugstore chains have somehow forgotten which is a real shame and disservice from my perspective.</li>
            <li>Now I am glad it is available online.    </li>
            <li>Thankfully, it is now available on many web sites.</li>
            <li>I am glad that it is available online.</li>
            <li>This powder is a wonderful drying agent and has been a miracle cure for me whenever I have an itchy rash from insects, plants or unknown causes.</li>
            <li>title of my original review was \\&quot;There&#x27;s NOTHING better than this\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>If you want the best it does cost a little bit more.</li>
            <li>the smell is not quite as strong as before, but still knew what package was before opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First as kids in my parents house and then for my own kids.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Mine bought 35 years ago still works fine without the powder stuck in a clump.    </li>
            <li>The product is fine for what I bought it for-(to use for my dog who had an allergy  issue) and cover up the loss of coat he had and blend in with his coloring-that&#x27;s what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>Better than the creams because it drys out the cut quickly.  </li>
            <li>The formula and ingredients contained in this &#x27;wonder&#x27; powder is so effective I and my kids have used it for cuts, sun burn, skin rash and anything that needs new cells to grow and regenerate in healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>this powder is the best for any little wounds of the skin.</li>
            <li>I shook it on a few times a day and within a day or so the sore was healing - it worked great!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years  and have found it indispensable when it comes to healing I use it on myself and on my dogs when out hunting..</li>
            <li>I am that BFI is still being manufactured &amp; is available on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to run out of this fabulous antiseptic.</li>
            <li>If you want to try a great product please write the manufacturer and request that they put it back on the market!!</li>
            <li>BFI Powder was used on wounds during some of the old wars and with good results  </li>
            <li>I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The original package, \\&quot;BFI-Antiseptic First-Aid</li>
            <li>Okay, now cut to many many years later...</li>
            <li>The original retail price was 9.00$  </li>
            <li>original product (the one pictured here as of Sept 10,2010)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund.</li>
            <li>It is very effective for helping things dry out and heal, protect from infection and stop itching and irritation.  </li>
            <li>A great product on kids when they get those boboos from rough playing around.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, when I got married many years before she died, I never thought of buying BFI powder for our home since I had used it when l lived with my parents.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Helps heal quickly and prevent infection.</li>
            <li>This powder quickly heals and dries cuts and abrasions.  </li>
            <li>It came in a well packaged envelope and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>It is the best first aid OTC item I&#x27;ve ever used for healing small wounds.</li>
            <li>i recently cut myself numerous times (while putting up a barbed wire fence) and started looking for BFI powder, remembering what a great job it had done in my youth for my many cuts, abrasions and scratches.  </li>
            <li>mixed with other salves and herbs ,it makes a very good healing salve for most any thing on the skin.</li>
            <li>First dog to heal the quickest using this!</li>
            <li>I still remember the first time BFI Powder was used on me!  </li>
            <li>This purchase was a test to see if it is better than Dollar Tree body talc with salicylic acid that works fine even though salcylic acid is not supposed to be applied to an open wound.</li>
            <li>Thanks to you that it was available.</li>
            <li>I never used it since i thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work since it was more than 17 years old.</li>
            <li>Although there is no claim by the manufacture, I have found the BIF powder to work exceptionaly well on poison ivy and have loaned my powder to several neighbors who have now purchased their own supply.</li>
            <li>and I never found a substitute that worked worth a damn as a replacement for it.</li>
            <li>Just put this on and it makes it stop right away.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I will ask for a replacement with the REAL product or full refund and  paid return shipment and let you know how they handle this.    </li>
            <li>Great for drying out blisters, especially wet goopy craters that you get on your toes from dancing in pointe shoes!</li>
            <li>Great for small cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li>It dries up wounds quickly and promotes fast healing.  </li>
            <li>I used BFI Powder in the past and found it to be very effective to promote healing.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended !!</li>
            <li>First aid</li>
            <li>I first learned of BFI Powder years ago after visiting a cousin in Australia.</li>
            <li>Anything sold now is most likely expired</li>
            <li>It goes everywhere with us in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li>BFI Antiseptic First Aid powder&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned it and will now take into consider anything I buy from you to check out the cost of the produce first.</li>
            <li>;...... I did a search on Amazon, and sure enough, there it was......  </li>
            <li>I have it in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>It has compounds that reduce the pain and itch from most types of minor injuries.</li>
            <li>Wife and I love it for minor abrasions and cuts.  </li>
            <li>only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of five is the current difficulty in obtaining it for a fair and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it also brings back strong childhood memories of this&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;boo</li>
            <li>The new packaging contains the exact same ingredients and ratio as the original package!  </li>
            <li>BFI works faster and better than any other first aid product, and it reduces scarring as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very good antiseptic for normal healing, if you work in a dirty environment&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t get to clean out an injury.</li>
            <li>Make sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active ingredient.    </li>
            <li>sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my high school track coach.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me to find this after all these years.  </li>
            <li>The vendor is great and stands behind the product 100%</li>
            <li>I was amazed how fast the cut healed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real shame the manufacturer has discontinued making BFI powder.</li>
            <li>I remembered my mother using this, and within a few days, the brushburn was healing nicely.</li>
            <li>Nowadays he&#x27;s dealing with Type 2 diabetes, so whenever he gets a scrape or scratch on one of his legs--and no matter how minor the damage appears to be at first--without proper treatment, the wound can quickly become an inflamed, oozing, yucky-looking, more worrisome skin lesion that never develops a decent scab and is very prone to infection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products that were made specifically for canker sores, but nothing works at all in comparison to this.</li>
            <li>Clean the open cut and then put the powder on and just let it take in the liquid</li>
            <li>After all, it&#x27;s been used by people all over the world since first developed in Philadelphia in 1897.</li>
            <li>The powder aides the healing of cuts fast and nearly always does so without unsightly large scarring.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>(I teach High School Science).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it was something my mom used to use when I was little</li>
            <li>Sprinkling this on helped keep the wound dry, disinfected it at the surface, and really seemed to help reduce the pain fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The product came quite quickly, but when I used it the first time I realized that the container had a leak and puffs of the powder would shoot out when I put it down on the counter.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it is rarely found in pharmacies and needs to be ordered online which is ok as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good for any open wound, abraision, burn or broken blister that won&#x27;t dry up and</li>
            <li>However, I am concerned that the container does not say &amp;#34;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder.&amp;#34; as does my very old container.  </li>
            <li>One application - no more than two - a day makes your rash feel better if that&#x27;s your problem.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and was glad to have found it again.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>can compare all the inactive ingredients on the new packaging, and all the ones from the old label are still there-with no ingredient added or taken away.</li>
            <li>No spray, no tubed to break, no mess to wash off!</li>
            <li>Then I remembered gold old BFI powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product all of my life (I&#x27;m 68 years old)</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old now.  </li>
            <li>Will continue using in my adult years.</li>
            <li>I find the current price a bit much, however there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any alternative.</li>
            <li>My mother told me to get this antiseptic powder that she used to use on me and my siblings when we were young.</li>
            <li>I was about 7 or 8 years old and at a sort of day camp put on by the town where I lived.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now 75 years old.</li>
            <li>When I was a kid my folks used this for nearly EVERYTHING, but through the years I had forgotten this product.</li>
            <li>Because of a rash  that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of, ( old people&#x27;s thing )</li>
            <li>I completely switched to BFI with physicians orders standing from that day on.</li>
            <li>The small 1.25 oz size will last you for a good long time.</li>
            <li>&quot; the sore with the powder, which reduces the risk of infection and promotes the formation of a thick, healthy scab.  </li>
            <li>The list of ingredients appears to be different from the older packaging, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.  </li>
            <li>Within five days no more bleeding,no more throbbing,my open lesion is healing.</li>
            <li>Apparently my father&#x27;s dentist recommended it to him when he was young.</li>
            <li>The packaging is small and cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is possibly because I live in Canada and the source was in the USA, but no explanation was received.</li>
            <li>The new BFI container says &amp;#34;Soothing Protective Powder.&amp;#34;  I wrote to the distributor and was told it is the same thing. . . .</li>
            <li>The dried blood seals the cut, allowing the wound to heal quickly.    </li>
            <li>I can no longer obtain it from any of the major pharmacy chains in my area and it cost me over $40 when I bought it from the vendor on Amazon - even considering 40 years of inflation</li>
            <li>no problem, I thought, as I have ordered multiple canisters of BFI in the past, so surely this vendor is actually sending 4 canisters....</li>
            <li>We call it &amp;quot;magic powder&amp;quot; in my family - soothes, dries out scabs, and generally heals all.</li>
            <li>It has not been available in my area for some time, since the small locally owned drugstores have gone out of business.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this miraculous powder as a young rock climber back in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>abrasions and cuts that have gotten worse rather than better, with bandages and/or antibiotic ointments keeping them moist so they don&#x27;t heal.    </li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone with a wound that wont dry out fast enough.</li>
            <li>NO active ingredient and the INGREDIENT order is different: Boric Acid, Magnesium Carbonate, Talc, etc</li>
            <li>is a must for any first aid kit, and I keep a few of them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only that the changing legal requirements mandated by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) required the packaging to show ingredients in a different way than it was previously done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new package, \\&quot;BFI Soothing Protective Powder\\&quot; does not list an active ingredient, and all references to First-Aid have been removed.  </li>

            <li> Mom really did know best!</li>
            <li> My family finds it a handy product to have around.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was my desire to create my own go to product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for some nice anti-biotic cream, but instead got this powder, which for the life of me I thought would never stay on the wound.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as effective as hydrocortisone, peroxide or alcohol.  </li>
            <li> effective in road type burns.</li>
            <li> Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck.</li>
            <li> You have no idea how happy &amp; excited</li>
            <li> Have loved this product since I was young when my parents used it; have not been able to find it in stores for years so was very happy to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li> It is the most effective wound treatment I know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great antiseptic / first aid powder</li>
            <li> It is a great way to treat hot spots and &amp;#34;weepy&amp;#34; sores and is tolerated better by my son than aerosol or lotions.  </li>
            <li> Based on personal experience, BFI powder is an excellent antiseptic powder.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A REVIEW SINCE I HAVEN&#x27;T PURCHASED THE PRODUCT YET.    </li>
            <li> and I still am extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have used this powder more than 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have used this product on me, family, and pets without ever a problem.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the ointments and sprays.</li>
            <li> and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> It works like magic, healing in no time.  </li>
            <li> I am glad they still make it.</li>
            <li> If you have a rash, cut, bump, blemish, itch, or whatever, an application of this powder will make it all better.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I make sure I always have a container or two at home, because like magical fairy dust</li>
            <li> It is the best and only thing that can give relief to poison ivy.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> been guarding the last container like gold... soooo happy to have discovered it here anew!</li>
            <li> does anyone know for sure??  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to be able to find some.  </li>
            <li> It is one of those products that heals everything faster and better without leaving a scar.  </li>
            <li> boo\\&quot; powder that mom had and made all cuts and burns feel better, for generations.</li>
            <li> am most grateful for it, takes care of me.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m glad I found it on-line.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t intended at all for more severe injuries).</li>
            <li> Make sure you do not get it in the eyes as it will sting for sure.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to get this BFI powder for years.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for minor cuts and infections.</li>
            <li> A remarkable product that time and mega-drugstore chains have somehow forgotten which is a real shame and disservice from my perspective.</li>
            <li> Now I am glad it is available online.    </li>
            <li> Thankfully, it is now available on many web sites.</li>
            <li> I am glad that it is available online.</li>
            <li> This powder is a wonderful drying agent and has been a miracle cure for me whenever I have an itchy rash from insects, plants or unknown causes.</li>
            <li> title of my original review was \\&quot;There&#x27;s NOTHING better than this\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> If you want the best it does cost a little bit more.</li>
            <li> the smell is not quite as strong as before, but still knew what package was before opening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First as kids in my parents house and then for my own kids.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Mine bought 35 years ago still works fine without the powder stuck in a clump.    </li>
            <li> The product is fine for what I bought it for-(to use for my dog who had an allergy  issue) and cover up the loss of coat he had and blend in with his coloring-that&#x27;s what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> Better than the creams because it drys out the cut quickly.  </li>
            <li> The formula and ingredients contained in this &#x27;wonder&#x27; powder is so effective I and my kids have used it for cuts, sun burn, skin rash and anything that needs new cells to grow and regenerate in healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> this powder is the best for any little wounds of the skin.</li>
            <li> I shook it on a few times a day and within a day or so the sore was healing - it worked great!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years  and have found it indispensable when it comes to healing I use it on myself and on my dogs when out hunting..</li>
            <li> I am that BFI is still being manufactured &amp; is available on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to run out of this fabulous antiseptic.</li>
            <li> If you want to try a great product please write the manufacturer and request that they put it back on the market!!</li>
            <li> BFI Powder was used on wounds during some of the old wars and with good results  </li>
            <li> I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The original package, \\&quot;BFI-Antiseptic First-Aid</li>
            <li> Okay, now cut to many many years later...</li>
            <li> The original retail price was 9.00$  </li>
            <li> original product (the one pictured here as of Sept 10,2010)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund.</li>
            <li> It is very effective for helping things dry out and heal, protect from infection and stop itching and irritation.  </li>
            <li> A great product on kids when they get those boboos from rough playing around.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, when I got married many years before she died, I never thought of buying BFI powder for our home since I had used it when l lived with my parents.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Helps heal quickly and prevent infection.</li>
            <li> This powder quickly heals and dries cuts and abrasions.  </li>
            <li> It came in a well packaged envelope and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> It is the best first aid OTC item I&#x27;ve ever used for healing small wounds.</li>
            <li> i recently cut myself numerous times (while putting up a barbed wire fence) and started looking for BFI powder, remembering what a great job it had done in my youth for my many cuts, abrasions and scratches.  </li>
            <li> mixed with other salves and herbs ,it makes a very good healing salve for most any thing on the skin.</li>
            <li> First dog to heal the quickest using this!</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time BFI Powder was used on me!  </li>
            <li> This purchase was a test to see if it is better than Dollar Tree body talc with salicylic acid that works fine even though salcylic acid is not supposed to be applied to an open wound.</li>
            <li> Thanks to you that it was available.</li>
            <li> I never used it since i thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work since it was more than 17 years old.</li>
            <li> Although there is no claim by the manufacture, I have found the BIF powder to work exceptionaly well on poison ivy and have loaned my powder to several neighbors who have now purchased their own supply.</li>
            <li> and I never found a substitute that worked worth a damn as a replacement for it.</li>
            <li> Just put this on and it makes it stop right away.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I will ask for a replacement with the REAL product or full refund and  paid return shipment and let you know how they handle this.    </li>
            <li> Great for drying out blisters, especially wet goopy craters that you get on your toes from dancing in pointe shoes!</li>
            <li> Great for small cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li> It dries up wounds quickly and promotes fast healing.  </li>
            <li> I used BFI Powder in the past and found it to be very effective to promote healing.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended !!</li>
            <li> First aid</li>
            <li> I first learned of BFI Powder years ago after visiting a cousin in Australia.</li>
            <li> Anything sold now is most likely expired</li>
            <li> It goes everywhere with us in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> BFI Antiseptic First Aid powder&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned it and will now take into consider anything I buy from you to check out the cost of the produce first.</li>
            <li> ;...... I did a search on Amazon, and sure enough, there it was......  </li>
            <li> I have it in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> It has compounds that reduce the pain and itch from most types of minor injuries.</li>
            <li> Wife and I love it for minor abrasions and cuts.  </li>
            <li> only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of five is the current difficulty in obtaining it for a fair and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it also brings back strong childhood memories of this&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;boo</li>
            <li> The new packaging contains the exact same ingredients and ratio as the original package!  </li>
            <li> BFI works faster and better than any other first aid product, and it reduces scarring as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very good antiseptic for normal healing, if you work in a dirty environment&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t get to clean out an injury.</li>
            <li> Make sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active ingredient.    </li>
            <li> sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my high school track coach.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me to find this after all these years.  </li>
            <li> The vendor is great and stands behind the product 100%</li>
            <li> I was amazed how fast the cut healed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real shame the manufacturer has discontinued making BFI powder.</li>
            <li> I remembered my mother using this, and within a few days, the brushburn was healing nicely.</li>
            <li> Nowadays he&#x27;s dealing with Type 2 diabetes, so whenever he gets a scrape or scratch on one of his legs--and no matter how minor the damage appears to be at first--without proper treatment, the wound can quickly become an inflamed, oozing, yucky-looking, more worrisome skin lesion that never develops a decent scab and is very prone to infection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products that were made specifically for canker sores, but nothing works at all in comparison to this.</li>
            <li> Clean the open cut and then put the powder on and just let it take in the liquid</li>
            <li> After all, it&#x27;s been used by people all over the world since first developed in Philadelphia in 1897.</li>
            <li> The powder aides the healing of cuts fast and nearly always does so without unsightly large scarring.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> (I teach High School Science).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was something my mom used to use when I was little</li>
            <li> Sprinkling this on helped keep the wound dry, disinfected it at the surface, and really seemed to help reduce the pain fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The product came quite quickly, but when I used it the first time I realized that the container had a leak and puffs of the powder would shoot out when I put it down on the counter.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it is rarely found in pharmacies and needs to be ordered online which is ok as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good for any open wound, abraision, burn or broken blister that won&#x27;t dry up and</li>
            <li> However, I am concerned that the container does not say &amp;#34;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder.&amp;#34; as does my very old container.  </li>
            <li> One application - no more than two - a day makes your rash feel better if that&#x27;s your problem.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and was glad to have found it again.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> can compare all the inactive ingredients on the new packaging, and all the ones from the old label are still there-with no ingredient added or taken away.</li>
            <li> No spray, no tubed to break, no mess to wash off!</li>
            <li> Then I remembered gold old BFI powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all of my life (I&#x27;m 68 years old)</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old now.  </li>
            <li> Will continue using in my adult years.</li>
            <li> I find the current price a bit much, however there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any alternative.</li>
            <li> My mother told me to get this antiseptic powder that she used to use on me and my siblings when we were young.</li>
            <li> I was about 7 or 8 years old and at a sort of day camp put on by the town where I lived.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now 75 years old.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid my folks used this for nearly EVERYTHING, but through the years I had forgotten this product.</li>
            <li> Because of a rash  that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of, ( old people&#x27;s thing )</li>
            <li> I completely switched to BFI with physicians orders standing from that day on.</li>
            <li> The small 1.25 oz size will last you for a good long time.</li>
            <li> &quot; the sore with the powder, which reduces the risk of infection and promotes the formation of a thick, healthy scab.  </li>
            <li> The list of ingredients appears to be different from the older packaging, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.  </li>
            <li> Within five days no more bleeding,no more throbbing,my open lesion is healing.</li>
            <li> Apparently my father&#x27;s dentist recommended it to him when he was young.</li>
            <li> The packaging is small and cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is possibly because I live in Canada and the source was in the USA, but no explanation was received.</li>
            <li> The new BFI container says &amp;#34;Soothing Protective Powder.&amp;#34;  I wrote to the distributor and was told it is the same thing. . . .</li>
            <li> The dried blood seals the cut, allowing the wound to heal quickly.    </li>
            <li> I can no longer obtain it from any of the major pharmacy chains in my area and it cost me over $40 when I bought it from the vendor on Amazon - even considering 40 years of inflation</li>
            <li> no problem, I thought, as I have ordered multiple canisters of BFI in the past, so surely this vendor is actually sending 4 canisters....</li>
            <li> We call it &amp;quot;magic powder&amp;quot; in my family - soothes, dries out scabs, and generally heals all.</li>
            <li> It has not been available in my area for some time, since the small locally owned drugstores have gone out of business.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this miraculous powder as a young rock climber back in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> abrasions and cuts that have gotten worse rather than better, with bandages and/or antibiotic ointments keeping them moist so they don&#x27;t heal.    </li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with a wound that wont dry out fast enough.</li>
            <li> NO active ingredient and the INGREDIENT order is different: Boric Acid, Magnesium Carbonate, Talc, etc</li>
            <li> is a must for any first aid kit, and I keep a few of them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only that the changing legal requirements mandated by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) required the packaging to show ingredients in a different way than it was previously done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new package, \\&quot;BFI Soothing Protective Powder\\&quot; does not list an active ingredient, and all references to First-Aid have been removed.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this far surpasses all other products of the same ilk.  </li>
            <li> Less messy than ointments and dries the wound quickly.</li>
            <li> I hesitated as the orders were different and gave him tewo days and if not major improvement</li>
            <li> If you have ever has a small cut or scratch that was slow to get better, try this powder.</li>
            <li> , there are some very minor wording changes on package, some reorder of ingredients (but same ingredients different order</li>
            <li> Regular inspection of the wound, keeping it dry, and follow-up applications of BFI as needed will almost always guarantee faster healing and a smaller scar.</li>
            <li> It helps stop the seepage long enough to allow a scab to form.</li>
            <li> After I ran out of the powder, I started searching for it on the internet and finally found some for sale at a pet supply company (used on dogs ears after they are cropped) for crying out loud!</li>
            <li> Nothing would get my hands and shins back into climbing shape after being scraped or cut on a hard climb as fast as BFI</li>
            <li> The cream antibiotic or liquid antiseptics keep the cut open, while the BFI powder antiseptic keeps the wound dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I use to help dry up poison ivy, or any oozing skin problem.</li>
            <li> Helps dry up problem areas on the outside of the body.</li>
            <li> Apparently drugstores have replaced it with other products.  </li>
            <li> My mother swore by this stuff when I was a little girl and then, as an adult, I could no longer find it on the shelves.  </li>
            <li> Her wound didn&#x27;t need stitches, but we were a little concerned that it could get infected and the dog wouldn&#x27;t tolerate hydrogen peroxide or direct contact.</li>
            <li> The former active ingredient-\\&quot;Bismuth Formic Iodide\\&quot; is listed as the fourth ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> What I ordered was called Antiseptic \\&quot;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder For CUTS, Chafing and minor abrasions\\&quot; with the ingredients being:</li>
            <li> BFI powder has been around for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product has been around a long time.  </li>
            <li> instead is \\&quot;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder For CUTS, Chafing and minor abrasions\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He always applies hydrogen peroxide to the wound and surrounding tissue to cleanse it inside and out, using a cotton swab to clear away as much dead skin and other debris as possible.  </li>
            <li> recently ordered another container of BFI powder because I gave my other one to a friend who was visiting from Utah.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my Doberman puppy&#x27;s breeder to keep his cropped ears dry while posting them for standing erect.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you need to dry out a sore rather than put a salve on it, but you still want it to be antiseptic.  </li>
            <li> Use on injuries or problems where you need to have a dry</li>
            <li> I need something to dry out the wound, BFI  does that.  </li>
            <li> I use BFI for chafing, dry skin patches and just about any sink irritation.  </li>
            <li> Even though I no longer fall off my bike and skin my knees and elbows, I am active and do get the occasional cut or scrape.  </li>
            <li> It is not available from any of the major drug retailers, even online, so thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is getting harder to find and the price seems to be going up, but it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so even though the container is small, it will last me plenty long enough.</li>
            <li> Used it as a little girl and worked wonders on open wounds.  </li>
            <li> Wow, so I thought the price of almost $40 was ridiculous for 1 1/4 OZ canister of BFI, until I noticed further down that the shipping weight was 4.8 OZ -</li>
            <li> alot -- it is too bad that you don&#x27;t see it on store shelves any more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around forever but not available at the big chain pharmacies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I also, just sent one to my 93 year old father to use to stop occasional bleeding from thin skin and thinner blood.</li>
            <li> I had a particularly troublesome sore that had started as a small abrasion from a sandal strap and turned into a raw red erosion, and none of the usual antibiotic creams or a prescription one worked (and the doctor said it was not MRSA).  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times in the past</li>
            <li> Not to worry about the review that suggests that the BFI being sold here is not the same product as in the past.</li>
            <li> I had to search the internet to find it since I last bought it at a small drug store over 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for BFI powder in stores for years - we used for every cut and scrape as kids - even for hives and other rashes.  </li>
            <li> I still have containers (from 2 other interations).</li>
            <li> As a physical therapist with experience in in-patient &amp; out-patient settings I have recommended this product to past patients.</li>
            <li> + years later to speed healing and prevent infections for scrapes, small cuts, burns, and insect bites.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredient Bismuth-Formic-Iodine followed by Inactive Ingredients: Bismuth Subgallate, Boric Acid, etc    </li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT CONTAIN the active ingredient which is the antiseptic ingredient, instead it has:</li>
            <li> &quot;  Lists an active ingredient of \\&quot;Bismuth-formic-iodide 16%...</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT DOES NOT CONTAIN the active ingredient which is the antiseptic</li>
            <li> it really works when other remedies fail.</li>

            <li> It is hard to get locally, but it works wonders on a multitude of scrapes.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I was not able to find it in drugstore or pharmacies.</li>
            <li> When I get a wound healing seems to be delayed if I use the typical antibiotic creams that keeps it moist.  </li>
            <li> I was a diabetic and started have serious problems with open wounds on my feet.</li>
            <li> It had not healed in the previous month.</li>
            <li> Now, people are probably going to think I&#x27;m crazy, as every GF I&#x27;ve had has thought so at first, but this stuff works miracles for canker sores.</li>
            <li> BFI Powder works well to dry up and heal slow healing oozing sores and wounds.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle a little on an infection and it&#x27;s gone in hours.</li>
            <li> At that time it was in a little metal can.</li>
            <li> About 24 hours after applying the BFI powder it had dried up and was healing.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with messy ointments or creams anymore.  </li>
            <li> It helps to stop bleeding well.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it is not easy to find in a pharmacy, that is why I bought a few.</li>
            <li> She gave me a small container to use and keep after I cut myself.</li>
            <li> My mom used it on us when we were small.  </li>
            <li> Product came on time and was what I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure from what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was small</li>
            <li> Item has been hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for years, getting hard to find on the shelves, .don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, my bad.</li>
            <li> BUT-the shipper shipped it to me too LATE</li>
            <li> late he was still complaining</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for scrapes, burns, bites, rashes and cuts for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> My late father had always used this for everything.  </li>
            <li> One lousy little canister came...for $40?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> She had a burn on her arm that would not dry and heal (it looked awful).  </li>
            <li> It draws out some of the nasty stuff whilst killing the germs &amp; overall dries &amp; speeds healing.  </li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, from that point on, I was a convert, and still use it for any wound problems I have with my feet.</li>
            <li> I had fallen and had a nasty open wound.  </li>
            <li> So sad that it is no longer made and they charge outlandish prices for any that still remains.</li>
            <li> I have very poor circulation in this area and the scrape was not healing.</li>
            <li> The review that says the formula changed is wrong!  </li>
            <li> If you never tried it please do you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Very expensive $10 talcum powder.  </li>
            <li> I get a bad cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly shocked to find out</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the rapid healing.</li>
            <li> I was shocked ate rapidness of healing.  </li>
            <li> so it was not helpful because I did not get it in TIME! :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mom used this on my skinned knees and elbows 50 years ago.  We always had a metal shaker-can of it in the medicine cabinet.  Cut to 2009.....I&#x27;ve gotten misc. abrasions and cuts that have gotten worse rather than better, with bandages and/or antibiotic ointments keeping them moist so they don&#x27;t heal.    I had a particularly troublesome sore that had started as a small abrasion from a sandal strap and turned into a raw red erosion, and none of the usual antibiotic creams or a prescription one worked (and the doctor said it was not MRSA).  Then I remembered gold old BFI powder. I shook it on a few times a day and within a day or so the sore was healing - it worked great!  Even though I no longer fall off my bike and skin my knees and elbows, I am active and do get the occasional cut or scrape.  BFI is now my go-to solution for these.  Mom really did know best!</li>
            <li> My mother swore by this stuff when I was a little girl and then, as an adult, I could no longer find it on the shelves.  Was SO happy to find it through Amazon!  It&#x27;s amazing stuff and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get results.  One application - no more than two - a day makes your rash feel better if that&#x27;s your problem.  It&#x27;s also very good at promoting healing where that&#x27;s needed.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it for those &#x27;just in case...&#x27; times.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years  and have found it indispensable when it comes to healing I use it on myself and on my dogs when out hunting..</li>
            <li> BFI Powder was used on wounds during some of the old wars and with good results  My family finds it a handy product to have around.  Norman Clark  Usn Retired</li>
            <li> i recently cut myself numerous times (while putting up a barbed wire fence) and started looking for BFI powder, remembering what a great job it had done in my youth for my many cuts, abrasions and scratches.  having no luck at local supermarkets and pharmacies, i finally found it online and ordered it through amazon.  in my youth, it was in a metal shaker tin, whereas now it is in a cardboard shaker container.  BUT, the product still works great promoting rapid healing.  yes, i&#x27;m still working with barb wire, but now i heal faster with BFI powder back in the medicine chest.</li>
            <li> I have used the BFI powder antiseptic for 30 years.  For a long time, I was not able to find it in drugstore or pharmacies. Now I am glad it is available online.    This is the best antiseptic for cuts and wounds.      The cream antibiotic or liquid antiseptics keep the cut open, while the BFI powder antiseptic keeps the wound dry. The dried blood seals the cut, allowing the wound to heal quickly.    This thing will last 30 - 40 years on the shelf.  Mine bought 35 years ago still works fine without the powder stuck in a clump.    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Based on personal experience, BFI powder is an excellent antiseptic powder. However, the requested shipment of BFI was never received. This is possibly because I live in Canada and the source was in the USA, but no explanation was received. A refund was issued by Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband has used BFI to treat cuts and abrasions for 35 years, always with satisfactory results.  Nowadays he&#x27;s dealing with Type 2 diabetes, so whenever he gets a scrape or scratch on one of his legs--and no matter how minor the damage appears to be at first--without proper treatment, the wound can quickly become an inflamed, oozing, yucky-looking, more worrisome skin lesion that never develops a decent scab and is very prone to infection. He always applies hydrogen peroxide to the wound and surrounding tissue to cleanse it inside and out, using a cotton swab to clear away as much dead skin and other debris as possible.  Next, he sprinkles on enough BFI to \\&quot;pack\\&quot; the sore with the powder, which reduces the risk of infection and promotes the formation of a thick, healthy scab.  Regular inspection of the wound, keeping it dry, and follow-up applications of BFI as needed will almost always guarantee faster healing and a smaller scar.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A REVIEW SINCE I HAVEN&#x27;T PURCHASED THE PRODUCT YET.    You have no idea how happy &amp; excited I am that BFI is still being manufactured &amp; is available on Amazon.com. BFI was my mother&#x27;s go to for almost everything, cuts &amp; scrapes etc. When she died 17 years ago, I found the container in her medicine cabinet. I took it home as a memory &amp; each time I see it, I think of her. I never used it since i thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work since it was more than 17 years old. It&#x27;s funny, when I got married many years before she died, I never thought of buying BFI powder for our home since I had used it when l lived with my parents. Maybe it was my desire to create my own go to product. I guess mother knew best.</li>
            <li> What I ordered was called Antiseptic \\&quot;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder For CUTS, Chafing and minor abrasions\\&quot; with the ingredients being: Active Ingredient Bismuth-Formic-Iodine followed by Inactive Ingredients: Bismuth Subgallate, Boric Acid, etc    But what I received is not only called something else - \\&quot;Soothing, Protective PowdervHelps prevent chafing and irritation - Keeps skin drier\\&quot;    But also the ingredient list is also different!!    IT DOES NOT CONTAIN the active ingredient which is the antiseptic ingredient, instead it has: Boric Acid, Magnesium Carbonate, Talc, etc    What I got is just glorified talcum powder and has no antiseptic value perse.     Make sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active ingredient.    I will ask for a replacement with the REAL product or full refund and  paid return shipment and let you know how they handle this.    Angel      I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund.</li>
            <li> A great antiseptic powder. The only thing I use to help dry up poison ivy, or any oozing skin problem. It helps stop the seepage long enough to allow a scab to form.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my Doberman puppy&#x27;s breeder to keep his cropped ears dry while posting them for standing erect.  I&#x27;ve had good luck with it &amp; am very pleased with this product.  A little bit goes a long way so even though the container is small, it will last me plenty long enough.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times in the past and I still am extremely satisfied.  Although there is no claim by the manufacture, I have found the BIF powder to work exceptionaly well on poison ivy and have loaned my powder to several neighbors who have now purchased their own supply.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for what I bought it for-(to use for my dog who had an allergy  issue) and cover up the loss of coat he had and blend in with his coloring-that&#x27;s what I bought it for.  BUT-the shipper shipped it to me too LATE so it was not helpful because I did not get it in TIME! :(</li>
            <li> This is the best antiseptic on the market!  It&#x27;s been around forever but not available at the big chain pharmacies.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder more than 15 years ago.It has done miracles in my life.I still have the one that I bought.I search the web if it was still available,wow I found it.Thanks to you that it was available.</li>
            <li> No spray, no tubed to break, no mess to wash off! This stuff has been around 50+ years and is still great for cuts and skin scrapes. I use mine hiking and when traveling.</li>
            <li> Not to worry about the review that suggests that the BFI being sold here is not the same product as in the past. The ingredients and formulation is still the same. It&#x27;s only that the changing legal requirements mandated by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) required the packaging to show ingredients in a different way than it was previously done. Like many others, I have used this product on me, family, and pets without ever a problem. It is much better than the ointments and sprays. BFI works faster and better than any other first aid product, and it reduces scarring as well. After all, it&#x27;s been used by people all over the world since first developed in Philadelphia in 1897. The small 1.25 oz size will last you for a good long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product all of my life (I&#x27;m 68 years old) and it works like magic. Sprinkle a little on an infection and it&#x27;s gone in hours. Works every time!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition.  I bought this for my dog and it seems to work well and soothe his skin problems.</li>
            <li> Have loved this product since I was young when my parents used it; have not been able to find it in stores for years so was very happy to find it on-line.  Size is an excellent deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Now, people are probably going to think I&#x27;m crazy, as every GF I&#x27;ve had has thought so at first, but this stuff works miracles for canker sores. Apparently my father&#x27;s dentist recommended it to him when he was young. I&#x27;ve tried many other products that were made specifically for canker sores, but nothing works at all in comparison to this. Pack some powder on before bed for a night or two, and it won&#x27;t hurt anymore and will heal up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, it&#x27;s foot powder, but it works.</li>
            <li> My mother used this on us when we were children.  I am 62 years old now.  I cannot believe that I found this product on Amazon.com.  I told my sister about it and she ordered it also.  Years ago while camping with friends, their son got a fishing hook stuck in his finger.  After washing his finger, his father said \\&quot;get the BFI powder\\&quot;, and I almost couldn&#x27;t believe what I was hearing.  I said \\&quot;Oh my gosh, my mother use to use that for us\\&quot;.  He said that his mother did too and that he always kept a can at camp for accidents like this.  It is the best!! It&#x27;s a powder and it dries the wound and seals it.  It works like magic, healing in no time.  I will always keep this in my medicine cabinet and I even purchased one for my daughter in law.  Thanks for helping me to find this after all these years.  BFI antiseptic powder is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> My mother kept this on hand at all times !  I was pleasantly shocked to find out it is still made !!  Sometimes you need to dry out a sore rather than put a salve on it, but you still want it to be antiseptic.  This is the stuff !!  It draws out some of the nasty stuff whilst killing the germs &amp; overall dries &amp; speeds healing.  Can be used with or without a bandage over it.  HIGHLY recommended !!</li>
            <li> on 1/27 I was charged for this item, but it never came - and it isn&#x27;t in my order history.  BILLWA HM7AG3WDKA2 is on the charge.  I hope someday to find my printed order page...</li>
            <li> This powder has been around for many decades, and it is still the best powder for its purposes.  I am glad they still make it.</li>
            <li> If you have a rash, cut, bump, blemish, itch, or whatever, an application of this powder will make it all better.  It even works as a great heat rash prevention for under arms or wherever skin overlaps.</li>
            <li> I have used BFI Power for 40 years.  It works wonders.  Helps dry up problem areas on the outside of the body.</li>
            <li> It was great on an infected hammer toe.  It has a great drying agent that aids in healing. I will use it again!</li>
            <li> As a child it worked on all my cut wounds. Even if I had an infection. Why did they change the container to read &amp;#34;SOOTHING,PROTECTIVE POWDER&amp;#34; when it is the same?? FDA reg.?</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Excellent product - wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  My mom was a nurse before the days of antibiotics and this is what they used.  Especially good for scrapes and cuts the Greyhounds receive while running in the yard.  would NOT be without this product!  Have a container in just about every room of the house.</li>
            <li> The review that says the formula changed is wrong!  The new packaging contains the exact same ingredients and ratio as the original package!  (Call the manufacturer, the number is on the shaker.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original package, \\&quot;BFI-Antiseptic First-Aid Powder\\&quot;  Lists an active ingredient of \\&quot;Bismuth-formic-iodide 16%...First aid antiseptic\\&quot;  The inactive ingredients are listed alphabetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new package, \\&quot;BFI Soothing Protective Powder\\&quot; does not list an active ingredient, and all references to First-Aid have been removed.  The ingredients are listed in descending order of content.  The former active ingredient-\\&quot;Bismuth Formic Iodide\\&quot; is listed as the fourth ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can compare all the inactive ingredients on the new packaging, and all the ones from the old label are still there-with no ingredient added or taken away.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; on dogs. We use this all the time in our Bulldogs ears and between their toes. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used BFI powder for several decades and have recommended it to dozens of friends and students (I teach High School Science).  Everyone to whom I&#x27;ve suggested the use of BFI powder is now a believer. My grandfather was a doctor in World War II and they even used it back then!  It&#x27;s especially good for any open wound, abraision, burn or broken blister that won&#x27;t dry up and heal.&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered another container of BFI powder because I gave my other one to a friend who was visiting from Utah.  She had a burn on her arm that would not dry and heal (it looked awful).  About 24 hours after applying the BFI powder it had dried up and was healing.  She too is now a believer in this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;If you try it, you will want to thank that guy in Southern California who almost never takes time to write one of these reviews.  So I&#x27;ll just say in advance, You&#x27;re Welcome!</li>
            <li> BFI is excellent for stopping bleeding from any wound. I have used it for over 20 years. This medication should be in the medicine cabinet of all households.</li>
            <li> This is neither anti-fungal or antibiotic. The packaging is small and cheap.  Go elsewhere to find a good product.  Expensive.</li>
            <li> After I fell and scrapted up my knee, I used an antibiotic ointment for about 2 weeks. The brushburn still looked like it was infected and not healing. I remembered my mother using this, and within a few days, the brushburn was healing nicely.</li>
            <li> BFI was always in the medicine cabinet when I was growing up.  It has not been available in my area for some time, since the small locally owned drugstores have gone out of business.  Use on injuries or problems where you need to have a dry application(rather an ointment) for both people and pets. Helps heal quickly and prevent infection. A great product I won&#x27;t be without again!</li>
            <li> When I get a wound healing seems to be delayed if I use the typical antibiotic creams that keeps it moist.  I need something to dry out the wound, BFI  does that.  I like that it is an antiseptic.  This purchase was a test to see if it is better than Dollar Tree body talc with salicylic acid that works fine even though salcylic acid is not supposed to be applied to an open wound. This seems to be a good product except for the price.</li>
            <li> I first learned of BFI Powder years ago after visiting a cousin in Australia. She gave me a small container to use and keep after I cut myself. I was hoping for some nice anti-biotic cream, but instead got this powder, which for the life of me I thought would never stay on the wound. I took the container but did not use it at that time. Okay, now cut to many many years later...I was a diabetic and started have serious problems with open wounds on my feet. The podiatrists I was seeing tried everything they knew to heal what were basically holes on my heels. They gave me a powder that was supposed to stimulate skin growth. It didn&#x27;t work, but after running out of it on a weekend, I saw the BFI powder in my medicine cabinet, that had been gathering dust since my trip to Australia. I used it for a bit over a week, and when I next saw my doctor, he was amazed that my wounds looked like they had almost healed! After I ran out of the powder, I started searching for it on the internet and finally found some for sale at a pet supply company (used on dogs ears after they are cropped) for crying out loud! Needless to say, from that point on, I was a convert, and still use it for any wound problems I have with my feet. Thankfully, it is now available on many web sites. I make sure I always have a container or two at home, because like magical fairy dust it really works when other remedies fail.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended BFI when I was a child 60 years ago!!!  I am still using it for myself and my dogs.  This powder quickly heals and dries cuts and abrasions.  The list of ingredients appears to be different from the older packaging, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.  This BFI is as good as ever.  I keep several containers in my house at all times.  I don&#x27;t want to run out of this fabulous antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Great for drying out blisters, especially wet goopy craters that you get on your toes from dancing in pointe shoes! I used it like it were my neosporin, but in powder form. I recommend this for anyone with a wound that wont dry out fast enough.</li>
            <li> Replace your deodorant with this. No smell at all! Get away from putting aluminum in your body and getting Alzheimer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My dad used to use this on his feet to  prevent athletes foot, on cuts, rashes, insect bites, etc.  It is very effective for helping things dry out and heal, protect from infection and stop itching and irritation.  I think that they gave it to him in the army during WWII.  I like it alot -- it is too bad that you don&#x27;t see it on store shelves any more. I am glad that it is available online.</li>
            <li> I call it my itching powder. It is the best and only thing that can give relief to poison ivy.  While watching the fireworks on 4th of July my son-in-law &amp; I  received several bits and hours late he was still complaining but I wasn&#x27;t because I had used BFI.  I use BFI for chafing, dry skin patches and just about any sink irritation.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Received this powder today.  Used it as a little girl and worked wonders on open wounds.  I bought it because it always worked in healing my open sores and blemishes.  Will continue using in my adult years.</li>
            <li> Have had experience since the 1950&#x27;s with this product. The powder aides the healing of cuts fast and nearly always does so without unsightly large scarring.Would not be without it in our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> BFI POWDER DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER Numark Laboratories&lt;br /&gt;There is no substitute manufactured. The original retail price was 9.00$  Anything sold now is most likely expired</li>
            <li> they sent me a different product, they picture what I ordered but sent a different product explaining that the supplier made a change. I don&#x27;t want what they sent so I&#x27;m not happy. this could not happen in a physical store</li>
            <li> I have used BFI Powder since 1970 and thought that it was currently unavailable until I found it on Amazon.com  Thank you for carrying it and I will order it again, as needed.</li>
            <li> BFI powder has been around for a long time. It is hard to get locally, but it works wonders on a multitude of scrapes.</li>
            <li> I have been treating wounds with Bismuth Formic Iodide, BFI for 57 years. It is the most effective wound treatment I know. Even my doctor thought so. I love the product. HOWEVER... $41. 95 is an outlandish price. 2 yrs ago, I bought it for $9.00 Amazon Prime. I bought 3 containers but gave 2 away. Wish I had kept them.</li>
            <li> A very effective product. Less messy than ointments and dries the wound quickly. It came in a well packaged envelope and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This product has been around a long time.  My mom used it on us when we were small.  It is the best stuff for scrapes, cuts, etc.  It lasts a very long time.  I had to search the internet to find it since I last bought it at a small drug store over 10 years ago.  Glad to find it at Amazon.  It goes everywhere with us in our first aid kit.</li>
            <li> (I am Jack&#x27;s wife.) I used BFI Powder in the past and found it to be very effective to promote healing. It is difficult to find any more. I had a scrape over an area above my ankle. I have very poor circulation in this area and the scrape was not healing. I read another review somewhere on the Internet by a person who said that his doctor recommended BFI Powder for a similar situation, and that his problem healed in 4 days after using BFI Powder. My scraped area healed in about a week after using BFI Powder. It had not healed in the previous month. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I read all the uses and have only tried it on my dogs ears after an ear crop. First dog to heal the quickest using this! I&#x27;m sold on it and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> mixed with other salves and herbs ,it makes a very good healing salve for most any thing on the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find BFI powder in local stores.  It&#x27;s great antiseptic / first aid powder</li>
            <li> UPDATE AFTER PURCHASE: PLEASE READ !!!  THIS IS *NOT* WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!!!&lt;br /&gt;The title of my original review was \\&quot;There&#x27;s NOTHING better than this\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And it read \\&quot;I have used this for years... First as kids in my parents house and then for my own kids.&lt;br /&gt;Have been guarding the last container like gold... soooo happy to have discovered it here anew! etc etc \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I even ordered not one but SIX bottles of the stuff from American Wholesaler, Brooklyn, NY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER when I received it IT WASN&#x27;T THE SAME PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container IS SIMILAR BUT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received is labelled \\&quot;Soothing, Protective Powder Helps prevent chafing and irritation - Keeps skin drier\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original product (the one pictured here as of Sept 10,2010) instead is \\&quot;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder For CUTS, Chafing and minor abrasions\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was just the label, who cares... but the ingredient list is also different!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT CONTAIN the active ingredient which is the antiseptic ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient Bismuth-Formic-Iodine followed by Inactive Ingredients: Bismuth Subgallate, Boric Acid, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New One (the one on this listing)&lt;br /&gt;Has NO active ingredient and the INGREDIENT order is different: Boric Acid, Magnesium Carbonate, Talc, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff as listed is a fancy talcum powder like Goldbond, not the wonderful product we all remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet.  However, I am concerned that the container does not say &amp;#34;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder.&amp;#34; as does my very old container.  The new BFI container says &amp;#34;Soothing Protective Powder.&amp;#34;  I wrote to the distributor and was told it is the same thing. . . . does anyone know for sure??  It used to stop bleeding on cuts.</li>
            <li> The product came quite quickly, but when I used it the first time I realized that the container had a leak and puffs of the powder would shoot out when I put it down on the counter.  I have had to put it in an airtight plastic bag in hopes that it doesn&#x27;t get damaged from humidity.</li>
            <li> BFI Antiseptic First Aid powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;found this local at a tramenous cheeper price. I returned it and will now take into consider anything I buy from you to check out the cost of the produce first.</li>
            <li> Missing one ingredient (Amol (mono-n-amyl hydroquinone ether))from the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; but I am happy to have it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver for me. I use it anytime I get a bad cut.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must for any first aid kit, and I keep a few of them around!&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good antiseptic for normal healing, if you work in a dirty environment&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t get to clean out an injury. It helps to stop bleeding well.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it is not easy to find in a pharmacy, that is why I bought a few.</li>
            <li> Worked 50 years ago...Works now. Great product with good healing results and some clotting ability as well.. . . .</li>
            <li> My name is Louis S Bake</li>
            <li> Very expensive $10 talcum powder.  The Amazon picture of the product says BFI Antiseptic First-Aid Powder.  The actual product graphic says nothing about antiseptic.  It is labeled \\&quot;BFI Soothing Protective Powder\\&quot;.  INDICATIONS Helps soothe and protect chafing and irritation.  It is to much trouble to return it for credit.  Next time I will buy a generic powder at Wal-Mart instead.</li>
            <li> BFI Powder works well to dry up and heal slow healing oozing sores and wounds. I&#x27;ve used this product since childhood and I am very happy with it as it works for me when nothing else seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of five is the current difficulty in obtaining it for a fair and reasonable price. When I graduated from college close to 40 years ago the 1.25 oz container could be bought at your local pharmacy for a couple of bucks. I can no longer obtain it from any of the major pharmacy chains in my area and it cost me over $40 when I bought it from the vendor on Amazon - even considering 40 years of inflation I find the current price a bit much, however there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any alternative.</li>
            <li> Used to use before when I was younger and I&#x27;m happy to report it still works GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for BFI powder in stores for years - we used for every cut and scrape as kids - even for hives and other rashes.  And, I used it for years on my dog&#x27;s skin irritations.  Then it seemed to disappear for a number of years, and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I&#x27;m so glad to be able to find some.  We call it &amp;quot;magic powder&amp;quot; in my family - soothes, dries out scabs, and generally heals all.</li>
            <li> This product works great for man or beast.  We have animals and I use it on their boo-boos as well.  It has compounds that reduce the pain and itch from most types of minor injuries.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for scrapes, burns, bites, rashes and cuts for at least 20 years.  It is one of those products that heals everything faster and better without leaving a scar.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I do not remember paying $75.00 for this product.  It is outrageous</li>
            <li> This product is getting harder to find and the price seems to be going up, but it lasts a long time.  It is a great way to treat hot spots and &amp;#34;weepy&amp;#34; sores and is tolerated better by my son than aerosol or lotions.  It seem to help control and prevent yeast type infections in skin folds.</li>
            <li> Here is my story.I was working in my garage and cut myself on my ankle,long story short it got infected and had to take antibiotics for two weeks.For seven weeks I was using prescription antibiotic ointments on my lesion that never healed.My mother told me to get this antiseptic powder that she used to use on me and my siblings when we were young.I got the BFI powder and within 3 days of using it a scab formed. Within five days no more bleeding,no more throbbing,my open lesion is healing.I wish I remembered this product two months ago!It works that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I don&#x27;t bother with messy ointments or creams anymore.  This stuff is just as effective as hydrocortisone, peroxide or alcohol.  Burns, rashes, cuts, scrapes, insect bites, etc. - this powder takes care of it all!</li>
            <li> The product does what it claims.  Wife and I love it for minor abrasions and cuts.  Heals a lot faster.  The vendor is great and stands behind the product 100%</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time BFI Powder was used on me!  I was about 7 or 8 years old and at a sort of day camp put on by the town where I lived.  I had fallen and had a nasty open wound.  The counselors wanted to  put BFI Powder on me and I freaked out because I just &amp;#34;KNEW&amp;#34; it was going to hurt.  The counselors prevailed, and to my surprise, there was no pain at all.  I&#x27;ve used it all my life and I&#x27;m now 75 years old.</li>
            <li> Great! Wish they would keep making this product. We have used it all our lives.</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing if you can&#x27;t stop bleeding.  Just put this on and it makes it stop right away.  I always keep it in the house for emergencies....</li>
            <li> thought I already reviewed this product. I had been looking for this for years. I actually contacted Smith Kline beecham years ago and learned in had been discontinued. I still have containers (from 2 other interations). others reviewers have talked about changes in product, packaging, and ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you as fact (and provide pictures), there are some very minor wording changes on package, some reorder of ingredients (but same ingredients different order and I assume quantity) and different distributor. the smell is not quite as strong as before, but still knew what package was before opening.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S THE SAME. IT&#x27;S AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;it also brings back strong childhood memories of this&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;boo boo\\&quot; powder that mom had and made all cuts and burns feel better, for generations.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and was glad to have found it again.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective in road type burns.</li>
            <li> I came across this by accident.  My in-laws gave some to my daughter and I happened to see it in the cabinet one day after I cut myself.  I put some on the cut and covered with a cloth bandage.  I was amazed how fast the cut healed.  Use this in place of that greasy Triple antibiotic stuff and see the difference!</li>
            <li> Item has been hard to find.  I find it a good product to use on my dog, if it has a cut.  Product came on time and was what I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid my folks used this for nearly EVERYTHING, but through the years I had forgotten this product. Because of a rash  that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of, ( old people&#x27;s thing ) HA!  I remembered Mom&#x27;s &amp;#34; CURE ALL&amp;#34;...... I did a search on Amazon, and sure enough, there it was......  I used it on the rash, and lo and behold, after two uses it is gone....... I will keep my BFI on hand and recommend it to anyone that will listen......... &amp;#34;THANKS for the Memories&amp;#34; and a GREAT product......</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for minor cuts and infections. It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real shame the manufacturer has discontinued making BFI powder. It is the best first aid OTC item I&#x27;ve ever used for healing small wounds. As a physical therapist with experience in in-patient &amp; out-patient settings I have recommended this product to past patients. If you want to try a great product please write the manufacturer and request that they put it back on the market!! ( Numark Laboratories Inc )</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my high school track coach.  We used it to help blisters heal faster and for cuts and scrapes to prevent infections.  My family still uses it 40+ years later to speed healing and prevent infections for scrapes, small cuts, burns, and insect bites. This is the same product now as then; does not need to be &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;. I would buy this product again and again.  It is not available from any of the major drug retailers, even online, so thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, getting hard to find on the shelves, .don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find,&lt;br /&gt;I am most grateful for it, takes care of me. recommend it for all</li>
            <li> Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck. Not sure from what. This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder. I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI. At that time it was in a little metal can. Anyway  I use them both and they worked great. Just can&#x27;t say which one works best. They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid.</li>
            <li> My great-grandma &amp; grandma always used it. Works great!!  It&#x27;s very hard to find &amp; I&#x27;m glad I found it on-line.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t found this product in years. Decided to look at Amazon and found it. Its good stuff. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> received in great condition thank you</li>
            <li> This works so well - it did wonders in reducing the pain and protecting a surface wound after our dog got in a scuffle (note: this isn&#x27;t intended at all for more severe injuries). Her wound didn&#x27;t need stitches, but we were a little concerned that it could get infected and the dog wouldn&#x27;t tolerate hydrogen peroxide or direct contact. Sprinkling this on helped keep the wound dry, disinfected it at the surface, and really seemed to help reduce the pain fairly quickly. Our relatives swear by it, and I now see why. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This powder is a wonderful drying agent and has been a miracle cure for me whenever I have an itchy rash from insects, plants or unknown causes.</li>
            <li> Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;How can anyone not have on of these in their medicine cabinet?  Great for small cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it was something my mom used to use when I was little and I found it works on my kid just as it did on myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was small it works wonders. If you never tried it please do you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this is stores anymore, so finding it online is GREAT!!  My father loves BFI, so I purchase it for him.</li>
            <li> I discovered this miraculous powder as a young rock climber back in the 1970&#x27;s. Nothing would get my hands and shins back into climbing shape after being scraped or cut on a hard climb as fast as BFI and I never found a substitute that worked worth a damn as a replacement for it. I&#x27;m still climbing solid and have used the product religiously for just short of forty years to keep me on rock as much as possible. I also, just sent one to my 93 year old father to use to stop occasional bleeding from thin skin and thinner blood. A remarkable product that time and mega-drugstore chains have somehow forgotten which is a real shame and disservice from my perspective.</li>
            <li> AS a nurse I met WW II veteran who asked me to use BFI on his wound.  I hesitated as the orders were different and gave him tewo days and if not major improvement I would change the treatment.  I was shocked at the rapid healing. BEgan experimenting with hospice patients, doing half the wounds with BFI and as ordered on the other.  I was shocked ate rapidness of healing.  I completely switched to BFI with physicians orders standing from that day on. It worked miracles with deep wounds.  One patient with deep abscess from melanoma shots, i used it and the pts physician called me to find out what I was using!!!  The results was amazing!!! LINDA D. R.N.</li>
            <li> My late father had always used this for everything.  ( It was given during WW11).  I had been looking for this for over 20 years, off and on, and had just about given up, when I finally found it!!  This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Wow, so I thought the price of almost $40 was ridiculous for 1 1/4 OZ canister of BFI, until I noticed further down that the shipping weight was 4.8 OZ - no problem, I thought, as I have ordered multiple canisters of BFI in the past, so surely this vendor is actually sending 4 canisters....right? Wow, my bad. One lousy little canister came...for $40? That&#x27;s a total ripoff. Do Not Buy!!</li>
            <li> My Mother used BFI powder on us when we were kids and it has always had a place in the medicine cabinet.  Clean the open cut and then put the powder on and just let it take in the liquid and it will form a scab within an hour.  I am still using it 65 years later.  Better than the creams because it drys out the cut quickly.  I have never had an infection using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using BFI for lst 20 years and is a very good product. It heals all the wounds.</li>
            <li> If you have ever has a small cut or scratch that was slow to get better, try this powder. You will see results in one use. I have it in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I received a different product called &amp;#34;Soothing Protective Powder&amp;#34;.  NOT the &amp;#34;Antiseptic First-Aid Powder&amp;#34; that was in the listing photo.</li>
            <li> AMAZING healing powder. So sad that it is no longer made and they charge outlandish prices for any that still remains.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product about 30 years ago when it was recommended to me by a medical doctor.  The formula and ingredients contained in this &#x27;wonder&#x27; powder is so effective I and my kids have used it for cuts, sun burn, skin rash and anything that needs new cells to grow and regenerate in healthy skin.  The only complaint I have is that it is rarely found in pharmacies and needs to be ordered online which is ok as long as it is available.  A great product on kids when they get those boboos from rough playing around.  Make sure you do not get it in the eyes as it will sting for sure.  Combined with DESETIN (the cream for diaper burn) this powder is the best for any little wounds of the skin.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff as a kid. Heals anything (:</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this.</li>
            <li> If you want the best it does cost a little bit more.</li>
            <li> This is the best antibiotic powder I have ever used!  It dries up wounds quickly and promotes fast healing.  I will never be without it!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to get this BFI powder for years.  Apparently drugstores have replaced it with other products.  In my opinion, this far surpasses all other products of the same ilk.  You can always count on Amazon to deliver what others can&#x27;t.</li>
