    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>It smells lemony (not chemical-y) and does an excellent job!</li>
            <li>and they work great</li>
            <li>Pleasant grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>Good remover,</li>
            <li>This is a good product but you may receive a bottle that does not work.</li>
            <li>Takes the glue right off and  works great.  </li>
            <li>it hurts when it contact eyes, but rinse with water and everything is ok.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many brand</li>
            <li>just wish that the labeling was more detailed thou</li>
            <li>Works fast and good.</li>
            <li>I just let the glue sit for a bit and the lashes slide right off  easy and effective</li>
            <li>Do not buy, unless you absolutely enjoy the feeling of your eyeballs on fire.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean up my stone I use to apply adhesive to faux lashes.</li>
            <li>Overall good</li>
            <li>, just so i can be more informative with clients on  the product thanks</li>
            <li>Not as strong as other pro brands but a good price.</li>
            <li>I have been self applying for years,but this glue has such strong fumes that I can not do more than one lash without tearing profusely.</li>
            <li>The lash then slid right off.</li>
            <li>Worked FAST!</li>
            <li>It works well for lightly weakening the glue on lashes to remove them early, as well.</li>
            <li>We first received the Glue Remover (Gel Type) with some U+ glue we purchased.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to remove their eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>I have never been in so much pain in my life.</li>
            <li>I had to really put a lot on and let it stay on for awhile.</li>
            <li>but when we received the new bottle of remover it was like water and did not remove glue like the first bottle received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s bleach, gasoline, cat claws and lemon juice.  </li>
            <li>Some needed to soak longer than others, but I was false individual eyelash free!!</li>
            <li>Sone complained about their eyes burning, i was fine.</li>
            <li>so be careful  and have a fan ready.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother my eyes and did remove extensively amounts of glue from a hot mess of semi- permanent eyelashes.</li>

            <li> still don\\&quot;t know how to use or how to apply or how long to leave it on.</li>
            <li> This product removes the glue in a short period of time, it is a little fumes</li>
            <li> I let it stay for about 60-90seconds and carefully pulled</li>
            <li> bothered using any other remover</li>
            <li> I had no problem with stinging since I was very careful not to get it in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this remover, just have to be careful that u don&#x27;t get it in your eye because it will burn bad</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on getting off all of the eyelashes and glue, but it seems impossible not getting any in your eye.</li>
            <li> Apply a small amount with a qtip and within a minute, the extensions fall off.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tedious work but it can be done.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit difficult to remove the lashes with the glue.  </li>
            <li> I guess I bought the wrong glue since I self-apply.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> I did not get that product.</li>
            <li> Buy this and you won&#x27;t need to hire someone to remove your eyelash extensions. Apply a small amount with a qtip and within a minute, the extensions fall off. Just don&#x27;t allow the gel to slip inside your eyelid.</li>
            <li> no instructions with it . still don\\&quot;t know how to use or how to apply or how long to leave it on.</li>
            <li> This product removes the glue in a short period of time, it is a little fumes so be careful  and have a fan ready.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.  It took forever to remove it. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this gel again.  Maybe u get wat u pay for..</li>
            <li> I used this to remove a couple dozen straggling lash extensions. I had no problem with stinging since I was very careful not to get it in my eyes. I used a magnifying mirror and two microbrushes each coated with the remover. I positioned the brushes on both sides of the lash, upper and lower, and held it there for about 10-15 seconds. The lash then slid right off. It took me about 20 minutes to remove all of them. It&#x27;s tedious work but it can be done.</li>
            <li> I really like this remover, just have to be careful that u don&#x27;t get it in your eye because it will burn bad</li>
            <li> This remover got my eyelashes off without any issues. Sone complained about their eyes burning, i was fine. Overall good</li>
            <li> Worked FAST! Pleasant grapefruit scent. It Does sting but all removers do. Excellent product. I would def recommend this product</li>
            <li> Takes the glue right off and  works great.  It&#x27;s citrus scented, and not fumy at all, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to remove their eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that would remove my eyelashes. Oil, Vaseline, NOTHING would work except this. I let it stay for about 60-90seconds and carefully pulled and they came off. Some needed to soak longer than others, but I was false individual eyelash free!!</li>
            <li> This eyelash remover works. It didn&#x27;t bother my eyes and did remove extensively amounts of glue from a hot mess of semi- permanent eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product burn when I tried to use it.  I even dissolves the nail polish on my hand when I tried to apply it and it didnt even work to remove my eyelashes. Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I use this to clean up my stone I use to apply adhesive to faux lashes. It smells lemony (not chemical-y) and does an excellent job! It works well for lightly weakening the glue on lashes to remove them early, as well. Doesn&#x27;t sting eyes or skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious...don&#x27;t use it!  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s bleach, gasoline, cat claws and lemon juice.  I have never been in so much pain in my life.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on getting off all of the eyelashes and glue, but it seems impossible not getting any in your eye. It stings like hell and the pain made my body shake and eyes water. Plus, you don&#x27;t know what is actually in this product but it smells like grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Good remover, yeah it hurts when it contact eyes, but rinse with water and everything is ok. Works fast and good. Smells like orange juice, i like!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit difficult to remove the lashes with the glue.  I had to really put a lot on and let it stay on for awhile.</li>
            <li> We first received the Glue Remover (Gel Type) with some U+ glue we purchased. It worked so well that we purchased another bottle but when we received the new bottle of remover it was like water and did not remove glue like the first bottle received. We tried to shake the bottle to see if this improved the result but it did not. This is a good product but you may receive a bottle that does not work.</li>
            <li> I just let the glue sit for a bit and the lashes slide right off  easy and effective&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t bothered using any other remover</li>
            <li> I guess I bought the wrong glue since I self-apply.  I have been self applying for years,but this glue has such strong fumes that I can not do more than one lash without tearing profusely.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, unless you absolutely enjoy the feeling of your eyeballs on fire. Terrible product, unknown ingredients, and not the best customer service.</li>
            <li> just bought 2 and they work great just wish that the labeling was more detailed thou, just so i can be more informative with clients on  the product thanks</li>
            <li> Works well enough. I haven&#x27;t used many brand but this seems to get the job done. Not as strong as other pro brands but a good price. Eats away a bit at the micro swabs since extra rubbing us needed.</li>
            <li> I recommend a reseller</li>
