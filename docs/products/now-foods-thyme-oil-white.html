    <ol>
            <li>Happy, just what I wanted!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s growing in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Works great in my homemade products!</li>

            <li>I have been impressed with the product.</li>
            <li>Very good quality oil.</li>
            <li>Good product well priced!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend teases me and says I smell like fried plantains (lol).</li>
            <li>I bought this to use in a fly repelling spray, but I&#x27;m still working on it.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>and these are great.</li>
            <li>It is a great healer.</li>
            <li>Great to cook with</li>
            <li>taste great</li>
            <li>Item was as described, great deal for the price, and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it here and at a good price.</li>
            <li>You can throw a bit of sulfur in there for good measure.</li>
            <li>Good oil.</li>
            <li>a good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good for the price.  </li>
            <li>This company is good for quality and price.</li>
            <li>They are already looking better!</li>
            <li>The product is probably really great, but I had no idea it was so strong and that I had to mix it with olive oil or something else to use it.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy again, but honestly it will take me like 12 years to use what I&#x27;ve got one drop at a time.</li>
            <li>Try it, and good luck :)</li>
            <li>So even if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for flies, and makes no difference on my toenail, I think it&#x27;s nice to have around.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with thyme oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it to make my own disinfecting spray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cinnamon oil has been a good deterrent for chewing her leashes, but it smells strong and can burn.</li>
            <li>This has a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Also the scent is very strong so it might not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>Very fast service too, good packaging, all good.</li>
            <li>This is strong stuff!</li>
            <li>This was the exact product I needed and it was a great value.</li>
            <li>Great scent and good for general use.  </li>
            <li>Nice strong scent.</li>
            <li>Product is great, but I really wish it would come with an eyedropper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually more of a minty herb tea smell.</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I use this to mix essential oils and it went perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent in my products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it, along with Eucalyptus Oil, to make an anti-bacterial mouthwash which has worked better than I could have hoped.  </li>
            <li>Love all these oils on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My favorite place for making orders.</li>
            <li>i even bought more</li>
            <li>Nail filing by a podiatrist temporarily relieved buildup, nothing more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried their other products and I think they&#x27;re good quality, I think this is good quality, I just did not fancy the smell!</li>
            <li>Beautiful oil, clean and pure</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell because I love earthy scents.</li>
            <li>Smells strong Product</li>
            <li>I was reading online that Thyme Oil is pretty effective treatment</li>
            <li>Extra stars for Amazon&#x27;s great packaging.</li>
            <li>so I can mix it and then clean the bottle up and use it easily.</li>
            <li>This quality product has been useful in many cleaning agents and projects and has a pleasing smell too.</li>
            <li>Good price and a reputable company to purchase essential oils from.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, high quality as all NOW Essential Oils</li>
            <li>:) Thanks for having on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love NOW Foods EO&#x27;s and will certainly be ordering again when I need it.  </li>
            <li>Good news is, the scent only lasts for 8-10 hours before it fades - hence why I put it on at night.</li>
            <li>Another really good essential oil from Now Foods.  </li>
            <li>Yes, your feet will smell like thyme, but I personally think it&#x27;s a good smell.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty strong smelling, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li>House guests always comment on how clean and fresh</li>
            <li>It should most definitely come with a squeeze dropper top for ease of use.</li>
            <li>This stuff really smells strong</li>
            <li>These essential oils + carrier oils are an amazing cocktail for stimulating hair growth.</li>
            <li>Thyme oil is gentle and I think I&#x27;d feel comfortable using it every day until she stops going for my extremities.</li>
            <li>Thyme oil is so useful that I need to order it in a 1 ounce bottle</li>
            <li>I have success with rosemary oil, but just for the hell of it, I put this stuff on my toes for my (almost gone) nail</li>
            <li>I dip a Q-tip in the oil and apply it directly on my nail, making sure to get into the cuticle and under the nail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of white thyme itself, but it is an effective antiviral/antibacterial cleaning agent.</li>
            <li>This oil is pure and clean, so it can be used for aromatherapy purposes as well.</li>
            <li>I would clean out under the nails really well after each shower, using a metal nail file.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overwhelming and it&#x27;s a great price for the size.</li>
            <li>I only use them externally and in cleaning products but the smells are strong and nice</li>
            <li>Ok, so it took a long time, but this really works for toenail fungus!!  </li>
            <li>I intend to purchase more essential oils from Now Foods.</li>
            <li>gave some of this to my son for his snoring and he came back for more.  </li>
            <li>I love NOW brand essential oils!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like thyme and reminds me of the Thyme-scented Seventh Generation antiseptic wipes.</li>
            <li>Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using NOW and the first time to purchase Thyme Oil.  </li>
            <li>Now is one of my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>but I completely have to struggle with this bottle to get my drops out as they do not come out smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a year now, and my toenails are normal again!!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that they have strong smells.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>It caused my old  nail to peel and new nail came out clean.  </li>
            <li>it is much thinner/watery than the product you&#x27;d buy in a store.    </li>
            <li>So thanks to all people who posted the suggestions of its uses on fungus nail.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really afford the laser options.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon</li>
            <li>Again, straight oil.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if if it was available through Prime -- it took a little long to get to me.</li>
            <li>Very, very strong so possibly good for wiping down counters you want to disinfect but not good to put on flesh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I read previous reviews and chose this product.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was wrapped individually in some bubble wrap so that kept the oil from spreading to the rest of my shipment.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing jojoba oil in addition to this oil.  </li>
            <li>So glad I discovered this, as OTC and other natural remedies were not working for athletes foot.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if that is normal</li>
            <li>All my toenails are normal now - no discoloration;</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s important to disinfect clippers in rubbing alcohol before using on any other nails.)</li>
            <li>Wow is this stuff pungent!  </li>
            <li>i mix thyme oil and tea tree oil in simmering water and inhale the vapor as an all natural, antifungal/antibacterial nasal cleanser...really opens up your sinuses and prevents sinus infections!</li>
            <li>but my husband does not, so I use it during the early part of the day.  </li>
            <li>He has sleep apnea, so it does not eliminate his snoring completely.</li>
            <li>One reviewer stated that it&#x27;s much stronger than oil of oregano, which might be used for similar purposes.</li>
            <li>Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before getting them anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>I did not have any pain doing this, but I&#x27;ve read cautions on applying it directly to skin.  </li>
            <li>The NOW brand can be really hit and miss where the essential oils are concerned, but this one is a hit.</li>
            <li>An old dermatologist prescribed this for me</li>
            <li>It always shows up earlier than  Amazon prime tells me and is always packaged with care so that the bottle is not broken.  </li>
            <li>Then I read about the anti-bacterial action of thymus, found in oregano oil and thyme oil.</li>
            <li>I tried oregano oil, which burned considerably but didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li>No issues as far as quality are concerned.</li>
            <li>It dribbles around if you try to apply the oil directly.</li>
            <li>love the sent, but very small for the price.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t try natural remedies, so this was going outside the box for me.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected it would be and prompt shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only my pinky toenail, so it won&#x27;t be long before I have a whole new nail.  </li>
            <li>I have definite new nail growth</li>
            <li>I mixed the thyme oil with some jojoba and had him apply it after every shower directly to his nails.</li>
            <li>Be careful, it can burn your skin if you use to much.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping, product as I expected</li>
            <li>If you mix a little thyme oil and jojoba oil and put on your toes, it is less potent.  </li>
            <li>This brand compares to more expensive brands and so far I have no reason not to purchase from this company when their prices beat the others.</li>
            <li>I have used multiple oils from multiple well-known companies and so far Now has not sent me anything but quality oils.</li>
            <li>and it goes really well with other essential oils.</li>
            <li>It too burned for the first few weeks</li>
            <li>I really like the woodsy, slightly camphor-ous smell.</li>
            <li>This product is really potent, so you are usually just using a few drops</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find cheaper oils here, but they are just that- cheap :(</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a little hard to control with just the plastic insert over the top.</li>

            <li> So glad I discovered this, as OTC and other natural remedies were not working for athletes foot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if that is normal</li>
            <li> All my toenails are normal now - no discoloration;</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s important to disinfect clippers in rubbing alcohol before using on any other nails.)</li>
            <li> Wow is this stuff pungent!  </li>
            <li> i mix thyme oil and tea tree oil in simmering water and inhale the vapor as an all natural, antifungal/antibacterial nasal cleanser...really opens up your sinuses and prevents sinus infections!</li>
            <li> but my husband does not, so I use it during the early part of the day.  </li>
            <li> He has sleep apnea, so it does not eliminate his snoring completely.</li>
            <li> One reviewer stated that it&#x27;s much stronger than oil of oregano, which might be used for similar purposes.</li>
            <li> Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before getting them anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I did not have any pain doing this, but I&#x27;ve read cautions on applying it directly to skin.  </li>
            <li> The NOW brand can be really hit and miss where the essential oils are concerned, but this one is a hit.</li>
            <li> An old dermatologist prescribed this for me</li>
            <li> It always shows up earlier than  Amazon prime tells me and is always packaged with care so that the bottle is not broken.  </li>
            <li> Then I read about the anti-bacterial action of thymus, found in oregano oil and thyme oil.</li>
            <li> I tried oregano oil, which burned considerably but didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> No issues as far as quality are concerned.</li>
            <li> It dribbles around if you try to apply the oil directly.</li>
            <li> love the sent, but very small for the price.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t try natural remedies, so this was going outside the box for me.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected it would be and prompt shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only my pinky toenail, so it won&#x27;t be long before I have a whole new nail.  </li>
            <li> I have definite new nail growth</li>
            <li> I mixed the thyme oil with some jojoba and had him apply it after every shower directly to his nails.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it can burn your skin if you use to much.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping, product as I expected</li>
            <li> If you mix a little thyme oil and jojoba oil and put on your toes, it is less potent.  </li>
            <li> This brand compares to more expensive brands and so far I have no reason not to purchase from this company when their prices beat the others.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple oils from multiple well-known companies and so far Now has not sent me anything but quality oils.</li>
            <li> and it goes really well with other essential oils.</li>
            <li> It too burned for the first few weeks</li>
            <li> I really like the woodsy, slightly camphor-ous smell.</li>
            <li> This product is really potent, so you are usually just using a few drops</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find cheaper oils here, but they are just that- cheap :(</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a little hard to control with just the plastic insert over the top.</li>
            <li> I use this white thyme essential oil combined with other essential oils in my all natural soap recipes for a mossy, wood, leafy essence.</li>
            <li> I found applying the oil directly to my toes gave a slight burning sensation for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Only qualm is that I personally do not particularly care for the scent.</li>
            <li> It seems to be up to Now Foods&#x27;s usual high standards.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long, so I can&#x27;t yet say, but it does seem to be stronger.</li>
            <li> As I said, it took a long long time to see results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this oil everyday, and I&#x27;m not seeing any improvements so far.  </li>
            <li> I use my sweet almond oil (Now Solutions) and a few drops of the thyme oil on my toe at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Used this last year for about half a year on my big toe which had a fungus problem.  </li>
            <li> I have not actually used it except once since there is no applicator and it made such a mess on the bottle I put it in.</li>
            <li> I do have other essential oils from Now Foods</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve used it in my cooking and mixed it with other oil for remedies.  </li>
            <li> Okay, this is gross: two of my toenails were badly disfigured by toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the NOW foods brand, but it&#x27;s certainly not a brand allegiance that would prompt me to pay more for it if some other brand was less expensive.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell as potent as store-bought thyme essential oil :(    </li>
            <li> They started out almost black, and really gross.</li>
            <li> strong oil to used in moderation in cold process soap making</li>
            <li> I recently contracted a little toe nail fungus on one of my toes.  </li>
            <li> I use it in a homemade cleaning solution - only need a few drops in the recipe</li>
            <li> My nails are getting harder and longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually mixed a few dropper fulls of this into Vapo Rub (another toenail fungus fixer) and using it that way.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using the product and plan on trying it on some of the other home remedies that I have found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way as long as you use a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> At the same time, I scraped and clipped the infected toenails assiduously, which was not easy, particularly the first few months, because they were in very, very bad shape.</li>
            <li> I also purchased disposable emery boards (use once and toss) and have filed down the surface of my nail.  </li>
            <li> I use this Thyme Oil in combination with rosemary oil, basil oil, Jamaican black castor oil, avocado oil, and olive oil as a Hair Growth serum.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a mess of oil.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d purchased one of the products that was made for toenail fungus and could be applied without the mixing and so much mess.</li>
            <li> but I can tell by the consistency and the way that it EVAPORATES (oil does not evaporate into thin air)  that this has been diluted with some kind of alcohol :(    </li>
            <li> It was packed with other oils, so not sure which is to blame for the leakage.</li>
            <li> so what&#x27;s a little patience when trying to get the oil out?</li>
            <li> well thats life,... little mistakes</li>
            <li> I find this oil to smell and feel very harsh, chemical and unnatural compared to other oils that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I had tried prescriptions, and other over the counter products,and nothing worked!!</li>
            <li> But if musky smells bother you, you might not enjoy this oil for your hair.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to shampoo and let it sit on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I switched to thyme oil, putting a drop of this oil on each toenail everyday for about a year.</li>
            <li> The nails projected so much that wearing shoes was painful.</li>
            <li> I need to buy a small bottle with an applicator in it</li>
            <li> White thyme has this weird funk.</li>
            <li> I would say at least a few months to see that  it was working.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the size or not</li>
            <li> This oil was hard find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process no matter what you use.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, dh.</li>
            <li> Do your research and do not be duped into purchasing expensive &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I was unable to find a pharmacy who would make it, so</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this, and was skeptical, but desperate, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li> She also bites my fingers so she may soon find they taste bad, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it had just been rubbed horribly by shoes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Exactly what I expected it would be and prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil. I really like the woodsy, slightly camphor-ous smell. I use this white thyme essential oil combined with other essential oils in my all natural soap recipes for a mossy, wood, leafy essence. This oil is pure and clean, so it can be used for aromatherapy purposes as well. Extra stars for Amazon&#x27;s great packaging.</li>
            <li> Happy, just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Product is great, but I really wish it would come with an eyedropper. This product is really potent, so you are usually just using a few drops and that&#x27;s a little hard to control with just the plastic insert over the top. I would probably buy again, but honestly it will take me like 12 years to use what I&#x27;ve got one drop at a time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and it is supposed to be 100% but I can tell by the consistency and the way that it EVAPORATES (oil does not evaporate into thin air)  that this has been diluted with some kind of alcohol :(    it is much thinner/watery than the product you&#x27;d buy in a store.    It also doesn&#x27;t smell as potent as store-bought thyme essential oil :(    I was so excited to find cheaper oils here, but they are just that- cheap :(</li>
            <li> I use this Thyme Oil in combination with rosemary oil, basil oil, Jamaican black castor oil, avocado oil, and olive oil as a Hair Growth serum. You can throw a bit of sulfur in there for good measure. These essential oils + carrier oils are an amazing cocktail for stimulating hair growth. The only downside is that they have strong smells. I only use them at night, wrap my hair with a scarf, and put a towel over my pillow. My boyfriend teases me and says I smell like fried plantains (lol). It&#x27;s actually more of a minty herb tea smell. I enjoy the smell because I love earthy scents. But if musky smells bother you, you might not enjoy this oil for your hair. Good news is, the scent only lasts for 8-10 hours before it fades - hence why I put it on at night. Try it, and good luck :)</li>
            <li> Arrived in a mess of oil. It was packed with other oils, so not sure which is to blame for the leakage.</li>
            <li> Wow is this stuff pungent!  Wish it came with eyedropper.</li>
            <li> Good oil. No complaints. This brand compares to more expensive brands and so far I have no reason not to purchase from this company when their prices beat the others. I have used multiple oils from multiple well-known companies and so far Now has not sent me anything but quality oils. If that ever changes my reviews will reflect that as well. I am not affliated with any oil company or linked to anyone who is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I read previous reviews and chose this product. I have had no staining on my skin and my nail &amp;#34;fungus&amp;#34; is resolved.</li>
            <li> I find this oil to smell and feel very harsh, chemical and unnatural compared to other oils that I have purchased. Very, very strong so possibly good for wiping down counters you want to disinfect but not good to put on flesh.</li>
            <li> Use it as a disinfecting agent in my homemade bathroom cleaner.  Works like a charm.  I love the scent but my husband does not, so I use it during the early part of the day.  House guests always comment on how clean and fresh the scent is.  Sorry, dh.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, high quality as all NOW Essential Oils are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to state that there is NO CLASSIFICATION  by the FDA for &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; Essential Oils. Do your research and do not be duped into purchasing expensive &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; when such a thing doesn&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This review is solely based upon my independent review. I purchased this product. I was NOT given this product in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> This oil was hard find. I was happy to find it here and at a good price. It would be nice if if it was available through Prime -- it took a little long to get to me.</li>
            <li> I needed thyme oil and I ordered this. It meets my needs and does what I needed it to for my DIY mixtures. I did appreciate the tips on the labels. I do prefer the NOW foods brand, but it&#x27;s certainly not a brand allegiance that would prompt me to pay more for it if some other brand was less expensive.</li>
            <li> This oil is clearing up my husband&#x27;s stubborn toenail fungus. I mixed the thyme oil with some jojoba and had him apply it after every shower directly to his nails. They are already looking better! It&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way as long as you use a carrier oil. Very high quality. I intend to purchase more essential oils from Now Foods.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong smell.  I use it in a homemade cleaning solution - only need a few drops in the recipe and it makes 20oz.</li>
            <li> The product is probably really great, but I had no idea it was so strong and that I had to mix it with olive oil or something else to use it. I wish I&#x27;d purchased one of the products that was made for toenail fungus and could be applied without the mixing and so much mess. It is pretty strong smelling, so be prepared for that. I have not actually used it except once since there is no applicator and it made such a mess on the bottle I put it in. I need to buy a small bottle with an applicator in it so I can mix it and then clean the bottle up and use it easily.</li>
            <li> Another really good essential oil from Now Foods.  Thyme oil is so useful that I need to order it in a 1 ounce bottle and Now Foods has a good price.&lt;br /&gt;I gave some of this to my son for his snoring and he came back for more.  He says it does help.  He has sleep apnea, so it does not eliminate his snoring completely.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a fly repelling spray, but I&#x27;m still working on it. I have success with rosemary oil, but just for the hell of it, I put this stuff on my toes for my (almost gone) nail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, my dog likes to bite my toes and ankles and is not deterred by the rosemary oil on my feet at all. I even use rosemary to preserve her homemade treats. But thyme oil is a different story! She came up to investigate when I put it on my toes and after she got a taste she backed away. She came back and sat up against the couch, and I put my feet on her to see what she would do. She jumped up and moved across the room. LOL She also bites my fingers so she may soon find they taste bad, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon oil has been a good deterrent for chewing her leashes, but it smells strong and can burn. I don&#x27;t want it on my skin. Thyme oil is gentle and I think I&#x27;d feel comfortable using it every day until she stops going for my extremities. So even if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for flies, and makes no difference on my toenail, I think it&#x27;s nice to have around.</li>
            <li> My product had crystals in it. Don&#x27;t know if that is normal and I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried their other products and I think they&#x27;re good quality, I think this is good quality, I just did not fancy the smell! White thyme has this weird funk. You don&#x27;t see that oil in lip balm for a reason. It&#x27;s yuck.</li>
            <li> I love NOW brand essential oils!</li>
            <li> This is strong stuff! One reviewer stated that it&#x27;s much stronger than oil of oregano, which might be used for similar purposes. I haven&#x27;t used it long, so I can&#x27;t yet say, but it does seem to be stronger. It seems to be up to Now Foods&#x27;s usual high standards. The bottle doesn&#x27;t leak, the dropper works, and I have no complaints. Very fast service too, good packaging, all good.</li>
            <li> It should most definitely come with a squeeze dropper top for ease of use.</li>
            <li> i mix thyme oil and tea tree oil in simmering water and inhale the vapor as an all natural, antifungal/antibacterial nasal cleanser...really opens up your sinuses and prevents sinus infections!</li>
            <li> Ok, so it took a long time, but this really works for toenail fungus!!  I had tried prescriptions, and other over the counter products,and nothing worked!! I read the reviews on this, and was skeptical, but desperate, so I tried it.  I normally don&#x27;t try natural remedies, so this was going outside the box for me.  I was patient, and it paid off.  I have been using it for over a year now, and my toenails are normal again!! They started out almost black, and really gross. I would clean out under the nails really well after each shower, using a metal nail file. Then drop it under.  (I used an actual dropper that I purchased separately).  As I said, it took a long long time to see results.  I would say at least a few months to see that  it was working.  And almost a year until my nail grew out all the way.  I now use it as a daily maintenance so that the fungus doesn&#x27;t come back.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Thyme can be used for cooking, mixed oil/lotion together for pain and rub on your body. I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS.  ALSO KEEP BUGS AWAY WHEN YOU&#x27;RE OUT SIDE IN YARD.</li>
            <li> Works well for seborrheic dermatitis.  I add a few drops to shampoo and let it sit on my scalp.  Be careful, it can burn your skin if you use to much.  Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before getting them anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my one big toe that has a fugus on it.  Only one toe.  I have had for 7 years now.  The med&#x27;s from dr worked but it came back as soon as I stopped taking the meds.  And the meds are harmful to your liver.  I use my sweet almond oil (Now Solutions) and a few drops of the thyme oil on my toe at least twice a day.  I also use Vite20 twice a day.  I am taking Thyme Oil twice a day.  I use Nature&#x27;s Answer Thyme,  My nails are getting harder and longer and the fugus is almost gone after just 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> love the sent, but very small for the price. will buy it again, but not this time or any time soon.</li>
            <li> This was the exact product I needed and it was a great value. Came on time without any defects!</li>
            <li> This bottle came all oily because the oil inside had leaked. Luckily, it was wrapped individually in some bubble wrap so that kept the oil from spreading to the rest of my shipment.</li>
            <li> Great value. I use this to mix essential oils and it went perfectly. Would and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with thyme oil.  I had read quite a bit on how it can cure athlete&#x27;s foot and nail fungus.  I have one nail that I didn&#x27;t even realize had an infection.  I thought it had just been rubbed horribly by shoes.  I have been using thyme on it twice daily for about 2 weeks now.  I have definite new nail growth and it&#x27;s growing in perfectly.  Night and day difference.  It&#x27;s only my pinky toenail, so it won&#x27;t be long before I have a whole new nail.  I dip a Q-tip in the oil and apply it directly on my nail, making sure to get into the cuticle and under the nail.  I also purchased disposable emery boards (use once and toss) and have filed down the surface of my nail.  I did not have any pain doing this, but I&#x27;ve read cautions on applying it directly to skin.  I also made a foot powder (1 part baking soda, 4 parts arrowroot powder, thyme EO and peppermint EO).  Yes, your feet will smell like thyme, but I personally think it&#x27;s a good smell.  So glad I discovered this, as OTC and other natural remedies were not working for athletes foot.</li>
            <li> Beautiful oil, clean and pure</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love NOW Foods EO&#x27;s and will certainly be ordering again when I need it.  Works great in my homemade products!</li>
            <li> When I read that thyme oil has cleaning and disinfecting properties, I had to try it.  This quality product has been useful in many cleaning agents and projects and has a pleasing smell too.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, product as I expected</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have not actually used this one yet.  I do have other essential oils from Now Foods and I love them.  I only use them externally and in cleaning products but the smells are strong and nice so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Used this last year for about half a year on my big toe which had a fungus problem.  It caused my old  nail to peel and new nail came out clean.  So thanks to all people who posted the suggestions of its uses on fungus nail.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The NOW brand can be really hit and miss where the essential oils are concerned, but this one is a hit. Smells exactly like thyme and reminds me of the Thyme-scented Seventh Generation antiseptic wipes. If you like that, you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li> Works does what it needs to do</li>
            <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil sfor different things and these are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of white thyme itself, but it is an effective antiviral/antibacterial cleaning agent. I add several drops mixed with water and vinegar to disinfect toys and kitchen area.</li>
            <li> Now has the best oils out there. Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils. Love the scent in my products.</li>
            <li> I recently contracted a little toe nail fungus on one of my toes.  I was reading online that Thyme Oil is pretty effective treatment and I can&#x27;t really afford the laser options.  I have been using this oil everyday, and I&#x27;m not seeing any improvements so far.  However, getting rid of toenail fungus can takes months so I&#x27;m being patient.  I would highly recommend purchasing jojoba oil in addition to this oil.  I found applying the oil directly to my toes gave a slight burning sensation for awhile.  If you mix a little thyme oil and jojoba oil and put on your toes, it is less potent.  Also the scent is very strong so it might not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> strong oil to used in moderation in cold process soap making</li>
            <li> I use a 5% solution in denatured alcohol to combat nail fungus. An old dermatologist prescribed this for me and I was unable to find a pharmacy who would make it, so I make it myself.</li>
            <li> My white Tyme  oil is one of my favorites for my massage therapy business.  It is a great healer. It always shows up earlier than  Amazon prime tells me and is always packaged with care so that the bottle is not broken.  Thanks again Amazon prime![[ASIN:B000MGSJEG NOW Foods, THYME OIL WHITE 1 OZ]]</li>
            <li> This was my first time using NOW and the first time to purchase Thyme Oil.  I wanted the Thyme oil for it&#x27;s anti-bacterial properties. I have been impressed with the product. I&#x27;ve used it, along with Eucalyptus Oil, to make an anti-bacterial mouthwash which has worked better than I could have hoped.  I will continue using the product and plan on trying it on some of the other home remedies that I have found.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice essential oil.  Good price and a reputable company to purchase essential oils from.  Great to cook with</li>
            <li> I like the thyme essential oil. I&#x27; ve used it in my cooking and mixed it with other oil for remedies.  It smells and tastes just like thyme. I would recommend it to anyone who uses thyme.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing,I used it with oregano to get rid of skin cancer on my face,and it removed it all</li>
            <li> Love all these oils on Amazon. My favorite place for making orders. Now is one of my favorite essential oils. :) Thanks for having on Amazon!</li>
            <li> taste great i even bought more</li>
            <li> Okay, this is gross: two of my toenails were badly disfigured by toenail fungus. The nails projected so much that wearing shoes was painful. Ingested medication, which can damage your liver, did not work. Nail filing by a podiatrist temporarily relieved buildup, nothing more. Then I read about the anti-bacterial action of thymus, found in oregano oil and thyme oil. I tried oregano oil, which burned considerably but didn&#x27;t seem to help. I switched to thyme oil, putting a drop of this oil on each toenail everyday for about a year. Again, straight oil. It too burned for the first few weeks but I didn&#x27;t feel anything thereafter. At the same time, I scraped and clipped the infected toenails assiduously, which was not easy, particularly the first few months, because they were in very, very bad shape. (It&#x27;s important to disinfect clippers in rubbing alcohol before using on any other nails.) I had suffered the fungus for years, but with the thyme oil I began to see change. It was hallucinatory. All my toenails are normal now - no discoloration; no projection. I am amazed at the power of this oil for this condition.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Smells strong Product came well wrapped.  This company is good for quality and price.</li>
            <li> A must have for adding to your hand soaps. Kills bacteria, germs and mold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to make my own disinfecting spray.  Nice strong scent.</li>
            <li> Item was as described, great deal for the price, and arrived on time. Only qualm is that I personally do not particularly care for the scent. No issues as far as quality are concerned.</li>
            <li> This stuff really smells strong but I think it is doing the trick.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and beginning to show improvement.  It&#x27;s a slow process no matter what you use.  I&#x27;ve actually mixed a few dropper fulls of this into Vapo Rub (another toenail fungus fixer) and using it that way.  It dribbles around if you try to apply the oil directly.</li>
            <li> I add it to my skin oil, and it seems to help with irritations.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming and it&#x27;s a great price for the size. And I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the size or not but I completely have to struggle with this bottle to get my drops out as they do not come out smoothly. I wish this wasn&#x27;t the case because I like the product otherwise and it goes really well with other essential oils. But I guess you can&#x27;t beat the size for the price so what&#x27;s a little patience when trying to get the oil out?</li>
            <li> must have got things mixed up at one end or another cause i recieved thyme oil ,not thymol as i wanted, well thats life,... little mistakes</li>
            <li> Good product well priced!</li>
