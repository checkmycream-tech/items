            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect mix between a glitter polish and a nude one.</li>
            <li>Just a beautiful color all around!</li>
            <li>course, China Glaze is an awesome nail polish.</li>
            <li>but it has a beautiful gold shimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery gold/</li>
            <li>So beautiful.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Harvest Moon: This is a great Fall color.</li>
            <li>and it might not look great with every ones skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for nail-painting amateurs--it looks great even if it&#x27;s not applied evenly.</li>
            <li>Its a fantastic neutral with a twist and application is wonderful!</li>
            <li>But it shimmers beautifully and besides the orange color, it&#x27;s my favorite from the collection.</li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>Interesting color!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and looks good on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love this color - it looks even better in person!</li>
            <li>This is definitely an appropriate color for work.</li>
            <li>It is a nice light shade that will make your nail glisten.</li>
            <li>I did 2 coats and a top coat.</li>
            <li>OMG I love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this glitter.  </li>
            <li>I love this nude color.</li>
            <li>I love this polish color.</li>
            <li>I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work on me</li>
            <li>That will take a more precise application, as it is near-black.</li>
            <li>The formula is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this polish, but when it dries it comes out more golden than tan as it looks in the bottle.</li>
            <li>have very fair skin and nudes typically make my hands look even more fair, but because of the gold flecks, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color - has very tiny gold sparkles inside.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s saved by the lovely golden shimmer and sparkle in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that this polish would look fantastic layered over</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Amazon seller I got exactly what I was expecting quickly and for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This polish is pretty and great with a coat of Luxe &amp; Lush over it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for how this color would apply on its own.</li>
            <li>: This is a great matte Grey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to wear all year long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more tan than the picture shows, but it&#x27;s still a great color.</li>
            <li>Fast Track is my favorite color of nail polish ever.</li>
            <li>Based on the photos I&#x27;ve seen (do an image search for China Glaze Fast Track), I thought it would work better for her skin tone (med/fair with pinker undertones).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery black.</li>
            <li>I personally love vibrant colors so this is a bit subdued for me...</li>
            <li>If you put a top coat over it, it will obviously not be matte anymore, but I love it both</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a gold-tone, but it&#x27;s not too bright to seem costume-y, so I&#x27;m not afraid to wear it in the office.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>It is a welcome change on your typical nude shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast Track is a light beige with golden flecks of glitter.  </li>
            <li>If light isn&#x27;t directly hitting it, the color just looks like a light brown or nude.</li>
            <li>But the results are well worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>One coat is enough to just add a nice glittery shimmer to your nails.</li>
            <li>I put Luxe &amp; Lush on top to add dimensions or else</li>
            <li>With two coats you get a nice solid color.</li>
            <li>Subtle but incredibly flattering, and an all around great &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; color when having trouble picking a color to wear.</li>
            <li>It went on like clear polish with beautiful, subtle, very fine gold flecks.</li>
            <li>formula was nice but sheer on the first coat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty close to my skin tone</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this nail polish!</li>
            <li>When I got the bottle, of course I had to test it out on myself, first.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It look grey in the bottle but is very light and glittery once on the nail.</li>
            <li>Just the right shade to be flattering on almost anyone and go with nearly any outfit!</li>
            <li>I really like this as a neutral.</li>
            <li>I really like the formula and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very neutral and requires about 3 coats.</li>
            <li>and she is very picky when it comes to her nails,</li>
            <li>so I hope she likes this one as much as the others I got her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I bought Fast Track as a gift for a friend, since she likes to wear neutral, gold-ish polish on her toes.</li>
            <li>A couple of coats provides a nice nude/golden sheen whereas 3+ coats almost looks olive green.</li>
            <li>I personally go for the single layer with a topcoat and it lasts beautifully all week long.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful champagne shade and the glitter is not overly flashy or obnoxious, so it would work easily for a business setting, casual or even a more dressy event or night out!</li>
            <li>If you like wearing nudes and neutrals but want a little something extra, this is a good shade to try.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries at the speed of light, but it began chipping less than 24 hours later.</li>
            <li>I love this for job interviews -- subtle but really pretty.</li>
            <li>This is an office appropriate shade with a little &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>It is pretty sheer</li>
            <li>So far</li>
            <li>My wife says china glaze is a professional quality product</li>
            <li>I originally got it because I wanted a creamy, everyday color to wear.</li>
            <li>Its subtle and sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>When the light hits it, though, it looks like your fingernails are covered with small gold glitter.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, with no pulling or streaking, and the formula isn&#x27;t thick, which happens from time to time.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is definitely noticeable, especially in the light, but it&#x27;s a very clean and classic look because of the beige base.</li>
            <li>you enjoy the look of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; nails, you&#x27;ll like this one because the flecks are subtle.  </li>

            <li> This may need three thin coats for full opacity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really glittery, but still subtle.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned african american woman and this is my go to polish when i don&#x27;t feel like experimenting with any other color.</li>
            <li> Also,  If you layer on this polish too thickly, it will make your skin tone look very sallow if you&#x27;re pale.</li>
            <li> I really thought I&#x27;d have to apply a solid nude base underneath it to get even coverage, but I was pleased to see that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> shade can be used very subtly with one layer for a shimmery nude look or layered for a more dramatic but still neutral tone.</li>
            <li> In the bottle, it looks like a fine gold glitter, but the base color looks greyish/taupe-ish with an almost lavender undertone.</li>
            <li> The only thing that i don&#x27;t like about this polish is it starts to get thick after awhile, so you will have to thin it out with some polish thinner,</li>
            <li> The glitter particles help mask small chips around the edge of the nail, so the manicure stays &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; longer.</li>
            <li> One of my go to polish hands down ! !!!</li>
            <li> , there didn&#x27;t seem to be any base color (at least, on me!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stone Cold</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I applied one coat to my nails--beautiful!</li>

            <li> If you like wearing nudes and neutrals but want a little something extra, this is a good shade to try. This is definitely an appropriate color for work. I personally love vibrant colors so this is a bit subdued for me...but it&#x27;s saved by the lovely golden shimmer and sparkle in it. The formula is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This is one of the \\&quot;Hunger Games\\&quot; nail polishes by China Glaze. It look grey in the bottle but is very light and glittery once on the nail. It is a nice light shade that will make your nail glisten.</li>
            <li> So far I have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Track: I really like this as a neutral. It&#x27;s pretty close to my skin tone but it has a beautiful gold shimmer. It&#x27;s a champagne color. It is pretty sheer so you will need 2-3 coats. I really like the formula and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riveting: This color is beautiful! It&#x27;s an orange with lots of gold shimmer, it&#x27;s like fire on your nails. I did 2 coats and a top coat. If you&#x27;re on the fence about getting it, get it! No picture you see online will do this color justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harvest Moon: This is a great Fall color. It&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery gold/brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Cold: This is a great matte Grey. If you put a top coat over it, it will obviously not be matte anymore, but I love it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoke and Ashes: OMG I love this color. It&#x27;s a beautiful shimmery black. It has a lot of blue/green and gold shimmer. So beautiful.</li>
            <li> Fast Track is my favorite color of nail polish ever. It&#x27;s really glittery, but still subtle. If light isn&#x27;t directly hitting it, the color just looks like a light brown or nude. When the light hits it, though, it looks like your fingernails are covered with small gold glitter. I love this for job interviews -- subtle but really pretty. &lt;3</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color.  It&#x27;s a muted goldish color, so it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; gold.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Fast Track is a light beige with golden flecks of glitter.  It is a welcome change on your typical nude shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and nudes typically make my hands look even more fair, but because of the gold flecks, I really like it. I love this glitter.  Its subtle and sophisticated.  I&#x27;m thinking that this polish would look fantastic layered over darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula was nice but sheer on the first coat.  This may need three thin coats for full opacity.  But the results are well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy the look of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; nails, you&#x27;ll like this one because the flecks are subtle.  This is an office appropriate shade with a little &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I love this color - it looks even better in person! It&#x27;s the perfect neutral for me to wear to work. One coat is enough to just add a nice glittery shimmer to your nails. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the color of this polish, but when it dries it comes out more golden than tan as it looks in the bottle. But it shimmers beautifully and besides the orange color, it&#x27;s my favorite from the collection.</li>
            <li> I love this nude color. It&#x27;s great to wear all year long. One of my go to polish hands down ! !!!</li>
            <li> Love the color! Thanks to the Amazon seller I got exactly what I was expecting quickly and for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shade can be used very subtly with one layer for a shimmery nude look or layered for a more dramatic but still neutral tone. I personally go for the single layer with a topcoat and it lasts beautifully all week long.</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty and great with a coat of Luxe &amp; Lush over it. It&#x27;s very neutral and requires about 3 coats. I put Luxe &amp; Lush on top to add dimensions or else this would have faded into my brown skin tone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for how this color would apply on its own. I really thought I&#x27;d have to apply a solid nude base underneath it to get even coverage, but I was pleased to see that I was wrong. With two coats you get a nice solid color. This is the perfect mix between a glitter polish and a nude one. The shimmer is definitely noticeable, especially in the light, but it&#x27;s a very clean and classic look because of the beige base. The only problem I can see someone having with it is that it&#x27;s a very different color beige and it might not look great with every ones skin tone.</li>
            <li> My wife says china glaze is a professional quality product and she is very picky when it comes to her nails, so I hope she likes this one as much as the others I got her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this nail polish! It&#x27;s definitely a gold-tone, but it&#x27;s not too bright to seem costume-y, so I&#x27;m not afraid to wear it in the office. The glitter particles help mask small chips around the edge of the nail, so the manicure stays &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; longer.</li>
            <li> Nothing else to write here. Just a beautiful color all around! It&#x27;s a little more tan than the picture shows, but it&#x27;s still a great color.</li>
            <li> Interesting color!  It goes on smoothly and dries at the speed of light, but it began chipping less than 24 hours later. Also,  If you layer on this polish too thickly, it will make your skin tone look very sallow if you&#x27;re pale. A couple of coats provides a nice nude/golden sheen whereas 3+ coats almost looks olive green.</li>
            <li> I love this polish color. It goes on easy and looks good on any skin tone. I am a dark skinned african american woman and this is my go to polish when i don&#x27;t feel like experimenting with any other color. Being that this color was apart of the hunger games collection and was only out for a short time, you can&#x27;t buy it in the store anymore, so i have to order this online. The only thing that i don&#x27;t like about this polish is it starts to get thick after awhile, so you will have to thin it out with some polish thinner, which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color - has very tiny gold sparkles inside. You could set on 1 coat, but 2 makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, China Glaze is an awesome nail polish.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is beautiful. I originally got it because I wanted a creamy, everyday color to wear. I&#x27;ve get tons of compliments every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought Fast Track as a gift for a friend, since she likes to wear neutral, gold-ish polish on her toes. Based on the photos I&#x27;ve seen (do an image search for China Glaze Fast Track), I thought it would work better for her skin tone (med/fair with pinker undertones). When I got the bottle, of course I had to test it out on myself, first. In the bottle, it looks like a fine gold glitter, but the base color looks greyish/taupe-ish with an almost lavender undertone. I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work on me (I have med skin w/yellow undertones). I was shocked when I applied one coat to my nails--beautiful! It went on like clear polish with beautiful, subtle, very fine gold flecks. Even with two coats (and it doesn&#x27;t need it), there didn&#x27;t seem to be any base color (at least, on me!). It&#x27;s also great for nail-painting amateurs--it looks great even if it&#x27;s not applied evenly. ;-) So I guess I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle for myself. I also bought Smoke and Ashes but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. Looks amazing--as another reviewer said, it&#x27;s like a galaxy in a bottle. That will take a more precise application, as it is near-black.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Its a fantastic neutral with a twist and application is wonderful! Goes on smooth, with no pulling or streaking, and the formula isn&#x27;t thick, which happens from time to time. Just the right shade to be flattering on almost anyone and go with nearly any outfit! It is a beautiful champagne shade and the glitter is not overly flashy or obnoxious, so it would work easily for a business setting, casual or even a more dressy event or night out! Subtle but incredibly flattering, and an all around great &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; color when having trouble picking a color to wear.</li>
