            <li>Great clippers, quality built</li>
            <li>Great adjustable blade Clipper for fades and tapers.</li>
            <li>The blade cuts smooth as well, great for tapers and fades and take the andis magnetic guards perfectly.</li>
            <li>perfect fit (the ones it came with</li>
            <li>If your looking for something to do shape ups/tapes Wahl, Andis and Oster make good trimmers/liners.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the power a wahl senior would have but a good clipper all around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but I do cut my own hair and some family and friends.</li>
            <li>A nice precise cut on his beard and hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these clippers, they have been my \\&quot;Workhorse\\&quot; clipper for fading</li>
            <li>they fade better than all my master&#x27;s put together, so</li>
            <li>Best thang smoking  next to the masters  </li>
            <li>I wish is had more \\&quot;small\\&quot; covers.  </li>
            <li>They work ok</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, and with a pivot motor, they work much better than those vibrating ones.</li>
            <li>I bought this clipper thinking that there would be a great difference between this and my Fast Feeds.</li>
            <li>i used that 4 and more years</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected great product for a good price</li>
            <li>light</li>
            <li>I really wanna add these back into my \\&quot;arsenal\\&quot; but I still love my masters!!!</li>
            <li>So glad I decided not to get another of those cheaper home haircut clipper sets and went for the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that while they make you feel like you&#x27;re getting a real value, most of the combs in those home hair clipper sets are not needed.  </li>
            <li>its pivot motor stay cool.</li>
            <li>works good &amp; its quiet.</li>
            <li>and I believe better than Fast Feed.</li>
            <li>The machine itself stays cool.</li>
            <li>I quick cleanup and oil to the blades</li>
            <li>they cut smooth never get hot there</li>
            <li>These clippers are very lightweight, quiet, don&#x27;t get hot as quick, Doing any kind of haircut from fades to tapered haircuts are smoky smooth easy to clean you can use the Purple Andis magnetic guards with these Clippers</li>
            <li>Cuts like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>The blades are very well made</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much simpler than I thought so just use a barber comb.</li>
            <li>Very even cut.    </li>
            <li>Perfect for clipper over comb cutting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you get these.</li>
            <li>Invest just a few dollars more and get these professional clippers instead.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot and they are my back up to my andis clippers</li>
            <li>They use a different type of motor for a better, long lasting, clipper action.  </li>
            <li>This clipper works great for all around cutting and blending.</li>
            <li>Which the only difference besides the color of the body and the blade is that the Fast Feeds adjust closer than the Speedlines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m professional hair stylist ,Before i had oster 616</li>
            <li>Smooth cutting blade that leaves a very clean and polished look to haircuts.</li>
            <li>The length guards on these are pretty basic, and they clip on differently that the home style ones</li>
            <li>, this is not comfortable like 616 but not bad.</li>
            <li>The only ones I would like to have extra would be the left and right ear guards.  </li>
            <li>fast feeds the only difference between these and the red ones is just the color.</li>
            <li>I accidently dropped them and the cutting blade fell out, I was able to put them back in but the blade would then pull hair, I used them for maybe 2-3 cuts, then I sold them for a very \\&quot;Reasonable\\&quot; price.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a pair of Andis Masters to replace them but, I will be keeping them as a Back-up since Masters tend to run a little hot, and I know these clippers w/</li>
            <li>So all around good clipper for those who are passionate about cutting and for those who like to collect clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>The gold blade warms up a little faster than the standard blade found on the fast feed model.</li>

            <li> Only draw back on this particular set of clippers are that they are adjustable, yet they do not have a notch or mark to let you know the position of the blade, which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing it just takes awhile using them to master.</li>

            <li> The included guards are terrible however, I recommend purchasing the andis magnetic guards if you plan on cutting with a guard in place.</li>

            <li> If you use clippers for home use, you are probably buying a new set every couple years -- and probably fiddling with them in the meantime just to keep them cutting properly.  Don&#x27;t waste your time!  Invest just a few dollars more and get these professional clippers instead.  They use a different type of motor for a better, long lasting, clipper action.  The blades are very well made and they really don&#x27;t mess around!  I used these to &amp;#34;de thatch&amp;#34; my caveman spouse and got the job done in half the time it usually takes.  A nice precise cut on his beard and hair.  I quick cleanup and oil to the blades and we were done! So glad I decided not to get another of those cheaper home haircut clipper sets and went for the real deal.  I can see these lasting for a long time.  The length guards on these are pretty basic, and they clip on differently that the home style ones, so you won&#x27;t be use your old ones and may have to invest in a set if you do a lot of cutting at different lengths.  I&#x27;ve found that while they make you feel like you&#x27;re getting a real value, most of the combs in those home hair clipper sets are not needed.  The only ones I would like to have extra would be the left and right ear guards.  I&#x27;m going to train myself to do without those, it&#x27;s much simpler than I thought so just use a barber comb.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these clippers, they have been my \\&quot;Workhorse\\&quot; clipper for fading/Tapering for the past year and half. Not one problem out of them yet!! Only draw back on this particular set of clippers are that they are adjustable, yet they do not have a notch or mark to let you know the position of the blade, which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing it just takes awhile using them to master. I recently bought a pair of Andis Masters to replace them but, I will be keeping them as a Back-up since Masters tend to run a little hot, and I know these clippers w/ its pivot motor stay cool. Overall the Oster \\&quot;Speedline\\&quot; clipper is \\&quot;Win\\&quot;.. Buy these clippers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 04/12:&lt;br /&gt; Wish I could say that I still have these clippers but maybe 4-5 months back I accidently dropped them and the cutting blade fell out, I was able to put them back in but the blade would then pull hair, I used them for maybe 2-3 cuts, then I sold them for a very \\&quot;Reasonable\\&quot; price. Since then, I&#x27;ve been wanting to get another pair, this time the TOPAZ edition, but I can&#x27;t seem to find them, the way these clippers cut are awesome they fade better than all my master&#x27;s put together, so I really wanna add these back into my \\&quot;arsenal\\&quot; but I still love my masters!!!</li>
            <li> Cuts like a hot knife through butter.  However, traps a lot of hair under the guard.  Highly recommend you get these.</li>
            <li> Use this daily in my salon, these help me to finish my cuts after my oster 76&#x27;s. They are quiet and adjustable for blending. Will recommend to others</li>
            <li> Best thang smoking  next to the masters  Ima barber  they cut smooth never get hot there light so yea there a must have for me</li>
            <li> It works great on my goatee.  Very even cut.    I wish is had more \\&quot;small\\&quot; covers.  There is one small cover and the adjustment but there isn&#x27;t enough of variance for facial hair.</li>
            <li> To begin with these are fast feeds the only difference between these and the red ones is just the color. Oster has different colors/variations of this clipper . I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. These clippers are very lightweight, quiet, don&#x27;t get hot as quick, Doing any kind of haircut from fades to tapered haircuts are smoky smooth easy to clean you can use the Purple Andis magnetic guards with these Clippers perfect fit (the ones it came with I didn&#x27;t like) And zero gap/adjust the blade is no problem. NOTE: THESE CLIPPERS ARE NOT INTENDED TO SHAPE/TAPE YOUR BEARD. If your looking for something to do shape ups/tapes Wahl, Andis and Oster make good trimmers/liners.</li>
            <li> great item for barbers whether aspiring or perfecting your craft.</li>
            <li> The little lever is stripped. I just bought these. I&#x27;ve only adjusted them 1 time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected great product for a good price</li>
            <li> They work ok but I was thrown off by the packaging. This product looked like it was packaged in the 1980&#x27;s. It came with a VHS tape, not a DVD, and had cutting techniques in a book that were styles my parents had at one point.</li>
            <li> works good &amp; its quiet.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, quality built and I believe better than Fast Feed. A bit heavier and the lever is a bit stronger as in there is some pressure needed to move taper lever. The blade cuts smooth as well, great for tapers and fades and take the andis magnetic guards perfectly.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot and they are my back up to my andis clippers they do the job. Great for tapers!!</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, and with a pivot motor, they work much better than those vibrating ones. I have a heavy beard, and while the vibrating types tend to pull almost as much as they clip, this one clips with no pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper thinking that there would be a great difference between this and my Fast Feeds. Which the only difference besides the color of the body and the blade is that the Fast Feeds adjust closer than the Speedlines.</li>
            <li> Great adjustable blade Clipper for fades and tapers. Perfect for clipper over comb cutting. Smooth cutting blade that leaves a very clean and polished look to haircuts. The included guards are terrible however, I recommend purchasing the andis magnetic guards if you plan on cutting with a guard in place. The gold blade warms up a little faster than the standard blade found on the fast feed model. The machine itself stays cool.</li>
            <li> This clipper works great for all around cutting and blending. Doesn&#x27;t have the power a wahl senior would have but a good clipper all around. I recommend getting the andis purple magnetic guards. I am not a professional but I do cut my own hair and some family and friends. So all around good clipper for those who are passionate about cutting and for those who like to collect clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m professional hair stylist ,Before i had oster 616 i used that 4 and more years ,now i get this one, I like this one too, this is not comfortable like 616 but not bad.</li>
