            <li>Perfect for carry-ons, and well made and packaged.</li>
            <li>The scent is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I think this set is wonderful for travel.</li>
            <li>The choice of scented or unscented is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved this product.</li>
            <li>Oh, and buy a good brush to go along with it.</li>
            <li>Makes a good gift.</li>
            <li>My husband really loved this gift.</li>
            <li>Well, he loved the set; however, the brush sheds everytime he used it.  </li>
            <li>But the brush was the most pleasant surprise of the kit.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to a deluxe set, by Art of Shaving, and that brush doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>The products seems nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the shaving cream as it lathered nicely and lubricated well.</li>
            <li>I liked the balm as it gives the skin a nice satiny sheen and suppresses nicks while soothing.</li>
            <li>The pre-shave oil smelled really nice but did not seem to lubricate at all (and frankly seemed to work against the shave).</li>
            <li>The Starter Kit is an excellent and inexpensive way to see if the AOS line is right for you, and I encourage anyone looking for a better shaving experience to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This set is great for travel or for a first time user.</li>
            <li>But, the person that got the gift ... Called me to tell me the Quality was real good and will  purchase it in the future,</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t pleased AT ALL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty floppy and not as good for using with shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>I do think the oil helps glide the blade more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Honestly just buy the regular size products the sample is good</li>
            <li>It provides a comfortable shave day after day.</li>
            <li>Gentlemen, pamper your face, and enjoy an invigerating shave.</li>
            <li>His face is so silky smooth that i cant take it.</li>
            <li>That pre shave oil is key to a great shave.</li>
            <li>If you are, however, pretty sure you&#x27;ll like the product, just get the full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>ME CLEAN</li>
            <li>As my first foray into the world of traditional shaving, it was fun to begin using these products and, after becoming comfortable with them, start to get good results and actually enjoy shaving for a change.</li>
            <li>the after shave lotion has the same good scent (</li>
            <li>My husband is in the military and he loved this product.</li>
            <li>SINCE I BOUGHT, THIS MAKES SHAVING FUN...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough to use and still get in patients faces without them being overpowered with strong smells.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the shaving process now more than ever, and my face looks and feels better than it did after using various other creams, gels, and soaps.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the step about shaving with the grain then agaist the grain, he said that it made a big differance.</li>
            <li>but the items go fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I favor the AOS unscented line for sensitive skin, the Sandalwood set worked just fine for weekend usage during a recent weekend up in Seattle at a friend&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing this as a gift set for someone.  </li>
            <li>But the products are mostly pretty great, if a little small.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my face, and really maximizes the shaving cream by creating a thick lather out of a tiny dollop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is a little softer, I smell better, and the whole process only takes maybe three more minutes than my previous</li>
            <li>I got this set an found a new way to shave.</li>
            <li>(see my other Amazon reviews of individual AOS products for more detail).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear, these are quality products.  </li>
            <li>His skin felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>He loves this new set, especially likes using the brush.</li>
            <li>The smell is masculine, pleasing, and not overpowering, plus the individual bottles are small enough to fit inside my kit bag.  </li>
            <li>He says he&#x27;s never going back to the old way.</li>
            <li>Not extreme but enough to purchase regular sized amounts of this product when I run</li>
            <li>I use a very small amount of product per shave and feel I&#x27;ll get two weeks out of the pack if I&#x27;m lucky.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product is good.</li>
            <li> Last year I received a full-sized set of the Art of Shaving products as a Christmas gift.  I enjoy the shaving process now more than ever, and my face looks and feels better than it did after using various other creams, gels, and soaps.  However, I wanted a travel-sized set to take along on local overnighters so I got this Starter Kit.  The kit worked out well, especially since it introduced me to the benefits of the shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I favor the AOS unscented line for sensitive skin, the Sandalwood set worked just fine for weekend usage during a recent weekend up in Seattle at a friend&#x27;s house.  The smell is masculine, pleasing, and not overpowering, plus the individual bottles are small enough to fit inside my kit bag.  But the brush was the most pleasant surprise of the kit.  It feels good on my face, and really maximizes the shaving cream by creating a thick lather out of a tiny dollop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sensitive skin and thick beard have forced me to try various shaving products over the years.  Finally, in middle age I believe that I&#x27;ve found what I&#x27;ve been looking for in the Art of Shaving product line (see my other Amazon reviews of individual AOS products for more detail).  The Starter Kit is an excellent and inexpensive way to see if the AOS line is right for you, and I encourage anyone looking for a better shaving experience to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this kit years ago!  Using all the steps in this kit has provided me with the smoothest shave and the least razor-burn/bumps I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving or over 35 years and have never had a shave like The Art of Shaving provides. My wife loves the feel of my skin after I shave. It provides a comfortable shave day after day. Gentlemen, pamper your face, and enjoy an invigerating shave.</li>
            <li> R&lt;br /&gt;eally small like travel sizes, was disappointed when i saw it in the package. But, the person that got the gift ... Called me to tell me the Quality was real good and will  purchase it in the future,</li>
            <li> My husband is in the military and he loved this product. Make sure you follow the step about shaving with the grain then agaist the grain, he said that it made a big differance.</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side, but you will be hooked with the quality of shave this set gives you! Perfect for carry-ons, and well made and packaged.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this product.</li>
            <li> For comparison, my typical shaving routine is Edge shave gel, Mach 3 razor, then whatever non scented lotion is on hand (I work in the health care field to scents are discouraged).  I have a medium thickness beard which needs to be shaved once every morning.  I had no problems with my previous shaving setup, just got bored.  I still use my Mach 3 but this shaving kit has elevated my shaving experience from a 6/10 to an 8/10.  Not extreme but enough to purchase regular sized amounts of this product when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:  The scent is perfect.  Earthy, woody and manly.  It&#x27;s mild enough to use and still get in patients faces without them being overpowered with strong smells.  The pre shave oil makes for a smoother shave, the shaving cream lathers well with the included brush and a little water, and the after shave lotion has the same good scent (although otherwise I think it&#x27;s just regular lotion).  My skin is a little softer, I smell better, and the whole process only takes maybe three more minutes than my previous routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:  One star off for the sample size.  I expected at least twice as much product.  I use a very small amount of product per shave and feel I&#x27;ll get two weeks out of the pack if I&#x27;m lucky.  For the price I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s enough.  The second star off is for the brush.  It sheds...a lot.  After five shaves I&#x27;m still picking bristles off my face after applying the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, these are quality products.  I would highly recommend purchasing this as a gift set for someone.  If you are, however, pretty sure you&#x27;ll like the product, just get the full size bottles.  Oh, and buy a good brush to go along with it.</li>
            <li> As my first foray into the world of traditional shaving, it was fun to begin using these products and, after becoming comfortable with them, start to get good results and actually enjoy shaving for a change. Before this I was shaving a couple of times a year when necessary and just using a beard trimmer the rest of the year to keep it short. I do think the oil helps glide the blade more smoothly. I&#x27;ve used the brush probably 25+ times now and it is still shedding. That&#x27;s frustrating. It&#x27;s also pretty floppy and not as good for using with shaving soaps. I&#x27;ll probably buy a nicer brush soon. But the products are mostly pretty great, if a little small. Makes a good gift.</li>
            <li> My husband really loved this gift. I wanted to get him something that he could try out for a while and see if it compared to his regular shaving routine. He says he&#x27;s never going back to the old way. He loves this new set, especially likes using the brush. Now all that&#x27;s missing in his new and improved shaving routine is an Art of Shaving razor!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It makes your face slippery - even after two or three passes of the razor.  I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with anything else.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL OF IT.&lt;br /&gt;EVER SINCE I BOUGHT, THIS MAKES SHAVING FUN... I FINALLY LOOK CLEAN!!!&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS ME CLEAN BECAUSE IT IS A RITUAL</li>
            <li> Its was smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as a gift for my husband to see how he would like the product. Well, he loved the set; however, the brush sheds everytime he used it.  I upgraded to a deluxe set, by Art of Shaving, and that brush doesn&#x27;t shed.  All in all, I think this set is wonderful for travel.</li>
            <li> The products seems nice. I&#x27;m giving it as a stocking stuffer. But I wasn&#x27;t pleased AT ALL that thr box smelled so bad of ciggeratte smoke.</li>
            <li> The title of this review says it all. I bought it for my boyfriend for Valentines Day and it might as well have been at gift for me too. His face is so silky smooth that i cant take it. Its now valentines day every day. The set is also travel size so you can take this party anywhere!</li>
            <li> I liked the shaving cream as it lathered nicely and lubricated well. I liked the balm as it gives the skin a nice satiny sheen and suppresses nicks while soothing. The pre-shave oil smelled really nice but did not seem to lubricate at all (and frankly seemed to work against the shave). The brush is obviously not a good one, but I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want to try the three shave products. Do not buy this to get the brush as it adds no value.</li>
            <li> His skin felt so soft.  The choice of scented or unscented is wonderful. This set is great for travel or for a first time user.</li>
            <li> when it arrived I thought it was a for Barbie and ken. its  tiny and toy sized just buy the regular size kit</li>
            <li> I got this set an found a new way to shave. That pre shave oil is key to a great shave. Honestly just buy the regular size products the sample is good but the items go fast.</li>
