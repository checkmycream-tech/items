            <li>It smells kind of like a dessert though</li>
            <li>I would have liked a stronger honey smell.</li>
            <li>, so this one is perfect -- a nice light scent that&#x27;s very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smelling and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I just think its nice to have something I love</li>
            <li>I could not find any more of it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>i am totally in love with this body mist.</li>
            <li>and i always use it. :)</li>
            <li>so glad i can buy this here because its been discontinued in stores around me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I smell good and feel good when wearing the Wild Honey collection.</li>
            <li>I have used many body mists with no problem</li>
            <li>But most days I find I end up reaching for this one when I&#x27;m just working or doing errands.  </li>
            <li>She was glad to have found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite fragrances and the scent stays one my skin for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love honey</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS.....</li>
            <li>I love this scent and was so glad to find it here on Amazon as I could no longer find it in the store.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I love the smell of honey.</li>
            <li>Smells more like a perfume than the honey and flowers</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>this one has been my all time favorite since first spritz a good number of years ago.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend never fails to tell me how good I smell or the room does.</li>
            <li>If you want a wonderful smelling honey scented body spray...so far for me healing garden is well worth the $.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but ok.</li>
            <li>And chemical free :)</li>
            <li>Fresh, gentle scent, sooths skin while leaving a great light aroma on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and this one works fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfumes for this reason and thought that since this is a body mist it would be much more of a mild scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent, for those of us who can&#x27;t do perfume-y and,</li>
            <li>It leaves a cheap perfume after smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to make the switch to chemical free beauty products</li>
            <li>Light and spring aroma</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost too light.  </li>
            <li>It is completely surprising to me how much I love this body spray, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>and I was really excited about the prospect of smelling of honey.  </li>
            <li>DISCONTINUED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you like natural smells, botanical scents, this is the perfectly understated definitely Honey scent for you.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent (it&#x27;s more floral than honey)</li>
            <li>Since reading that, I spritz it on my skin before getting dressed and I smell sweet for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>SOFT AND NICE FLOWERY SCENT.....</li>
            <li>Doesnt smell like honey, smells a bit sweet like a sweet pea scented body spray</li>
            <li>This smells fresh and light and sort of floral but the ingredients has parfum/fragrance which can be toxic</li>
            <li>Other Healing Gardens Organics are great too - why was this line discontinued?</li>
            <li>it came quickly and no leaks in the packaging...</li>
            <li>Spray them right on your skin to make it smell good and last longer.</li>
            <li>Floral, sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li>It smells great and has enough ooomph to make it high quality.</li>
            <li>the scent is fresh and mild, although i wouldnt say it smells like honey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wild about honey, almond, coconut, banana and vanilla scents, but right now honey is winning.</li>
            <li>It is really warm and works well with my body chemistry, and I find that it lasts far longer than many other scents.  </li>
            <li>To be specific, I love the honey smell of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Vive Pro shampoo (golden bottle) and I have been searching for a body spray or perfume that smell like it.</li>
            <li>i refuse to call any other scent my signature :)!</li>
            <li>Smells better and the hint of honey is just enough.  </li>
            <li>If the scent would be more in the mid range I would say buy it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t liked any of the other scents in this line, however.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but every time I would spray it on me even once I would get an instant headache.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d say it really smells exactly like honey, but it does evoke something yummy to eat, which to me (and my husband)</li>
            <li>The scent is calming and quite unusual..</li>
            <li>Im very picky with scents.</li>
            <li>i get bored/disgusted by scents fast and often, with the exception of this body spray.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, I really dont smell any honey in this.</li>
            <li>I didnt really like it</li>
            <li>It is never too much</li>
            <li>and you feel like you are just walking in this personal fragrance of this not to sweet honey cloud..</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest getting this.</li>
            <li>This does tend to give me headaches too, but please note I do tend to be sensitive to certain scents.</li>
            <li>This scent is so soft and I already bought the shower gel and scrub.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive at all to perfumes, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Completely misleading.</li>
            <li>Wild Honey  </li>
            <li>and it is a delicate  and feminine fragrance, and I love to wear it with the lotion after a shower.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use this directly on my skin</li>
            <li>In the past few years I have been moving more towards organic and more natural scents as many of the others smell fake to me.  </li>
            <li>True, it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; smelling, but it is floral and sweet like the honeysuckle flower, so maybe that&#x27;s what they mean by calling the scent &amp;#</li>
            <li>I ADORE This perfume/body spray, always have and this in the only place I can find it (so far).</li>
            <li>Some people complained that it doesn&#x27;t last or smells cheap.</li>
            <li>and I find that scent doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long.  </li>

            <li> and I find that scent doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long.  </li>
            <li> It is just about impossible to find a truly organic body mist but this is better than ones that aren&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li> This by far is my favorite scent, and was sad to see that it disappeared off store shelves, it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Every single time I spray this on myself or in the room as room spray</li>
            <li> I did not particularly like the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly weak, you might have to use the whole bottle to smell anything</li>
            <li> So money wasted, Now I&#x27;m back to searching.</li>
            <li> The scent last a little longer than some other body sprays I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Alot of body sprays are not strong smelling enough.  </li>
            <li> Has a very strong alcohol scented base.</li>
            <li> I DON T NEED ANY OTHER PERFUME....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not special at all.  </li>
            <li> My current bottle was down to the last few sprays and I was unhappy</li>
            <li> On the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t want a scent that would make everyone fall out when I walked by!!  </li>
            <li> Nah, not this time- Dont waste your dough.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 1 star, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell bad, just nothing, nothing, nothing like honey - whatsoever.</li>
            <li> , I guess it&#x27;s not completely useless, I might use it in my car or something, but as a body spray this would be like spraying water on yourself with alcohol in it :(</li>
            <li> Hard to believe this product had been discontinued by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I can still smell it late in the day.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t expect this scent to have such an unpleasant effect on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; -- hard to believe it&#x27;s a $3 body spray!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe the smell</li>
            <li> I am crazy about the smell of honey, I once had the Alice in Wonderland wall flower, though i can find refills I can&#x27;t find my wall flower, so I&#x27;ve been searching for the smell of honey, and alas this is bull crap.</li>

            <li> I was so happy to have found this body spray at Amazon.com.  My current bottle was down to the last few sprays and I was unhappy I could not find any more of it anywhere.  The scent is calming and quite unusual..it came quickly and no leaks in the packaging...</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a gift pack with the body mist and lotion. I love it! It&#x27;s a light scent, for those of us who can&#x27;t do perfume-y and, best of all, my boyfriend loves the scent as well.</li>
            <li> i am totally in love with this body mist. the scent is so good and i always use it. :)</li>
            <li> I love this body spray!  I don&#x27;t like too-strong body sprays that make the wearer smell like food or an overgrown garden, so this one is perfect -- a nice light scent that&#x27;s very \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smelling and not too overpowering.  I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore, but I&#x27;ve had good luck buying on Amazon.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; -- hard to believe it&#x27;s a $3 body spray!</li>
            <li> Im very picky with scents. i get bored/disgusted by scents fast and often, with the exception of this body spray. this one has been my all time favorite since first spritz a good number of years ago. im so glad i can buy this here because its been discontinued in stores around me. the scent is fresh and mild, although i wouldnt say it smells like honey. also, you can spray a lot of it and not suffocate passersby or yourself. i refuse to call any other scent my signature :)!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe this product had been discontinued by the manufacturer.  So I&#x27;m stocking up whenever and wherever I can find it.  Fresh, gentle scent, sooths skin while leaving a great light aroma on your skin.  Other Healing Gardens Organics are great too - why was this line discontinued?</li>
            <li> I got this and I was really excited about the prospect of smelling of honey.  It&#x27;s not special at all.  Just standard.  It leaves a cheap perfume after smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I Just received mines and i love it!! The honey scent is so relaxing, Perfect for after a bath or during one with some lit candles..off i go ;~)</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on as soon as I received it in the mail.  This scent is so soft and I already bought the shower gel and scrub.  This is a scent for Spring time.  I am a person that dresses and polish nails and wear scents according to the season and this is going to be my Spring scent.  It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> Again, this product is the best smelling body mist.  I don&#x27;t leave home without it.  The aroma is like therapy.  I smell good and feel good when wearing the Wild Honey collection.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent (it&#x27;s more floral than honey) but it goes away after an hour or so. This is good if you want something to put on after a shower.</li>
            <li> I did not particularly like the smell of it.  Not for me...I would not recommend and will not repurchase item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wild about honey, almond, coconut, banana and vanilla scents, but right now honey is winning. If you want a wonderful smelling honey scented body spray...so far for me healing garden is well worth the $.  The scent last a little longer than some other body sprays I&#x27;ve tried and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> THIS SHOULD NOT BE DISCONTINUED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you like natural smells, botanical scents, this is the perfectly understated definitely Honey scent for you. I ADORE This perfume/body spray, always have and this in the only place I can find it (so far). Excellent!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but every time I would spray it on me even once I would get an instant headache. I don&#x27;t wear perfumes for this reason and thought that since this is a body mist it would be much more of a mild scent. I have used many body mists with no problem and I didn&#x27;t expect this scent to have such an unpleasant effect on me. If you are sensitive at all to perfumes, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is completely surprising to me how much I love this body spray, especially for the price!  In the past few years I have been moving more towards organic and more natural scents as many of the others smell fake to me.  I have gotten some beautiful scents ie. tokyo milk, etc.  But most days I find I end up reaching for this one when I&#x27;m just working or doing errands.  It is really warm and works well with my body chemistry, and I find that it lasts far longer than many other scents.  I can still smell it late in the day.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d say it really smells exactly like honey, but it does evoke something yummy to eat, which to me (and my husband) is a nice way to smell.  And I&#x27;m really happy that I can spray it on without abandon because of the price--I went through a bottle of Paper and Cotton in 2 months and I find that scent doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near as long.  I just think its nice to have something I love that&#x27;s inexpensive to \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; out some of my more expensive faves.  I haven&#x27;t liked any of the other scents in this line, however.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I received really great service from the vendor I did business with.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when they sold it in Walmart.  Now i have to buy it off online and happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this body mist in a retail store a year, or so, ago. She could no longer find Healing Garden anywhere. She was glad to have found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to make the switch to chemical free beauty products and I&#x27;m so happy that I found this. True, it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; smelling, but it is floral and sweet like the honeysuckle flower, so maybe that&#x27;s what they mean by calling the scent &amp;#34;Wild Honey&amp;#34;. I love it! Some people complained that it doesn&#x27;t last or smells cheap. I recently read something that said that body sprays are not meant to be sprayed on clothes or fabrics, because they can distort or fade the smell. Spray them right on your skin to make it smell good and last longer. Since reading that, I spritz it on my skin before getting dressed and I smell sweet for quite awhile. It a big bottle, too. And chemical free :)</li>
            <li> This by far is my favorite scent, and was sad to see that it disappeared off store shelves, it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Has a very strong alcohol scented base.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It is one of my favorite fragrances and the scent stays one my skin for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> It smelled like something else and did not last. I love honey made products this one fell short of its title.</li>
            <li> Alot of body sprays are not strong smelling enough.  This one is.  It smells great and has enough ooomph to make it high quality.</li>
            <li> Every single time I spray this on myself or in the room as room spray my boyfriend never fails to tell me how good I smell or the room does. I would highly suggest getting this. It smells SOOO good!</li>
            <li> I am crazy about the smell of honey, I once had the Alice in Wonderland wall flower, though i can find refills I can&#x27;t find my wall flower, so I&#x27;ve been searching for the smell of honey, and alas this is bull crap. It smells like water, with maybe a flower petal in it. It&#x27;s incredibly weak, you might have to use the whole bottle to smell anything, I guess it&#x27;s not completely useless, I might use it in my car or something, but as a body spray this would be like spraying water on yourself with alcohol in it :(</li>
            <li> The smell of this body mist is a pleasant departure from all the fruity smells on the market these days.  It&#x27;s difficult to describe the smell but it&#x27;s enchanting!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use sparingly, and last one &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34;.  Smells better and the hint of honey is just enough.  I have allergies and this one works fine.  No sneezing at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Light and spring aroma</li>
            <li> A FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME THIS PRODUCT AS A PRESENT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO....I LOVED IT...SO IM GLAD I FOUND IT IN AMAZON....I REALLY LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS.....I DON T NEED ANY OTHER PERFUME....SOFT AND NICE FLOWERY SCENT.....THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I love this scent and was so glad to find it here on Amazon as I could no longer find it in the store. Floral, sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but ok. However, it doesnt last and almost disappears. If the scent would be more in the mid range I would say buy it.  Nah, not this time- Dont waste your dough. This does tend to give me headaches too, but please note I do tend to be sensitive to certain scents.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I love the smell of honey. To be specific, I love the honey smell of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Vive Pro shampoo (golden bottle) and I have been searching for a body spray or perfume that smell like it. This smells NOTHING like honey at ALL. Completely misleading. Smells more like a perfume than the honey and flowers it&#x27;s labeled on the bottle as. So money wasted, Now I&#x27;m back to searching.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpowering with alcohol and smells like hair spray.  Did not like at all. I&#x27;m a massage therapist and thought this would be a great addition to my practice. No way.</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell like honey, smells a bit sweet like a sweet pea scented body spray, I really dont smell any honey in this. Its a bit &#x27;matronly&#x27; I didnt really like it</li>
            <li> I would have given it 1 star, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell bad, just nothing, nothing, nothing like honey - whatsoever. It smells kind of like a dessert though</li>
            <li> i have worn Coty&#x27;s Healing Garden Organics Wild Honey  Body Mist for about 10 years and it is a delicate  and feminine fragrance, and I love to wear it with the lotion after a shower.  It is never too much and you feel like you are just walking in this personal fragrance of this not to sweet honey cloud.. I love it.</li>
            <li> This smells fresh and light and sort of floral but the ingredients has parfum/fragrance which can be toxic so I wouldn&#x27;t use this directly on my skin, I just spray the outside of my clothing and jackets so the chemicals don&#x27;t absorb. It is just about impossible to find a truly organic body mist but this is better than ones that aren&#x27;t natural. Keep in mind, there&#x27;s still chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this body mist but it&#x27;s almost too light.  Seems like I can&#x27;t smell it after one or two hours after applying it.  On the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t want a scent that would make everyone fall out when I walked by!!  I would have liked a stronger honey smell.</li>
