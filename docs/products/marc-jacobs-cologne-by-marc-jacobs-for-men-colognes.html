            <li>good!</li>
            <li>I was impressed that I was able to find it here on amazon and at a very good price</li>

            <li>Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t amazed me.</li>
            <li>and i love the scent!  </li>
            <li>I had a bottle of this years ago and remembered that I really liked it, as did my wife.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and masculine, making it a perfect daytime perfume.</li>
            <li>Its so unique (in a good way) and all of my friends ask what it is all of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free shipping on top!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>rather \\&quot;what&#x27;s that nice light scent?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, I am SO glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my oldest daughter as this is her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a downer that Marc Jacobs is no longer selling this fragrance because it is delicious smelling.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find a bottle and snatch it up.</li>
            <li>Get with the program and bring it back!!! :D</li>
            <li>I love the scent as does my husband.  </li>
            <li>Men, I can pretty much guarantee that if you wear this scent women will notice, in a good way! :)</li>
            <li>If you like a strong smelling cologne, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>Its fine for the guys who like it,but this is not for me.</li>
            <li>So didn&#x27;t get to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>What a unique and timeless scent.</li>
            <li>Half the price here on Amazon versus Sephora, so a very good buy.</li>
            <li>However it fades really quickly...</li>
            <li>Still has the same nice scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hot.  </li>
            <li>Beware, this product makes women&#x27;s panties fall right off.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been wearing Estee Lauder Pleasures for Men for years, and while I love it, I was ready for him to wear something new.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this fragrance for a while, liked the scent very much and the fact that it is very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>cologne with out testing it first.</li>
            <li>Several times people have asked him what cologne he is wearing because they love it.  </li>
            <li>This has a very strong fig smell (which some have compared to old butter, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s fig), mixed with a woodsy scent.  </li>
            <li>Then like a fool I order a large bottle of Marc Jacobs reg.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s really strong,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The cliche that you get what you pay for, very well applies here.</li>
            <li>I expected something even more, but decided to try it.</li>
            <li>We absolutely give it five stars.</li>
            <li>Excited to have it and will try very hard to use it sparingly, as I may never be able to get it again.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like old butter left out to long in warm weather.</li>
            <li>the first time I purchased it through Amazon which has two options from two vendors, with a $10 difference for what appears to be the same product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not something that would make someone sitting next to you think \\&quot;wow</li>

            <li> , well, I learned my lesson, the cheaper one is in no way, shape or form similar to what I had used before, the scent is not as intense and to make it worse</li>
            <li> The purchase price is about 40% less than department store for the same bottle!</li>
            <li> Stir away from this product unless you go for weak scents that do not even last one hour on you.</li>
            <li> I recommend spraying on your clothes rather than skin to get a little longer life out of it.</li>

            <li> usually within and hour or two of application.</li>
            <li> I opted for the less expensive one (who doesn&#x27;t like to save a few bucks?)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard for me to find it.  </li>
            <li> I (female) tried this on before I gave it to my husband to see if I could stand to be around it all of the time and HATED it on me.</li>

            <li> I dont know if these online perfumers are fake, but I dont know because I bought it from an amazon seller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often use a cologne or aftershave, but I wanted something that I could wear in the daytime that would not be overpowering, but still be wearable for an evening out. I had a bottle of this years ago and remembered that I really liked it, as did my wife. So I decided to buy another bottle. I&#x27;m glad I did. Still has the same nice scent. Not something that would make someone sitting next to you think \\&quot;wow, that&#x27;s really strong,\\&quot; rather \\&quot;what&#x27;s that nice light scent?\\&quot; If you like a strong smelling cologne, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. But if you like something lighter, yet still pleasantly noticeable, you may well like this. Half the price here on Amazon versus Sephora, so a very good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, it&#x27;s so wonderful!  He&#x27;s been wearing Estee Lauder Pleasures for Men for years, and while I love it, I was ready for him to wear something new.  This has a very strong fig smell (which some have compared to old butter, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s fig), mixed with a woodsy scent.  It&#x27;s super hot.  Men, I can pretty much guarantee that if you wear this scent women will notice, in a good way! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for a while, liked the scent very much and the fact that it is very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time I purchased it through Amazon which has two options from two vendors, with a $10 difference for what appears to be the same product.&lt;br /&gt;After checking both products on the site and not noticing any difference in description of product, size, etc. I opted for the less expensive one (who doesn&#x27;t like to save a few bucks?), well, I learned my lesson, the cheaper one is in no way, shape or form similar to what I had used before, the scent is not as intense and to make it worse it DOES NOT LAST on you for long.&lt;br /&gt;The ones I had purchased from another site, will last ALL DAY. The cliche that you get what you pay for, very well applies here. Stir away from this product unless you go for weak scents that do not even last one hour on you.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells awesome!!! I told my husband he can only wear it when he is with me!</li>
            <li> This was one of the the worst cologne&#x27;s I have ever purchased.I purchased Marc Jacobs Bang which I like.Then like a fool I order a large bottle of Marc Jacobs reg. cologne with out testing it first.I have put this on my wrist a few times thinking I might change my mind,but no way.This stuff smells like old butter left out to long in warm weather.Its fine for the guys who like it,but this is not for me.I think this crap stinks. Rod.</li>
            <li> I (female) tried this on before I gave it to my husband to see if I could stand to be around it all of the time and HATED it on me. I ended up giving it a second chance and gave it a one night trial on my husband, I am SO glad that I did. On him it is irresistibly alluring, I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing him! Its so unique (in a good way) and all of my friends ask what it is all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s very light and masculine, making it a perfect daytime perfume. However it fades really quickly... usually within and hour or two of application. I recommend spraying on your clothes rather than skin to get a little longer life out of it.</li>
            <li> Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t amazed me. I expected something even more, but decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Beware, this product makes women&#x27;s panties fall right off. I have been wearing this scent for years and obviously the biggest compliment you can get on your cologne is seeing underwear hit the ground. Thank you Marc Jacobs!!!!</li>
            <li> Im a big fan of the marc jacobs cologne and it&#x27;s very hard for me to find it.  I was impressed that I was able to find it here on amazon and at a very good price and i love the scent!  A must have for any man that is wanting a fesh scent.</li>
            <li> Fantiastic scent, mellow, and is not overpowering.  If you want it to linger, spray it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I recieved a women&#x27;s Marc Jacobs perfume . So didn&#x27;t get to enjoy it. Hopefully the fix this error. Bottles don&#x27;t even looke the d</li>
            <li> I want another one !!!</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal! I purchased this for my oldest daughter as this is her favorite perfume. The purchase price is about 40% less than department store for the same bottle! Why would anyone purchase anywhere else??? Free shipping on top! I recieved the bottle of perfume within 3 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a downer that Marc Jacobs is no longer selling this fragrance because it is delicious smelling. Mmm...Mmm...good! Glad I was able to find a bottle and snatch it up. Excited to have it and will try very hard to use it sparingly, as I may never be able to get it again. Come on Marc Jacobs. Get with the program and bring it back!!! :D</li>
            <li> this is the greatest cologne every , the comments rain in all night , its awesome , put the topping on my style</li>
            <li> My ex-wife bought me this several years ago, and I never get tired of it.  What a unique and timeless scent.</li>
