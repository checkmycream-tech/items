            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>You just keep working at it and the knots come out nicely!</li>
            <li>She is happy with this brush!! :-)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t brush my daughter&#x27;s hair with this brush, who knows what kind of chemicals are in the brush!</li>
            <li>especially right after I washed it-- every time I ran the brush through it, gobs of hair would come out each time!</li>
            <li>My two girls were delighted when these brushes arrived.</li>
            <li>The shark brush is also a good price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It feels good going over my scalp, and does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li>It feels good going through my hair and on my scalp</li>
            <li>Good construction.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and is a great size.  </li>
            <li>But after one or two ouches, I learned to brush lightly and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really loved this brush</li>
            <li>I still have to be carefull but this brush is really good.</li>
            <li>one is cheaper, and the review is good.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush.</li>
            <li>But when I looked that up, the reviews for that weren&#x27;t so good.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how any of the competing products could be significantly superior to this one.</li>
            <li>Good brush for the money</li>
            <li>It has held up exceptionally and all of the bristles are still in tact.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with customer service.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great quality brush for the price compare to the ones you buy at stores for $8-12 or more.</li>
            <li>Oh and it&#x27;s a great price :)</li>
            <li>I have used this brush on my own hair and it is surprising the difference a brush can make.  </li>
            <li>She has beautiful curly hair but can get tangled easily...</li>
            <li>I love this brush and will order more for friends and family!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This type brush is our favorite for removing knots and tangles!  </li>
            <li>I love it, its a brush, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>I love this hair brush!</li>
            <li>Thank you for a top shelf product!</li>
            <li>It is like magic!</li>
            <li>Better for both of us!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this $5 brush!</li>
            <li>We love this brush!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about buying this Shark Hair brush,  but now, I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived on time (love amazon prime!)</li>
            <li>We LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing a couple more for my daughter and granddaughters.&lt;br /&gt;mahalo!</li>
            <li>These brushes were in the Christmas stockings of my two 11-year-old granddaughters, and they LOVE them!  </li>
            <li>I can see the difference even more when I use one of my brushes on her hair and it pulls and there are tears!</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush on a whim, but I actually really love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, the price was great</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s just so easy to smooth everything out and best of all, without tears!</li>
            <li>Works great on fine hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>There are no snags when brushing and the ease of which it glides through your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is the kind of thing I have come to expect from Sharkk products.</li>
            <li>It worked very well on both types and the girls are very happy with their brushes.</li>
            <li>She also loves to have her own &amp;#34;hearbrus&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nice size and construction.</li>
            <li>This brush effectively removes tangles but doesn&#x27;t rip our hair out.</li>
            <li>She can now brush her own hair and it amazed it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>sent one to my daughter - her boys each want their own.</li>
            <li>It was nice to find it in a nice color as well.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it,</li>
            <li>I liked hers so well</li>
            <li>It does not; but for the price it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, and it comes in my favorite color of course!</li>
            <li>:) I LOVE it too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size for both my seven year old and me to use (think after workout tangles!)</li>
            <li>This is far and beyond the best brush I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to brush my hair without bringing tears to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have waist length, very fine hair and a tender head</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this brush!  </li>
            <li>This brush  is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, both for the shower and just general brushing.  </li>
            <li>Love the choices in color too.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this brush</li>
            <li>I love to see it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull and she gladly picks it up and uses it when I ask her to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m killing her :)</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Makes our mornings so much better to not have tears when it&#x27;s time to brush their hair :)</li>
            <li>I will agree that this helps detangle better than most brushes.</li>
            <li>I am adding a couple more of these brushes to my cart now.  </li>
            <li>I thought this brush would be the next best thing since sliced bread...</li>
            <li>Also the brush was sitting on the bathroom counter top</li>
            <li>it stained the counter top</li>
            <li>My daughter used to spend the better part of a half-hour detangling her hair.</li>
            <li>We are SOLD on these brushes and I will purchase more to ensure they always have one within reach.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item, we just love it, I had a chance to read reviews for the item</li>
            <li>Leaves her hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>many colors to chose</li>
            <li>Still had to tug a couple of times, but overall very happy.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad</li>
            <li>Girls love the color too.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the result.  </li>
            <li>I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to sneak hers to brush my hair :)</li>
            <li>- was going to get the $20.00 no tangle brush - glad</li>
            <li>Going to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x60;s better then the rest of them that she has before she</li>
            <li>Wished I ordered more.</li>
            <li>i found this brush for her&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It has saved me many of tears and fits.</li>
            <li>This one is better compared to the one she used.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the way it works on my shoulder length, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>We love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush, and I&#x27;ll be buying it again if I ever need to replace mine.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask of a brush?</li>
            <li>: you can&#x27;t get the feeling without touching it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has the most challenging hair to brush, a mix between curls and texture.  </li>
            <li>this brush is ok</li>
            <li>even more so when I got it.  </li>
            <li>It worked so well for us that I bought four more - never wanted to be caught without one.</li>
            <li>We got this  brush and have now been using it for more than two years and she won&#x27;t use anything else - no exaggeration.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll fall in love with this hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>Some days she still runs away,  but most of the time she sits still and doesn&#x27;t even wince.  </li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad that I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>These might be better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>And what I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it brushes through well.</li>
            <li>and I read through tons of the reviews for many of them.</li>
            <li>* still love it - ordering another one because for some reason I&#x27;ve never been able to keep up w/ a hair brush.</li>
            <li>and it seems like it&#x27;s working okay for her.</li>
            <li>Purchased this brush for my hair which is very fine but also very full.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is this, She loved the brush, and said it worked wonderfully, going right through the sleep matted hair like it had just been brushed.</li>
            <li>One of my daughters&#x27; hair is very fine, and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>There is only one thing to be said about this brush: It is easily the best brush I have ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle on scalp and gives a nice massage while brushing!</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty good, but my daughter still tells me it hurts to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d originally purchased it for myself, but gave it to her, so I have to get another for myself!</li>
            <li>It is easy for my daughter to use; and I love that she doesn&#x27;t lose handfuls of hair like she used to detangling with a wide-toothed comb</li>
            <li>This brush had good reviews and was at a good price point, so I bought enough for everyone to have one for their purse, one in each bathroom and have a couple spares.</li>
            <li>I paid $5.oo more for the excellent Wet Brush</li>
            <li>The new, non-pink brush is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair and Sharkk&#x27;s customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li>all the good things other reviewers have said about it (e.g. rubbery handle, good size, detangling powers, etc) are true!!</li>
            <li>34;add-on&amp;#34; item, meaning that if you add it to a greater than $25 purchase, it is free two day shipping like a prime item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pink color is great!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s already becoming my every day brush.  </li>
            <li>The sharkk hair brush is working great on my tender headed four year old.  </li>
            <li>It detangles very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been easy.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy on my hair and does not pull out my hair.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; have space in between them which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair and it combs through so easily.</li>
            <li>This brush gets all the knots out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to clean, and I wish I had purchased more than one.  </li>
            <li>Brush works well but has a strong and distinctive chemical odor which makes it inappropriate for use with my toddler&#x27;s hair as intended.</li>
            <li>The vinyl smell is so strong, my daughter asked if it&#x27;s going to leave on her hair.  </li>
            <li>And, while it is not a miracle brush, major snags still require working through, it has made the hair brushing process much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>seem pretty sturdy and are a nice size on both the handle and brush</li>
            <li>The hair brush made my hair frizzy and full of static.  </li>
            <li>I have a house full of girls and this hair brush is their favorite.  </li>
            <li>Even those pesky dust rings that sometimes like to build up on the bristles are easy to get off because the bristles on the SHARK aren&#x27;t topped off with an unnecessarily huge ball.</li>
            <li>Flexible bristles detangle fine wavy hair well.</li>
            <li>(I have fine hair)</li>
            <li>Works fine, but I was hoping for something sized for children.</li>
            <li>This brush glides through her fine hair without any drama.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my fine, tangle-prone hair.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, this sounded like a brush that my fine hair would benefit from.</li>
            <li>She has fine hair</li>
            <li>this brush is fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a spare brush to leave at the office, but it quickly became my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>This brush works quickly and takes out the tangles so well!</li>
            <li>While looking for that brush though, I came across this super magical brush.  </li>
            <li>, it REALLY does go through the hair and detangles BETTER than even using a detangler spray in my opinion!  </li>
            <li>The amount of loose hair on the brush was incredible.  </li>
            <li>I got mine for only 4.99 I am so happy.</li>
            <li>easy to clean of hair, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in two seconds.</li>
            <li>It tear free.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush so much that I let my mom try it</li>
            <li>The quality was cheap, and it reeked of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Amazon returned our money and Sharkk reached out to us and sent us a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fast and effective without ripping.</li>
            <li>SHARKK sent me this brush for free to make up for a mess-up Amazon had with one of my orders.</li>
            <li>That was enough to make me happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>the brush goes smoothly through it without hurting it.</li>
            <li>This inexpensive hairbrush was a big happy surprise.  </li>
            <li>The price and the quality are fantastic</li>
            <li>With this brush, it literally takes 1 minute to go through their long, curly hair leaving it beautiful and detangled immediately!A mother&#x27;s dream..</li>
            <li>The brush went right through my hair, much better than the pick ever did.  </li>
            <li>Once more the brush went right through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li>The freezer?\\&quot; sound familiar anyone?</li>
            <li>This is an excellent brush that gently straightens / detangles long locks of hair.</li>
            <li>my new favorite product!  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush to stick in my suitcase</li>
            <li>I am going to order more very soon since it&#x27;s such a great deal.</li>
            <li>This brush works great on my daughter&#x27;s long, tangly, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>She loves the brush and is now actually excited for me to brush her curly, tangly hair, and will even brush it herself.</li>
            <li>This hairbrush has numerous semi-soft pins with protector points, a nice non-slip handle, and I love the color.  </li>
            <li>It does not hurt anymore to brush my hair out after a shower and it works great on dry hair too!</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made mornings a lot less stressful and a lot more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited about this brush.</li>
            <li>This nice brush gently does the trick for me, and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The best brush we&#x27;ve found for my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li>I would love to see more colors available in the future.</li>
            <li>A good solid brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good brush</li>
            <li>---the brush works its way through knots with relative ease (there will always be SOME work!), and is fairly painless for her.  </li>
            <li>so much i am going order her two more</li>
            <li>Would definitely order again and in bulk too since the price is so good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re TRUE.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush, my daughter loves it, and she has super thick hair and hates to brush it, this brush glides right through, just ordered one for myself!</li>
            <li>She likes the brush very much and finds it easy to use without pulling her hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just as I expected with quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I know other brands exist, but in my mind this one is just as great as the rest.</li>
            <li>I like it doesn&#x27;t pull all my hair out while brushing, and the bristles are soft but strong, none have came out and the best part is its a really pretty pink color.</li>
            <li>We DID NOT use this with a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sharkk Customer Service quickly sent me a replacement brush (which I appreciate).  </li>
            <li>and I liked the pink better.</li>
            <li>This brush allows a quick comb through without any pulling or pain.</li>
            <li>The super flexibility of the bristles is literally the difference between this brush and all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After purchasing a different detangling brush and being very pleased, I decided to give the SHARKK brush a try.</li>
            <li>Still much better than using just a normal brush.</li>
            <li>we had a couple of other brushes but this one is so far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the absolute best brush ive ever had in my entire life....</li>
            <li>I am so happy to know that this torture is bestowed on other children &amp; it wasn&#x27;t just me!</li>
            <li>I used to spend a good 15 minutes brushing my kids hair (they have very long curly hair)</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and easy to comb through the toughest hair.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this for my daughter who also has long, curly hair and it worked so wonderfully on hers</li>
            <li>Fast shipping nice and light brush very convenient, doesn&#x27;t hurt hair, very soft !</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t really tried it in the shower, but the real amazing feat is how well it works in my daughters thin, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles give your head a nice little message too. :)</li>
            <li>short: This brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing; not only does it detangle my daughters hair with ease, it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>The handle fits the palm comfortably and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy this brush as much as we do.</li>
            <li>I suppose pink is worth it, but colors would be good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brush that does seem to get through tangles verily easy, however it causes my hair to become frizzy versus the straight effect I get from most brushes after I comb through my whole head.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that can be a bit \\&quot;mousey\\&quot; at times, but since I have started using the wet brush instead of a comb I have noticed it&#x27;s behaving better. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and it will be worth paying for .</li>
            <li>I recently purchased another one for my 16 year old niece and am thinking about purchasing more when more colors are available again.  </li>
            <li>The risk is certainly minimal, and the quality, surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old daughter is absolutely in love with this brush.</li>
            <li>We were given a similar brush and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Oh and of course it comes in pink, our favorite color :)</li>
            <li>Worth  </li>
            <li>If you struggle getting tangles out, be not afraid with SHARRK hair brush</li>
            <li>I cant believe I have lived so long without this brush- which I love to use myself!  </li>
            <li>It brushes right through my curls without tearing my hair out and without hurting my head.  </li>
            <li>are both plagued with tangles and this brushes them right out without tears.</li>
            <li>Again the brush went right through my hair.</li>
            <li>yeah right.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fancy or anything, but it works and the price is right.</li>
            <li>a bright pink hairbrush is pretty helpful.</li>
            <li>My best friend has very thick beautiful coarse long wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the pain in her hands makes it hard to take care of her beautiful hair, and she threatens to cut it all off.</li>
            <li>But, it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It worked exactly the same and was absolutely amazing on my normally knotty hair right after the shower!</li>
            <li>it to try out to see if the others are really worth investing in - (&amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; is MY personal favorite)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that is was easy on the scalp and it worked.</li>
            <li>The price for this brush is also very reasonable</li>
            <li>I had used a friends wet brush recently, and absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>head of the brush easily fits in my hand, which is not typical</li>
            <li>It is excellent at gently detangling wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It did a wonderful job on my long, thick dry hair and felt so good while brushing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush the first time for my 5 year old daughter who has long, rather fine hair that tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has hair to her waist and it is the first brush after 13 years</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>This brush works exactly how they say it will.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to harass the kids to go brush their hair - they now do it willingly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The brush is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It is funny.</li>
            <li>Thanks SHARKK!</li>
            <li>There are many similar de-tangler type brushes, but they don&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say my girls love getting their hair brushed now</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second brush days after we got this one just to be safe (in case we misplace one at the pool).</li>
            <li>201 people have already given this product 5 stars so at first I didn&#x27;t think I would even need to bother to write a review.  </li>
            <li>She is much happier using this brush!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It really gets the knots out!</li>
            <li>(her hair is just like mine, just not as long) and she liked it so much that I&#x27;m going to order one for her too.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this brush works great for detangling.  </li>
            <li>it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than any of my regular hair brushes.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the first one to really work!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know first hand</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first product review I have ever done.</li>
            <li>So it brought her independence and confidence and me a peaceful home.</li>
            <li>only purchased 1 of these to try, but at $5, I&#x27;m going to order about 4 more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Give me the brush Mommy, I want to brush my own hair because I can with my new brush!&amp;#34; I am ordering 2 more for extras and all my other brushes are finding new homes.</li>
            <li>Great brush, totally gets the tanges out of my dry hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft on my young daughters fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I never use a brush on wet hair and the only way to really get my hair tangle free was to douse with tons of conditioner while in the shower,  and spend a good 25 minutes with a wide-tooth</li>
            <li>It will be nice if it comes in other color.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to brush and detangle hair... even very long hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my grand daughters who have really long hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that likes to tangle more than I would prefer.  </li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be that much different than any other brush, but there is something magical about it that takes the ouch out of brushing.</li>
            <li>With the sharkk brush, I can easily brush through my hair virtually pain free, without a lot of breakage, and in half the time.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what exactly makes this brush so much better, but now that I have tried it I will not be going back to anything else, not to mention it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li>I have tried every &#x27;gimmick&#x27; detangling brush I could find for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s thick, straight hair, and this has been the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>Great for long, wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have had this brush several weeks now and it still smells strongly of plastic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Every single one had reviews that were causing me to bust a gut laughing because of all the hilarious stories from parents about chasing their daughters all over creation when it was time to brush out their hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it first and it seemed to work fine (on wet hair right out of the shower).  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush, works well when hair is wet and dry.</li>
            <li>This brush works great on wet hair or dry.</li>
            <li>It works great on both wet hair &amp; dry-</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to have strong enough &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; to get the tangles out very well (they bend I think)</li>
            <li>My 6 yo daughter&#x27;s fine and curly locks develop into a dense mat in the back after swimming and sleeping.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and its great to use when wet or dry</li>
            <li>The brush works great in my wife&#x27;s very thick hair without any discomfort from the bristles or tangling.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I sort of viewed this SHARK brush as like a knock-off of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It works very well at detangling.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t take too much hair out.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and no matter what hair brush or comb</li>
            <li>It gently works through the knots without pulling out my hair, which gets VERY knotty because of my hair type.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I have come to know that they are very quality oriented, so</li>
            <li>The bristles feel very flexible, and I doubted they could tackle their tangles, but they work really well.</li>
            <li>i got it for my sister, she says it really does the detangling.</li>
            <li>My daughter has hair that is over 3 feet in length and this brush makes de-tangling her hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain much anymore that my wife is pulling her hair when brushing.  </li>
            <li>The brush works really well in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have very curly multiracial hair, my kids do too.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s much easier to get the tangle out, this brush doesn&#x27;t provide any massage to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this brush makes detangling so much easier</li>
            <li>and we can get it done much faster</li>
            <li>but I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush looks similar to cheap brushes that scratch the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This brush helps me deal with the tangles without making me want to just cut the whole thing off.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>No pulling and not too much hair in the brush when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>Using this hairbrush makes my scalp feel like it&#x27;s getting a gentle massage.  </li>
            <li>However, I tried this brush and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li>and I can never find a hair brush that will both be gentle on my scalp and hair while still getting out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;m a swimmer, but this brush really helps to detangle my hair after a swim and/or shower.</li>
            <li>and was in perfect condition, it is wrapped in plastic so it wont get dirty when being shipped.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this brush, and that&#x27;s really all that matters.  </li>
            <li>oh you cant not break them at all their made from a very tough&amp;hard rubber</li>
            <li>This brush works very well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>and it tends to get very tangled</li>
            <li>, we like it so much the whole family uses one.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes and have bought 3 for me and one for my niece.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and the bristles did not stag my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>The brush works very well...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend washing the brush before you use it if the smell really bothers you.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and she actually wants to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>Until trying a detangling brush, getting the knots out was a nightmare - I would use detangling sprays (didn&#x27;t really work for us) and lots of conditioner and hair oils, which are helpful.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like these as much as I hoped to.</li>
            <li>This brush has helped make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>This things works great when you use it on WET hair and it is the only brush that my 5 year old daughter wants to use.</li>
            <li>It really is a detangling brush and worth purchasing if you have a daughter with a sensitive head.</li>
            <li>I bought this, kind of doubting if it would actually work, but thought I would try since we have lots of tears over brushed hair in my household.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and it tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get over how good this brush works and how it cuts back on the time spent brushing!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s marginally better than my other brush, but not a miracle cure for tangles.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of long fine hair and dreaded washing it because then I would have to brush it afterwards.</li>
            <li>have long fine hair</li>
            <li>We both have long, fine hair that tangles often</li>
            <li>I am so happy to report that this brush has in fact eliminated the tears and whining that usually go along with daily brushing of my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I found that it wasn&#x27;t very strong and dissipated after a few days.</li>
            <li>I have very long and fine hair, this brush gets out all the knots without tearing out all of my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s long hair is tangle free in 60 seconds with no complaining.</li>
            <li>The reviews are true, I brushed through my daughter&#x27;s hair without a flinch.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally brush my hair straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The brush arrived completely sealed and sanitary, and I really appreciate that!  </li>
            <li>Start at the top of the head and work your way down.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy brushing my long hair again!</li>
            <li>you will not even feel a slight tug, you&#x27;ll feel like you have worked magic brushing through your hair.</li>
            <li>works better on wet hair, but also works better than a regular brush on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li>I stumbled on a similar product and thought that it would be great for my daughter, as she has thick hair and showers a lot at night after swimming and tend to wake up with her hair clumped and knotted.  </li>
            <li>I find this particular brush</li>
            <li>no more tangles and no more smelly chemical sprays on our beautiful daughter&#x27;s head!!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase it again &amp; would add this to a list of necessary (&amp; favorite) grooming products.</li>
            <li>Another brand, in particular, appeared to have the market cornered on these things</li>
            <li>and now I have a proof it does work, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is rather amazing because regardless of long or short hair (I just had it cut), dry or wet, it does a remarkably good job at straightening my hair out without me having to struggle with it like I would do earlier...</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mentioned it had a really strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>It feels very durable and has held up well with our 18 month old daughter who likes to play with</li>
            <li>My 6 year old loves it so much she walks around the house brushing her hair all the time.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very soothing and soft to my scalp.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>However, it works great on my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a normal brush.</li>
            <li>Bought for our 5 year old who has beautiful curly hair but can get difficult to manage.</li>
            <li>and it does help with the pulling and tugging unlike normal</li>
            <li>The slight odor in the beginning was a small price to pay for such a wonderful hair brush.  </li>
            <li>They have a sharp feel on your scalp if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is amazing for wet and dry hair and no pulling.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to spot, which might not seem like such a big deal , but if you are in a hurry</li>
            <li>This brush works nicely with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>The price was right, but had I had known what my hair would look like later I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li>cheaply made,,used it for a month and tossed it,,may work for a child&#x27;s thin fine hair</li>
            <li>My wife wasn&#x27;t going to buy a new brush</li>
            <li>This new brush has eliminated the majority of tangles.</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t prevented me from using the brush hoping it would live up to its description.</li>
            <li>I guess I still can&#x27;t compare to the Wet brush since I haven&#x27;t tried it, but this wasn&#x27;t the miracle it was claimed to be and might have damaged my hair making it more likely to tangle.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and easey to use.</li>
            <li>and I seemed to pull out endless clumps of hair just trying to get it smooth enough to wash (I wouldn&#x27;t DARE wash it with tangles, I would never be able to comb thru it wet!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush; and too boot, it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>if we ever need another brush we will definitely get this one soft to all hair and good with wet and dry.</li>
            <li>With 2 young girls this has made my life a lot easier!  </li>
            <li>and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>if I could go back in time, probably the first thing I&#x27;d do is give my mother this brush to use when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first ordered it I didn&#x27;t have big expectations, but WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow! save @10-15 mins not fighting my hair every day.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, it was so painless that I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be brushing through my hair.  </li>
            <li>but the brush went back to its original form shortly after taking it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>This is our purchase of a second one, because one of our girls always had the first brush in her room.  </li>
            <li>I have daily battles about her tangled hair but from the moment she first used this brush the battles have ended</li>
            <li>From conditioners, detangling sprays, big tooth combs, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;I was first interested in the Mercier detangling brush, seeing their commercial online.  </li>
            <li>no complaints so far!</li>
            <li>far nothing!</li>
            <li>oh so nice and works on my thick, coarse, curly hair without too much frizz.  </li>
            <li>Made brushing my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair so easy!  </li>
            <li>The new brushes are holding up well so far.</li>
            <li>Just start at the bottom and work up as usual, works better than our old  brush.</li>
            <li>This hairbrush is great - if you&#x27;re tired of the whining and tears associated with brushing out your kid&#x27;s long hair, give this brush a try!</li>
            <li>Finally, can more or less please my 3 yo.</li>
            <li>Not only is it super affordable but it TOTALLY works!</li>
            <li>Tried a couple of different detangling brushes for my daughter&#x27;s very thick, slightly wavy hair and this one worked the best.</li>
            <li>this is an edited version of my previous review because I barely gave the brush a good look over or tried it out before I wrote the previous review.</li>
            <li>So far this brush is holding up very well, and looks like it will last for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will go away completely, because that&#x27;s really the only drawback to this item.</li>
            <li>They have a strange eclectic bevy of products, to which I haven&#x27;t ever figured out the exact theme.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my 7 year old daughter whose hair would often tangled into something akin to a Gordian knot.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 yr old daughter that fusses every time I brush her hair</li>
            <li>I ordered for my 6 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>My 5 yr old loves this brush...</li>
            <li>I can brush the knots completely out and take two steps and its tangled again.  </li>
            <li>It is the only brush I have found that is gentle on the head and gets the knots out without pulling the hair.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old, and</li>
            <li>Will only use this brush from now on, fast shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are actually really soft on your scalp, noticeably so.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved my SHARKK Detangling Hair Brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so much faster than a wooden comb I was using, just a couple of strokes</li>
            <li>She told me, and  I ordered brushes for myself and two young granddaughters.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt because of its soft bristles.</li>
            <li>We like this brush so much be have purchased multiple.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my 91 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s hair with no problems.</li>
            <li>My three year old loves this brush.</li>
            <li>It has held up wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li>I have an over reacting, drama queen of a 5 yr old.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my four year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush and haven&#x27;t heard her complain about tugs or knots in her hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews, for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>old daughter and</li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;m getting ready to order a second one</li>
            <li>My mornings all of a sudden become so much</li>
            <li>My nearly three year old daughter used to cry when I&#x27;d brush her hair with a boarshead brush.  </li>
            <li>and I think an overly sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>, we&#x27;re keeping her long hair, thanks to the SHARKK Hair Brush!</li>
            <li>As an adult when Id brush my hair</li>
            <li>I went from madness that hasn&#x27;t been brushed in a few days to tangle free in seconds!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying a few more to keep around the house and in the car.</li>
            <li>Of course the color is fun and as marvelously PINK as advertised.</li>
            <li>As I used the brush on my hair (thick, shoulder length hair), it DID NOT pull out my hair nor did it leave my hair with that \\&quot;static cling look\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It feels nice against my scalp, not scratchy, and works well with my short thick hair.</li>
            <li>I bought two more for my niece and daughter who have really thick unruly hair.</li>
            <li>she has long hair and this brush made it easy to brush out her wet hair.</li>
            <li>They both have thick hair -- one fine and blond and one more coarse and dark.  </li>
            <li>Im not 100% satisfied as my hair seems just as tangly as with my other brushes and makes me question if is this even a &#x27;wet brush&#x27;??</li>
            <li>My daughter has hair that gets tangled easily and this works on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I screamed &amp; cried &amp; kicked &amp; moaned the whole time my hair was getting brushed until I eventually grew into one of those people that can barely feel any tugging at all.</li>
            <li>To my opinion, it brushes nicely, but nothing special, but I couldn&#x27;t use it more than once, because the material it&#x27;s made of simply smells horrible (or as my 4 years old says - it smells like tires) and I had to send it back.</li>
            <li>the brush is a little softer than expected but has no problems brushing through light knots (my hair is mostly straight), i can&#x27;t tell you how it would do on tangled curls though.</li>
            <li>Every time I tried to brush out her hair was a major struggle with her in tears (and me too!)</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t even flinch now when I brush her hair which is a major difference from her screaming her head off!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t personally used this item, but my 7 year old daughter had told me numerous times that this brush works really well.</li>
            <li>My other brushes are full of hair and the sharkk brush only has a strand or two.</li>
            <li>rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because it had a super funky smell (plastic-y) at the beginning, but it&#x27;s faded a little.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick, long, straight hair that tangles really easily, if it helps.</li>
            <li>I have a younger daughter that I always brushed her long hair because it took so long and required de-tangling spray, but she has now taken over the job as this brush has made it so easy</li>
            <li>The only thing that made this 4 stars for me is when I brush my dry hair with this, my hair becomes quite poofy and static, so I only use this brush on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Concerning the odor other reviewers have commented on, I did notice a rubbery smell to the brush when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used it I thought nothing was happening because my head was tilted over w/ my hair in front of my face &amp; I couldnt feel anything other than my hand on the handle.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty good, probably not great for really thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li>Although they both take out the knots, wet or dry, without the pain of other brushes; the Sharkk feels better on the scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is short &amp; thick, but I think this brush will also be very good on my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a regular adult size hair brush.</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase another one in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have tangly hair, so getting through my hair, wet, with a brush really helps.</li>
            <li>Also, it feels really soft on the scalp unlike regular brushes that tend to tug on your hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>When I first got this brush it was smaller than I expected</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hairbrush and totally recommend it especially if you have thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has many little bristles that flex as you brush, so there&#x27;s less pulling and tugging.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it pulls too much hair out when I try it on dry hair, plus I end up with a big head of frizz!</li>
            <li>We used a lot of conditioner, a comb and wasted a lot of money finding the right brush.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be just like any other brush, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>The Wet Brush is well made &amp; fantastic with wet &amp; dry hair but the Sharkk is not.  </li>
            <li>Easy on my scalp and yet sturdy enough to tackle my extremely thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sells quite a few different brushes that are more or less functionally the same as this one...</li>
            <li>Also, we like the size....not too small, but small enough to be comfortable and controllable for small hands.  :)</li>
            <li>When I received this brush, I could immediately feel a big difference just brushing through it dry, but when my hair was wet and tangled, I could really tell a difference!</li>
            <li>The Sharkk Brush has weak bristles and works okay with dry hair</li>
            <li>My daughter very much likes using the SHARKK Hair Brush Professional Detangling Shower Brush For Wet Or Dry Hair (Pink).</li>
            <li>After doing a little more digging on Amazon, I can across the Shark and after reading other reviews and seeing the cost, which was 1/3 the cost of the other brush</li>
            <li>Getting tangles out of wet or dry hair is fast and painless.  </li>
            <li>She also has pretty bad Rheumatoid Arthritis in her hands, the result of work and many years as a practitioner of several martial arts, as well as being an all around bad-ass.</li>
            <li>[Note: I have thin, fine hair, if that makes a difference?]</li>
            <li>and I think she has tried every brush on the market before finding this terrific brush which easily goes through her wet thick curly hair and even straightens it.</li>
            <li>I have two little girls whose hair gets very tangled.  </li>
            <li>I was about ready to cut off my little girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>it still pull her hair a little but not so much.</li>

            <li> This brush is very effective in de-tangling.  </li>

            <li> After using it, my hair looks smoother :) great brush for  great price!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> You just keep working at it and the knots come out nicely!</li>
            <li> She is happy with this brush!! :-)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t brush my daughter&#x27;s hair with this brush, who knows what kind of chemicals are in the brush!</li>
            <li> especially right after I washed it-- every time I ran the brush through it, gobs of hair would come out each time!</li>
            <li> My two girls were delighted when these brushes arrived.</li>
            <li> The shark brush is also a good price.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It feels good going over my scalp, and does not pull my hair.</li>
            <li> It feels good going through my hair and on my scalp</li>
            <li> Good construction.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and is a great size.  </li>
            <li> But after one or two ouches, I learned to brush lightly and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really loved this brush</li>
            <li> I still have to be carefull but this brush is really good.</li>
            <li> one is cheaper, and the review is good.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> But when I looked that up, the reviews for that weren&#x27;t so good.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how any of the competing products could be significantly superior to this one.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the money</li>
            <li> It has held up exceptionally and all of the bristles are still in tact.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with customer service.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush for the price compare to the ones you buy at stores for $8-12 or more.</li>
            <li> Oh and it&#x27;s a great price :)</li>
            <li> I have used this brush on my own hair and it is surprising the difference a brush can make.  </li>
            <li> She has beautiful curly hair but can get tangled easily...</li>
            <li> I love this brush and will order more for friends and family!!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This type brush is our favorite for removing knots and tangles!  </li>
            <li> I love it, its a brush, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush!</li>
            <li> Thank you for a top shelf product!</li>
            <li> It is like magic!</li>
            <li> Better for both of us!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this $5 brush!</li>
            <li> We love this brush!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about buying this Shark Hair brush,  but now, I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived on time (love amazon prime!)</li>
            <li> We LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing a couple more for my daughter and granddaughters.&lt;br /&gt;mahalo!</li>
            <li> These brushes were in the Christmas stockings of my two 11-year-old granddaughters, and they LOVE them!  </li>
            <li> I can see the difference even more when I use one of my brushes on her hair and it pulls and there are tears!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush on a whim, but I actually really love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly, the price was great</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s just so easy to smooth everything out and best of all, without tears!</li>
            <li> Works great on fine hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> There are no snags when brushing and the ease of which it glides through your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is the kind of thing I have come to expect from Sharkk products.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on both types and the girls are very happy with their brushes.</li>
            <li> She also loves to have her own &amp;#34;hearbrus&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice size and construction.</li>
            <li> This brush effectively removes tangles but doesn&#x27;t rip our hair out.</li>
            <li> She can now brush her own hair and it amazed it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> sent one to my daughter - her boys each want their own.</li>
            <li> It was nice to find it in a nice color as well.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it,</li>
            <li> I liked hers so well</li>
            <li> It does not; but for the price it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and it comes in my favorite color of course!</li>
            <li> :) I LOVE it too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size for both my seven year old and me to use (think after workout tangles!)</li>
            <li> This is far and beyond the best brush I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to brush my hair without bringing tears to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length, very fine hair and a tender head</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this brush!  </li>
            <li> This brush  is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, both for the shower and just general brushing.  </li>
            <li> Love the choices in color too.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this brush</li>
            <li> I love to see it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull and she gladly picks it up and uses it when I ask her to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m killing her :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes our mornings so much better to not have tears when it&#x27;s time to brush their hair :)</li>
            <li> I will agree that this helps detangle better than most brushes.</li>
            <li> I am adding a couple more of these brushes to my cart now.  </li>
            <li> I thought this brush would be the next best thing since sliced bread...</li>
            <li> Also the brush was sitting on the bathroom counter top</li>
            <li> it stained the counter top</li>
            <li> My daughter used to spend the better part of a half-hour detangling her hair.</li>
            <li> We are SOLD on these brushes and I will purchase more to ensure they always have one within reach.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item, we just love it, I had a chance to read reviews for the item</li>
            <li> Leaves her hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> many colors to chose</li>
            <li> Still had to tug a couple of times, but overall very happy.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad</li>
            <li> Girls love the color too.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love the result.  </li>
            <li> I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to sneak hers to brush my hair :)</li>
            <li> - was going to get the $20.00 no tangle brush - glad</li>
            <li> Going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x60;s better then the rest of them that she has before she</li>
            <li> Wished I ordered more.</li>
            <li> i found this brush for her&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It has saved me many of tears and fits.</li>
            <li> This one is better compared to the one she used.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the way it works on my shoulder length, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> We love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush, and I&#x27;ll be buying it again if I ever need to replace mine.</li>
            <li> what more can you ask of a brush?</li>
            <li> : you can&#x27;t get the feeling without touching it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the most challenging hair to brush, a mix between curls and texture.  </li>
            <li> this brush is ok</li>
            <li> even more so when I got it.  </li>
            <li> It worked so well for us that I bought four more - never wanted to be caught without one.</li>
            <li> We got this  brush and have now been using it for more than two years and she won&#x27;t use anything else - no exaggeration.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll fall in love with this hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> Some days she still runs away,  but most of the time she sits still and doesn&#x27;t even wince.  </li>
            <li> I Love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad that I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> These might be better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> And what I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it brushes through well.</li>
            <li> and I read through tons of the reviews for many of them.</li>
            <li> * still love it - ordering another one because for some reason I&#x27;ve never been able to keep up w/ a hair brush.</li>
            <li> and it seems like it&#x27;s working okay for her.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush for my hair which is very fine but also very full.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is this, She loved the brush, and said it worked wonderfully, going right through the sleep matted hair like it had just been brushed.</li>
            <li> One of my daughters&#x27; hair is very fine, and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> There is only one thing to be said about this brush: It is easily the best brush I have ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle on scalp and gives a nice massage while brushing!</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty good, but my daughter still tells me it hurts to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d originally purchased it for myself, but gave it to her, so I have to get another for myself!</li>
            <li> It is easy for my daughter to use; and I love that she doesn&#x27;t lose handfuls of hair like she used to detangling with a wide-toothed comb</li>
            <li> This brush had good reviews and was at a good price point, so I bought enough for everyone to have one for their purse, one in each bathroom and have a couple spares.</li>
            <li> I paid $5.oo more for the excellent Wet Brush</li>
            <li> The new, non-pink brush is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair and Sharkk&#x27;s customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li> all the good things other reviewers have said about it (e.g. rubbery handle, good size, detangling powers, etc) are true!!</li>
            <li> 34;add-on&amp;#34; item, meaning that if you add it to a greater than $25 purchase, it is free two day shipping like a prime item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pink color is great!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s already becoming my every day brush.  </li>
            <li> The sharkk hair brush is working great on my tender headed four year old.  </li>
            <li> It detangles very easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been easy.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy on my hair and does not pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; have space in between them which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grip.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair and it combs through so easily.</li>
            <li> This brush gets all the knots out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to clean, and I wish I had purchased more than one.  </li>
            <li> Brush works well but has a strong and distinctive chemical odor which makes it inappropriate for use with my toddler&#x27;s hair as intended.</li>
            <li> The vinyl smell is so strong, my daughter asked if it&#x27;s going to leave on her hair.  </li>
            <li> And, while it is not a miracle brush, major snags still require working through, it has made the hair brushing process much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> seem pretty sturdy and are a nice size on both the handle and brush</li>
            <li> The hair brush made my hair frizzy and full of static.  </li>
            <li> I have a house full of girls and this hair brush is their favorite.  </li>
            <li> Even those pesky dust rings that sometimes like to build up on the bristles are easy to get off because the bristles on the SHARK aren&#x27;t topped off with an unnecessarily huge ball.</li>
            <li> Flexible bristles detangle fine wavy hair well.</li>
            <li> (I have fine hair)</li>
            <li> Works fine, but I was hoping for something sized for children.</li>
            <li> This brush glides through her fine hair without any drama.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my fine, tangle-prone hair.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, this sounded like a brush that my fine hair would benefit from.</li>
            <li> She has fine hair</li>
            <li> this brush is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a spare brush to leave at the office, but it quickly became my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works quickly and takes out the tangles so well!</li>
            <li> While looking for that brush though, I came across this super magical brush.  </li>
            <li> , it REALLY does go through the hair and detangles BETTER than even using a detangler spray in my opinion!  </li>
            <li> The amount of loose hair on the brush was incredible.  </li>
            <li> I got mine for only 4.99 I am so happy.</li>
            <li> easy to clean of hair, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in two seconds.</li>
            <li> It tear free.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush so much that I let my mom try it</li>
            <li> The quality was cheap, and it reeked of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Amazon returned our money and Sharkk reached out to us and sent us a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fast and effective without ripping.</li>
            <li> SHARKK sent me this brush for free to make up for a mess-up Amazon had with one of my orders.</li>
            <li> That was enough to make me happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> the brush goes smoothly through it without hurting it.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive hairbrush was a big happy surprise.  </li>
            <li> The price and the quality are fantastic</li>
            <li> With this brush, it literally takes 1 minute to go through their long, curly hair leaving it beautiful and detangled immediately!A mother&#x27;s dream..</li>
            <li> The brush went right through my hair, much better than the pick ever did.  </li>
            <li> Once more the brush went right through my hair.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> The freezer?\\&quot; sound familiar anyone?</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush that gently straightens / detangles long locks of hair.</li>
            <li> my new favorite product!  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush to stick in my suitcase</li>
            <li> I am going to order more very soon since it&#x27;s such a great deal.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on my daughter&#x27;s long, tangly, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> She loves the brush and is now actually excited for me to brush her curly, tangly hair, and will even brush it herself.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush has numerous semi-soft pins with protector points, a nice non-slip handle, and I love the color.  </li>
            <li> It does not hurt anymore to brush my hair out after a shower and it works great on dry hair too!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made mornings a lot less stressful and a lot more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I was super excited about this brush.</li>
            <li> This nice brush gently does the trick for me, and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The best brush we&#x27;ve found for my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> I would love to see more colors available in the future.</li>
            <li> A good solid brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good brush</li>
            <li> ---the brush works its way through knots with relative ease (there will always be SOME work!), and is fairly painless for her.  </li>
            <li> so much i am going order her two more</li>
            <li> Would definitely order again and in bulk too since the price is so good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re TRUE.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush, my daughter loves it, and she has super thick hair and hates to brush it, this brush glides right through, just ordered one for myself!</li>
            <li> She likes the brush very much and finds it easy to use without pulling her hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product, just as I expected with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I know other brands exist, but in my mind this one is just as great as the rest.</li>
            <li> I like it doesn&#x27;t pull all my hair out while brushing, and the bristles are soft but strong, none have came out and the best part is its a really pretty pink color.</li>
            <li> We DID NOT use this with a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sharkk Customer Service quickly sent me a replacement brush (which I appreciate).  </li>
            <li> and I liked the pink better.</li>
            <li> This brush allows a quick comb through without any pulling or pain.</li>
            <li> The super flexibility of the bristles is literally the difference between this brush and all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a different detangling brush and being very pleased, I decided to give the SHARKK brush a try.</li>
            <li> Still much better than using just a normal brush.</li>
            <li> we had a couple of other brushes but this one is so far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the absolute best brush ive ever had in my entire life....</li>
            <li> I am so happy to know that this torture is bestowed on other children &amp; it wasn&#x27;t just me!</li>
            <li> I used to spend a good 15 minutes brushing my kids hair (they have very long curly hair)</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and easy to comb through the toughest hair.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this for my daughter who also has long, curly hair and it worked so wonderfully on hers</li>
            <li> Fast shipping nice and light brush very convenient, doesn&#x27;t hurt hair, very soft !</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t really tried it in the shower, but the real amazing feat is how well it works in my daughters thin, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles give your head a nice little message too. :)</li>
            <li> short: This brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing; not only does it detangle my daughters hair with ease, it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> The handle fits the palm comfortably and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy this brush as much as we do.</li>
            <li> I suppose pink is worth it, but colors would be good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush that does seem to get through tangles verily easy, however it causes my hair to become frizzy versus the straight effect I get from most brushes after I comb through my whole head.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that can be a bit \\&quot;mousey\\&quot; at times, but since I have started using the wet brush instead of a comb I have noticed it&#x27;s behaving better. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and it will be worth paying for .</li>
            <li> I recently purchased another one for my 16 year old niece and am thinking about purchasing more when more colors are available again.  </li>
            <li> The risk is certainly minimal, and the quality, surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter is absolutely in love with this brush.</li>
            <li> We were given a similar brush and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Oh and of course it comes in pink, our favorite color :)</li>
            <li> Worth  </li>
            <li> If you struggle getting tangles out, be not afraid with SHARRK hair brush</li>
            <li> I cant believe I have lived so long without this brush- which I love to use myself!  </li>
            <li> It brushes right through my curls without tearing my hair out and without hurting my head.  </li>
            <li> are both plagued with tangles and this brushes them right out without tears.</li>
            <li> Again the brush went right through my hair.</li>
            <li> yeah right.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fancy or anything, but it works and the price is right.</li>
            <li> a bright pink hairbrush is pretty helpful.</li>
            <li> My best friend has very thick beautiful coarse long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the pain in her hands makes it hard to take care of her beautiful hair, and she threatens to cut it all off.</li>
            <li> But, it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It worked exactly the same and was absolutely amazing on my normally knotty hair right after the shower!</li>
            <li> it to try out to see if the others are really worth investing in - (&amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; is MY personal favorite)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that is was easy on the scalp and it worked.</li>
            <li> The price for this brush is also very reasonable</li>
            <li> I had used a friends wet brush recently, and absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> head of the brush easily fits in my hand, which is not typical</li>
            <li> It is excellent at gently detangling wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It did a wonderful job on my long, thick dry hair and felt so good while brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush the first time for my 5 year old daughter who has long, rather fine hair that tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has hair to her waist and it is the first brush after 13 years</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> This brush works exactly how they say it will.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to harass the kids to go brush their hair - they now do it willingly.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It is funny.</li>
            <li> Thanks SHARKK!</li>
            <li> There are many similar de-tangler type brushes, but they don&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say my girls love getting their hair brushed now</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second brush days after we got this one just to be safe (in case we misplace one at the pool).</li>
            <li> 201 people have already given this product 5 stars so at first I didn&#x27;t think I would even need to bother to write a review.  </li>
            <li> She is much happier using this brush!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It really gets the knots out!</li>
            <li> (her hair is just like mine, just not as long) and she liked it so much that I&#x27;m going to order one for her too.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this brush works great for detangling.  </li>
            <li> it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than any of my regular hair brushes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the first one to really work!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know first hand</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first product review I have ever done.</li>
            <li> So it brought her independence and confidence and me a peaceful home.</li>
            <li> only purchased 1 of these to try, but at $5, I&#x27;m going to order about 4 more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Give me the brush Mommy, I want to brush my own hair because I can with my new brush!&amp;#34; I am ordering 2 more for extras and all my other brushes are finding new homes.</li>
            <li> Great brush, totally gets the tanges out of my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft on my young daughters fine hair!  </li>
            <li> I never use a brush on wet hair and the only way to really get my hair tangle free was to douse with tons of conditioner while in the shower,  and spend a good 25 minutes with a wide-tooth</li>
            <li> It will be nice if it comes in other color.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to brush and detangle hair... even very long hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grand daughters who have really long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that likes to tangle more than I would prefer.  </li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be that much different than any other brush, but there is something magical about it that takes the ouch out of brushing.</li>
            <li> With the sharkk brush, I can easily brush through my hair virtually pain free, without a lot of breakage, and in half the time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what exactly makes this brush so much better, but now that I have tried it I will not be going back to anything else, not to mention it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li> I have tried every &#x27;gimmick&#x27; detangling brush I could find for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s thick, straight hair, and this has been the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> Great for long, wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush several weeks now and it still smells strongly of plastic chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Every single one had reviews that were causing me to bust a gut laughing because of all the hilarious stories from parents about chasing their daughters all over creation when it was time to brush out their hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it first and it seemed to work fine (on wet hair right out of the shower).  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush, works well when hair is wet and dry.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on wet hair or dry.</li>
            <li> It works great on both wet hair &amp; dry-</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to have strong enough &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; to get the tangles out very well (they bend I think)</li>
            <li> My 6 yo daughter&#x27;s fine and curly locks develop into a dense mat in the back after swimming and sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and its great to use when wet or dry</li>
            <li> The brush works great in my wife&#x27;s very thick hair without any discomfort from the bristles or tangling.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I sort of viewed this SHARK brush as like a knock-off of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It works very well at detangling.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take too much hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and no matter what hair brush or comb</li>
            <li> It gently works through the knots without pulling out my hair, which gets VERY knotty because of my hair type.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I have come to know that they are very quality oriented, so</li>
            <li> The bristles feel very flexible, and I doubted they could tackle their tangles, but they work really well.</li>
            <li> i got it for my sister, she says it really does the detangling.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair that is over 3 feet in length and this brush makes de-tangling her hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain much anymore that my wife is pulling her hair when brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brush works really well in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have very curly multiracial hair, my kids do too.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s much easier to get the tangle out, this brush doesn&#x27;t provide any massage to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this brush makes detangling so much easier</li>
            <li> and we can get it done much faster</li>
            <li> but I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush looks similar to cheap brushes that scratch the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This brush helps me deal with the tangles without making me want to just cut the whole thing off.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> No pulling and not too much hair in the brush when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> Using this hairbrush makes my scalp feel like it&#x27;s getting a gentle massage.  </li>
            <li> However, I tried this brush and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> and I can never find a hair brush that will both be gentle on my scalp and hair while still getting out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;m a swimmer, but this brush really helps to detangle my hair after a swim and/or shower.</li>
            <li> and was in perfect condition, it is wrapped in plastic so it wont get dirty when being shipped.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush, and that&#x27;s really all that matters.  </li>
            <li> oh you cant not break them at all their made from a very tough&amp;hard rubber</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> and it tends to get very tangled</li>
            <li> , we like it so much the whole family uses one.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and have bought 3 for me and one for my niece.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and the bristles did not stag my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> The brush works very well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend washing the brush before you use it if the smell really bothers you.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> and she actually wants to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> Until trying a detangling brush, getting the knots out was a nightmare - I would use detangling sprays (didn&#x27;t really work for us) and lots of conditioner and hair oils, which are helpful.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these as much as I hoped to.</li>
            <li> This brush has helped make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> This things works great when you use it on WET hair and it is the only brush that my 5 year old daughter wants to use.</li>
            <li> It really is a detangling brush and worth purchasing if you have a daughter with a sensitive head.</li>
            <li> I bought this, kind of doubting if it would actually work, but thought I would try since we have lots of tears over brushed hair in my household.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get over how good this brush works and how it cuts back on the time spent brushing!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s marginally better than my other brush, but not a miracle cure for tangles.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long fine hair and dreaded washing it because then I would have to brush it afterwards.</li>
            <li> have long fine hair</li>
            <li> We both have long, fine hair that tangles often</li>
            <li> I am so happy to report that this brush has in fact eliminated the tears and whining that usually go along with daily brushing of my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I found that it wasn&#x27;t very strong and dissipated after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have very long and fine hair, this brush gets out all the knots without tearing out all of my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s long hair is tangle free in 60 seconds with no complaining.</li>
            <li> The reviews are true, I brushed through my daughter&#x27;s hair without a flinch.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally brush my hair straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The brush arrived completely sealed and sanitary, and I really appreciate that!  </li>
            <li> Start at the top of the head and work your way down.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy brushing my long hair again!</li>
            <li> you will not even feel a slight tug, you&#x27;ll feel like you have worked magic brushing through your hair.</li>
            <li> works better on wet hair, but also works better than a regular brush on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on a similar product and thought that it would be great for my daughter, as she has thick hair and showers a lot at night after swimming and tend to wake up with her hair clumped and knotted.  </li>
            <li> I find this particular brush</li>
            <li> no more tangles and no more smelly chemical sprays on our beautiful daughter&#x27;s head!!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase it again &amp; would add this to a list of necessary (&amp; favorite) grooming products.</li>
            <li> Another brand, in particular, appeared to have the market cornered on these things</li>
            <li> and now I have a proof it does work, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is rather amazing because regardless of long or short hair (I just had it cut), dry or wet, it does a remarkably good job at straightening my hair out without me having to struggle with it like I would do earlier...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned it had a really strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> It feels very durable and has held up well with our 18 month old daughter who likes to play with</li>
            <li> My 6 year old loves it so much she walks around the house brushing her hair all the time.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very soothing and soft to my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> However, it works great on my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a normal brush.</li>
            <li> Bought for our 5 year old who has beautiful curly hair but can get difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> and it does help with the pulling and tugging unlike normal</li>
            <li> The slight odor in the beginning was a small price to pay for such a wonderful hair brush.  </li>
            <li> They have a sharp feel on your scalp if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing for wet and dry hair and no pulling.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to spot, which might not seem like such a big deal , but if you are in a hurry</li>
            <li> This brush works nicely with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> The price was right, but had I had known what my hair would look like later I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> cheaply made,,used it for a month and tossed it,,may work for a child&#x27;s thin fine hair</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t going to buy a new brush</li>
            <li> This new brush has eliminated the majority of tangles.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t prevented me from using the brush hoping it would live up to its description.</li>
            <li> I guess I still can&#x27;t compare to the Wet brush since I haven&#x27;t tried it, but this wasn&#x27;t the miracle it was claimed to be and might have damaged my hair making it more likely to tangle.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and easey to use.</li>
            <li> and I seemed to pull out endless clumps of hair just trying to get it smooth enough to wash (I wouldn&#x27;t DARE wash it with tangles, I would never be able to comb thru it wet!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush; and too boot, it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> if we ever need another brush we will definitely get this one soft to all hair and good with wet and dry.</li>
            <li> With 2 young girls this has made my life a lot easier!  </li>
            <li> and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> if I could go back in time, probably the first thing I&#x27;d do is give my mother this brush to use when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first ordered it I didn&#x27;t have big expectations, but WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow! save @10-15 mins not fighting my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, it was so painless that I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be brushing through my hair.  </li>
            <li> but the brush went back to its original form shortly after taking it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is our purchase of a second one, because one of our girls always had the first brush in her room.  </li>
            <li> I have daily battles about her tangled hair but from the moment she first used this brush the battles have ended</li>
            <li> From conditioners, detangling sprays, big tooth combs, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;I was first interested in the Mercier detangling brush, seeing their commercial online.  </li>
            <li> no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> far nothing!</li>
            <li> oh so nice and works on my thick, coarse, curly hair without too much frizz.  </li>
            <li> Made brushing my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair so easy!  </li>
            <li> The new brushes are holding up well so far.</li>
            <li> Just start at the bottom and work up as usual, works better than our old  brush.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush is great - if you&#x27;re tired of the whining and tears associated with brushing out your kid&#x27;s long hair, give this brush a try!</li>
            <li> Finally, can more or less please my 3 yo.</li>
            <li> Not only is it super affordable but it TOTALLY works!</li>
            <li> Tried a couple of different detangling brushes for my daughter&#x27;s very thick, slightly wavy hair and this one worked the best.</li>
            <li> this is an edited version of my previous review because I barely gave the brush a good look over or tried it out before I wrote the previous review.</li>
            <li> So far this brush is holding up very well, and looks like it will last for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will go away completely, because that&#x27;s really the only drawback to this item.</li>
            <li> They have a strange eclectic bevy of products, to which I haven&#x27;t ever figured out the exact theme.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 7 year old daughter whose hair would often tangled into something akin to a Gordian knot.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 yr old daughter that fusses every time I brush her hair</li>
            <li> I ordered for my 6 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> My 5 yr old loves this brush...</li>
            <li> I can brush the knots completely out and take two steps and its tangled again.  </li>
            <li> It is the only brush I have found that is gentle on the head and gets the knots out without pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old, and</li>
            <li> Will only use this brush from now on, fast shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are actually really soft on your scalp, noticeably so.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved my SHARKK Detangling Hair Brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so much faster than a wooden comb I was using, just a couple of strokes</li>
            <li> She told me, and  I ordered brushes for myself and two young granddaughters.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt because of its soft bristles.</li>
            <li> We like this brush so much be have purchased multiple.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my 91 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s hair with no problems.</li>
            <li> My three year old loves this brush.</li>
            <li> It has held up wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li> I have an over reacting, drama queen of a 5 yr old.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my four year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush and haven&#x27;t heard her complain about tugs or knots in her hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> old daughter and</li>
            <li> In fact I&#x27;m getting ready to order a second one</li>
            <li> My mornings all of a sudden become so much</li>
            <li> My nearly three year old daughter used to cry when I&#x27;d brush her hair with a boarshead brush.  </li>
            <li> and I think an overly sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> , we&#x27;re keeping her long hair, thanks to the SHARKK Hair Brush!</li>
            <li> As an adult when Id brush my hair</li>
            <li> I went from madness that hasn&#x27;t been brushed in a few days to tangle free in seconds!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying a few more to keep around the house and in the car.</li>
            <li> Of course the color is fun and as marvelously PINK as advertised.</li>
            <li> As I used the brush on my hair (thick, shoulder length hair), it DID NOT pull out my hair nor did it leave my hair with that \\&quot;static cling look\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It feels nice against my scalp, not scratchy, and works well with my short thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought two more for my niece and daughter who have really thick unruly hair.</li>
            <li> she has long hair and this brush made it easy to brush out her wet hair.</li>
            <li> They both have thick hair -- one fine and blond and one more coarse and dark.  </li>
            <li> Im not 100% satisfied as my hair seems just as tangly as with my other brushes and makes me question if is this even a &#x27;wet brush&#x27;??</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair that gets tangled easily and this works on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I screamed &amp; cried &amp; kicked &amp; moaned the whole time my hair was getting brushed until I eventually grew into one of those people that can barely feel any tugging at all.</li>
            <li> To my opinion, it brushes nicely, but nothing special, but I couldn&#x27;t use it more than once, because the material it&#x27;s made of simply smells horrible (or as my 4 years old says - it smells like tires) and I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> the brush is a little softer than expected but has no problems brushing through light knots (my hair is mostly straight), i can&#x27;t tell you how it would do on tangled curls though.</li>
            <li> Every time I tried to brush out her hair was a major struggle with her in tears (and me too!)</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t even flinch now when I brush her hair which is a major difference from her screaming her head off!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally used this item, but my 7 year old daughter had told me numerous times that this brush works really well.</li>
            <li> My other brushes are full of hair and the sharkk brush only has a strand or two.</li>
            <li> rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because it had a super funky smell (plastic-y) at the beginning, but it&#x27;s faded a little.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, long, straight hair that tangles really easily, if it helps.</li>
            <li> I have a younger daughter that I always brushed her long hair because it took so long and required de-tangling spray, but she has now taken over the job as this brush has made it so easy</li>
            <li> The only thing that made this 4 stars for me is when I brush my dry hair with this, my hair becomes quite poofy and static, so I only use this brush on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Concerning the odor other reviewers have commented on, I did notice a rubbery smell to the brush when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> the first time I used it I thought nothing was happening because my head was tilted over w/ my hair in front of my face &amp; I couldnt feel anything other than my hand on the handle.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty good, probably not great for really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Although they both take out the knots, wet or dry, without the pain of other brushes; the Sharkk feels better on the scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is short &amp; thick, but I think this brush will also be very good on my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a regular adult size hair brush.</li>
            <li> I will probably purchase another one in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have tangly hair, so getting through my hair, wet, with a brush really helps.</li>
            <li> Also, it feels really soft on the scalp unlike regular brushes that tend to tug on your hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush it was smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairbrush and totally recommend it especially if you have thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> This brush has many little bristles that flex as you brush, so there&#x27;s less pulling and tugging.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it pulls too much hair out when I try it on dry hair, plus I end up with a big head of frizz!</li>
            <li> We used a lot of conditioner, a comb and wasted a lot of money finding the right brush.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be just like any other brush, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is well made &amp; fantastic with wet &amp; dry hair but the Sharkk is not.  </li>
            <li> Easy on my scalp and yet sturdy enough to tackle my extremely thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sells quite a few different brushes that are more or less functionally the same as this one...</li>
            <li> Also, we like the size....not too small, but small enough to be comfortable and controllable for small hands.  :)</li>
            <li> When I received this brush, I could immediately feel a big difference just brushing through it dry, but when my hair was wet and tangled, I could really tell a difference!</li>
            <li> The Sharkk Brush has weak bristles and works okay with dry hair</li>
            <li> My daughter very much likes using the SHARKK Hair Brush Professional Detangling Shower Brush For Wet Or Dry Hair (Pink).</li>
            <li> After doing a little more digging on Amazon, I can across the Shark and after reading other reviews and seeing the cost, which was 1/3 the cost of the other brush</li>
            <li> Getting tangles out of wet or dry hair is fast and painless.  </li>
            <li> She also has pretty bad Rheumatoid Arthritis in her hands, the result of work and many years as a practitioner of several martial arts, as well as being an all around bad-ass.</li>
            <li> [Note: I have thin, fine hair, if that makes a difference?]</li>
            <li> and I think she has tried every brush on the market before finding this terrific brush which easily goes through her wet thick curly hair and even straightens it.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls whose hair gets very tangled.  </li>
            <li> I was about ready to cut off my little girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> it still pull her hair a little but not so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how such a soft bristled brush could work on wet hair, but did it ever!</li>
            <li> On either wet or dry hair, this brush glides right through, and I&#x27;m not left with a brush of hair either (much less than my other brushes, and nearly none in fact).</li>
            <li> This brush worked great at first on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair, but soon the bulbs on the bristle tips broke off and it became too painful to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You should know that other brands besides SHARK make nearly identical brushes but the prices vary quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but at the price, I can always get another one.  </li>
            <li> We comb my daughter&#x27;s blonde thin hair full of bed head knots before school and after shower!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> No more tears for the little one who has fine long hair.</li>
            <li> I have a large hair pick I usually use after I wash my hair, but tried the brush instead.  </li>
            <li> Goes right through my daughters thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B008O4YM5I SHARKK Hair Brush Professional Detangling Shower Brush For Wet Or Dry Hair (Purple)]]</li>
            <li> My daughter had to give this brush to our next door neighbor, who has super thin hair.</li>
            <li> Was able to shampoo and condition normally without long and painful process to remove the matting.</li>
            <li> It really helps brushing and no more tears.  </li>
            <li> Having purchased hair items with plenty of promises in the past before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot -- but, to my surprise, this brush delivered.</li>
            <li> My daughter is on the swim team and the constant pool use is wreaking havoc on her long hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is strange is the smell.  </li>
            <li> again, the bristles went flat.  </li>
            <li> Brushing time for my 3 year old daughter down from about 30 minutes to about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Im nearly 30 &amp; have hair down to my rear end &amp; its not just any ole hair either.</li>
            <li> mixed ( black, portugese, middle eastern)&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: fine strands, but thick, extremely curly&lt;br /&gt;Length:</li>
            <li> The first one like it I found at a local grocery store and have been frantically trying to find it since the brush finally did succumb to my daughters thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old still says &amp;#34;ow!&amp;#34; during brushing but much less than before.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months, I have developed a relationship with the folks at isharkk, both as a consumer and as a sometimes product tester.</li>
            <li> Despite its outdated and crude look, it still the best brush out there.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let bad reviews stop you from buying this amazing hair brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> My girls have long hair which is a nightmare to brush out.</li>
            <li> She has long hair and combing her long hair frustrates her.</li>
            <li> This stained my entire hand pink after brushing my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (3.5) has long curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter used to cry every time I brushed her wet hair...</li>
            <li> so when I saw The Sharkk Brush &amp; The Wet Brush I ordered both, they look the same but they are not.  </li>
            <li> I have two de-tangling hair brushes for my long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and so I bought this for a cousin&#x27;s daughter who has long curly hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, luxurious hair that sometimes tangles.</li>
            <li> I bought one for each of my daughters, one with long curly hair and one with thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to brush through my long, thick hair using this product.  </li>
            <li> it has definitely cut down the morning &amp;#34;battle of the brush&amp;#34; and it gives me extra time for my morning coffee!</li>
            <li> buy more for my nieces not sure how they will hold up but for less than $5 bucks that&#x27;s a deal!!!!</li>
            <li> totally works, wet or dry, no tangles, no tearing and ripping.</li>
            <li> Works on dry and wet hair equally well.</li>
            <li> so my wife can have a extra incase she misplace ut and it&#x60;s made for wet nor dry hair</li>
            <li> I use it wet &amp; dry - seems to work the same either way.</li>
            <li> &quot; My boyfriend calls it \\&quot;mutant hair\\&quot; because it is super thick &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li> With either wet or dry hair, this brush makes scant work of those tangles--a far cry from her previous hair brush.</li>
            <li> This brush gets knots out of my daughters long hair and doesn&#x27;t yank her head back like other brushes.</li>
            <li> It looks like every other brush but for some reason it works differently.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference between my other brushes and this one.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried to brush conditioner through my wet hair the bristles went flat and the conditioner went no where.  </li>
            <li> the other brushed pulled and made it so unpleasing when brushing her hair .</li>
            <li> I have very long colored hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have a 6 year old that always complained every time I brushed her hair.</li>
            <li> I seriously regret not getting this earlier for my 4.5 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the same as any other round brushes sold in 99 cents store, but I was sold on all the positive reviews people gave.  </li>
            <li> I also have a daughter with thin, super curly hair down to her shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li> And let me say, my daughter is \\&quot;the princess of tangles\\&quot; with long hair that is in a constant tangled mess</li>
            <li> oldest likes to brush her hair in the shower, and that brush seems unaffected by the wet use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, after one use, I think I might get rid of the white comb and maybe even my other hairbrush and just use this one!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and I&#x27;m careful about brushes that&lt;</li>
            <li> Seems to tackle some pretty bad tangles without too much fuss.</li>
            <li> I then tried it on my daughter (who is also very tender headed) and she didn&#x27;t scream or start crying as usual.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yank the tangles out, and I have used it on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Wet OR dry</li>
            <li> She was hesitant, but now I can brush her hair wet or dry with this brush and no tears.</li>
            <li> Works well with wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> It works well for both wet and dry hair just as described.  </li>
            <li> The brush is fabulous....truly either with wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and I said previously that the bristles were bent but it was only because of the packaging</li>
            <li> I chose this brush because it was half of the price of similar brushes.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> and it works so well with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It works well for wet hair as well as dry.</li>
            <li> We have purchased 2 of these brushes and they work well on wet or dry hair,</li>
            <li> I normally do not try to comb out my hair when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry, it works well for both!</li>
            <li> It cuts through the snags in her hair wet or dry without the discomfort of other brushes.</li>
            <li> It looks like a typical wig brush but with tiny teeth but don&#x27;t be fooled, brush your wet hair with it &amp; you can throw away your detangler!</li>
            <li> I comb my wet hair with when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li> However, avoid using it ion wet hair.</li>
            <li> The pink coating on the tips fell off throughout the brush and scraped my daughter&#x27;s scalp within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a disaster to comb out, even after going through it with a wide tooth comb in the shower.</li>
            <li> Almost identical with the Wet Brush except for the logo and cheaper price (at the time this review was written).</li>
            <li> The pink dye comes off of the handle of the brish on hands and stains.</li>
            <li> was wet</li>
            <li> If you having trouble brushing hair, especially after swimming, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Morning hair, wind-blown hair and even wet hair</li>
            <li> The tips can hurt if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> This product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it another try on wet hair and,</li>
            <li> The wet brush and this one.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used a Wet Brush (not Sharkk brand) on my hair at the salon</li>
            <li> Plus she likes that it is pink.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t believe it would ever work on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but for the price I figured it was worth the try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the slower you drag the brush through the hair</li>
            <li> Based on the description and reviews,  I expected it to slide through hair like butter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is never recommended to use a brush on wet, curly hair, but I have to say that this theory is thrown out the window when using this Sharkk brush.</li>
            <li> It breezes through my hair, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are incredibly soft and won&#x27;t comb through thick hair.</li>
            <li> We gave this brush to my 3.5 year old who has incredibly thick hair and always complains when we brush her hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer thick, so I would like to keep as much as possible attached to my scalp for obvious reasons.  </li>
            <li> We had issues with the pink brush bleeding pink when it became wet.</li>
            <li> Her hair brushed easily, little to no discomfort!</li>
            <li> For me, this hair brush is not firm enough and its little ticks (teeth?) are too thin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  have a weird smell,it works great on wet or dry hair,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Tried gluing it without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no misuse of the product, it didn&#x27;t survive a fall of three feet when it was knocked off the bathroom counter to the tile floor, something other brushes can handle.</li>
            <li> I did this with other brands, and still lost the balls.  </li>
            <li> She has extremely think hair and this product was recommended to us</li>
            <li> our other brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Does not pull or yank hair like some other brushes have.  </li>
            <li> For all you tender-headed ladies, SHARKK Detangling Hair Brush (the pink one) is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t due to see my stylist for a bit</li>
            <li> thank goodness for this hair brush recommend it to other people</li>
            <li> This brush works so well, I no longer need sprays or other chemicals to put on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have not used any other brand but this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my hair was down to the bottom of my back - long, curly, and thick, and I&#x27;d wake up with super-tangled hair every day.  </li>
            <li> , it never pulls my hair painfully, it glides through wet long hair fairly easily, and there is very little hair loss.  </li>
            <li> have a slightly rubber feeling in the plastic that works well wet or dry, gives a firm grip without feeling sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the brush handle has a soft plastic feel, almost like the feel of silicone, with a wide base for you to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is that the bristles are very thin and I don&#x27;t know how long they will last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Combs through knots EFFORTLESSLY, and does not pull out half of my hair, unlike my other brushes.</li>
            <li> On me, it hurt less than other brushes in tangled hair, but seemed like the bristles bent rather than removing the tangles.  </li>
            <li> We used the knot genie for several years, but it started falling apart, and my daughter found it hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item expecting a regular brush,,usually too hard.</li>
            <li> but the price is not worth it lower it by 2$</li>
            <li> Not worth even $1.</li>
            <li> Bristles are thin, soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> My hair is as thick and tangle-prone as it gets, so believe me when I say that if this brush can work on my hair, it will definitely work on yours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my son is mixed and has extremely curly hair and it worked miracles for him too!!!!</li>
            <li> : ) I can brush through my wet tangled hair in less than a minute, something that would have taken at least 5-7 (with breaks because I would get so frustrated).  </li>
            <li> She is very dramatic and sensitive to everything with a very low pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is down to my waist</li>
            <li> Tears for the brushing down to almost zero.</li>
            <li> There are no more tantrums about brushing her hair...wet or dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly the brush lasted less than 10 days before it snapped.</li>
            <li> This brush has flexible bristles so there is less pulling.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely much less of an ordeal</li>
            <li> I tried this brush, not knowing how it would do on a black woman&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> A lot less than I would have paid at Walmart, for a brush that I would have settled for.  </li>
            <li> At this point, I have returned to using my previous brush though since it seems to damage my hair less.</li>
            <li> &amp; it takes less than 2 minutes to brush it all out with this brush versus the 15-20 minutes it had always taken me before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this brush really DOES detangle my very thick wavy hair - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; thick and it was an ordeal to brush it out after a wash</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> She has found it easier to manage her thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Witha little bit of heat this brush has gotten ruined in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> It took a little time to get all the tangles out</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> But nothing a little air out can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to recommend this to every mom that struggles with her little girl&#x27;s tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 6 months, and now it is getting a little worn.</li>
            <li> A little pokey on your scalp and neck when brushing now.</li>
            <li> UNTIL this little brush came along now</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, my long, very thick hair is always tangled.  </li>
            <li> It detangles with in seconds without her crying that</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and the smell has gone.</li>
            <li> and yes, we go through the yelling, holding the hair from brushing, and even a few tears from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a few bucks.</li>
            <li> BUT it sure as heck smelled very bad when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I previously used a paddle brush and this seemed to work alright, but then my sister recommended the SHARKK and my life has changed!</li>
            <li> Not good on dry hair though.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> It takes out knots much quicker, and less painfully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s the first thing I smell when I go into the bathroom.</li>
            <li> If I knew it would smell so bad, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased, but it&#x27;s not a big enough drawback to throw away.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with these type brushes are when the little balls fall off the end of the bristles, making brushing painful.  </li>
            <li> I have long pretty thick hair and was getting frustrated when I was combing/brushing my hair after a shower - this brush was the answer!</li>
            <li> None of the plastic teeth thingies has popped out &amp; the very little amount of hair that accumulated on the brush was a piece of cake to remove.</li>
            <li> BEWARE of the Metallic Pink!!!!  </li>
            <li> Not one bit of trouble for the Sharkk brush!  </li>
            <li> Because she has curly hair, when tangled the small balls at the end of the bristles still sometimes get caught and can pull the hair.</li>
            <li> I was a round brush to try to delicately take out those tangles and it would take forever.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> When something so small as a brush can bring peace to my house</li>
            <li> No more pulling,</li>
            <li> no more fighting, no more tears.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy brushes with metal teeth, but this time I took a chance and bought this brush</li>
            <li> No More Pain!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> No more ouch</li>
            <li> The bristles are made of some alien engineered technology that allows them to bend all the way backwards without popping out...</li>
            <li> no more tears while trying to untangle the knots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had heard about the Wet Brush and figured I&#x27;d try this since it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old has curly hair and its always getting tangled (very bad) this brush works womderful on her hair wet or dry!!!</li>
            <li> Upon opening this brush I was very skeptical it would ever detangle wet long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit when I read about a brush that will make detangling hair easier and less painful, I&#x27;m a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must-have for every one who has hard to brush out tangled  hair .</li>
            <li> Before this brush, she would complained, screamed, cried, pouted, and just made my job so hard in trying to keep her hair in order.  </li>
            <li> At least she doesn&#x27;t scream anymore</li>
            <li> Even after several days in the sun to off-gas and a month of use, it still stinks.</li>
            <li> but they wanted at least twice or three times the cost of this one.</li>
            <li> I have hair as thick and course as a horse that seems to form dreadlocks overnight.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair don&#x27;t bother with this brush.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for this brush.</li>
            <li> She has thick hair and its a nightmare trying to brush it out after a bath.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested I purchase a &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; to help with my thick hair after showering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping they make this brush in a small purse size!</li>
            <li> FINALLY NO MORE COMBS!</li>
            <li> No more tears!  </li>
            <li> My hair usually takes about 5 mins to brush all the tangles out of, this took less than two mins!!!!</li>
            <li> I do like it for wet hair because I hate using those wide tooth combs and always utilize a brush so this one does work well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical for the price, but I purchased it</li>
            <li> When I washed it off, the pink bled like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I bought 10 of these because I was tired of being late everywhere because quote “I can’t find a brush”.</li>
            <li> Buy at least two!  </li>
            <li> my daughter had long waste length hair and hated me  brushing it cus</li>
            <li> have very thick, course, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It is much worse in the summer after hours in the chlorine pool.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the hair brushing time is always a dreaded time for us with her thick waist length hair.  </li>
            <li> I can take a breath and my hair is in tangles, this VERY smoothly untangles my worst knots, I&#x27;m so sad I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner!!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is of normal thickness and this brush was terrible.</li>
            <li> -gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do not tangle in my hair, but I would not buy this brush again because the handle is angular and uncomfortable to hold, but mainly because of the awful smell that has remained for weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the ends began to wear and the brush was getting painful to use.</li>
            <li> , it was so difficult to keep brushed and would just tangle awfully out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> weird.  </li>
            <li> For three years, I have been unable to brush my daughters hair because she didnt like brushes.</li>
            <li> There was a faint rubbery smell when I opemed the package, but that has dissipated now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and</li>
            <li> But I was wrong, it got out all the tangles without tugging at my scalp once.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and always have tangles after washing it.  </li>
            <li> The brush did have the horrible smell like the other reviewer said.</li>
            <li> and I was getting to the point of cutting it</li>
            <li> It did have an awful smell which dissipated in a few days.</li>
            <li> even after a week still stinks....</li>
            <li> I no longer hear crazy monster sounds coming from my hair when I brush it</li>
            <li> and before I used this brush it was very difficult to brush all the way through; I&#x27;d end up with a handful of hair and a sore scalp.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to get my daughter to brush her hair-now she almost enjoys it.  </li>
            <li> I have had to cut knots out because they have gotten so bad.</li>
            <li> It is a firmer brush without being a painful one</li>
            <li> But upon receiving it, I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> She was disappointed  but will use it</li>
            <li> Horrible!!! :(</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely awful.  </li>
            <li> You just cannot go wrong for the money !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It smelled awful, but I wasn&#x27;t worried, I figured the smell would dissipate.  </li>
            <li> However, it has a terrible rubber smell.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tangles horribly.  </li>
            <li> it was awful....</li>

            <li> After purchasing a different detangling brush and being very pleased, I decided to give the SHARKK brush a try. To my opinion, it brushes nicely, but nothing special, but I couldn&#x27;t use it more than once, because the material it&#x27;s made of simply smells horrible (or as my 4 years old says - it smells like tires) and I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush to stick in my suitcase so I wouldn&#x27;t have to remember to pack the white comb I comb my wet hair with when I go on vacation. However, after one use, I think I might get rid of the white comb and maybe even my other hairbrush and just use this one! It detangles very easily and quickly. I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair.  This type brush is our favorite for removing knots and tangles!  I ordered several of these brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush is as perfect as it gets. It is so affordable. I got mine for only 4.99 I am so happy. I ordered it for my daughter. It works very well at detangling. I am going to order more very soon since it&#x27;s such a great deal. I would love to see more colors available in the future. So far this brush is holding up very well, and looks like it will last for years.</li>
            <li> This brush is rather amazing because regardless of long or short hair (I just had it cut), dry or wet, it does a remarkably good job at straightening my hair out without me having to struggle with it like I would do earlier... highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long fine hair and dreaded washing it because then I would have to brush it afterwards. I previously used a paddle brush and this seemed to work alright, but then my sister recommended the SHARKK and my life has changed! : ) I can brush through my wet tangled hair in less than a minute, something that would have taken at least 5-7 (with breaks because I would get so frustrated).  It also doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  It never feels like I am ripping through my hair.  I am not sure what exactly makes this brush so much better, but now that I have tried it I will not be going back to anything else, not to mention it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this brush for the quality and price. My wife wasn&#x27;t going to buy a new brush but I got this one for her and she really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what we like about the brush:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;2. The handle is thin and shaped nicely to fit well in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s great for detangling hair&lt;br /&gt;4. It feels very durable and has held up well with our 18 month old daughter who likes to play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li> I tried it first and it seemed to work fine (on wet hair right out of the shower).  I then tried it on my daughter (who is also very tender headed) and she didn&#x27;t scream or start crying as usual.  It took a little time to get all the tangles out but it didn&#x27;t take too much hair out.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing for wet and dry hair and no pulling.  My daughter has hair to her waist and it is the first brush after 13 years she doesn&#x27;t complain about.  Love the choices in color too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush for my hair which is very fine but also very full.  I love it, its a brush, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to! Would recommend it</li>
            <li> There is no brush like this one. The first one like it I found at a local grocery store and have been frantically trying to find it since the brush finally did succumb to my daughters thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter is on the swim team and the constant pool use is wreaking havoc on her long hair. After trying various detangling/conditioning products another parent told us about this brush. I ordered one at the end of June and it was like a miracle! Her hair brushed easily, little to no discomfort! Hallelujah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the brush lasted less than 10 days before it snapped. While it can be used, the part that the bristles adhere to is cracked and split apart. Tried gluing it without success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no misuse of the product, it didn&#x27;t survive a fall of three feet when it was knocked off the bathroom counter to the tile floor, something other brushes can handle. Haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;m ordering a replacement, will look for another solution to the detangling problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - After posting this review I was contacted by SHARKK who sent me two replacement brushes. The new brushes are holding up well so far. Very pleased with customer service. Thank you. Changed 1 star review to 4 star review.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping nice and light brush very convenient, doesn&#x27;t hurt hair, very soft ! Would recommend them for a regular use</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and no matter what hair brush or comb I used, whenever I combed my hair I would wind up pulling out clumps.  This is the BEST hairbrush EVER!  It gently works through the knots without pulling out my hair, which gets VERY knotty because of my hair type.  Amazing!  It is gentle on scalp and gives a nice massage while brushing!</li>
            <li> This brush is a life saver for my daughter&#x27;s tangled, curly hair!! Had to order a second one! Great price and Excellent customer service too!</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush! It feels like your getting a massage lol.</li>
            <li> totally works, wet or dry, no tangles, no tearing and ripping. easy to clean of hair, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in two seconds. i LOVE this brush</li>
            <li> My best friend has very thick beautiful coarse long wavy hair. She also has pretty bad Rheumatoid Arthritis in her hands, the result of work and many years as a practitioner of several martial arts, as well as being an all around bad-ass. Sometimes the pain in her hands makes it hard to take care of her beautiful hair, and she threatens to cut it all off. I love to see it so I wanted to give her something to encourage her to keep it. Over the last few months, I have developed a relationship with the folks at isharkk, both as a consumer and as a sometimes product tester. They have a strange eclectic bevy of products, to which I haven&#x27;t ever figured out the exact theme. In any case, I have come to know that they are very quality oriented, so seeing that they had a De-tangling brush for sale, I knew I should buy one and give it a shot. It is offered as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item, meaning that if you add it to a greater than $25 purchase, it is free two day shipping like a prime item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this, She loved the brush, and said it worked wonderfully, going right through the sleep matted hair like it had just been brushed. It is the kind of thing I have come to expect from Sharkk products. Great quality, and great service.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it&#x27;s pretty good, probably not great for really thick hair.  It smells absolutely awful.  When I washed it off, the pink bled like crazy.  If I knew it would smell so bad, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased, but it&#x27;s not a big enough drawback to throw away.  I should&#x27;ve read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> This brush worked great at first on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair, but soon the bulbs on the bristle tips broke off and it became too painful to use.  If that had not happened it would probably be a five star product.</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush it was smaller than I expected and I didn&#x27;t think I would like it. However, it works great on my long, thick, wavy hair. It leaves my hair silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and feels great on my scalp. I bought this as a spare brush to leave at the office, but it quickly became my favorite brush. The smaller size also makes it convenient for travel</li>
            <li> Yes, just yes. I have hair as thick and course as a horse that seems to form dreadlocks overnight. I went from madness that hasn&#x27;t been brushed in a few days to tangle free in seconds!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this brush!  I have hair that is down to my waist and it often gets tangled from putting it up for the day.  Not one bit of trouble for the Sharkk brush!  Getting tangles out of wet or dry hair is fast and painless.  This is the last brush I will ever need.  Thank you for a top shelf product!</li>
            <li> This brush works exactly how they say it will. I bought one for each of my daughters, one with long curly hair and one with thick straight hair. It worked very well on both types and the girls are very happy with their brushes. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My two girls were delighted when these brushes arrived. The bristles feel very flexible, and I doubted they could tackle their tangles, but they work really well. I no longer have to harass the kids to go brush their hair - they now do it willingly. I ordered a second set for the downstairs bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have commented that the brushes have a smell. I found that it wasn&#x27;t very strong and dissipated after a few days.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to get my daughter to brush her hair-now she almost enjoys it.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and she gladly picks it up and uses it when I ask her to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 7 year old daughter whose hair would often tangled into something akin to a Gordian knot. With either wet or dry hair, this brush makes scant work of those tangles--a far cry from her previous hair brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed a detangling brush and so we bought This brush and it really is an awesome detangler! It is like magic!</li>
            <li> Flexible bristles detangle fine wavy hair well. Just start at the bottom and work up as usual, works better than our old  brush. My 6 year old loves it so much she walks around the house brushing her hair all the time. My 3 year old still says &amp;#34;ow!&amp;#34; during brushing but much less than before.</li>
            <li> this worked well in conjunction with TruKid Dancing Hair Detangler. My 6 yo daughter&#x27;s fine and curly locks develop into a dense mat in the back after swimming and sleeping. Been  brushing out her with the Sharkk and detangler each time she finishes swimming in the pool or ocean and it&#x27;s been easy. Has helped in avoiding any problems. Was able to shampoo and condition normally without long and painful process to remove the matting. Better for both of us!</li>
            <li> i got it for my sister, she says it really does the detangling. However, avoid using it ion wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is easy to spot, which might not seem like such a big deal , but if you are in a hurry like I am every morning, and you have A.D.D - having a bright pink hairbrush is pretty helpful. It also seems to detangle my hair without tearing it out. After using it, my hair looks smoother :) great brush for  great price!</li>
            <li> Finally, can more or less please my 3 yo. At least she doesn&#x27;t scream anymore like I&#x27;m killing her :) She also loves to have her own &amp;#34;hearbrus&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that set angles my daughters hair without pain. I suppose pink is worth it, but colors would be good.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I bought 3 of them; one for each of my girls and one for me.  It&#x27;s  a great brush for all types of hair. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush my girls will use because it doesn&#x27;t hurt! It really is a detangling brush and worth purchasing if you have a daughter with a sensitive head. Makes our mornings so much better to not have tears when it&#x27;s time to brush their hair :)</li>
            <li> We bought 2 brushes and both of them ended up in the trash.  The pink coating on the tips fell off throughout the brush and scraped my daughter&#x27;s scalp within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Does not go all the way through hair.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is of normal thickness and this brush was terrible.</li>
            <li> The brush is exactly as described.  The brush is easy on my hair and does not pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty good, but my daughter still tells me it hurts to brush her hair.  Because she has curly hair, when tangled the small balls at the end of the bristles still sometimes get caught and can pull the hair.</li>
            <li> I will agree that this helps detangle better than most brushes. I have a 4 yr old daughter that fusses every time I brush her hair and so I find this makes it easier to brush. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair that is over 3 feet in length and this brush makes de-tangling her hair so much easier.  I have a younger daughter that I always brushed her long hair because it took so long and required de-tangling spray, but she has now taken over the job as this brush has made it so easy and I can save money now that I don&#x27;t have to buy the spray. I have used this brush on my own hair and it is surprising the difference a brush can make.  It doesn&#x27;t yank the tangles out, and I have used it on both wet and dry hair.  I am adding a couple more of these brushes to my cart now.  You won&#x27;t find me buying regular hair brushes again!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair don&#x27;t bother with this brush. The bristles are incredibly soft and won&#x27;t comb through thick hair. My daughter had to give this brush to our next door neighbor, who has super thin hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this brush would be the next best thing since sliced bread... it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a decent brush that does seem to get through tangles verily easy, however it causes my hair to become frizzy versus the straight effect I get from most brushes after I comb through my whole head. (I have fine hair) I do like it for wet hair because I hate using those wide tooth combs and always utilize a brush so this one does work well for that purpose. The price for this brush is also very reasonable so I would recommend it, just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that&#x27;s a disaster to comb out, even after going through it with a wide tooth comb in the shower. I always used spray detanglers, which made the wood floor like a slip and slide. So glad I found this $5 brush!</li>
            <li> I stumbled on a similar product and thought that it would be great for my daughter, as she has thick hair and showers a lot at night after swimming and tend to wake up with her hair clumped and knotted.  After doing a little more digging on Amazon, I can across the Shark and after reading other reviews and seeing the cost, which was 1/3 the cost of the other brush I was looknig at, figured that, for the money, why not give it a try.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m soooo glad that I did. My daughter loves that she can now brush her knotty hair int he morning without pain.  She also loves the way the tips feel on her scalp, as do I, the feel/grip of the brush and the design on it.  Way To Go Shark !!!!!!!!!!  You just cannot go wrong for the money !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Almost identical with the Wet Brush except for the logo and cheaper price (at the time this review was written). Despite its outdated and crude look, it still the best brush out there.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain much anymore that my wife is pulling her hair when brushing.  Wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls whose hair gets very tangled.  I was a round brush to try to delicately take out those tangles and it would take forever.  This brush works quickly and takes out the tangles so well! I cant believe I have lived so long without this brush- which I love to use myself!  LOVE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> The brush works really well in the shower. Painless detangling for the kids. I just wonder about the bacteria/mold that collects in the brush if not replaced often.</li>
            <li> I ordered for my 6 year old daughter.  She likes the brush very much and finds it easy to use without pulling her hair.  Pink color is great!</li>
            <li> Very good brush . Nice size and construction. The only thing that is strange is the smell.  It is funny.</li>
            <li> Just buy it. You&#x27;ll thank me later. I could not be happier. I wish there was a purse size! Thumbs up</li>
            <li> My girls have long hair which is a nightmare to brush out. It is much worse in the summer after hours in the chlorine pool. This hairbrush is great - if you&#x27;re tired of the whining and tears associated with brushing out your kid&#x27;s long hair, give this brush a try! It&#x27;s at a great price too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller detangling brush for my toddler and because this appeared in the children&#x27;s section I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the dimensions- it&#x27;s a regular adult size hair brush. Works fine, but I was hoping for something sized for children.</li>
            <li> Its a great brush.  Easy on my scalp and yet sturdy enough to tackle my extremely thick and coarse hair.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that does not make my daughter cry when we brush her hair.  Bristles are thin, soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> The pink dye comes off of the handle of the brish on hands and stains. Also the brush was sitting on the bathroom counter top was wet it stained the counter top and I can not get it to come off. Horrible!!! :(</li>
            <li> Brush works well but has a strong and distinctive chemical odor which makes it inappropriate for use with my toddler&#x27;s hair as intended.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these wonderful brushes for my daughter and granddaughter. No more tears for the little one who has fine long hair. My daughter used to spend the better part of a half-hour detangling her hair. Wet OR dry these brushes do the job. It only took 5 minutes to get all the snarls out this time. We are SOLD on these brushes and I will purchase more to ensure they always have one within reach. Thanks SHARKK!</li>
            <li> My daughter very much likes using the SHARKK Hair Brush Professional Detangling Shower Brush For Wet Or Dry Hair (Pink). She has long hair and combing her long hair frustrates her. That has been reduced with this wonderful brush. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that can be a bit \\&quot;mousey\\&quot; at times, but since I have started using the wet brush instead of a comb I have noticed it&#x27;s behaving better. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought this, kind of doubting if it would actually work, but thought I would try since we have lots of tears over brushed hair in my household.  Oh my goodness! It works!  I&#x27;m definitely buying a few more to keep around the house and in the car.</li>
            <li> This brush has flexible bristles so there is less pulling. Works great on my&lt;br /&gt;Children&#x27;s hair! The shark brush is also a good price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item, we just love it, I had a chance to read reviews for the item and now I have a proof it does work, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, works well when hair is wet and dry. Very soft and easey to use. Thank you</li>
            <li> Brush only lasted about 3 months before the ends of the bristles came off. Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> BEWARE of the Metallic Pink!!!!  This stained my entire hand pink after brushing my daughters hair.  It smelled awful, but I wasn&#x27;t worried, I figured the smell would dissipate.  But I didn&#x27;t expect the color to come off in my hand.  My husband stained his hands just trying to pack it up for a return.  We DID NOT use this with a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sharkk Customer Service quickly sent me a replacement brush (which I appreciate).  My tender headed daughter likes this brush.  There are many similar de-tangler type brushes, but they don&#x27;t hold up.  I have had the replacement for quite some time and it has held up quite well.  The main problem with these type brushes are when the little balls fall off the end of the bristles, making brushing painful.  I have not had this problem.  I keep my brush on the counter and do not throw it in a drawer.  I did this with other brands, and still lost the balls.  So I am now ordering a 2nd brush for downstairs.  Hopefully it holds up as well.</li>
            <li> I have very curly multiracial hair, my kids do too. This brush effectively removes tangles but doesn&#x27;t rip our hair out. I will probably purchase another one in the near future.</li>
            <li> My daughter (3.5) has long curly hair. She would only let us use her baby brother&#x27;s &amp;#34;soft brush&amp;#34; baby brush on her hair...all others she screamed. Took my time reading reviews on detangler brushes &amp; decided to try this one. She was hesitant, but now I can brush her hair wet or dry with this brush and no tears. Good product.</li>
            <li> I had used a friends wet brush recently, and absolutely loved it! When I came across this brush it seemed to have the same features and I liked the pink better. It worked exactly the same and was absolutely amazing on my normally knotty hair right after the shower! It does not hurt anymore to brush my hair out after a shower and it works great on dry hair too!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!!! My 5 yr old loves this brush...it has definitely cut down the morning &amp;#34;battle of the brush&amp;#34; and it gives me extra time for my morning coffee! Happy mama!</li>
            <li> Works just as it says it does. Goes right through my daughters thick, long hair. Even after she hasn&#x27;t brushed it all weekend</li>
            <li> This works well on my daughters hair. She has extremely think hair and this product was recommended to us and I can see why, it&#x27;s great! If you having trouble brushing hair, especially after swimming, this is the product for you. Not good on dry hair though.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter (6 yo). It cuts through the snags in her hair wet or dry without the discomfort of other brushes. Leaves her hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s much easier to get the tangle out, this brush doesn&#x27;t provide any massage to the scalp. I use this brush to get the tangle out then I use my massaging brush after.</li>
            <li> With 2 young girls this has made my life a lot easier!  They love it. I would recommend this brush- you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally used this item, but my 7 year old daughter had told me numerous times that this brush works really well.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t believe a brush could actually detangle hair!  But this one actually does. But, it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on dry hair. I feel like it pulls too much hair out when I try it on dry hair, plus I end up with a big head of frizz! It looks like a typical wig brush but with tiny teeth but don&#x27;t be fooled, brush your wet hair with it &amp; you can throw away your detangler! I use this every time I was my hair! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this brush makes detangling so much easier but it truly does. I&#x27;m not going to say my girls love getting their hair brushed now but it&#x27;s definitely much less of an ordeal and we can get it done much faster now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second brush days after we got this one just to be safe (in case we misplace one at the pool). There&#x27;s no going back once you&#x27;ve tried it!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to brush and detangle hair... even very long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I really like this brush.  I have very thick long hair and it goes thru it great.</li>
            <li> I have one of these brushes already and have to say it is the best brush for children or anyone with hair that tangles easy! It tear free. I used to have to fight with my daughter to brush her hair. Now she brushes it her self this brush is awesome! But I never received the last one I ordered but amazon was so great I went to the chat explained my problem and they refunded me my money back. I plan on purchasing again but hopefully this time I will get it.</li>
            <li> We love this brush!  My daughter used to cry every time I brushed her wet hair...even with tons of detangling spray.  This brush glides through her fine hair without any drama.  I even use it on my fine, tangle-prone hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush looks similar to cheap brushes that scratch the scalp.  Do not mistake it for one of those!  I bought this brush to take on vacation with me, as it is lightweight.  Surprise - I like it ever so much better than my really expensive bristle brush.  It feels good going over my scalp, and does not pull my hair. I am buying an additional one to take to the pool with me so I can brush out my hair after swimming.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for this brush. It bent all the bristles and doesn&#x27;t quite detangle well now.</li>
            <li> 201 people have already given this product 5 stars so at first I didn&#x27;t think I would even need to bother to write a review.  But this brush worked so great, I felt the need to anyway.  Like other reviewers, my long, very thick hair is always tangled.  I can brush the knots completely out and take two steps and its tangled again.  I dreaded brushing my hair every morning because it took forever and I seemed to pull out endless clumps of hair just trying to get it smooth enough to wash (I wouldn&#x27;t DARE wash it with tangles, I would never be able to comb thru it wet!).  I have tried this brush on every scenario I could think of.  Morning hair, wind-blown hair and even wet hair and it worked perfect every time!  It looks like every other brush but for some reason it works differently. Believe the 200+ people and buy this brush!</li>
            <li> I have tried every &#x27;gimmick&#x27; detangling brush I could find for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s thick, straight hair, and this has been the best one so far.  We used the knot genie for several years, but it started falling apart, and my daughter found it hard to hold.  So we tried this one, and it has been a lifesaver.  It takes out knots much quicker, and less painfully.  She also never drops it!  She is much happier using this brush!</li>
            <li> the brush is the best and i have purchased several and we would search the house over to find it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grand daughters who have really long hair. I was amazed how well this worked and the girls were happy to have no tangles when brushing their hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, just as I expected with quick shipping. Thanks! It is the only brush I have found that is gentle on the head and gets the knots out without pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and I was getting to the point of cutting it, it was so difficult to keep brushed and would just tangle awfully out of the shower.  This brush helps me deal with the tangles without making me want to just cut the whole thing off.  Highly recommend to anyone with long hair.</li>
            <li> The reviews are true, I brushed through my daughter&#x27;s hair without a flinch.  We were both impressed with how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this brush really DOES detangle my very thick wavy hair - wet or dry. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. I&#x27;ll be ordering another for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> This brush works nicely with wet or dry hair. Seems to tackle some pretty bad tangles without too much fuss. The bristles give your head a nice little message too. :)</li>
            <li> I tried this brush, not knowing how it would do on a black woman&#x27;s hair and I must say I was pleasantly surprised!  First, the brush handle has a soft plastic feel, almost like the feel of silicone, with a wide base for you to hold on to.  As I used the brush on my hair (thick, shoulder length hair), it DID NOT pull out my hair nor did it leave my hair with that \\&quot;static cling look\\&quot; like I thought it would and it added lift and body to my curls.  The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; have space in between them which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I received this product recently in the mail. I really like it. I have tangly hair, so getting through my hair, wet, with a brush really helps.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush several weeks now and it still smells strongly of plastic chemicals.  I am concerned that smell transfers to my hair when I brush it so I&#x27;ve washed the brush several times and have been leaving it outside to off-gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles do not tangle in my hair, but I would not buy this brush again because the handle is angular and uncomfortable to hold, but mainly because of the awful smell that has remained for weeks.</li>
            <li> this brush glides through the straw hair my daughter has from swimming every day in the summer.  The balls of knots are gone with ease.  Start at the top of the head and work your way down.  Cream conditioner from Organics helps this along.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful for my hair!  I love it! It is what i wanted.  many colors to chose, it is beautiful!</li>
            <li> This brush detangles and separated my curls very nicely after washing.  No pulling and not too much hair in the brush when I&#x27;m done.  A good solid brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on my daughter&#x27;s long, tangly, baby-fine hair. However, it has a terrible rubber smell. Even after several days in the sun to off-gas and a month of use, it still stinks. It&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s the first thing I smell when I go into the bathroom. Will look for this type brush with a different handle (and from a different mfg) in the future.</li>
            <li> cheaply made,,used it for a month and tossed it,,may work for a child&#x27;s thin fine hair</li>
            <li> I have a 6 year old that always complained every time I brushed her hair. This brush has taken all the complaining away!! Amazing!! It&#x27;s such a good brush I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a normal brush. Nothing special. Not worth the extra cash.</li>
            <li> This is far and beyond the best brush I have ever purchased. You know what? It may be the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, course, wavy hair. I use (salon brand)shampoo and conditioner, followed by a leave-in conditioner when I get out of the shower. It is STILL a pain to brush through these locks. I dread it! I am 28 years old, and if I could go back in time, probably the first thing I&#x27;d do is give my mother this brush to use when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs through knots EFFORTLESSLY, and does not pull out half of my hair, unlike my other brushes. (I&#x27;ve tried A LOT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this brush at ten times the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: This brush is AMAZING. Stop reading reviews and buy it.</li>
            <li> Using this hairbrush makes my scalp feel like it&#x27;s getting a gentle massage.  My hair is short &amp; thick, but I think this brush will also be very good on my daughter&#x27;s long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tangles horribly.  I don&#x27;t normally brush my hair straight out of the shower.  However, when I want to this is what I use.  It brushes right through my curls without tearing my hair out and without hurting my head.  Great for anyone with tangles.  Works on dry and wet hair equally well.</li>
            <li> brushing my girls hair was always a fight until we got this brush. Works well with wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> Affordable and actually works they way it&#x27;s supposed to...weird.  I like it a lot.  It feels good going through my hair and on my scalp and it detangles well.  I can definitely tell the difference between my other brushes and this one.  I actually bought this as my travel brush but it&#x27;s already becoming my every day brush.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy brushing my long hair again! This is an excellent brush that gently straightens / detangles long locks of hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush, totally gets the tanges out of my dry hair. Will only use this brush from now on, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I normally do not try to comb out my hair when it&#x27;s wet.  However, I tried this brush and it worked very well.  Still had to tug a couple of times, but overall very happy.  I bought two additional brushes for my daughters.  I think they will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it tangles easily.  This brush is very effective in de-tangling.  I was sceptical about buying this Shark Hair brush,  but now, I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> As a father of 3 teenage girls I understand the chaos and destruction that occur around the home when hairbrushes are nowhere to be found. I bought 10 of these because I was tired of being late everywhere because quote “I can’t find a brush”. This brush had good reviews and was at a good price point, so I bought enough for everyone to have one for their purse, one in each bathroom and have a couple spares. I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Primary likes (as of three weeks use),&lt;br /&gt;My tender headed daughter loves them and swears they do not pull on her tangles the same way our other brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;My oldest likes to brush her hair in the shower, and that brush seems unaffected by the wet use.&lt;br /&gt;They have a slightly rubber feeling in the plastic that works well wet or dry, gives a firm grip without feeling sticky.&lt;br /&gt;They seem pretty sturdy and are a nice size on both the handle and brush head.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are actually really soft on your scalp, noticeably so.</li>
            <li> This brush gets knots out of my daughters long hair and doesn&#x27;t yank her head back like other brushes. You just keep working at it and the knots come out nicely! Good construction. Girls love the color too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful - just what I was looking for to use in our Operation Christmas Child shoebox. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> It did have an awful smell which dissipated in a few days. I have never had a brush like this. My hair gets so tangled and matted no matter what I do. I have had to cut knots out because they have gotten so bad. This brush is amazing! I have never used anything like it. It really gets the knots out! I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> I like this brush but the price is not worth it lower it by 2$ and it will be worth paying for .</li>
            <li> We gave this brush to my 3.5 year old who has incredibly thick hair and always complains when we brush her hair. This brush is virtually ouchless and is a great quality brush</li>
            <li> Does not pull or yank hair like some other brushes have.  Would buy again!  Just wish it would go on sale again!</li>
            <li> Great quality brush for the price compare to the ones you buy at stores for $8-12 or more. It will be nice if it comes in other color.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved my SHARKK Detangling Hair Brush.  I have waist length, very fine hair and a tender head and I can never find a hair brush that will both be gentle on my scalp and hair while still getting out the tangles.  This hair brush has everything that I have always been looking for in a brush.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to brush my hair without bringing tears to my eyes.  I liked this brush so much that I let my mom try it (her hair is just like mine, just not as long) and she liked it so much that I&#x27;m going to order one for her too.  For all you tender-headed ladies, SHARKK Detangling Hair Brush (the pink one) is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for a little over 2 months and I love it.  It works well for both wet and dry hair just as described.  I have thick curly hair and this brush works great for detangling.  It looks nice and is a great size.  I was happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush!!!! It brushes all tangles without hurting my head. It leaves my hair in place and looking beautiful. I do recommend this inexpensive hair brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair that gets tangled easily and this works on wet or dry hair. She is happy with this brush!! :-)</li>
            <li> One of my daughters&#x27; hair is very fine, and tangles easily.  I have tried detangler, although it works, I don&#x27;t like putting products on her hair or spaying it in her face every morning.  I am not sure if this is the same as any other round brushes sold in 99 cents store, but I was sold on all the positive reviews people gave.  I have been using it for over a week now; on myself, my daughters as well and I love the result.  It really helps brushing and no more tears.  The tips can hurt if you aren&#x27;t careful.  But after one or two ouches, I learned to brush lightly and it worked wonderfully.  The only thing I have to complain though is the smell.  The vinyl smell is so strong, my daughter asked if it&#x27;s going to leave on her hair.  But nothing a little air out can&#x27;t do.  I would recommend this and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. When I first ordered it I didn&#x27;t have big expectations, but WOW! Even my 13-year-old son likes it and will sneak in my room and use it because it makes his hair look &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product was what I expected. I would recommend it at this price to anyone. it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sharkk&#x27;s Detangling Brush is wonderful.  It is so much easier to brush through my long, thick hair using this product.  I have recommended this product to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought for our 5 year old who has beautiful curly hair but can get difficult to manage. This brush allows a quick comb through without any pulling or pain. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I seriously regret not getting this earlier for my 4.5 year old daughter! I can&#x27;t believe all this time I&#x27;ve been doing her hair without a brush like this! The ponytails I used to make were always not quite perfect and now it&#x27;s just so easy to smooth everything out and best of all, without tears! I&#x27;m going to recommend this to every mom that struggles with her little girl&#x27;s tangled hair. I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for myself too so I don&#x27;t have to sneak hers to brush my hair :) It&#x27;s also so much faster than a wooden comb I was using, just a couple of strokes and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> have long fine hair this works great - was going to get the $20.00 no tangle brush - glad I got this one instead</li>
            <li> Bought two of these hairbrushes last week. All I can say is WOW.&lt;br /&gt;They slide through my daughters hair with ease. Going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I tend to have tangled hair AND I&#x27;m a swimmer, but this brush really helps to detangle my hair after a swim and/or shower. It works a lot better than any of my regular hair brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter.  She has thick hair and its a nightmare trying to brush it out after a bath.  She can now brush her own hair and it amazed it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this brush. But upon receiving it, I was extremely disappointed. The quality was cheap, and it reeked of toxic chemicals. How does anyone expect to this through my hair? Not worth even $1.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush the first time for my 5 year old daughter who has long, rather fine hair that tangles very easily.  The brush is fabulous....truly either with wet or dry hair.  We&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the first one to really work!  I recently purchased another one for my 16 year old niece and am thinking about purchasing more when more colors are available again.  Love it!!!  Also, we like the size....not too small, but small enough to be comfortable and controllable for small hands.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and it comes in my favorite color of course! I have really curly hair and its great to use when wet or dry and it does help with the pulling and tugging unlike normal brushes.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 6 months, and now it is getting a little worn. The balls on the end of the bristles and coming off and the bristles are getting bent. A little pokey on your scalp and neck when brushing now. But I think I will purchase another one soon</li>
            <li> I got this brush to put into a care package to give to me sister-in-law to take to the hospital when she went to have a baby so I don&#x27;t know first hand but she said it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time (love amazon prime!) and was in perfect condition, it is wrapped in plastic so it wont get dirty when being shipped.</li>
            <li> The sharkk hair brush is working great on my tender headed four year old.  I don&#x27;t even have to use detangling spray on her hair.</li>
            <li> My girls and I have medium-fine hair. We LOVE this brush! The handle is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my grip. Of course the color is fun and as marvelously PINK as advertised. The bristles are the perfect balance of structure and softness. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> My daughter was hospitalized and couldn&#x27;t do her hair for two weeks. When she finally got home, this brush was a godsend! It did wonders for her hair. I&#x27;d originally purchased it for myself, but gave it to her, so I have to get another for myself! It is a great find!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush, and that&#x27;s really all that matters.  The brush arrived completely sealed and sanitary, and I really appreciate that!  It is easy for my daughter to use; and I love that she doesn&#x27;t lose handfuls of hair like she used to detangling with a wide-toothed comb---the brush works its way through knots with relative ease (there will always be SOME work!), and is fairly painless for her.  My daughter has thick, long, straight hair that tangles really easily, if it helps.</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; thick and it was an ordeal to brush it out after a wash so when I saw The Sharkk Brush &amp; The Wet Brush I ordered both, they look the same but they are not.  The Wet Brush is well made &amp; fantastic with wet &amp; dry hair but the Sharkk is not.  The Sharkk Brush has weak bristles and works okay with dry hair but when I tried to brush conditioner through my wet hair the bristles went flat and the conditioner went no where.  After I towel wrapped my hair I thought I&#x27;d give it another try on wet hair and, again, the bristles went flat.  I paid $5.oo more for the excellent Wet Brush (very happy I did so) and lost $4.oo on the Sharkk.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved this brush she has long hair and this brush made it easy to brush out her wet hair.</li>
            <li> Made brushing my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair so easy!  Life changer.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! all the good things other reviewers have said about it (e.g. rubbery handle, good size, detangling powers, etc) are true!! The only thing that made this 4 stars for me is when I brush my dry hair with this, my hair becomes quite poofy and static, so I only use this brush on wet hair. [Note: I have thin, fine hair, if that makes a difference?]</li>
            <li> my wife love&#x60;s this hair brush and say&#x60;s it&#x60;s better then the rest of them that she has before she love&#x60;s them so much i am going order her two more............these&#x60;s brushes dose what they say it dose not pull your hair out either i am starting to buy two every month so my wife can have a extra incase she misplace ut and it&#x60;s made for wet nor dry hair i give it a 200% postive feed back all the time if they had one on here,oh you cant not break them at all their made from a very tough&amp;hard rubber</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s long hair is tangle free in 60 seconds with no complaining. Wet or dry, it works well for both!</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, very thick curly hair and I think she has tried every brush on the market before finding this terrific brush which easily goes through her wet thick curly hair and even straightens it. She told me, and  I ordered brushes for myself and two young granddaughters. We all have similar type hair and this brush is the one of our dreams. So that is 3 generations who recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Wow! save @10-15 mins not fighting my hair every day.  sent one to my daughter - her boys each want their own.</li>
            <li> Wished I ordered more. My mom loves it. We both have long, fine hair that tangles often but with this brush, we managed to rid the pulling and tugging. Would definitely order again and in bulk too since the price is so good.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair.  This brush has many little bristles that flex as you brush, so there&#x27;s less pulling and tugging.  When I first used it, it was so painless that I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be brushing through my hair.  But, it was.  The price of this brush was so inexpensive.  A lot less than I would have paid at Walmart, for a brush that I would have settled for.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that likes to tangle more than I would prefer.  My hair is no longer thick, so I would like to keep as much as possible attached to my scalp for obvious reasons.  And I don&#x27;t like pain.  This nice brush gently does the trick for me, and at a very reasonable price.  Toss one in your cart and include it with your next order.  It might be just the thing for you, too.  The risk is certainly minimal, and the quality, surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for my curly hair. Doesn&#x27;t hurt because of its soft bristles. I definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on wet hair or dry. I have very long colored hair and it tends to get very tangled i was very happy with how great this brush worked on my hair. I plan on purchasing a couple more for my daughter and granddaughters.&lt;br /&gt;mahalo!</li>
            <li> We had issues with the pink brush bleeding pink when it became wet. Amazon returned our money and Sharkk reached out to us and sent us a replacement free of charge. The new, non-pink brush is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair and Sharkk&#x27;s customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li> This truly does does tangle stubborn hair painlessly! It was nice to find it in a nice color as well.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter is absolutely in love with this brush. She says is the best one she has ever used. Great product, cant be beat at this price. Excellent service also.</li>
            <li> These brushes were in the Christmas stockings of my two 11-year-old granddaughters, and they LOVE them!  They both have thick hair -- one fine and blond and one more coarse and dark.  Getting them to THOROUGHLY brush their hair has sometimes been a challenge, but this brush takes the pain out of the process.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The hair brush made my hair frizzy and full of static.  The price was right, but had I had known what my hair would look like later I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing; not only does it detangle my daughters hair with ease, it makes my hair feel invigorated!&lt;br /&gt;I brush my hair with this brush and my hair looks thicker immediately.</li>
            <li> We like this brush so much be have purchased multiple.  Works great on fine hair, we like it so much the whole family uses one.</li>
            <li> I have two de-tangling hair brushes for my long wavy hair. The wet brush and this one. Although they both take out the knots, wet or dry, without the pain of other brushes; the Sharkk feels better on the scalp. It is a firmer brush without being a painful one so it&#x27;s fast and effective without ripping. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great for tangly hair!  My daughter and I are both plagued with tangles and this brushes them right out without tears.</li>
            <li> My hair usually takes about 5 mins to brush all the tangles out of, this took less than two mins!!!! it is AMAZING!!!! my son is mixed and has extremely curly hair and it worked miracles for him too!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used a Wet Brush (not Sharkk brand) on my hair at the salon and I really liked it, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $10-15 on a brush so I just brushed it off (no pun intended) and moved on. However, as I kept growing my hair out I was getting increasingly irritated whenever I would wash my hair because my hair seemed to be getting so tangly! I wasn&#x27;t due to see my stylist for a bit so I hopped on Amazon hoping I could get a two-day delivery on a brush. Lo and behold I find this particular brush and it had great reviews! I was a little skeptical for the price, but I purchased it and I have been using it daily ever since (about 8 months). It has held up exceptionally and all of the bristles are still in tact. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair and it combs through so easily. I know other brands exist, but in my mind this one is just as great as the rest. I have already recommended that my mom buy one and I would definitely recommend to anyone else looking into purchasing one.</li>
            <li> Brushing time for my 3 year old daughter down from about 30 minutes to about 5-7 minutes. Tears for the brushing down to almost zero. I still have to be carefull but this brush is really good. Plus she likes that it is pink.</li>
            <li> I was on a hunt for a detangling brush after reading the blog reviews of the \\&quot;Goody\\&quot; brand detangler, I couldn&#x27;t find it in store anywhere so I went online to try and find something similar, that&#x27;s when I stumbled upon this brush. Not only is it super affordable but it TOTALLY works! I can take a breath and my hair is in tangles, this VERY smoothly untangles my worst knots, I&#x27;m so sad I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner!!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and have bought 3 for me and one for my niece. They do not pull on your hair at all. Sometimes they miss a knot or two, so now I brush through once with this and then follow with a standard brush. Still much better than using just a normal brush.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has curly hair and its always getting tangled (very bad) this brush works womderful on her hair wet or dry!!! It detangles with in seconds without her crying that im pulling her hair!! So happy i found this brush for her&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, this sounded like a brush that my fine hair would benefit from. Having purchased hair items with plenty of promises in the past before, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot -- but, to my surprise, this brush delivered. On either wet or dry hair, this brush glides right through, and I&#x27;m not left with a brush of hair either (much less than my other brushes, and nearly none in fact). I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush; and too boot, it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The handle fits the palm comfortably and is very sturdy. I have very curly hair and the bristles did not stag my hair. I found it to be very soothing and soft to my scalp. I even used it on my 91 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s hair with no problems. My only concern is that the bristles are very thin and I don&#x27;t know how long they will last.</li>
            <li> I actually like this brush this is an edited version of my previous review because I barely gave the brush a good look over or tried it out before I wrote the previous review. So now that I&#x27;ve had the brush for a while I really like it I use it everyday and I said previously that the bristles were bent but it was only because of the packaging but the brush went back to its original form shortly after taking it out of the packaging. I like it doesn&#x27;t pull all my hair out while brushing, and the bristles are soft but strong, none have came out and the best part is its a really pretty pink color. I would order from again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush, my daughter loves it, and she has super thick hair and hates to brush it, this brush glides right through, just ordered one for myself!</li>
            <li> SHARKK sent me this brush for free to make up for a mess-up Amazon had with one of my orders. I thought it would be just like any other brush, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. This brush gets all the knots out of my hair easily. Also, it feels really soft on the scalp unlike regular brushes that tend to tug on your hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> My three year old loves this brush. It has saved me many of tears and fits. I bought one for everyone in my family, one for travel, my car, you name it!&lt;br /&gt;Best brush ever. It is so soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> The brush works great in my wife&#x27;s very thick hair without any discomfort from the bristles or tangling. They haven&#x27;t really tried it in the shower, but the real amazing feat is how well it works in my daughters thin, very fine hair. She is constantly tangled in the mornings when she wakes up and we have always had to use a detangling spray before brushing.  The brush works very well... no more tangles and no more smelly chemical sprays on our beautiful daughter&#x27;s head!!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> We were given a similar brush and really liked it.  When I saw this, it looked almost identical and so I bought this for a cousin&#x27;s daughter who has long curly hair and she loved it!  It does a really good job of getting through the tangles with almost NO fuss!  AWESOME brush!</li>
            <li> I used to dread brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair because of the screaming and tears. This brush was a sanity saver for both myself and my daughter. It ACTUALLY doesn&#x27;t hurt! BUT it sure as heck smelled very bad when it arrived. A chemical plastic smell that lasted for a week but then gradually dissipated. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and the smell has gone. But it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying another one...that&#x27;s how well it works!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairbrush for my daughter. She doesn&#x27;t have any complain. This one is better compared to the one she used.  She has found it easier to manage her thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> Upon opening this brush I was very skeptical it would ever detangle wet long hair.  It did a wonderful job on my long, thick dry hair and felt so good while brushing. That was enough to make me happy with my purchase but I just couldn&#x27;t believe it would ever work on my wet hair. I took it into the shower with me and washed my hair.  I have a large hair pick I usually use after I wash my hair, but tried the brush instead.  I don&#x27;t understand how such a soft bristled brush could work on wet hair, but did it ever! The brush went right through my hair, much better than the pick ever did.  The amount of loose hair on the brush was incredible.  After brushing I applied cream rinse to my hair and brush it through.  Again the brush went right through my hair. After rinsing the cream rinse out and towel drying my hair I brush my hair again.  Once more the brush went right through my hair.  I have no idea why this brush works so well but believe me it does.  Concerning the odor other reviewers have commented on, I did notice a rubbery smell to the brush when I first used it.  After using the brush in the shower the smell was almost gone.  I&#x27;d recommend washing the brush before you use it if the smell really bothers you. After several trips to the shower the smell was gone.  The slight odor in the beginning was a small price to pay for such a wonderful hair brush.  It arrived very quickly, the price was great and I would definitely purchase from this supplier again.  I&#x27;m hoping they make this brush in a small purse size!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested I purchase a &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; to help with my thick hair after showering.  She even used hers after shampooing my hair so I could feel the difference.  Afterwards, I logged on and purchased this brush!  Im not 100% satisfied as my hair seems just as tangly as with my other brushes and makes me question if is this even a &#x27;wet brush&#x27;??</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair the brush goes smoothly through it without hurting it. we had a couple of other brushes but this one is so far the best.  if we ever need another brush we will definitely get this one soft to all hair and good with wet and dry. love it. if there was 10 stars I would give them all</li>
            <li> I chose this brush because it was half of the price of similar brushes. I am extremely pleased with the way it works on my shoulder length, wavy hair. I purchased it because of the time &amp; difficulty involved in detangling my hair after a shower. It works great on both wet hair &amp; dry- no pain &amp; efficient. It has held up wonderfully so far. I would definitely purchase it again &amp; would add this to a list of necessary (&amp; favorite) grooming products.</li>
            <li> For three years, I have been unable to brush my daughters hair because she didnt like brushes. We used a lot of conditioner, a comb and wasted a lot of money finding the right brush. OH MY GOODNESS!!! She LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this brush! Wet or dry I can brush her hair - FINALLY NO MORE COMBS! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I liked hers so well, I purchased one for me! :) I LOVE it too!</li>
            <li> You got what you paid for,  I lost my old wet brush  which is the one around $9 .This one is cheaper, and the review is good. The brush did have the horrible smell like the other reviewer said. They must used the cheapest Materials and it&#x27;s toxic. Don&#x27;t buy thus brush.</li>
            <li> We love this brush.  This is our purchase of a second one, because one of our girls always had the first brush in her room.  Great for long, wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have an over reacting, drama queen of a 5 yr old.  She is very dramatic and sensitive to everything with a very low pain tolerance.  Needless to say the hair brushing time is always a dreaded time for us with her thick waist length hair.  Well this brush is the BOMB!!!!  it is awesome.  she was amazed with is as well.  Every morning I tell her to come her so I can brush your hair. She says..... &amp;#34; Give me the brush Mommy, I want to brush my own hair because I can with my new brush!&amp;#34; I am ordering 2 more for extras and all my other brushes are finding new homes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my four year old daughter. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this brush and haven&#x27;t heard her complain about tugs or knots in her hair.  I will have to order one for myself.</li>
            <li> best hairbrush ever! I have long thick hair and it works so well with wet or dry hair. plus the color is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit when I read about a brush that will make detangling hair easier and less painful, I&#x27;m a bit skeptical.  And let me say, my daughter is \\&quot;the princess of tangles\\&quot; with long hair that is in a constant tangled mess (I&#x27;ve tried to convince her to cut it, but it hasn&#x27;t worked yet)...and yes, we go through the yelling, holding the hair from brushing, and even a few tears from time to time.  So, enter the SHARKK brush...my new favorite product!  It is wonderful, it REALLY does go through the hair and detangles BETTER than even using a detangler spray in my opinion!  It&#x27;s a perfect size for both my seven year old and me to use (think after workout tangles!) and it&#x27;s made mornings a lot less stressful and a lot more pleasant.  I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone!  Oh and of course it comes in pink, our favorite color :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought, yeah right.  They&#x27;re TRUE.  This is a miracle brush.  There are no more tantrums about brushing her hair...wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairbrush and totally recommend it especially if you have thick or curly hair. I used to spend a good 15 minutes brushing my kids hair (they have very long curly hair) every night after their baths. With this brush, it literally takes 1 minute to go through their long, curly hair leaving it beautiful and detangled immediately!A mother&#x27;s dream..HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> This hairbrush has numerous semi-soft pins with protector points, a nice non-slip handle, and I love the color.  It feels nice against my scalp, not scratchy, and works well with my short thick hair. There was a faint rubbery smell when I opemed the package, but that has dissipated now. I might get another brush for my pets!</li>
            <li> Witha little bit of heat this brush has gotten ruined in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> The best brush we&#x27;ve found for my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair. It really works. I can see the difference even more when I use one of my brushes on her hair and it pulls and there are tears!</li>
            <li> my daughter had long waste length hair and hated me  brushing it cus the other brushed pulled and made it so unpleasing when brushing her hair . UNTIL this little brush came along now she loves to brush her hair out thank goodness for this hair brush recommend it to other people</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush, and I&#x27;ll be buying it again if I ever need to replace mine. It gets the tangles out without breaking hair... what more can you ask of a brush?</li>
            <li> This is a great hair brush. My daughter has long, luxurious hair that sometimes tangles. She also has Rett Syndrome that has taken her voice, so she cannot tell me when it pulls her hair. This new brush has eliminated the majority of tangles. It is everything that I need it to be in a brush for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, for my 3 year old. She has beautiful curly hair but can get tangled easily... well we couldn&#x27;t pass the chemical smell of this brush.... it was awful.... even after a week still stinks.... I wouldn&#x27;t brush my daughter&#x27;s hair with this brush, who knows what kind of chemicals are in the brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. After a few weeks, the ends began to wear and the brush was getting painful to use. I contacted SHARKK and they sent out two replacement brushes as they didn&#x27;t know why my brush was defective. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the replacements. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to have strong enough &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; to get the tangles out very well (they bend I think) but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product review I have ever done. When something so small as a brush can bring peace to my house I knew I had to share. My10 year old daughter and I have daily battles about her tangled hair but from the moment she first used this brush the battles have ended and she actually wants to brush her hair. Not only has it stopped the battles but now she can do it by herself and it is done perfectly. So it brought her independence and confidence and me a peaceful home. Hope you enjoy this brush as much as we do.</li>
            <li> I have very long and fine hair, this brush gets out all the knots without tearing out all of my hair. I can&#x27;t believe how well this brush works. My other brushes are full of hair and the sharkk brush only has a strand or two. It&#x27;s amazing I love this brush and will order more for friends and family!! Oh and it&#x27;s a great price :)</li>
            <li> This brush  is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, both for the shower and just general brushing.  In fact I&#x27;m getting ready to order a second one so I can keep one in the shower stall and one on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; or Michelle Mercier style brushes but for a fraction of the cost. Worth  it to try out to see if the others are really worth investing in - (&amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; is MY personal favorite)</li>
            <li> For me, this hair brush is not firm enough and its little ticks (teeth?) are too thin. Maybe some items are not meant to be bought on line: you can&#x27;t get the feeling without touching it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the most challenging hair to brush, a mix between curls and texture.  Before this brush, she would complained, screamed, cried, pouted, and just made my job so hard in trying to keep her hair in order.  I tried just about everything too.  From conditioners, detangling sprays, big tooth combs, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;I was first interested in the Mercier detangling brush, seeing their commercial online.  But when I looked that up, the reviews for that weren&#x27;t so good.  While looking for that brush though, I came across this super magical brush.  I was skeptical, but for the price I figured it was worth the try.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it I thought I was dreaming.  This brush works so well, I no longer need sprays or other chemicals to put on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  No more pulling, no more fighting, no more tears.  My mornings all of a sudden become so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> this brush is ok but  my granddaughter didn&#x27;t like the way it pulled her hair  She was disappointed  but will use it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and even more so when I got it.  I remember these kinds of brushes from when I was younger and wigs were the thing.  That&#x27;s what the brushes were used for.  I&#x27;m so happy that this is the answer to detangling my hair.  I have very thin hair and always have tangles after washing it.  This works!</li>
            <li> Tried a couple of different detangling brushes for my daughter&#x27;s very thick, slightly wavy hair and this one worked the best. It was purchased as an add-on and was a great price. It worked so well for us that I bought four more - never wanted to be caught without one. Until trying a detangling brush, getting the knots out was a nightmare - I would use detangling sprays (didn&#x27;t really work for us) and lots of conditioner and hair oils, which are helpful. We got this  brush and have now been using it for more than two years and she won&#x27;t use anything else - no exaggeration. It works well for wet hair as well as dry. And, while it is not a miracle brush, major snags still require working through, it has made the hair brushing process much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> This SHARKK hair brush is the best hair brush you will ever own.  I have a house full of girls and this hair brush is their favorite.  It is excellent at gently detangling wet or dry hair.  I wish I had this hair brush years ago, but I am just happy to have it now.  Buy at least two!  You&#x27;ll fall in love with this hairbrush.  It is so gentle and easy to comb through the toughest hair.  Plus, the price is great!</li>
            <li> My nearly three year old daughter used to cry when I&#x27;d brush her hair with a boarshead brush.  She has fine hair and I think an overly sensitive scalp.  Anyway,&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on this brush and she is 95% converted.  Some days she still runs away,  but most of the time she sits still and doesn&#x27;t even wince.  I&#x27;ve noticed the slower you drag the brush through the hair, the easier it seems to be.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s marginally better than my other brush, but not a miracle cure for tangles. Based on the description and reviews,  I expected it to slide through hair like butter. It does not; but for the price it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li> There is only one thing to be said about this brush: It is easily the best brush I have ever used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my stats:&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity: mixed ( black, portugese, middle eastern)&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: fine strands, but thick, extremely curly&lt;br /&gt;Length: medium to long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;99% of the time, I wear my hair up because of the time it takes to brush it out. I never use a brush on wet hair and the only way to really get my hair tangle free was to douse with tons of conditioner while in the shower,  and spend a good 25 minutes with a wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;It is never recommended to use a brush on wet, curly hair, but I have to say that this theory is thrown out the window when using this Sharkk brush. There are no snags when brushing and the ease of which it glides through your hair is amazing. I initially bought this for my daughter who also has long, curly hair and it worked so wonderfully on hers, I thought I would try it on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get over how good this brush works and how it cuts back on the time spent brushing! My hair is as thick and tangle-prone as it gets, so believe me when I say that if this brush can work on my hair, it will definitely work on yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only purchased 1 of these to try, but at $5, I&#x27;m going to order about 4 more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to report that this brush has in fact eliminated the tears and whining that usually go along with daily brushing of my 5-year-old&#x27;s hair. She loves the brush and is now actually excited for me to brush her curly, tangly hair, and will even brush it herself. She claims that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> This inexpensive hairbrush was a big happy surprise.  I have very long hair, and I&#x27;m careful about brushes that&lt;br /&gt;often pull my hair out.  I usually buy brushes with metal teeth, but this time I took a chance and bought this brush&lt;br /&gt;made of plastic/vinyl.  It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve found in years, it never pulls my hair painfully, it glides through wet long hair fairly easily, and there is very little hair loss.  It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to clean, and I wish I had purchased more than one.  I&#x27;ve changed my mind about brushes made of plastic after using this one - but it&#x27;s the exception.</li>
            <li> No More Pain!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When We comb my daughter&#x27;s blonde thin hair full of bed head knots before school and after shower!!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more for my nieces not sure how they will hold up but for less than $5 bucks that&#x27;s a deal!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. My daughter absolutely loves it.  No more ouch your pulling my hair in the morning.  It&#x27;s a must-have for every one who has hard to brush out tangled  hair .

No joke this product works wonders. Don&#x27;t let bad reviews stop you from buying this amazing hair brush. It doesn&#x27;t  have a weird smell,it works great on wet or dry hair,you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I Love it.I am buying one of each color!!</li>
            <li> works better on wet hair, but also works better than a regular brush on dry hair as well. no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because I suspected that the brush I owned at the time was causing me to lose some hair by pulling it out. I was losing a lot of hair especially right after I washed it-- every time I ran the brush through it, gobs of hair would come out each time! When I received this brush, I could immediately feel a big difference just brushing through it dry, but when my hair was wet and tangled, I could really tell a difference! The amount of hair that came out was dramatically lessened! Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> this brush is fine. it&#x27;s not fancy or anything, but it works and the price is right. the brush is a little softer than expected but has no problems brushing through light knots (my hair is mostly straight), i can&#x27;t tell you how it would do on tangled curls though.</li>
            <li> My daughter is extremely happy that we purchased this item. When it first arrived, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be that much different than any other brush, but there is something magical about it that takes the ouch out of brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft on my young daughters fine hair!  No more tears!  It massages the scalp oh so nice and works on my thick, coarse, curly hair without too much frizz.  I only gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but at the price, I can always get another one.  I have been telling everyone to get one if their child cries or hates hair brushing</li>
            <li> All that follows are the words of my girlfriend, who uses this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I feel like a bada** when I use this brush because it has the word SHARKK on it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The head of the brush easily fits in my hand, which is not typical&lt;br /&gt;*Love the texture&lt;br /&gt;*Easily brushes through tangles and knots&lt;br /&gt;*Cleaning out hair is simple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that could be better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far nothing! I&#x27;ll let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and the quality, this can&#x27;t be beat. Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> I was about ready to cut off my little girl&#x27;s hair.  Every time I tried to brush out her hair was a major struggle with her in tears (and me too!) (even using detangling sprays). I don&#x27;t remember where I heard about the hairbrush but I&#x27;m so glad that I gave it a try.  It really works!  She doesn&#x27;t even flinch now when I brush her hair which is a major difference from her screaming her head off!  Thanks so much, we&#x27;re keeping her long hair, thanks to the SHARKK Hair Brush!</li>
            <li> I have long pretty thick hair and was getting frustrated when I was combing/brushing my hair after a shower - this brush was the answer! My stylist recommended it to me and I am so happy I took her advice!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these as much as I hoped to. They have a sharp feel on your scalp if you have fine hair. These might be better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush on a whim, but I actually really love it! It breezes through my hair, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because it had a super funky smell (plastic-y) at the beginning, but it&#x27;s faded a little. I&#x27;m hoping it will go away completely, because that&#x27;s really the only drawback to this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my hair was down to the bottom of my back - long, curly, and thick, and I&#x27;d wake up with super-tangled hair every day.  I also have a daughter with thin, super curly hair down to her shoulders.  On me, it hurt less than other brushes in tangled hair, but seemed like the bristles bent rather than removing the tangles.  My daughter cries and runs away at the sight of this brush now.  I had heard about the Wet Brush and figured I&#x27;d try this since it was less expensive.  I guess I still can&#x27;t compare to the Wet brush since I haven&#x27;t tried it, but this wasn&#x27;t the miracle it was claimed to be and might have damaged my hair making it more likely to tangle.  As other reviewers mentioned it had a really strong chemical smell.  Often when people say things like that I think they are over-sensitive, but I still notice the smell every time I pick it up.  I don&#x27;t notice it just walking in the bathroom and it hasn&#x27;t prevented me from using the brush hoping it would live up to its description. At this point, I have returned to using my previous brush though since it seems to damage my hair less.</li>
            <li> This brush has helped make my life so much easier. I have very long hair and before I used this brush it was very difficult to brush all the way through; I&#x27;d end up with a handful of hair and a sore scalp. I have fibromyalgia and my arms would be in pain by the time I was done also. With the sharkk brush, I can easily brush through my hair virtually pain free, without a lot of breakage, and in half the time. I love it!

            <li> I bought this item expecting a regular brush,,usually too hard. I was pleasantly surprised that is was easy on the scalp and it worked. I bought two more for my niece and daughter who have really thick unruly hair. The price and the quality are fantastic</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this SHARKK Hair Brush.  This brush does work well with detangling my hair in the shower or just out of the shower.  And what I like most is that it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it brushes through well.</li>
            <li> Im nearly 30 &amp; have hair down to my rear end &amp; its not just any ole hair either. I call it \\&quot;horse hair.\\&quot; My boyfriend calls it \\&quot;mutant hair\\&quot; because it is super thick &amp; heavy. This is by far the absolute best brush ive ever had in my entire life....and i have had hundreds! Amazon sells quite a few different brushes that are more or less functionally the same as this one...and I read through tons of the reviews for many of them. Every single one had reviews that were causing me to bust a gut laughing because of all the hilarious stories from parents about chasing their daughters all over creation when it was time to brush out their hair. I am so happy to know that this torture is bestowed on other children &amp; it wasn&#x27;t just me! (j/k)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a child there was no battle in the house bigger than the one between my mother and I when she wanted to brush out my tangles. I screamed &amp; cried &amp; kicked &amp; moaned the whole time my hair was getting brushed until I eventually grew into one of those people that can barely feel any tugging at all. As an adult when Id brush my hair I could literally hear the brush struggle with the tangles &amp; knots like a rake over a pile of leaves &amp; weeds, yet feel no pain. My issue these days is the amount of time it takes just to brush my dang hair! All my brushes were always ripping out tons of hairs - tons! But all of that was before I got this SHARK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that other brands besides SHARK make nearly identical brushes but the prices vary quite a bit. I have not used any other brand but this one. Another brand, in particular, appeared to have the market cornered on these things but they wanted at least twice or three times the cost of this one. Honestly, I sort of viewed this SHARK brush as like a knock-off of the more expensive ones. I decided I&#x27;d roll the dice &amp; check this out because of the great reviews and great price. I can&#x27;t imagine how any of the competing products could be significantly superior to this one. Please don&#x27;t spend a lot of money for a detangling brush - this one is excellent. I no longer hear crazy monster sounds coming from my hair when I brush it &amp; it takes less than 2 minutes to brush it all out with this brush versus the 15-20 minutes it had always taken me before. I use it wet &amp; dry - seems to work the same either way. None of the plastic teeth thingies has popped out &amp; the very little amount of hair that accumulated on the brush was a piece of cake to remove. Even those pesky dust rings that sometimes like to build up on the bristles are easy to get off because the bristles on the SHARK aren&#x27;t topped off with an unnecessarily huge ball. (there is a bit of a ball, just tiny when compared to some others) I&#x27;ll warn you...the first time I used it I thought nothing was happening because my head was tilted over w/ my hair in front of my face &amp; I couldnt feel anything other than my hand on the handle. But I was wrong, it got out all the tangles without tugging at my scalp once. The bristles are made of some alien engineered technology that allows them to bend all the way backwards without popping out...kinda like Neo dodging bullets in The Matrix. The super flexibility of the bristles is literally the difference between this brush and all the others I&#x27;ve tried. It makes a bigger difference than you&#x27;d think! I could go on &amp; on but I&#x27;ll shut up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get the brush. It&#x27;s a few bucks. It&#x27;s awesome. You&#x27;ll be glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** still love it - ordering another one because for some reason I&#x27;ve never been able to keep up w/ a hair brush. \\&quot;where&#x27;s my dang brush? In the car? In my purse? In the bathroom? The freezer?\\&quot; sound familiar anyone?</li>
            <li> my daughter loves the color of this. it still pull her hair a little but not so much. she&#x27;s using it all the times and it seems like it&#x27;s working okay for her.</li>
            <li> This things works great when you use it on WET hair and it is the only brush that my 5 year old daughter wants to use. Good brush for the money so I would buy 2 because the bristles do get bent after months of use.</li>
            <li> We have purchased 2 of these brushes and they work well on wet or dry hair, no more tears while trying to untangle the knots.&lt;br /&gt;Great colors too!  Will be back for more.</li>
