            <li>and my feet are in the best shape ever, even though I walk on the treadmill daily as part of my rehab program.</li>
            <li>it is potent.</li>
            <li>if you sit in a comfortable chair with a basin of warm water</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re both actually able to feel the floor under our heels now.</li>
            <li>It is extremely potent and using it even as directed can cause burning and irritation.  </li>

            <li>This product works like magic.  </li>

            <li>Make sure to wrap your feet in plastic .</li>
            <li>Because of the phone call I only did one foot, but I have one beautiful foot, let me tell you!!!</li>
            <li>When I go to the nail shop they put a plastic bag over my feet to let the product do its magic for a bit then buff off.</li>
            <li>I had been researching what would be best to use to try to do a professional pedicure at home, and this callus remover is an absolute must.  </li>
            <li>But really strong chemicals</li>
            <li>i find it to be a liitle strong for my liking, but it works</li>
            <li>But I will also use it in the shower for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li>This all happened to me and fortunately I had my foot in a gallon sized zip lock bag or my dog would have been at the vets.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews about this product, I am starting to wonder if there is something else inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>and I love this product a really works!</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet nice &amp; soft!</li>

            <li>Just order my second one, first lasted about 6 months, so good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution to your dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this product and decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>It took one more repetition to remove them completely, but it did the trick.  </li>
            <li>And keep a very large zip lock bag close by in which to put your foot when the phone rings...</li>
            <li>The 2nd time I went by the instructions, soaked my feet for about 10-15 minutes in warm water then applied the Prolinc with rubber gloves to the heels of my feet and then removed with a foot file and washed them good, dried, and then applied some cream.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to smooth up your active hard-working feet at home!</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME,AFTER THE FIRST USE YOUR FEET WILL CONTINUE PEELING.</li>
            <li>After those two sessions, I was completely callus free and let me tell you, that I thought this may never be the cases with me.  </li>
            <li>Get the stone too- works really well together!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t gotten a pedi in almost 2 years and it removed almost all my problem areas in the first pedicure.  </li>

            <li>It really works!</li>

            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This product is FANTASTIC especially when used with the Microplane colossal rasp.</li>
            <li>I use a large petty filer board.  </li>
            <li>you know your own feet better and where the spots are where the salon will do a pretty lame job sometimes.</li>
            <li>It was fast, efficient, completely painless and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the nail salon wants to charge me for callus removal.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>

            <li>and i am so happy i bought it because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>As suggested by others, soaked my feet first with water, listerine &amp; vinegar than applied Prolinc and covered area with clear wrap.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li>In 5 minutes my foot went from rough, hard and dry to smooth and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I applied the gel liberally on my heels and a little on the top of my foot where I have another callus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in the future I will probably have to use it a couple of times a month, we&#x27;ll see, right now my feet looks normal, not</li>
            <li>Great product to remove callus and thick dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put the lid back on the gel and set the bottle on something flat and large enough to hold it.  </li>
            <li>plus I live in a desert climate.  </li>
            <li>a removing the rough and tough skin on your feet easily and quickly, leaving them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Even then, it was better than what I had tried for in the past.  </li>

            <li>the dead skin sloughs right off without much work when using a natural pumice stone!</li>
            <li>To avoid this, I do it in stages, taking some off each time, and over 4 times in 2 weeks(that&#x27;s twice a week), I no longer have any callus anywhere on my feet, baby soft.  </li>
            <li>I scraped my heel with an old PedEgg I had laying around.</li>
            <li>It does what it says, your calluses will be gone and your feet soft again.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives you baby soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I work retail and stand on my feet 8 hours a day, so they&#x27;re pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Though it will be a while before I need more due to the large bottle and only requiring a small amount I will be ordering this product again and have reccomended it to family and friends.</li>

            <li> I usually shower and gently exfoliate with a loofa</li>
            <li> Do follow the instructions as it can cause burning if left on too long.</li>

            <li> Keeps the calluses away as long as I remember to use it!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome!!! I save the extra $10 the nail salon wants to charge me for callus removal. Be sure to buy the pedicure rasp to go along with this product. You&#x27;ll be amazed at how quick it works and how much dead skin it gets rid of.</li>
            <li> Great product to remove callus and thick dry skin on feet. Follow the directions, don&#x27;t leave on too long and wear gloves during application.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I have really bad calluses that come back with a few days after a pedicure, but this stuff works better and for longer. I use it with the big foot file you can find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good stuff But really strong chemicals but it does work, but I found something much better no chemical at all, but it looks like a cheese grater but it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I BOUGTH THE CALLUS ELIMINATOR AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BARIO.IT WORKS IT IAS AMAZING HOW FAST IT REMOVED THE HARD SKIN FROM THE FEET. 1.USE GLOVES TO APPLY IT.2. USE IT JUST ONCE PER WEEK IF NOT YOR FEET WILL FEEL UNCONFORTABLE I DID IT TWICE THE FIRST TIME,AFTER THE FIRST USE YOUR FEET WILL CONTINUE PEELING. WORKS AT IT SAYS AND YOU WILL SAVE MONEY I JUST TO PAY $3.00 AN OUNCE EVERY TIME I HAD A PEDICURE.IMAGINE TWO PEDICURES A MONTH $ 45.00 SAVINGS IN ONE MONTH.BUY IT  NOW.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical!!! I use it just as they do in the salon.....apply liberally &amp; wrap my feet with plastic wrap &amp; let sit for 10-15 min.....the dead skin sloughs right off without much work when using a natural pumice stone!</li>
            <li> this works just like the stuff when you pay to get a pedicure,  I soak my feet then apply this and cover with plastic wrap, then use the scrubber</li>
            <li> This stuff is great a removing the rough and tough skin on your feet easily and quickly, leaving them smooth and soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with what this did for the calluses on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like wearing shoes, so needless to say my heels were in bad shape.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different to remove the calluses to no avail until I ordered and tried Prolinc Be Natural.  The first time I used it I don&#x27;t think I left it on long enough, I left it on for 5 minutes, and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth.  Even then, it was better than what I had tried for in the past.  The 2nd time I went by the instructions, soaked my feet for about 10-15 minutes in warm water then applied the Prolinc with rubber gloves to the heels of my feet and then removed with a foot file and washed them good, dried, and then applied some cream.  I could not believe the results.  I only had to use the Prolinc the two times, in the future I will probably have to use it a couple of times a month, we&#x27;ll see, right now my feet looks normal, not like they looked before with those scratchy heels.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I have had lifelong trouble with calluses on my feet.  I tried this product and am AMAZED that it does what is claims.  I use it every two weeks or so and my feet are in the best shape ever, even though I walk on the treadmill daily as part of my rehab program.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with itchy dry cracked heels, after using this product my heels are soft as a babys bottom. I seen the bottle at the nail shop after receiving this $5 callous removal treatment and it didn&#x27;t even compare to me actually doing the treatment my self because they only allowed it stay on for 1-2 min when it calls for 3-5. This makes all the difference. Though it will be a while before I need more due to the large bottle and only requiring a small amount I will be ordering this product again and have reccomended it to family and friends. Do follow the instructions as it can cause burning if left on too long.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from Paula Begoun, The Cosmetic Cop. Works awesome.  I use a large petty filer board.  I have two towels I use specifically to wipe this gel off my feet&#x27; then I use the petty board and the callus just roll off.  Don&#x27;t over do, any one area or you will leave a small red burn mark.  To avoid this, I do it in stages, taking some off each time, and over 4 times in 2 weeks(that&#x27;s twice a week), I no longer have any callus anywhere on my feet, baby soft.  Just order my second one, first lasted about 6 months, so good value for the money.  No more spending $100&#x27;s a year on a petty........even got rid of callus on pads of my feet and off the back side of some toes.  Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> Great stuffâ€¦be careful..it is potent. But, it cuts down on the damaging trips to nail salon.Very easy to smooth up your active hard-working feet at home!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have trouble with calloused feet. This makes them feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom!!!! I am very pleased. No need for pedicures now!!</li>
            <li> Works good! I sit and put my feet in plastic bags before applying.&lt;br /&gt;Keep fee flat because you really don&#x27;t want to get it on the upper foot.&lt;br /&gt;but if you sit in a comfortable chair with a basin of warm water&lt;br /&gt;and towel you can get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;After I usually shower and gently exfoliate with a loofa</li>
            <li> i find it to be a liitle strong for my liking, but it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly skeptical by nature, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product. I work retail and stand on my feet 8 hours a day, so they&#x27;re pretty rough. The skin was so thick, I couldn&#x27;t feel anything through my heels, and if I had an itch on my heel, I was just out of luck because there was no way to scratch it. I stumbled upon this product and decided it was worth a shot. The results were amazing. I was shocked. I uploaded a before/after picture to the gallery for this product if you would like to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the steps I took to get my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I soaked my feet for about 20-30 minutes. I used the Hot Spa Ultimate Foot Bath that I purchased recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I applied the gel liberally on my heels and a little on the top of my foot where I have another callus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I waited 5 minutes, careful not to put my feet in a position where the gel would wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I put my feet back in the foot spa to wash the gel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I scraped my heel with an old PedEgg I had laying around. It looks like a cheese grater. I&#x27;m sure a pumis stone would work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Prettiest feet I&#x27;ve had in years. I also had my fiance use it (his feet were worse than mine), and he had the same results. We&#x27;re both actually able to feel the floor under our heels now.</li>
            <li> This product should be pulled from the market.  It is extremely potent and using it even as directed can cause burning and irritation.  I&#x27;m surprised there are not more warnings on the label.  It feels like it contains a derivative of sodium hydroxide (lye).</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  I use this in the shower with a pumice scrubber.  Keeps the calluses away as long as I remember to use it!</li>
            <li> This is just what I have been looking for my whole life.  The before and after are amazing.  I spent years trying various products, fighting the calluses on my feet day after day, creams, files, razor blades, the ped egg, nothing has done what this has.  In 5 minutes my foot went from rough, hard and dry to smooth and beautiful.  I followed the directions and did the whole five minutes, my feet were really bad and they came out looking great.  It took one more repetition to remove them completely, but it did the trick.  After those two sessions, I was completely callus free and let me tell you, that I thought this may never be the cases with me.  I had cracks in my heels and I had no pain whatsoever. It was fast, efficient, completely painless and worth every penny. A little goes a long way so the big bottle will last a long time.  This will become a staple for me forever.</li>
            <li> I read several of the reviews on here and got curious because i live in the dessert and at times the dryness can cause my heels to get really hard- this product does what it says!!! I am telling you- you cant go wrong with this and i am so happy i bought it because a little goes a long way! Good way to save $$$ in todays economy doing it on your own, not to mention you know your own feet better and where the spots are where the salon will do a pretty lame job sometimes. Get the stone too- works really well together!</li>
            <li> Use this product with a nice buff scrubber and your feet will look fantastic. I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 years and nothing beats it. For tougher spots, soak, apply, and leave on for a minute or two before rinsing off</li>
            <li> This product is FANTASTIC especially when used with the Microplane colossal rasp.</li>
            <li> Contributes much to my appearance</li>
            <li> If you have dry, rough feet get a bottle of Prolinc.  This product works like magic.  I&#x27;ve paid an extra $10 at a nail salon to have them to get the same result!  (it will make your feet feel nice and smooth).</li>
            <li> The product is worth the money if you have an issue with dry, cracked heels. I used the product as followed and it removed all dry skin that I had on my heels. This is a good product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution to your dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I had been researching what would be best to use to try to do a professional pedicure at home, and this callus remover is an absolute must.  I hadn&#x27;t gotten a pedi in almost 2 years and it removed almost all my problem areas in the first pedicure.  I plan to use it again every week just to get to a good place with my feet again.  Definitely read and follow the instructions to avoid injury.  FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use product as of yet;but it has a great smell and I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li> As suggested by others, soaked my feet first with water, listerine &amp; vinegar than applied Prolinc and covered area with clear wrap.  Worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I did not think it removed much of the callus. The product is not worth the money.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Thanks to this stuff, I do not have to go for pedicures as often. It dissolves my tough callous spots.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says. I also like the cuticle eliminator.</li>
            <li> I run around the house barefoot plus I live in a desert climate.  You cannot imagine the calluses on my feet.  I have done as in the nail salons but I find that if I use the scraper first to remove the thick excess callus and then use the eliminator, it takes off the remainder.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product. You must follow the directions, which you can read without a microscope! It does what it says, your calluses will be gone and your feet soft again.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! First time I tried the product at a pedicure salon. I never had it done with this product before. And I was amazed how well it worked. I remembered the name on the bottle and then ordered online. It really works! Although you have to be very careful with the length of the application. Do not excide more than 4-5 mins. Make sure to wrap your feet in plastic . I used regular Zipper bags and secured around ankles with rubber bands to avoid air access while the product works.</li>
            <li> This is a gel...  shake before using and I&#x27;d wear rubber gloves to apply.  If you have a little ceramic bowl and one of those hair dye applier brushes... you&#x27;re in business!  You just have to wash when you&#x27;re done.  Once you put this on your foot (and I recommend one foot at a time), you&#x27;re going to be stuck sitting there for about five minutes.  Be sure to put the lid back on the gel and set the bottle on something flat and large enough to hold it.  Sitting on the side of the tub, is boring... have a book or your Kindle at hand.  And keep a very large zip lock bag close by in which to put your foot when the phone rings... and it&#x27;s going to ring... it&#x27;s another Murphy&#x27;s Law...something will happen that will need you to hop half-way across the house.  You don&#x27;t want to be trying to walk and leaving this stuff on your carpets.  WARNING:  If you have a dog... you are going to get licked...and you don&#x27;t want your dog licking your foot or licking this corrosive stuff off of the carpet either.  This all happened to me and fortunately I had my foot in a gallon sized zip lock bag or my dog would have been at the vets.  He was all over it it like white on rice.  This stuff can cause an irritation burn.  The upshot is to have all your supplies ready before you sit down...  Clock to tell time as it passes slowly.  Book or Kindle...check.  Rasp and Rag... check  Something to brush or apply the potion onto your foot ...check.  Some foot or hand cream handy to massage into your foot afterwords...check.  It works really really well.  Because of the phone call I only did one foot, but I have one beautiful foot, let me tell you!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little frightening to hear that you only can leave this product on a short time or it can be too severe. I think that might be why I&#x27;m not having the results others are getting. I get a bit nervous when there is a slight burning sensation and wipe it off right away.</li>
            <li> This did not work as well for me as expected.  It only removed a small amount of dry skin and it was right back the next day.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I an a nail tech and I love this product a really works!</li>
            <li> I finally found something that actually works on my feet.  This stuff gives you baby soft skin.  I wish I had found this years ago!</li>
            <li> It does what its supposed  to do, and it really beats having to spend $3 everytime I go to the nail salon</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it at least twice weekly in between pedicures. It keeps my feet nice &amp; soft! When I go to the nail shop they put a plastic bag over my feet to let the product do its magic for a bit then buff off. But I will also use it in the shower for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t soften the heel of my foot as expected, needs longer than 10 minutes to work Very disappointed about the results.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews about this product, I am starting to wonder if there is something else inside the bottle. I have tried this product 3 times, followed religiously all the instructions, even left the product on for 40 minutes before starting the scraping part: no results. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I leave this in for 5 min and my feet look like I just had a spa pedicure. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years. I&#x27;m a former nail tech, and learned about this at one of the salons I was working at. It does exactly what it says it does. It&#x27;s the best callus remover out there.</li>
            <li> Callus Eliminator is the best item I have discovered for keeping callus off my feet.  This item cut out a waste of my time at the nail shop,  Sometime giving four to five hours a day at a nail salon is not my idea of relaxation.  Prolinc Callus Eliminator is a life saver. Soaking my feet about 45 minutes then applying the callus remover it takes all of 1 hour for the entire job.  So to this I would have to thank the makers of this product</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that actually removes callouses! This product is great on even stubborn areas. Give this one a try and you will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> awesome for removing layers of callus</li>
