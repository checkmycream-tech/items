            <li>one of the best toothbrushes i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Was happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>After using these, teeth &amp; gums feel great.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a dozen brushes.  </li>
            <li>(great because I always have spares) and are prime eligible, so it&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li>Good looks.</li>
            <li>Loved these.</li>
            <li>Going to buy more soon!</li>
            <li>Awesome toothbrush &amp; shipper sent lightning fast.  </li>
            <li>I think they clean great.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making it easy to find them here!  </li>
            <li>Simple toothbrush but yet perfect!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to obtain these thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>Best business I had since a long time.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t clean your teeth any better than this &amp;#34;old-fashioned style &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really Firm, excellent deal</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Nice and firm, provides good cleaming</li>
            <li>I really love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am now on two months with the first brush, no fraying or splaying, just clean teeth every time.</li>
            <li>Much better than soft one</li>
            <li>My personal opinion is that the dental community has brainwashed us into believing we should use soft toothbrushes so we will need their services for cleaning &amp; care because we can&#x27;t keep our own teeth clean anymore.  </li>
            <li>All around good quality - no complaints, maybe I wish they were a little longer and wider - the heads are medium sized.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you need to remove plaque and tarter from your teeth.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>i have tried the natural bristle, the &#x27;plastic-free&#x27; natural toothbrush, and a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>When the ad says &amp;#34;Firm,&amp;#34; these are REALLY &amp;#34;Firm.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>THIS TOOTHBRUSH MEETS MY NEEDS FOR MY DENTURE CARE VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>Too much medium brushes left me wondering why I got so much tartar so quickly despite consistent brushing .</li>
            <li>I grew up in a time when a toothbrush actually brushed your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth actually feel clean.</li>
            <li>I am actually coming back to buy a couple more 6 packs just in case</li>
            <li>I credit my teeth to eating lots of fresh fruit and fresh fruit juices... and the fact that I&#x27;ve used a firm toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li>Funny how in the old days a tooth brush would last for years (in my case literally when we were kids), yet today, with all of the advances in technology, the tooth brush is shot and splayed out after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>the 6-pack of these firm brushes, fired it up with my favorite paste, and 45 seconds later felt like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Now I am interested in trying a Harder toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I am here to tell you that I am 50 years old and have never had one cavity or other issue with my teeth in my whole life.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sell anything above SOFT at the damn stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s impossible to find firm toothbrushes in stores now, but that&#x27;s the only kind that makes my teeth really feel clean.</li>
            <li>I have used this particular version of Reach toothbrushes for years, and I love it---none of that newish crazy looking toothbrushes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You cannot find a single hard-bristle toothbrush in my city, so I was thankful to find these - and I will buy again if possible.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this six pack of Reach Firm toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used firm toothbrushes my entire life &amp; have no problems with enamel, gum disease, etc.  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t find firm long-head toothbrushes locally.  </li>
            <li> the bristles stay firm for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is obvious that this industry decided to promote sales by making crap quality products in China which never get your teeth clean and wear out after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a big conspiracy to remove all hard bristle toothbrushes from the market, even though the mfg&#x27;s don&#x27;t even seem to realize this!  </li>

            <li> I cannot find any firm toothbrushes anywhere in any stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Firm toothbrushes are all I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So sick of the soft, spineless tooth brushes in local stores.</li>
            <li> Firm brushes are so hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t brush too hard.</li>
            <li> The lie from the ADA is that they are too hard on your enamel and gums.  </li>
            <li> If you want a firm toothbrush head, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> There is a big conspiracy to remove all hard bristle toothbrushes from the market, even though the mfg&#x27;s don&#x27;t even seem to realize this!

            <li> Have always preferred the firm brush.  My teeth feel really clean after brushing.  No so with the medium brush.  Was happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this toothbrush.  We can never find firm toothbrushes at any store.  It brushed the plaque off his teeth so well he said it felt like he just got his teeth cleaned at the dental office.  I need to stock up just incase they decide to stop making these.</li>
            <li> Simple toothbrush but yet perfect!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you need to remove plaque and tarter from your teeth. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> When the ad says &amp;#34;Firm,&amp;#34; these are REALLY &amp;#34;Firm.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best business I had since a long time. I really love my new toothbrush. They are as described. I recommend them to every one.</li>
            <li> Too much medium brushes left me wondering why I got so much tartar so quickly despite consistent brushing . I could never find the firm brush I desired  but Amazon came through. With these I save time cause the brush clears plaque and tartar doesn&#x27;t have a chance to build up. I can now survive till my 6 month dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> So sick of the soft, spineless tooth brushes in local stores. Funny how in the old days a tooth brush would last for years (in my case literally when we were kids), yet today, with all of the advances in technology, the tooth brush is shot and splayed out after two weeks of use. It is obvious that this industry decided to promote sales by making crap quality products in China which never get your teeth clean and wear out after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought the 6-pack of these firm brushes, fired it up with my favorite paste, and 45 seconds later felt like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning. I am now on two months with the first brush, no fraying or splaying, just clean teeth every time. I am actually coming back to buy a couple more 6 packs just in case they quit making these.</li>
            <li> Much better than soft one</li>
            <li> Nice and firm, provides good cleaming</li>
            <li> the bristles stay firm for a long time. one of the best toothbrushes i&#x27;ve ever used. i have tried the natural bristle, the &#x27;plastic-free&#x27; natural toothbrush, and a whole lot more. this is the one i continue to go back to--when i can find them, that is. i ordered a bunch for future use.</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this six pack of Reach Firm toothbrushes. They&#x27;re not fancy or anything, but they are firm. These are for you, if you&#x27;re tired of using wimpy soft or medium brushes and not being able to find a firm toothbrush at the store.</li>
            <li> I grew up in a time when a toothbrush actually brushed your teeth clean.

As a value to me, it gets 5 stars!  Thank you REACH for allowing this choice!</li>
            <li> I TRIED FOR MONTHS TO BUY A TOOTHBRUSH WITH FIRM BRISTLES AND COULD NOT FIND 1 ANYWHERE. THIS TOOTHBRUSH MEETS MY NEEDS FOR MY DENTURE CARE VERY WELL.</li>

            <li> Really Firm, excellent deal</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush &amp; shipper sent lightning fast.  A++</li>
            <li> Loved these. Firm brushes are so hard to find these days. Great price for a dozen brushes.  Going to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to obtain these thru Amazon.  They don&#x27;t sell anything above SOFT at the damn stores.  They want you to get cavities so they don&#x27;t sell these at the store.  Period.  Now I am interested in trying a Harder toothbrush.  Get rid of nicotine &amp; wine stains.  Overall a great product. thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth actually feel clean. I truly don&#x27;t believe a harder toothbrush damages my teeth. I&#x27;m 46 and gets compliments on my teeth being white all the time. I credit my teeth to eating lots of fresh fruit and fresh fruit juices... and the fact that I&#x27;ve used a firm toothbrush for years. I love the way my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find firm long-head toothbrushes locally.  Thank you Amazon for making it easy to find them here!  These toothbrushes are great!  If you want a firm toothbrush head, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I think they clean great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find firm toothbrushes in stores now, but that&#x27;s the only kind that makes my teeth really feel clean. These come in a pack of 6 (great because I always have spares) and are prime eligible, so it&#x27;s a great deal and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that I can find these on Amazon.  I cannot find any firm toothbrushes anywhere in any stores anymore.  Firm toothbrushes are all I have ever used.  The lie from the ADA is that they are too hard on your enamel and gums.  I am here to tell you that I am 50 years old and have never had one cavity or other issue with my teeth in my whole life. Just another example of &amp;#34;one-size fits all&amp;#34; pronouncements from agencies of the Federal Government.  Can&#x27;t let the consumers decide what they want...they might choose the &amp;#34;wrong thing&amp;#34;.  RIDICULOUSNESS.</li>
