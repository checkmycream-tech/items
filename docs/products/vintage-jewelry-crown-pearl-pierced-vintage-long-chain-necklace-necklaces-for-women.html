            <li>It is cute, but kind not very well made.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a small and dainty charm, it is about the size of a golf ball.</li>
            <li>We like vintage jewelry and that is exactly what it was!</li>
            <li>The chain lays nice and isn&#x27;t too short.</li>
            <li>However it was just right.</li>
            <li>you could buy something better that cost a little more.</li>
            <li>One of the crystals is glued on funny and might fall off eventually.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Still, it&#x27;s pretty</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not too large and not small.</li>
            <li>I love this little vintage crown.  </li>

            <li> I gave it to my 32 year old daughter as a gift</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> It came a few days early, but the pearl is actually an inch or so around, the bottom is uneven, and the figures on the sides barely look at all like the picture.</li>
            <li> The necklace is a little big, but I adore the look and the color!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I was scared the Crown and pearl would be small.</li>
            <li> It came broken in half.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> broken chain, but fixable</li>
            <li> This is very poorly made although I figured it would be for the price.</li>
            <li> Extremely bad quality.</li>
            <li> The dimonds are badly glued and the design imprinted on the metel is nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Really ugly.</li>
            <li> I still like the necklace, but am very disappointed in the company&#x27;s representation of the product.</li>

            <li> It came a few days early, but the pearl is actually an inch or so around, the bottom is uneven, and the figures on the sides barely look at all like the picture. Also, you can see glue in several places. One of the crystals is glued on funny and might fall off eventually.&lt;br /&gt; I still like the necklace, but am very disappointed in the company&#x27;s representation of the product. This product is probably worth a dollar at most.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do this piece justice.  I love this little vintage crown.  It goes with almost everything and for almost any age.</li>

            <li> I really like this, more than I thought I would. I wore it on Mother&#x27;s Day. So I could be queen mother ........for the day. Ha, Ha</li>
            <li> I love this, but it does look a little warped. Still, it&#x27;s pretty cool!&lt;br /&gt;Waited weeks on end for it though.</li>
            <li> I got this neckless as a gift for my niece and she really likes it. It  look a little on the cheap side but she really like this neckless.</li>
