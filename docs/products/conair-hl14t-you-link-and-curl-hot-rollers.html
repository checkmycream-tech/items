            <li>These work great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>These hot roller rods are great.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better have lots of \\&quot;spare hair\\&quot; for you&#x27;ll lose a lot with these.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>With these curlers I am able to control the outcome much better.  </li>
            <li>I love where you can just throw them in your suitcase too.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Also, the longer you leave them in, the better.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product that will give you great curls in little time i have been using these rollers for about 5 months</li>
            <li>These hot sticks are an amazing product.   </li>
            <li>Being in my (cough) 50&#x27;s the style lasted all day and gave me a lovely full style without burning.</li>
            <li>Super cute and easy curls in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>They work quickly and the curl lasts all day!  </li>
            <li>Love the handy case and the complete set packs easily for out of town travel.</li>
            <li>and I have very fine straight hair...</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t stay put well and to achieve waves I personally feel like a 1.5&amp;#34; iron is much more effective.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier Conair model for years that I loved but the silicone in these is a lot more gentle on my hair and the grooves on them</li>
            <li>up quick without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>But, since the heating element is at the core of the unit, the rollers still get very hot.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, straight, and waist-length.  </li>
            <li>- Gets hot fast  - Easy for storage  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practise to get the right curl.</li>
            <li>They are also super easy to snap into place (no pins or extra clips needed).  </li>
            <li>Cons  - Hot to touch  - every now</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with these kinds of rollers.</li>
            <li>the first time my hair was almost too</li>
            <li>perhaps if you have a personal stylist to do for you they would be okay.  </li>
            <li>I remember \\&quot;hot sticks\\&quot; that I had in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>...loved them the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly if the flap is closed on top.  </li>
            <li>These are the definitely the best results I&#x27;ve had achieving long lasting natural looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, really - I would give these curlers a 4-5 for curl - they do that, almost too much though.  </li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fast.</li>
            <li>Heat up fast but don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you try putting them into your hair.  </li>
            <li>Curl your hair fast.  </li>
            <li>They are very compact and portable (very packable).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They heat fast.</li>
            <li>really help to keep my strands in place as I wrap them around the roller.</li>
            <li>Also, the case isn&#x27;t very well insulated.</li>
            <li>By far, the most lasting curls!  </li>
            <li>Again, these work great and the curls are smaller (but way longer lasting) than your typical hot roller styles.  </li>
            <li>Because of their design I am able to choose how little or how much hair to curl.  </li>
            <li>There are more than enough rollers to heat my entire head.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried them I didnt think that the heated up much but the second time that I used them they really worked.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so long that I need two sets and was delighted to finally get this second set.</li>
            <li>Curls last longer if you put them in extra hot and keep them in until they are cool.</li>
            <li>These rollers definitely curl your hair, but are hot to touch when rolling hair, not easy to put hair around the rollers, I think it is better for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous hot rollers over the years with little success.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and when I would use other hot rollers my hair would end up looking poofy and \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>But the major drawback is that they TANGLE -</li>
            <li>I opened the box and more than half of the rods were missing.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but when I opened it, one of the curling rods was missing. There are only twelve to begin with, so with long hair, 11 is going to be pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my little granddaughter. She&lt;br /&gt;has long thick hair and these really curled her&lt;br /&gt;hair great for her recital. The cutest one there!</li>
            <li> These hot sticks are an amazing product.   Pros  - Good curls  - Good amount of rollers  - Gets hot fast  - Easy for storage  Cons  - Hot to touch  - every now and then one will pop off  Overall this is a great product that will give you great curls in little time i have been using these rollers for about 5 months and i have no complaints</li>
            <li> I have really hard to curl straight hair. This was my first experience with these kinds of rollers. I must say they work amazingly! It takes a bit of practise to get the right curl. but holy smokes! the first time my hair was almost too curly!&lt;br /&gt;heats up quick without burning your fingers. takes alot less time than a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> Well, really - I would give these curlers a 4-5 for curl - they do that, almost too much though.  But the major drawback is that they TANGLE - perhaps if you have a personal stylist to do for you they would be okay.  But doing it oneself, medium length layered hair is quite a challenge.  You&#x27;d better have lots of \\&quot;spare hair\\&quot; for you&#x27;ll lose a lot with these.</li>
            <li> I remember \\&quot;hot sticks\\&quot; that I had in the 90&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t know what happened to them, but these do the same job. I like the travel case. The curlers heat up fast. Curls last longer if you put them in extra hot and keep them in until they are cool.</li>
            <li> These hot roller rods are great.  Heat up fast but don&#x27;t burn your fingers when you try putting them into your hair.  Curl your hair fast.  In fact you don&#x27;t want to keep them in your hair longer than a few minutes or your hair will look like shirley temple.  There are more than enough rollers to heat my entire head.

            <li> A bit difficult to use, since the curlers keep falling out of my hair.  Otherwise, good heat and an attractive package.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and more than half of the rods were missing. It looked like you pulled this out of the trash, threw it in a box and shipped it out.. it was gross.  I have no idea how this could have passed inspection. I just threw the entire thing away and reorded it from Sears.  I won&#x27;t order from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Had one before but burned up &amp; was sad cause I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. I&#x27;m happy now!</li>
            <li> If you are a child of the 80&#x27;s like me, and you want those cute spiral curls, these are for you! Super cute and easy curls in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find these in the stores forever!  My hair is so long that I need two sets and was delighted to finally get this second set.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t stay put well and to achieve waves I personally feel like a 1.5&amp;#34; iron is much more effective.</li>
            <li> I tried these rollers--they were hard to use and did not work. Came out with some weird looking curls that did not stay...I ended up just using a curling iron!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these curlers!!  I have tried numerous hot rollers over the years with little success.  My hair is naturally curly and when I would use other hot rollers my hair would end up looking poofy and \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot;.  With these curlers I am able to control the outcome much better.  Because of their design I am able to choose how little or how much hair to curl.  Standard rollers usually require a minimum amount of hair or else they will not stay wrapped.  With these rollers I can add just a small amount of hair and the curlers will not unravel.  They heat up quickly if the flap is closed on top.  Lightweight and perfect for travel. I wish I could give 6 stars!</li>
            <li> When I first tried them I didnt think that the heated up much but the second time that I used them they really worked.  I would recommend these.  I love where you can just throw them in your suitcase too.</li>
            <li> For those of us who remember (cough) the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to find hot rollers that give us the same adaptable styles as these...loved them the first time I used them. Being in my (cough) 50&#x27;s the style lasted all day and gave me a lovely full style without burning. I found no issues removing them and I have very fine straight hair...</li>
            <li> I love these.  By far, the most lasting curls!  My hair is fine, straight, and waist-length.  I use these with a styling product, like a cream gel, so there&#x27;s no crunchiness.  The surface of the roller is sticky/grippy, and because my hair is so long, it can create a tangled mess and sometimes pulls out my hair when removing the roller.  So, I just wrap the rollers in square pieces of foil as I go along and this helps a lot.  No biggie!  Again, these work great and the curls are smaller (but way longer lasting) than your typical hot roller styles.  Also, the longer you leave them in, the better.  I try to leave mine in for at least 20 minutes, but usually aim for 30.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier Conair model for years that I loved but the silicone in these is a lot more gentle on my hair and the grooves on them really help to keep my strands in place as I wrap them around the roller. I like the sizes supplied as I am looking to achieve the small, tight curls. These are the definitely the best results I&#x27;ve had achieving long lasting natural looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the picture is false. There isn&#x27;t an even number of each size. There are 6 of the smaller size and 8 of the larger size. This was a bit of a disappointment, but the the instructions do include information on how to order extra rollers through the company. I&#x27;ll probably do without. Also, the case isn&#x27;t very well insulated. But, since the heating element is at the core of the unit, the rollers still get very hot.</li>
            <li> These rollers definitely curl your hair, but are hot to touch when rolling hair, not easy to put hair around the rollers, I think it is better for longer hair.</li>
