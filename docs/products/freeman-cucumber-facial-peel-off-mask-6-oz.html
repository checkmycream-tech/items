    <ol>
            <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT  OUT ITS AMAZING.I LIKE THE DIFFERENT SCENTS IT COMES IN AND THIS  WAS MUCH CHEAPER THEN THE LOCAL STORES..</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product highly enough.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and it was good, but they seem to have changed the formulation.  What I got this time was a gummy substance that could not be applied.  I tried adding water to thin it to usability but that didn&#x27;t help. I won&#x27;t be buying Freeman products again.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  I have been using Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel Off Mask for nearly 20 years. Once you peel off the mask your skin is so soft and clean. It gets rid of the dead skin and you face is really clean. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants fresh clean skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft without irritation.  Scent is mild, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have sensitive skin and this product is great to help softening the skin and removing impurities.</li>
            <li> The peel dried very well and when I peeled it off, I could feel that my skin was smoother and my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li> My wife made the purchase and is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought these years ago from Walmart but they have since stopped selling them. I was thrilled to find them online. They always leave my face feeling soft. I have very sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the effect of the older peel off masks I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the pores very well.  It does however leave the face feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Awesome bought three more</li>
            <li> It  work&#x27;s very well, I recommend It. I love It</li>
            <li> Mask did not peel off and was very sticky. Had to be washed off.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive facial masks but found this one to be one of the best!  I have normal skin with breakouts here and there. This mask clears them right up and soothes my breakouts.  Also it has a great cucumber scent that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> The mask removes the dead and dull skin and not too harsh to damage ghe skin.  I&#x27;m happy with my the outcome.</li>
            <li> Great for getting blackheads out. Will dry your face out if you use it 3 or more times a week. I wish it would spread a bit easier (it&#x27;s very thick). A good product overall.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and refreshing</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just don&#x27;t get it in your hair.  Hard to get out of eyebrows, sideburns, etc. OUCH!</li>
            <li> There are definitely better products out there. Mediocre at best.</li>
