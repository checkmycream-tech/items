    <ol>
            <li>Great for in-home bleaching!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT, AWESOME PRODUCT AND AWESOME SERVICE, THANK YOU</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy that I chose this product-</li>
            <li>This developer has worked great for me (using with and without ion hair color).  </li>
            <li>Also comes in a great bulk size so you can store some for touch-ups.</li>
            <li>it probably took a good 15-20 mins to apply it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Wear a plastic/nylon cap over your own hair</li>
            <li>I have very strong hair to process</li>
            <li>Anyway if you used this and your hair didnt go very light, try another creme deleveoper and see what happens..</li>
            <li>Its wonderful, especially if you&#x27;re bleaching and leaving it on for more than 45 mins</li>
            <li>Safe to use for on scalp application.</li>
            <li>Also lifted color well :)</li>
            <li>Used this in combination with some Clairol Professional BW2 powder to color my hair extensions and it lifted the hair beautifully to my desired look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, trying this new developer was a great decision.</li>
            <li>If you have very fair, dry, easy to irritate skin, try this one!</li>
            <li>but my scalp was fine :)</li>
            <li>I love this product and the smell is mild.  </li>
            <li>If you bleach you must use a toner so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>And I kind of like the smell, haha.</li>
            <li>Normally when i bleach my hair i can get it nice and &amp;#34;pale banana&amp;#34; light in one process..</li>
            <li>worked great nice price for the amount of product you recieve still have a lot left to use for later</li>
            <li>Wear a good ventilated mask so you don&#x27;t breathe in this stuff for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>it worked out very well for my first bleach. :)</li>
            <li>Most developers will cause me to break out into a rash, having very sensitive skin, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>and right now it is &amp;#34;auburn,&amp;#34; as my friends put it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s STRONG so if you are sensitive to chemicals like this</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>Good to make harsh grays softer to color.</li>
            <li>No burns, irritations, or smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some instructions and how-tos online, and used this developer with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li>my face/eyes felt a little warm-</li>
            <li>I got this as a huge package from sallys with other stuff, doesnt smell too strong and it was soft on my hauir too.</li>
            <li>so it was liquid-y enough to apply smoothly (but not water-y).</li>
            <li>I had not washed my hair for a whole day at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a very bearable smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well and isn&#x27;t very damaging.</li>
            <li>strips well and gentle</li>
            <li>Works great to brighten dull white hair.</li>
            <li>It smells decent as well.</li>
            <li>and I have VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The smells pretty mild, and it is not too harsh on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and did not irritate my sensitive scalp at all.</li>
            <li>Takes 30 minutes to lighten dark hair to a light blonde.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using bare hands</li>
            <li>barely any stench.</li>
            <li>Bleaches just as well, and rather than stinging irritation, I barely feel any irritation.</li>
            <li>They are always fast and prompt, and careful with the things I order from them.  </li>
            <li>Hair obviously felt a little damaged but still feels pretty normal when dry.</li>
            <li>My first time going blonde from virgin black hair, and it worked quite well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> few tips when using this stuff...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews for this product before purchasing it and still hesitant to use it because of the last incident I had after I colored my hair using Clairol amonia-free color made me have a really bad allergic reaction that caused me to go to an urgent care clinic since my forehead and ears was getting swollen.</li>
            <li> i tried again with my go to delevoper and used on sections not prelightened by this crap and it lifted to that pale banana color...</li>
            <li> but this may because I was going through a cold at that point</li>
            <li> Usually when I apply bleach on my scalp accidentally it burns terribly!</li>
            <li> I feared that this would have a painful stench like boxed hair dye kits, but no-</li>
            <li> i bet you&#x27;ll be shocked!</li>
            <li> anyway this stuff is awful</li>

            <li> So i got this because it was onsale to do some highlights. Normally when i bleach my hair i can get it nice and &amp;#34;pale banana&amp;#34; light in one process.. anyway this stuff is awful my hair came out coppery orange.. i tried again with my go to delevoper and used on sections not prelightened by this crap and it lifted to that pale banana color... i think the protective scalp stuff is what does it. Anyway if you used this and your hair didnt go very light, try another creme deleveoper and see what happens.. i bet you&#x27;ll be shocked!</li>
            <li> I use this for both bleaching &amp; coloring my hair.  The smells pretty mild, and it is not too harsh on my scalp.  You just have to read the instruction to see what ratio you&#x27;re supposed to use for each application.</li>
            <li> I applied this with hands and mushed it into my scalp with wella colorcharm powder lightner.  I don&#x27;t recommend using bare hands but it didn&#x27;t burn at all and had on head 1 hour .  I love this product and the smell is mild.  I have very strong hair to process and this is the ticket.  Will buy again.  I diluted this to make 20 vol developer.  You can google how to dilute to make weaker product and don&#x27;t have to buy 20 vol for toner.  If you bleach you must use a toner so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful, especially if you&#x27;re bleaching and leaving it on for more than 45 mins</li>
            <li> TL;DR I bleached my hair from dark brown/natural black and right now it is &amp;#34;auburn,&amp;#34; as my friends put it. No burns, irritations, or smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some instructions and how-tos online, and used this developer with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach (also available on Amazon). I mixed the power to developer about 1:1.5 ish so it was liquid-y enough to apply smoothly (but not water-y). I had not washed my hair for a whole day at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom helped me put the mix onto my hair- it probably took a good 15-20 mins to apply it thoroughly. The product undoubtedly came in contact with my scalp and sometimes onto my skin, but there was no irritation or pain of any sort.  and then I sat around for 20 minutes with a cap on. It felt a little heated and my face/eyes felt a little warm- but this may because I was going through a cold at that point (*sniffle*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed it off and still no burns or irritations or all of my hair falling out. Hair obviously felt a little damaged but still feels pretty normal when dry. I feared that this would have a painful stench like boxed hair dye kits, but no- barely any stench. It was a very bearable smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that I chose this product- it worked out very well for my first bleach. :)</li>
            <li> Used this in combination with some Clairol Professional BW2 powder to color my hair extensions and it lifted the hair beautifully to my desired look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips when using this stuff...It&#x27;s STRONG so if you are sensitive to chemicals like this I suggest doing a few things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wear a good ventilated mask so you don&#x27;t breathe in this stuff for long periods of time. (I used an allergy mask and couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.)&lt;br /&gt;2. Wear some sealed goggles to block the chemicals from messing with your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wear a plastic/nylon cap over your own hair so you don&#x27;t breathe in the chemicals that could potentially linger into it while coloring your hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wear some plastic gloves so the chemicals don&#x27;t irritate/burn your skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. Shower off/change clothes after you&#x27;re done to remove any potential lingering chemicals that may have remained on your skin/clothes.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, AWESOME PRODUCT AND AWESOME SERVICE, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> This developer has worked great for me (using with and without ion hair color).  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and it works.  That sums it up.</li>
            <li> Works very well and isn&#x27;t very damaging. Safe to use for on scalp application. Takes 30 minutes to lighten dark hair to a light blonde.</li>
            <li> strips well and gentle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews for this product before purchasing it and still hesitant to use it because of the last incident I had after I colored my hair using Clairol amonia-free color made me have a really bad allergic reaction that caused me to go to an urgent care clinic since my forehead and ears was getting swollen. After using this product, I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction at all. This stuff really does work! I used this product combined with Ion Brilliance hair color creme and Bio Kur Care and Comfort.</li>
            <li> My last developer was saloncare and I had an incident where it got on my ears and it just burned like hell. So, trying this new developer was a great decision. Bleaches just as well, and rather than stinging irritation, I barely feel any irritation. It smells decent as well.</li>
            <li> worked great nice price for the amount of product you recieve still have a lot left to use for later</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take to my hair so well had to switch developer.</li>
            <li> Works great to brighten dull white hair. On my second bottle .</li>
            <li> Good to make harsh grays softer to color.</li>
            <li> Sally Beauty Supply never lets me down.  They are always fast and prompt, and careful with the things I order from them.  This product I have been using for two years.  Most developers will cause me to break out into a rash, having very sensitive skin, but not this one.  If you have very fair, dry, easy to irritate skin, try this one!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this and she said it did not burn her scalp.</li>
            <li> Usually when I apply bleach on my scalp accidentally it burns terribly! Used this and when I felt I had some on my scalp, it literally didn&#x27;t hurt at all and I have VERY sensitive skin.  But it did irritate my arms/neck which was excepted but my scalp was fine :) Also lifted color well :) And I kind of like the smell, haha.</li>
            <li> I got this as a huge package from sallys with other stuff, doesnt smell too strong and it was soft on my hauir too.</li>
            <li> Great for in-home bleaching!  My first time going blonde from virgin black hair, and it worked quite well.  Also comes in a great bulk size so you can store some for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dark brown hair. This did lighten my hair, but it took 2-3 before I could see the difference (the person doing my hair could tell but I could not). It is inexpensive and did not irritate my sensitive scalp at all.</li>
