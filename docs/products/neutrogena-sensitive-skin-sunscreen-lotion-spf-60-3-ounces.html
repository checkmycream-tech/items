            <li>MY OWN dermatologist recommended (i.e. titanium dioxide) for best protection.</li>
            <li>When I go running, as I&#x27;m a runner, I apply some on and it great.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>I switched to a lighter brand but imagine this is the best in some situations where you want to make sure it stays on and continues to protect.</li>
            <li>It gives you a peace of mind, knowing you item will arrive on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>good quality product that does what its supposed to do and as advertised.good quality product that does what it is supposed to do as advertised</li>

            <li>i love it!  </li>
            <li>more of this nonsense!</li>
            <li>and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li>very good, stays on in water, smooth, does not appear to stain, pleased with the product, will buy again, lp</li>
            <li>This is the best at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>have always liked the service and quality of the products from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I accused my husband of rubbing his sweaty arm on me, but it was my own sweat</li>
            <li>and I do break out fairly easily, so that was good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I was going to be able to find anything that would work effectively and not bother my skin or my nose.  </li>
            <li>I have never, ever, known Neutrogena Sensitive Skin to sting my skin or burn my eyes and best of all, it works!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give our 4 year old a rash, awesome!</li>
            <li>the best thus far.</li>
            <li>perfect for even the most sensitive</li>
            <li>Great for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin!!!!</li>
            <li>Mineral sunblock ingredients (titanium and zinc) help play it safe while chemical sunscreens are being scrutinized.  </li>
            <li>This compares to the chemical sunscreens (avobenzone) found in most full-spectrum drugstore sunscreens which absorb the rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are allergic to physical sunscreens, this is a wonderful solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been able to use Vanicream (greasy), and Fallene Cotz (practically wipes off).  </li>
            <li>i doesn&#x27;t break out my face. : )</li>
            <li>it looks okay</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be a better alternative to the more chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t put anything on it to make it better either, so be warned.</li>
            <li>Do your research for healthy sunscreens at ewg.org and don&#x27;t fall for this like I did.</li>
            <li>it is safe to put on you and children.</li>
            <li>Glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li>So when I ran out of my Biore dual sunscreen/moisturizer and needed sunscreen ASAP, many friends recommended this to me.</li>
            <li>Even after trying your best to do so and then sweating, you will have patches of this stuff left on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like condensation as opposed to sweat.</li>
            <li>They just make us feel better.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling like most sunblocks do.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It is light and yet effective.</li>
            <li>Better than the face sunscreen by neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Will run out soon for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found that applying this 15-30 minutes before heading outside works the best.</li>
            <li>I love this Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because skin cancer and wrinkle prevention are important to me!</li>
            <li>Okay, well, I know it is SPF 60, but this does not go on smooth at all!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I actually made effort to be in the sun to get some color to my fair skin!  </li>
            <li>and I burn easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>Spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve always used neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreens on my face and have liked them very much.</li>
            <li>The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned.</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix, so I need a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This would be fine for use on the body.  </li>
            <li>, I thought it rubbed in just fine</li>
            <li>I like the product because it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens create all sorts of bizarre chemical compounds while reacting with the sun, causing skin rashes.  </li>
            <li>But it can form free radicals in sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Effective and gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, unscented, reasonably priced, and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li>FYI, no, this isn&#x27;t organic and chemical free</li>
            <li>This smelled neutral went on smooth and was not sticky at all after application.</li>
            <li>I thought this was supposed to be good for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>Note, I am an early 30&#x27;s man with fair caucasian</li>
            <li>It is by far the best drugstore physical sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection, but be careful to apply sparingly.</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well for a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Retinyl Palmitate is technically Vitamin A and sounds &#x27;good&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>still I&#x27;d like to say it&#x27;s a very good sunscreen especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Anything like 30 is fine, but research this first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than most sunscreens within the same price range</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>Definitely will be sticking to the moisturizer I know and love!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all.</li>
            <li>+, which blends in much easier and works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive fair -way too easy to burn skin - I use this now regularly on my face - under make up and also on my hands and forearms when driving.</li>
            <li>This product is quite the opposite: It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;thick\\&quot; on the skin.</li>
            <li>but it is always worth it to me to keep everything sunburn free!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, this is far superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is a very different kind of anti-chafing item.  </li>
            <li>and I love it because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance, but some people might not like the smell.</li>
            <li>It does leave a distinctly whitish cast to the skin and will accumulate in any hair.</li>
            <li>The product does leave a whitish cast to my skin because it needs a bit of time to get absorbed.</li>
            <li>so I had a nice red rash going on my face for about 5 days which ironically looked like sunburn.</li>
            <li>Plus, it had more sunscreen for a lower cost as compared to Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Face SPF 55+ sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This has a similar sheer finish that doesn&#x27;t make you look oily, and the consistency is very nice and light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read that the baby pure &amp; free is almost the exact product to this, so if you can&#x27;t find this in the stores look for that.</li>
            <li>This would probably be good for a long day at the beach, but I bought this for everyday wear and it does not look good.</li>
            <li>it does leave your skin kinda white/pale, so applying makeup right after or allowing time for it to soak in is recommended.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>, I love the texture, for me, it wasn&#x27;t too greasy and left a &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; finish when absorbed.</li>
            <li>I will not use it very much.</li>
            <li>I was very, very upset.  </li>
            <li>fun when you hit a certain age</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I am sensitive to most high spf sunblocks and sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I cannot use most commercial sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products, but they need to fix that white effect.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most mass-market drugstore sunscreens, this is a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>First of all, I did not purchase this from Amazon, I purchased it from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s been working pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to go on my super-sensitive face at the beach but will use more standard sunscreen for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, when you first put it on you&#x27;re going to look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>: The first drugstore sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make me itch and break out</li>
            <li>Most of the people reviewing this product are pretty obviously marketers or they must use a foundation over it.</li>
            <li>It also makes me break out when I sweat on really hot humid days.  </li>
            <li>(I look pretty funny when I use it in the yard without shaving.)</li>
            <li>My skin keeps a healthy white look during the trip and feels moisturized all the day.</li>
            <li>I do have to really wash with soap and water to get it off, but that means it works well in water!  </li>
            <li>I bought this seeing all positive reviews, but I&#x27;ve come to start clicking on the &amp;#34;most helpful reviews&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve noticed something: Everything they buy is 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product when I was living in Florida because I was spending so much time in the sun, either competing in or coaching track.  </li>
            <li>I found that certain sunscreens have cancer causing ingredients.</li>
            <li>so far the lightest and easy to blend natural sunblock containing titanium dioxide</li>
            <li>The left eye seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to try Neutrogena Pure and free baby sunscreen</li>
            <li>The only difference is that Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby has added the inactive ingredients Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, and Potassium Sorbate.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it were available as a spray for faster application.  </li>
            <li>How much can you trust a person that rates 9/10 items they buy as 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to be very moisture resistant, too; I have to wash my hands with lava soap after applying it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have to really rub it in to try to get rid of whiteness on my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have absolute proof that the lotion caused the rash, but it went away within days of switching away from the product to a lower SPF lotion containing a lower percentage of titanium oxide.</li>
            <li>While I liked that it does not contain harsh chemicals, it sweat off of me any my children within minutes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because there&#x27;s such an appearance of  sunscreen variety on the market when in reality, most of the sunscreens have the same chemical formula.  </li>
            <li>I do keep using still because my face does not get itchy from it like most other sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Obviously I have to wear sunscreen, but most products make my skin hot, red, and sometimes itchy.  </li>
            <li>This particular product has to much Grease/oil in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had real issues with sunscreen in particular.  </li>
            <li>I am very committed to protecting my face from sun damage and so use a sunscreen with a high SPF every day.</li>
            <li>Completely painless around eyes, just looks funny for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear sun block daily and have used Neutrogena clear face breakout free for a while.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a problem with me (my foundation color is called Ivory, I&#x27;m super white)</li>
            <li>but once I start sweating it seems to pool up on top of the sweat making me look extra white.  </li>
            <li>Titanium or Zinc Oxide are different because they lay on top of the skin and physically block sun like a shirt or piece of clothing.  </li>
            <li>Smells lighter and wipes on as well as the regular baby neutrogena free and clear.</li>
            <li>have very fait, very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>) I tend to be highly allergic to chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in the high numbers are shams.</li>
            <li>I switched to this sunblock for regular use, and so far it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>: It leaves a pretty significant white cast when you use the correct amount (because it&#x27;s a physical sunscreen).</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 60+ on Sept 5 2013, received it after 2 business days (thanks to Amazon prime).  </li>
            <li>I just got this a couple of days ago (from Walgreens, but same product) and so far I love it as my daily</li>
            <li>Overall I find it worth  </li>
            <li>I carefully wiped it off with a cool cloth and immediately felt much relief.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where sunscreen is pretty much an every day essential.</li>
            <li>Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye.</li>
            <li>I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 seconds, my right eye was burning like fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  </li>
            <li>– it works well only right after a shave.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t find Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, try Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby sunblock lotion, because they are essentially the same product.  </li>
            <li>After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned.</li>
            <li>I took my brand new, unopened tube with me on vacation.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t care less about looks as long as my son is safe from the sun and isn&#x27;t using other brands which contain WAY more chemicals.</li>
            <li>Having very sensitive skin, I have had no allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of skin allergies and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is NOT for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Definitely stays on though I did a 5 mile run, 14 mile bike, worked out on gym equipment, swam 1/4 mile and sat in the hot tub and still had to scrub in the shower to get it off.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product before a recent vacation, preferring the titanium and zinc oxide ingredients to the chemical ingredients found in so many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>There are few things less pleasant than putting sunblock on your face.</li>
            <li>My husband is so frustrated that I purchased it a second time after it took him a good 15 minutes to get it off his face the first time he used it!!!</li>
            <li>The consistency also is slightly thicker than most chemical sunscreens, so it&#x27;s harder to rub in and feels a little more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The only thing I use on my skin is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and olive oil, so when I need a sunscreen, it must be as pure as I can find.  </li>
            <li>It goes on with little white cast IF you can rub it in effectively, but sometimes it leaves white streaks</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and when i use reg.</li>
            <li>when I use Neutrogena sensitive skin sunblock I don&#x27;t brake out.</li>
            <li>I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  </li>
            <li>For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use too much of this sunscreen, your skin will have a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I do not recommend it if you are sensitive to sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like this because it is not scented, doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive (allergy and eczema stricken)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken it on two trips now including one with my young kids.  </li>
            <li>None of us have sensitive skin either so the rashes weren&#x27;t because our skin was just sensitive.</li>
            <li>This is NOT for sensitive skin nor should you use it if you are prone to acne because its oily feeling.</li>
            <li>and I like Neutrogena products for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, this may work for you.</li>
            <li>(I think I&#x27;m sensitive to chemical sunscreens).</li>
            <li>I can put this Neutrogena sensitive skin sunscreen on them anytime, any scenario, and they never get irritated or complain it burns or itches them.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Because of my sensitive skin, sunblock lotions tend to burn my eyes and make my skin itchy, BUT this product doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>After trying the Nitrogen Sensitive Skin, I figure I must be allergic to sunscreens with Benzoophenones, Oxybenzone, Dioxybenzone, and Avobenzone, because Neutrogena Sensitive Skin contains none of these as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like others reviewing this product, I will say it does leave a white haze on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It seems Neutrogena&#x27;s Sensitive Skin sunscreen is identical to their baby sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen keeps me from burning and doesnt feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>If you have truly sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this brand of sunscreen because it&#x27;s for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much you&#x27;ll end up with a chalky white face.</li>
            <li>I tried ALL of the blockers and screens that were labeled &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ... none of them worked.  </li>
            <li>Having extremely sensitive skin, and living in sunny Arizona, I&#x27;ve gone through probably hundreds of dollars worth of sun products to find one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I saw this product in the store the other day and thought I&#x27;d try it</li>
            <li>I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  </li>
            <li>My solution is to blend it with a drop of foundation in a dark tan shade to create a BB style concoction similar to but MUCH BETTER THAN pricey formulas like Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense.</li>
            <li>Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time.</li>
            <li>recently tried Mustela High protection Sun Lotion 50</li>
            <li>This stuff left patchy white flakes on my skin no matter how much I buffed it</li>
            <li>My face now looks very sunburned and is covered with white flakes similar to excema.</li>
            <li>Had a Major allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin and normally use Biore, which I have to buy on Amazon since they stopped selling their products in my area.</li>
            <li>If not careful, I leave the house looking like a geisha or have smeared bird poop on my face.  </li>
            <li>I used a daily moisturizer with avobenzone for 10+ years, and seem to have developed a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li>It also wasn&#x27;t oily like a lot of sunscreens; once it absorbs you can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I must be the elusive sensitive male.  </li>
            <li>Over the past 2 years I have developed a progressively worsening hypersensitivity - allergy to any skin block or sunscreen that uses ingredients that are absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  </li>
            <li>I guess you don&#x27;t need large amounts like other sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye.</li>
            <li>:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  </li>
            <li>It is also on the lists of most dangerous sun screens because of certain ingredients.</li>
            <li>Goes on very greasy and it takes forever to rub in long enough to not have a white residue.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m very concerned about ordering again other item that has a expiration date.</li>
            <li>Kind of disappointing given the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; forumla.</li>
            <li>The Skinceuticals product contains sunscreen nanoparticles that may not be perfectly safe (search &amp;#34;Health Hazards of Sunscreening Agents - National Center for Biotechnology Information.&amp;#34;) Skinceuticals is also very irritating.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used it yet, it can look a little white/chalky when it&#x27;s first applied.  </li>
            <li>Most physical sunscreens are glopy, white and poorly formulated.</li>
            <li>(I have pretty pale skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty naturally pale anyway, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many zinc/titanium oxide bases sunscreens and this is the first one I&#x27;ve had a bad reaction to.</li>
            <li>and it really makes quite a mess until showertime.</li>
            <li>These reactions included but were not limited to: facial swelling, lip swelling with yellow fluid, and non-itchy bumps on arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not easy to find zinc and titanium sunscreens that go on easily and don&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> MY OWN dermatologist recommended (i.e. titanium dioxide) for best protection.</li>
            <li> When I go running, as I&#x27;m a runner, I apply some on and it great.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> I switched to a lighter brand but imagine this is the best in some situations where you want to make sure it stays on and continues to protect.</li>
            <li> It gives you a peace of mind, knowing you item will arrive on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> good quality product that does what its supposed to do and as advertised.good quality product that does what it is supposed to do as advertised</li>
            <li> No reactions, and good sun protection.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my skin specially the water resistance</li>
            <li> It is so good, so effective keeping my skin from burning.</li>
            <li> i love it!  </li>
            <li> more of this nonsense!</li>
            <li> and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li> very good, stays on in water, smooth, does not appear to stain, pleased with the product, will buy again, lp</li>
            <li> This is the best at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> have always liked the service and quality of the products from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I accused my husband of rubbing his sweaty arm on me, but it was my own sweat</li>
            <li> and I do break out fairly easily, so that was good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I was going to be able to find anything that would work effectively and not bother my skin or my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have never, ever, known Neutrogena Sensitive Skin to sting my skin or burn my eyes and best of all, it works!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give our 4 year old a rash, awesome!</li>
            <li> the best thus far.</li>
            <li> perfect for even the most sensitive</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Mineral sunblock ingredients (titanium and zinc) help play it safe while chemical sunscreens are being scrutinized.  </li>
            <li> This compares to the chemical sunscreens (avobenzone) found in most full-spectrum drugstore sunscreens which absorb the rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to physical sunscreens, this is a wonderful solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been able to use Vanicream (greasy), and Fallene Cotz (practically wipes off).  </li>
            <li> i doesn&#x27;t break out my face. : )</li>
            <li> it looks okay</li>
            <li> This product is okay</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be a better alternative to the more chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t put anything on it to make it better either, so be warned.</li>
            <li> Do your research for healthy sunscreens at ewg.org and don&#x27;t fall for this like I did.</li>
            <li> it is safe to put on you and children.</li>
            <li> Glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li> So when I ran out of my Biore dual sunscreen/moisturizer and needed sunscreen ASAP, many friends recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> Even after trying your best to do so and then sweating, you will have patches of this stuff left on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like condensation as opposed to sweat.</li>
            <li> They just make us feel better.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling like most sunblocks do.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> It is light and yet effective.</li>
            <li> Better than the face sunscreen by neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Will run out soon for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found that applying this 15-30 minutes before heading outside works the best.</li>
            <li> I love this Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because skin cancer and wrinkle prevention are important to me!</li>
            <li> Okay, well, I know it is SPF 60, but this does not go on smooth at all!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I actually made effort to be in the sun to get some color to my fair skin!  </li>
            <li> and I burn easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> Spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always used neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreens on my face and have liked them very much.</li>
            <li> The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned.</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix, so I need a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This would be fine for use on the body.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it rubbed in just fine</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens create all sorts of bizarre chemical compounds while reacting with the sun, causing skin rashes.  </li>
            <li> But it can form free radicals in sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, unscented, reasonably priced, and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> FYI, no, this isn&#x27;t organic and chemical free</li>
            <li> This smelled neutral went on smooth and was not sticky at all after application.</li>
            <li> I thought this was supposed to be good for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> Note, I am an early 30&#x27;s man with fair caucasian</li>
            <li> It is by far the best drugstore physical sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, but be careful to apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well for a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Retinyl Palmitate is technically Vitamin A and sounds &#x27;good&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> still I&#x27;d like to say it&#x27;s a very good sunscreen especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Anything like 30 is fine, but research this first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than most sunscreens within the same price range</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> Definitely will be sticking to the moisturizer I know and love!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all.</li>
            <li> +, which blends in much easier and works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive fair -way too easy to burn skin - I use this now regularly on my face - under make up and also on my hands and forearms when driving.</li>
            <li> This product is quite the opposite: It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;thick\\&quot; on the skin.</li>
            <li> but it is always worth it to me to keep everything sunburn free!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, this is far superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is a very different kind of anti-chafing item.  </li>
            <li> and I love it because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance, but some people might not like the smell.</li>
            <li> It does leave a distinctly whitish cast to the skin and will accumulate in any hair.</li>
            <li> The product does leave a whitish cast to my skin because it needs a bit of time to get absorbed.</li>
            <li> so I had a nice red rash going on my face for about 5 days which ironically looked like sunburn.</li>
            <li> Plus, it had more sunscreen for a lower cost as compared to Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Face SPF 55+ sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This has a similar sheer finish that doesn&#x27;t make you look oily, and the consistency is very nice and light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that the baby pure &amp; free is almost the exact product to this, so if you can&#x27;t find this in the stores look for that.</li>
            <li> This would probably be good for a long day at the beach, but I bought this for everyday wear and it does not look good.</li>
            <li> it does leave your skin kinda white/pale, so applying makeup right after or allowing time for it to soak in is recommended.  </li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> , I love the texture, for me, it wasn&#x27;t too greasy and left a &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; finish when absorbed.</li>
            <li> I will not use it very much.</li>
            <li> I was very, very upset.  </li>
            <li> fun when you hit a certain age</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, I am sensitive to most high spf sunblocks and sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use most commercial sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products, but they need to fix that white effect.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most mass-market drugstore sunscreens, this is a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not purchase this from Amazon, I purchased it from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s been working pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to go on my super-sensitive face at the beach but will use more standard sunscreen for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, when you first put it on you&#x27;re going to look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> : The first drugstore sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make me itch and break out</li>
            <li> Most of the people reviewing this product are pretty obviously marketers or they must use a foundation over it.</li>
            <li> It also makes me break out when I sweat on really hot humid days.  </li>
            <li> (I look pretty funny when I use it in the yard without shaving.)</li>
            <li> My skin keeps a healthy white look during the trip and feels moisturized all the day.</li>
            <li> I do have to really wash with soap and water to get it off, but that means it works well in water!  </li>
            <li> I bought this seeing all positive reviews, but I&#x27;ve come to start clicking on the &amp;#34;most helpful reviews&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve noticed something: Everything they buy is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product when I was living in Florida because I was spending so much time in the sun, either competing in or coaching track.  </li>
            <li> I found that certain sunscreens have cancer causing ingredients.</li>
            <li> so far the lightest and easy to blend natural sunblock containing titanium dioxide</li>
            <li> The left eye seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to try Neutrogena Pure and free baby sunscreen</li>
            <li> The only difference is that Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby has added the inactive ingredients Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, and Potassium Sorbate.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like this.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it were available as a spray for faster application.  </li>
            <li> How much can you trust a person that rates 9/10 items they buy as 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be very moisture resistant, too; I have to wash my hands with lava soap after applying it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have to really rub it in to try to get rid of whiteness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have absolute proof that the lotion caused the rash, but it went away within days of switching away from the product to a lower SPF lotion containing a lower percentage of titanium oxide.</li>
            <li> While I liked that it does not contain harsh chemicals, it sweat off of me any my children within minutes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because there&#x27;s such an appearance of  sunscreen variety on the market when in reality, most of the sunscreens have the same chemical formula.  </li>
            <li> I do keep using still because my face does not get itchy from it like most other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Obviously I have to wear sunscreen, but most products make my skin hot, red, and sometimes itchy.  </li>
            <li> This particular product has to much Grease/oil in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had real issues with sunscreen in particular.  </li>
            <li> I am very committed to protecting my face from sun damage and so use a sunscreen with a high SPF every day.</li>
            <li> Completely painless around eyes, just looks funny for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear sun block daily and have used Neutrogena clear face breakout free for a while.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a problem with me (my foundation color is called Ivory, I&#x27;m super white)</li>
            <li> but once I start sweating it seems to pool up on top of the sweat making me look extra white.  </li>
            <li> Titanium or Zinc Oxide are different because they lay on top of the skin and physically block sun like a shirt or piece of clothing.  </li>
            <li> Smells lighter and wipes on as well as the regular baby neutrogena free and clear.</li>
            <li> have very fait, very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> ) I tend to be highly allergic to chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in the high numbers are shams.</li>
            <li> I switched to this sunblock for regular use, and so far it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> : It leaves a pretty significant white cast when you use the correct amount (because it&#x27;s a physical sunscreen).</li>
            <li> However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 60+ on Sept 5 2013, received it after 2 business days (thanks to Amazon prime).  </li>
            <li> I just got this a couple of days ago (from Walgreens, but same product) and so far I love it as my daily</li>
            <li> Overall I find it worth  </li>
            <li> I carefully wiped it off with a cool cloth and immediately felt much relief.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where sunscreen is pretty much an every day essential.</li>
            <li> Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye.</li>
            <li> I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 seconds, my right eye was burning like fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  </li>
            <li> – it works well only right after a shave.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t find Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, try Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby sunblock lotion, because they are essentially the same product.  </li>
            <li> After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> , I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned.</li>
            <li> I took my brand new, unopened tube with me on vacation.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t care less about looks as long as my son is safe from the sun and isn&#x27;t using other brands which contain WAY more chemicals.</li>
            <li> Having very sensitive skin, I have had no allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of skin allergies and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is NOT for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Definitely stays on though I did a 5 mile run, 14 mile bike, worked out on gym equipment, swam 1/4 mile and sat in the hot tub and still had to scrub in the shower to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product before a recent vacation, preferring the titanium and zinc oxide ingredients to the chemical ingredients found in so many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> There are few things less pleasant than putting sunblock on your face.</li>
            <li> My husband is so frustrated that I purchased it a second time after it took him a good 15 minutes to get it off his face the first time he used it!!!</li>
            <li> The consistency also is slightly thicker than most chemical sunscreens, so it&#x27;s harder to rub in and feels a little more noticeable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I use on my skin is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and olive oil, so when I need a sunscreen, it must be as pure as I can find.  </li>
            <li> It goes on with little white cast IF you can rub it in effectively, but sometimes it leaves white streaks</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when i use reg.</li>
            <li> when I use Neutrogena sensitive skin sunblock I don&#x27;t brake out.</li>
            <li> I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li> : I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  </li>
            <li> For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use too much of this sunscreen, your skin will have a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I do not recommend it if you are sensitive to sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like this because it is not scented, doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive (allergy and eczema stricken)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it on two trips now including one with my young kids.  </li>
            <li> None of us have sensitive skin either so the rashes weren&#x27;t because our skin was just sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is NOT for sensitive skin nor should you use it if you are prone to acne because its oily feeling.</li>
            <li> and I like Neutrogena products for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> (I think I&#x27;m sensitive to chemical sunscreens).</li>
            <li> I can put this Neutrogena sensitive skin sunscreen on them anytime, any scenario, and they never get irritated or complain it burns or itches them.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Because of my sensitive skin, sunblock lotions tend to burn my eyes and make my skin itchy, BUT this product doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After trying the Nitrogen Sensitive Skin, I figure I must be allergic to sunscreens with Benzoophenones, Oxybenzone, Dioxybenzone, and Avobenzone, because Neutrogena Sensitive Skin contains none of these as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like others reviewing this product, I will say it does leave a white haze on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It seems Neutrogena&#x27;s Sensitive Skin sunscreen is identical to their baby sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen keeps me from burning and doesnt feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you have truly sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this brand of sunscreen because it&#x27;s for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much you&#x27;ll end up with a chalky white face.</li>
            <li> I tried ALL of the blockers and screens that were labeled &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ... none of them worked.  </li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin, and living in sunny Arizona, I&#x27;ve gone through probably hundreds of dollars worth of sun products to find one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I saw this product in the store the other day and thought I&#x27;d try it</li>
            <li> I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  </li>
            <li> My solution is to blend it with a drop of foundation in a dark tan shade to create a BB style concoction similar to but MUCH BETTER THAN pricey formulas like Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense.</li>
            <li> Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time.</li>
            <li> recently tried Mustela High protection Sun Lotion 50</li>
            <li> This stuff left patchy white flakes on my skin no matter how much I buffed it</li>
            <li> My face now looks very sunburned and is covered with white flakes similar to excema.</li>
            <li> Had a Major allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and normally use Biore, which I have to buy on Amazon since they stopped selling their products in my area.</li>
            <li> If not careful, I leave the house looking like a geisha or have smeared bird poop on my face.  </li>
            <li> I used a daily moisturizer with avobenzone for 10+ years, and seem to have developed a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> It also wasn&#x27;t oily like a lot of sunscreens; once it absorbs you can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I must be the elusive sensitive male.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 2 years I have developed a progressively worsening hypersensitivity - allergy to any skin block or sunscreen that uses ingredients that are absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  </li>
            <li> I guess you don&#x27;t need large amounts like other sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye.</li>
            <li> :  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  </li>
            <li> It is also on the lists of most dangerous sun screens because of certain ingredients.</li>
            <li> Goes on very greasy and it takes forever to rub in long enough to not have a white residue.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m very concerned about ordering again other item that has a expiration date.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing given the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; forumla.</li>
            <li> The Skinceuticals product contains sunscreen nanoparticles that may not be perfectly safe (search &amp;#34;Health Hazards of Sunscreening Agents - National Center for Biotechnology Information.&amp;#34;) Skinceuticals is also very irritating.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used it yet, it can look a little white/chalky when it&#x27;s first applied.  </li>
            <li> Most physical sunscreens are glopy, white and poorly formulated.</li>
            <li> (I have pretty pale skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty naturally pale anyway, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many zinc/titanium oxide bases sunscreens and this is the first one I&#x27;ve had a bad reaction to.</li>
            <li> and it really makes quite a mess until showertime.</li>
            <li> These reactions included but were not limited to: facial swelling, lip swelling with yellow fluid, and non-itchy bumps on arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find zinc and titanium sunscreens that go on easily and don&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> Although thick and matte, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit in-depth to go into here, but needless to say, this is very important for the health and wellbeing of your skin in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other big name brands really seemed to burn my face so this seemed a safe bet: WRONG!</li>
            <li> Tried a couple of other sensitive skin sunscreens...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing no odor and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I generally use other stuff if I&#x27;m going to be outside and sweating, because I&#x27;m going to break out anyway</li>
            <li> I would only use this sunscreen on days that you aren&#x27;t planning to be out in the sun for a long time.</li>
            <li> this year, i have purchased two separate tubes and both have a distinctly sour smell that even my child&#x27;s sensitive nose noticed.  </li>
            <li> This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very possible that other user&#x27;s complaints are related to non-sunscreen related sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s consistency and residue on the skin after application is really very similar to the other Neutrogena Sunblock Lotions, and for all the fear that this would leave one looking like a Zinc-faced rugby player, it&#x27;s actually not very much different at all than a regular sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  </li>
            <li> Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the white cast this will give your face, as with any other titanium dioxide-base sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It developed into little bumps and itched like craxy.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because it contains only physical sunscreens as active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset, would&#x27;ve gave negative stars if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves a ghostly look, but that&#x27;s to be expected with barrier sunscreen.</li>
            <li> recently went to a baseball game and sat in direct sunlight for about 3 hours and had no effects from the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so it keeps staying on my face very long .</li>
            <li> My skin is dry</li>
            <li> I assumed my skin must be too dry</li>
            <li> But a few minutes after applying this sensitive skin sunscreen on my face, I start sweating and the sunscreen becomes a milky wet residue.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few different brands, but I started breaking out with an itchy rash around the back of my neck, and between my forearms and biceps, and calves and hamstrings.  </li>
            <li> Just because I have sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t mean I want to remain white and pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle (which left me white and hard to rub in) and thought I was avoiding chemicals.</li>
            <li> Rubs in easily (though I can&#x27;t get the ghost look out) but is difficult to wash off, also typical of barrier sunscreen.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way, don&#x27;t glob it on or you will look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Today my forehead was dry, but my chin was wet.</li>
            <li> We usually forget that our internal body has a lot to do with how our external body turns</li>
            <li> will also add that we all have very sensitive skin and eyes and have never had a complaint or rash with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is an active or an inactive ingredient but for now I am sticking with Clear face.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  </li>
            <li> I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have even minimal stubble it sticks and won&#x27;t rub in</li>
            <li> does not really rub in too well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, occasionally.</li>
            <li> I had to spend my entire vacation under the shadows and could not enjoy the pools or ocean.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very</li>
            <li> But I put it on the next day with the same result only 100 times worse: my skin felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> My whole face is white after I put it on, and it is so thick that I described it to my boyfriend as \\&quot;putting on thick mayonnaise\\&quot; all over my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe there&#x27;s a very slight whitening effect, but the regular Neutrogena products can do that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave a very slight white haze</li>
            <li> But beyond that, the white cast it left on my skin is completely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve bought it twice, forgetting after the first time that this is the one that does not blend at all with the skin, so it leaves a heavy white cast.</li>
            <li> It left me with a white tinge (and I have very pale skin), and seemed heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> If i touch my face to dry it, it removes the sunscreen, at least the visible white part of the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Like i said i only used it once and the rash was so bad my whole face was red and bumpy</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t happen with any other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used or tried.</li>
            <li> Other than my problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I like this one</li>
            <li> and I do not use any other moisturizer before applying the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The other brands give me chemical burns or a bumpy rash on my face...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I broke out in a red bumpy rash on my chest and neck the second day I used it, which worsened over the next day or so with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have encountered allergic reactions due to over exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not contain active ingredients other than Zinc Oxide and Titanium</li>
            <li> you have allergies to the active ingredients on other products, or problems with getting them in your eyes, then give this one a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I end up tasting the active ingredients all day.  </li>
            <li> Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  </li>
            <li> I have dark skin and for years I never used a sunscreen until a dermatologist recommended I start using a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I went fishing in the last few days, and I applied the sunscreen every 2.5 hours as usual.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was putting lotion and pancake mix on my head but that eventually dies down</li>
            <li> I had issues with Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra-sheer sunscreen (and other chemical based sunscreens) giving me allergy headaches with everyday use, so I decided to try this sunscreen</li>
            <li> Slight tan.  </li>
            <li> (that you might not notice till half the day has passed).</li>
            <li> What does bother me slightly is that it balls up and rubs off if you&#x27;re someone that touches or picks at your face (neck, jawline, etc) a lot.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to get rid of the white cast it leaves on your skin although that&#x27;s fairly common with this type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The only part of me that saw real sun was my forearms; a day later, they&#x27;d broken out in painful, itchy hives.</li>
            <li> It is also slightly greasy and heavy like makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier that the number 30</li>
            <li> There is also no fragrance, so it has a little bit of a chemical-type smell.</li>
            <li> My skin burned a little when putting it on but just in places on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for a few years now, and here are my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I tried the Neutragena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen Lotion, but broke out, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> i use it everyday after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreen&#x27;s that has worked on my daughter&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I recently read on Paula&#x27;s Choice that this contains some ingredient as a preservative that can be irritating to Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I am prone to random allergic reactions, so I bought this sensitive formula at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have ordered hundreds of items from Amazon from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars but never had any issue until today.  </li>
            <li> I wear makeup everyday</li>
            <li> However, it is NOT light weight.</li>
            <li> It feels really heavy when you layer it on.  </li>
            <li> I am one of the unfortunate people who developed a rash when using this product.</li>
            <li> Slight whiteness while wearing -- but this helps you know it&#x27;s still on and working!  </li>
            <li> I am an extremely pale person - I wear the lightest foundations in the store.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for 5 days and by the end, my face was raw, cracked, and burning.</li>
            <li> It does leave a very subtle white hue on the face once rubbed in</li>
            <li> Very thick and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The day after using it, I developed a terrible rash on my upper arms, back and chest.  </li>
            <li> Barbados was brutal in terms of dry heat and sun, Puerto Rico was less intense, Cozumel was the median.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I really needed this SPF 60 to work for me, too bad, was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Even with combination or oily skin, it does not shine or slick at any point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin and comes in a small container for air travel.  </li>
            <li> Studies show this is not a safe sunscreen</li>
            <li> I usually use Neutrogena Sport Face SPF 70+, but decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> :-/. I had been using Clinique face sunscreen for years, until it started to make my skin react this summer.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena put the weird helioplex in its standard sunscreen, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find products that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this over the weekend and developed a horribly itchy rash and hives, ONLY where I applied this product!</li>
            <li> Methylisothiazolinone is a relatively common allergen, so test this before using it all over your body.</li>
            <li> It always smells icky, feels oily going on and attracts every speck of dust or salt or sand that is in the air leaving your face gritty and dirty.</li>
            <li> After being home one week, the rash is slowly subsiding</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can wear without breaking out in  horrible red itchy rash!  </li>
            <li> and I needed some serious SPF protection.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m distracted enough that I don&#x27;t scratch, but everyday itchy face was getting really annoying.</li>
            <li> If you have scruff, or don&#x27;t shave, this is not a good option.</li>
            <li> Not good, cause it probably is clogging my pores a lot.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment to buy a quality name brand and expensive to boot only to find it burned worse than the less expensive brand.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> The item looked very dirty, the supposed white container of the sun screen is in beige color, as if it had been kicked around on the ground for months.  </li>
            <li> Works well but very thick, once I get it all rubbed in</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get reactions from a lot of products besides maybe making my acne worse</li>
            <li> This was even worse.</li>
            <li> The environmental working group rated it a 7 (not good)!</li>
            <li> This product paired with my over-the-counter medicine protected me enough in the brutal Carribean weather.</li>
            <li> Into hard, painful, cystic acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and leaves a white cast.</li>
            <li> I tried this product one time and got a horrible red rash on my face, that took days to go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> Very weird.</li>
            <li> VERY bad reaction that took weeks to repair the damage.</li>
            <li> Benedryl helped a bit; hopefully continued doses will do the trick to get rid of this terrible rash.</li>
            <li> I too broke out into a terrible itchy rash that lasted for days.</li>
            <li> but this was just awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible product for me!!!!!!!!!!!.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very good, stays on in water, smooth, does not appear to stain, pleased with the product, will buy again, lp</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot use most commercial sunscreens.  I end up tasting the active ingredients all day.  This does the job and with enough rubbing, blends in and does not look whitish.  I live in Phoenix, so I need a good sunscreen.  It works.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I burn easily. I wear sun block daily and have used Neutrogena clear face breakout free for a while.  I recently decided to try Neutrogena Pure and free baby sunscreen but I had a reaction to it. So I decided to try this one and I had a similar reaction to it. Not sure if it is an active or an inactive ingredient but for now I am sticking with Clear face.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  The only problem is that it is all white looking after you apply it to your skin.  I need something that I can just rub on and go.  I love Neutrogena products, but they need to fix that white effect.  I bought it for my Panama Central America trip, but I had to use Hawaiian Tropic.  I am a mixed person with a cafe con leche skin tone and I got some sunburn over there. so I really needed this SPF 60 to work for me, too bad, was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and when i use reg. sunblock I brake out where ever its on me at. when I use Neutrogena sensitive skin sunblock I don&#x27;t brake out. But the problem I have with it is when I go to the beach. when I get out of the water the sunblock on my skin is creamy white</li>
            <li> Very thick and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Completely painless around eyes, just looks funny for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of science, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned. I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATERIAL: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  For simplicity, I&#x27;ll just refer to them by their SPF rating (50, 60, &amp; 70).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METHODS: The test was simple. I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time. Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye. After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  The results were quite surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:  Lotions were vastly different. I literally had no reaction to 60, but 70 felt like I had been pepper sprayed.  The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned. I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it and ran to the kitchen sink to rinse my eyes.  After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  Within 3 seconds, my right eye was burning like fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet. This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye. I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye. The left eye seemed fine.  The final test was direct spray onto the eyelid of each closed eye.  Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all. However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE:  Very different appearance between the 3 products.  Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can wear without breaking out in  horrible red itchy rash!  It&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Picked up a bottle of this for my recent vacation. Applied it on my arms, chest, and neck prior to sun exposure while wearing a t-shirt. The only part of me that saw real sun was my forearms; a day later, they&#x27;d broken out in painful, itchy hives. It&#x27;s been about a week, and they still won&#x27;t go away. Topically applied Cortisone hasn&#x27;t made a dent; nor did Sarna. Benedryl helped a bit; hopefully continued doses will do the trick to get rid of this terrible rash. No idea what ingredient it was that caused the problem, but this is an inconvenience and annoyance I wouldn&#x27;t wish on anyone.</li>
            <li> Put to the test at a four-day, outdoor swim meet in Mesa, Arizona (without a cloud in the sky).  Not even a hint of a burn.  No irritated skin.  Slight whiteness while wearing -- but this helps you know it&#x27;s still on and working!  Slight tan.  Mineral sunblock ingredients (titanium and zinc) help play it safe while chemical sunscreens are being scrutinized.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Into hard, painful, cystic acne. I thought this was supposed to be good for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where sunscreen is pretty much an every day essential. I had issues with Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra-sheer sunscreen (and other chemical based sunscreens) giving me allergy headaches with everyday use, so I decided to try this sunscreen and it did the trick. This has a similar sheer finish that doesn&#x27;t make you look oily, and the consistency is very nice and light. Only downside is the white cast this will give your face, as with any other titanium dioxide-base sunscreen. This isn&#x27;t a problem with me (my foundation color is called Ivory, I&#x27;m super white) but this might be a problem on people with darker skin or people who don&#x27;t want to put on makeup after their sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for a few years now, and here are my thoughts. Note, I am an early 30&#x27;s man with fair caucasian skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This sunscreen provides full-spectrum coverage, both UVA and UVB protection. It&#x27;s a bit in-depth to go into here, but needless to say, this is very important for the health and wellbeing of your skin in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Unlike most mass-market drugstore sunscreens, this is a physical sunscreen. That means it relies on titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to physically reflect damaging rays. This compares to the chemical sunscreens (avobenzone) found in most full-spectrum drugstore sunscreens which absorb the rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I tend to be highly allergic to chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Most physical sunscreens are glopy, white and poorly formulated. Think the noses of 50&#x27;s lifeguards. This product is quite the opposite: It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;thick\\&quot; on the skin. Even with combination or oily skin, it does not shine or slick at any point during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) If you are allergic to physical sunscreens, this is a wonderful solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) If you have scruff, or don&#x27;t shave, this is not a good option. It will get into the beard and cause a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) If you use too much of this sunscreen, your skin will have a white cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Having very sensitive skin, I have had no allergic reaction to this product. That said, my allergies tend to be connected to the chemical sunscreens, and not the stabilizing ingredients. It&#x27;s very possible that other user&#x27;s complaints are related to non-sunscreen related sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) I can&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen enough. It is by far the best drugstore physical sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not purchase this from Amazon, I purchased it from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I am sensitive to most high spf sunblocks and sunscreens.  I break out in a rash.  I have been able to use Vanicream (greasy), and Fallene Cotz (practically wipes off).  I tried the Neutragena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen Lotion, but broke out, unfortunately.  So I do not recommend it if you are sensitive to sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Mustela High protection Sun Lotion 50+ and that&#x27;s been working pretty well for me.  Goes on really white and have to cover it with mineral make up.  I use Vanicream on everything but my face and neck.</li>
            <li> i have used this sunscreen for several years, always worked.  this year, i have purchased two separate tubes and both have a distinctly sour smell that even my child&#x27;s sensitive nose noticed.  i have spoken with neutrogena twice about this, but no one seems to know anything about it, or shows any interest in cause.  oh well...</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin. Does not clog skin. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Like this because it is not scented, doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive (allergy and eczema stricken) skin and comes in a small container for air travel.  I&#x27;ve taken it on two trips now including one with my young kids.  It works well for all of us.</li>
            <li> This particular product has to much Grease/oil in it.  It leaves a whitish residue on your skin.  I wanted it for my face but you could SEE it after I applied it.  I will go back to the neutrogena spf30 Oil-Free Moisture w/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the best at a reasonable price.  Note it does not have PABA or any harmful ingredients.  It uses a physical (not chemical) blocking method like zinc oxide.  But since it is micro milled, it does not leave you covered in white goo.  It does appear slightly white if you do not rub it in or if you haven&#x27;t shaved and it gets stuck in your stubble.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my sensitive skin!  (Note that I do NOT use it on my face.) It provides excellent sun protection, and once it&#x27;s rubbed in, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a flowery scent.  If you haven&#x27;t used it yet, it can look a little white/chalky when it&#x27;s first applied.  Just rub it in thoroughly and the whiteness will disappear.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well for a physical sunscreen. It goes on with little white cast IF you can rub it in effectively, but sometimes it leaves white streaks (that you might not notice till half the day has passed). Also, if you have even minimal stubble it sticks and won&#x27;t rub in– it works well only right after a shave.</li>
            <li> Goes on very greasy and it takes forever to rub in long enough to not have a white residue. It is also on the lists of most dangerous sun screens because of certain ingredients. After one use we ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I used this over the weekend and developed a horribly itchy rash and hives, ONLY where I applied this product! This is NOT for sensitive skin! It&#x27;s been two days and I am still itching and my skin has WELTS where I applied this stuff! BEWARE!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my skin specially the water resistance so it keeps staying on my face very long .</li>
            <li> Only drawback is how greasy it is.  If not careful, I leave the house looking like a geisha or have smeared bird poop on my face.  Works great for my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not contain active ingredients other than Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s consistency and residue on the skin after application is really very similar to the other Neutrogena Sunblock Lotions, and for all the fear that this would leave one looking like a Zinc-faced rugby player, it&#x27;s actually not very much different at all than a regular sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe there&#x27;s a very slight whitening effect, but the regular Neutrogena products can do that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have allergies to the active ingredients on other products, or problems with getting them in your eyes, then give this one a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.</li>
            <li> Studies show this is not a safe sunscreen</li>
            <li> Perfect for my allergy to fragrances</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves a ghostly look, but that&#x27;s to be expected with barrier sunscreen. I bought this to go on my super-sensitive face at the beach but will use more standard sunscreen for the rest of my body. Rubs in easily (though I can&#x27;t get the ghost look out) but is difficult to wash off, also typical of barrier sunscreen.</li>
            <li> i have a tendancy to break out, but i need mositure to prevent from getting so oily.  this product is perfect!  i use it everyday after washing my face.  it does leave your skin kinda white/pale, so applying makeup right after or allowing time for it to soak in is recommended.  i love it!  i doesn&#x27;t break out my face. : )</li>
            <li> I have a lot of skin allergies and very sensitive skin.  Used this product on my face and was itching for 2 days.  Although it protects skin from the sun, if you have a lot of allergies, this probably isn&#x27;t the sunscreen for you.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreen&#x27;s that has worked on my daughter&#x27;s face.  It does not burn her skin and she has yet to get sunburnt with this on her cheeks.  It does leave a very subtle white hue on the face once rubbed in but it is always worth it to me to keep everything sunburn free!&lt;br /&gt;I will also add that we all have very sensitive skin and eyes and have never had a complaint or rash with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and leaves a white cast. It is also slightly greasy and heavy like makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it on my eyes but I stopped that too after noticing the sunscreen settles into the lines leaving stripes on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more of this nonsense!</li>
            <li> Works well but very thick, once I get it all rubbed in it looks okay but once I start sweating it seems to pool up on top of the sweat making me look extra white.  Rubs off on everything, car door, the clothes you&#x27;re wearing etc...  Definitely stays on though I did a 5 mile run, 14 mile bike, worked out on gym equipment, swam 1/4 mile and sat in the hot tub and still had to scrub in the shower to get it off.  I switched to a lighter brand but imagine this is the best in some situations where you want to make sure it stays on and continues to protect.</li>
            <li> This product is okay I had no problem with it except lotion does not really rub in too well and it really makes quite a mess until showertime. I will not use it very much. Lotion is a bit oily even. I guess you don&#x27;t need large amounts like other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, occasionally.</li>
            <li> I too broke out into a terrible itchy rash that lasted for days. I bought it thinking it would be a better alternative to the more chemical sunscreens. 2 of my 3 kids also broke out into rashes. None of us have sensitive skin either so the rashes weren&#x27;t because our skin was just sensitive.</li>
            <li> I tried this product one time and got a horrible red rash on my face, that took days to go away. This is NOT for sensitive skin nor should you use it if you are prone to acne because its oily feeling. Like i said i only used it once and the rash was so bad my whole face was red and bumpy i couldn&#x27;t put anything on it to make it better either, so be warned. I don&#x27;t get reactions from a lot of products besides maybe making my acne worse but this was just awful. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I took my brand new, unopened tube with me on vacation.  The day after using it, I developed a terrible rash on my upper arms, back and chest.  It developed into little bumps and itched like craxy.  I did not use it for my face, thank goodness.  I had to spend my entire vacation under the shadows and could not enjoy the pools or ocean.  I was very, very upset.  After being home one week, the rash is slowly subsiding but the bumps are still there.  Terrible product for me!!!!!!!!!!!.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin like most other sunscreens. It leaves you with a white powdered face, looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> I recently took a trip to Tanzania and I needed some serious SPF protection.  The only problem was that I am allergic to almost every fragrance out there.  I&#x27;ve also had real issues with sunscreen in particular.  I didn&#x27;t know if I was going to be able to find anything that would work effectively and not bother my skin or my nose.  Thankfully, this stuff did the trick without any offensive smell that I could detect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when you first put it on you&#x27;re going to look like a ghost.  I felt like I was putting lotion and pancake mix on my head but that eventually dies down and it&#x27;s not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that it protected me while on safari in Africa and I&#x27;m about as fair-skinned as they come.</li>
            <li> I like that this sunscreen is Titanium or Zinc Oxide-based rather than Avobenzene-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 90% of sunscreens on the market have avobenzene these days.  It&#x27;s funny because there&#x27;s such an appearance of  sunscreen variety on the market when in reality, most of the sunscreens have the same chemical formula.  Avobenzene is a carcinogen and gives me a rash.  Avobeneze is a chemical sunscreen rather than a physical sunscreen.  Chemical sunscreens create all sorts of bizarre chemical compounds while reacting with the sun, causing skin rashes.  Titanium or Zinc Oxide are different because they lay on top of the skin and physically block sun like a shirt or piece of clothing.  So, I always look for sunscreens with Titanium and Zinc Oxide for the healthier option and to avoid skin rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this sunscreen has Retinyl Palmitate which has been associated with Skin Tumors.  Retinyl Palmitate is technically Vitamin A and sounds &#x27;good&#x27;.  But it can form free radicals in sunlight.  Another thing is, I wish this sunscreen came in medium spf levels like 30 so that my skin could potentially form a tan.  Just because I have sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t mean I want to remain white and pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be one of the only sensitive-skin healthier options found in local stores besides Avalon Organics which is only spf 15, so I buy it despite the Retinyl Palmitate.  I might order Blue Lizard which is spf 30, but I&#x27;ll have to pay the shipping costs since it&#x27;s not carried in my local store.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is just so-so. It left me with a white tinge (and I have very pale skin), and seemed heavy on my skin. It also rubbed off when I went for a run on the beach. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier that the number 30 I used before, but I like it and I like Neutrogena products for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this to try to find a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreen without chemicals. Do NOT purchase. I&#x27;m so mad I used the entire bottle (which left me white and hard to rub in) and thought I was avoiding chemicals. Then I find it has retinyl palmitate which is cancer causing especially when exposed to the sun. The environmental working group rated it a 7 (not good)! So deceiving. Do your research for healthy sunscreens at ewg.org and don&#x27;t fall for this like I did.</li>
            <li> The only thing I use on my skin is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap and olive oil, so when I need a sunscreen, it must be as pure as I can find.  So far, this is far superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried.  Two weeks in June Cancun Mexico&#x27;s sun and no burn!!!  I actually made effort to be in the sun to get some color to my fair skin!  AND it kept me cooler - like when you put on a rash guard (sun protective shirt).  I will look for a SPF 30 in this formula...can&#x27;t believe that...have not used a SPF 30 in 20 years!</li>
            <li> This is a very different kind of anti-chafing item.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing no odor and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Find another brand to buy for the face.  This would be fine for use on the body.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive fair -way too easy to burn skin - I use this now regularly on my face - under make up and also on my hands and forearms when driving. It is so good, so effective keeping my skin from burning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind having a white face or looking like a geisha when i apply the sunscreen on.  But a few minutes after applying this sensitive skin sunscreen on my face, I start sweating and the sunscreen becomes a milky wet residue.  If i touch my face to dry it, it removes the sunscreen, at least the visible white part of the sunscreen.  This doesn&#x27;t happen with any other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used or tried.</li>
            <li> I found that certain sunscreens have cancer causing ingredients. This one does Nordic it is safe to put on you and children.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always used neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreens on my face and have liked them very much. i would, however prefer something with titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide.  i have found one but haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  if i like it, i may stop using neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with this sunscreen on my face.  I have Rosacea, so any product is chancy.  I tried this because it contains only physical sunscreens as active ingredients.  However, I still suffered from upset skin, breakouts on my cheeks.  I recently read on Paula&#x27;s Choice that this contains some ingredient as a preservative that can be irritating to Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will continue to use this on the rest of my skin, and let my kids use it.  Other than my problem, I thought it rubbed in just fine, I didn&#x27;t notice that it made me skin look white. (I have pretty pale skin anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> Really like this.  Easy to put on.  Spreads easily.  Doesn&#x27;t feel clammy.  Doesn&#x27;t smell. It is not easy to find zinc and titanium sunscreens that go on easily and don&#x27;t feel heavy.  Glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li> Effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and normally use Biore, which I have to buy on Amazon since they stopped selling their products in my area. So when I ran out of my Biore dual sunscreen/moisturizer and needed sunscreen ASAP, many friends recommended this to me. I am prone to random allergic reactions, so I bought this sensitive formula at the grocery store. I used it everyday for 5 days and by the end, my face was raw, cracked, and burning. VERY bad reaction that took weeks to repair the damage. Definitely will be sticking to the moisturizer I know and love!</li>
            <li> It works.  I only wish it were available as a spray for faster application.  Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I trust on my face but the white zinc oxide does produce a ghastly pallor even when rubbed in well. My solution is to blend it with a drop of foundation in a dark tan shade to create a BB style concoction similar to but MUCH BETTER THAN pricey formulas like Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense. The Skinceuticals product contains sunscreen nanoparticles that may not be perfectly safe (search &amp;#34;Health Hazards of Sunscreening Agents - National Center for Biotechnology Information.&amp;#34;) Skinceuticals is also very irritating. I have never, ever, known Neutrogena Sensitive Skin to sting my skin or burn my eyes and best of all, it works!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give our 4 year old a rash, awesome!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 60+ on Sept 5 2013, received it after 2 business days (thanks to Amazon prime).  The item looked very dirty, the supposed white container of the sun screen is in beige color, as if it had been kicked around on the ground for months.  Next, I looked at the expiration date, guess what, it expired 8 months ago in Jan 2013.  I&#x27;m very upset, would&#x27;ve gave negative stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked the service and quality of the products from Amazon.  It gives you a peace of mind, knowing you item will arrive on time and in good shape.  I have ordered hundreds of items from Amazon from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars but never had any issue until today.  Now I&#x27;m very concerned about ordering again other item that has a expiration date.</li>
            <li> I just got this a couple of days ago (from Walgreens, but same product) and so far I love it as my daily sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It leaves a pretty significant white cast when you use the correct amount (because it&#x27;s a physical sunscreen). I wear makeup everyday and I&#x27;m pretty naturally pale anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but something to keep in mind. There is also no fragrance, so it has a little bit of a chemical-type smell. Not bad, and I love it because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance, but some people might not like the smell. The consistency also is slightly thicker than most chemical sunscreens, so it&#x27;s harder to rub in and feels a little more noticeable. Again, not something that bothers me. What does bother me slightly is that it balls up and rubs off if you&#x27;re someone that touches or picks at your face (neck, jawline, etc) a lot. I&#x27;m trying to get out of that habit anyway, so it&#x27;s not a dealbreaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The first drugstore sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make me itch and break out (I think I&#x27;m sensitive to chemical sunscreens). I generally use other stuff if I&#x27;m going to be outside and sweating, because I&#x27;m going to break out anyway and I&#x27;m distracted enough that I don&#x27;t scratch, but everyday itchy face was getting really annoying. It&#x27;s not greasy, not oily, doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or coconut or Palm Tree Seashell Sunrise, and gives me peace of mind that my face is protected from UV.</li>
            <li> I tried several \\&quot;baby\\&quot; or \\&quot;kid\\&quot; sunscreens (even Aveeno Baby) and they always irritated my children.  Maybe not on the 1st application, but always on any additional applications after sun exposure and/or swimming - such as mid-day when we needed to reapply it.  They would scream it burned!  I tried this one and it&#x27;s no problem.  I can put this Neutrogena sensitive skin sunscreen on them anytime, any scenario, and they never get irritated or complain it burns or itches them.</li>
            <li> I am severely allergic to Methylisothiazolinone, which is in this product. Methylisothiazolinone is a relatively common allergen, so test this before using it all over your body. Ironically, I can tolerate Neutrogena products that are NOT labelled &amp;#34;hypoallergenic,&amp;#34; I just seem to react to the products advertised as &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; because the Methylisothiazolinone is used as a preservative in them. Regardless, I just want people to know that this product is not allergy-free and I have many photos to prove it!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen and can even be used on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this seeing all positive reviews, but I&#x27;ve come to start clicking on the &amp;#34;most helpful reviews&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve noticed something: Everything they buy is 5 stars. How much can you trust a person that rates 9/10 items they buy as 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen did not break out my skin and I do break out fairly easily, so that was good. But beyond that, the white cast it left on my skin is completely ridiculous. Keep in mind I am an extremely pale person - I wear the lightest foundations in the store. This stuff left patchy white flakes on my skin no matter how much I buffed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I&#x27;m as white as they come and this stuff left a white cast, what&#x27;s it gonna do for you? Most of the people reviewing this product are pretty obviously marketers or they must use a foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Strangest sunblock I have ever used. While it does prevent sunburn, you can never fully rub it in. Even after trying your best to do so and then sweating, you will have patches of this stuff left on your face. Oddly enough, it makes you &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; somehow- I accused my husband of rubbing his sweaty arm on me, but it was my own sweat I was experiencing! Today my forehead was dry, but my chin was wet. Very weird. It&#x27;s more like condensation as opposed to sweat. Plus, it gives you zits...it&#x27;s non-non-comdogenic. I&#x27;m going to deal with it, but not on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Sunscreens in the high numbers are shams. They just make us feel better. Anything like 30 is fine, but research this first so you do not blame me if you get radiated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You do not have to put it on twenty minutes beforehand. Put it on as soon as you get to &amp;#34;Sunnyville&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You towel off, start over. Meaning, put it on again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Try to be a vampire. Sunscreens do contain chemicals. Stay away from the sprays.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find products that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. Because of my sensitive skin, sunblock lotions tend to burn my eyes and make my skin itchy, BUT this product doesn&#x27;t. It also doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling like most sunblocks do. The only downside is the fact that it can leave a white cast to your face, especially if you have tan skin, but it will go away once it absorbs into your skin. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I like this one the best thus far.</li>
            <li> Great price on a product that has become my foundation each morning. Why? It has healed some areas on my face that are there because of sun damage. Mr dermatologist recommended this product and I am now a believer!</li>
            <li> Ok.  Doesn&#x27;t leave too much white on skin.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product when I was living in Florida because I was spending so much time in the sun, either competing in or coaching track.  I have dark skin and for years I never used a sunscreen until a dermatologist recommended I start using a sunscreen.  I tried a few different brands, but I started breaking out with an itchy rash around the back of my neck, and between my forearms and biceps, and calves and hamstrings.  After trying the Nitrogen Sensitive Skin, I figure I must be allergic to sunscreens with Benzoophenones, Oxybenzone, Dioxybenzone, and Avobenzone, because Neutrogena Sensitive Skin contains none of these as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to a baseball game and sat in direct sunlight for about 3 hours and had no effects from the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunscreen.  Like others reviewing this product, I will say it does leave a white haze on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in really well.  But for me, I&#x27;ll take the haze rather than a sunburn or allergic reaction any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t find Neutrogena Sensitive Skin sunblock lotion, try Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby sunblock lotion, because they are essentially the same product.  The only difference is that Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Baby has added the inactive ingredients Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, and Potassium Sorbate.</li>
            <li> It does the job of protecting my skin from the rays, and not scented is a plus. However, it is NOT light weight. It feels really heavy when you layer it on.  It also makes me break out when I sweat on really hot humid days.  Not good, cause it probably is clogging my pores a lot. I do keep using still because my face does not get itchy from it like most other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> While I do like this product, I contacted Amazon about the misleading photo showing two bottles of the sunscreen. You only get one. I realize this is not a problem with the product but rather with the advertising but it just seems to me that we need to be accountable for the total purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a physical, not chemical, sunblock. I used a daily moisturizer with avobenzone for 10+ years, and seem to have developed a sensitivity to it. I switched to this sunblock for regular use, and so far it has not disappointed. It does leave a distinctly whitish cast to the skin and will accumulate in any hair. (I look pretty funny when I use it in the yard without shaving.) Overall I find it worth  it; I haven&#x27;t had any skin irritation or sunburns since switching to this product. It seems to be very moisture resistant, too; I have to wash my hands with lava soap after applying it.</li>
            <li> LOVE NEUTROGENA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fait, very sensitive skin.  Obviously I have to wear sunscreen, but most products make my skin hot, red, and sometimes itchy.  Not this!  It also wasn&#x27;t oily like a lot of sunscreens; once it absorbs you can barely tell you&#x27;re wearing it.  Even my husband doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I would only use this sunscreen on days that you aren&#x27;t planning to be out in the sun for a long time. I did a breast cancer walk using this sunscreen and still was burned even though i applied every 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance. This works for me and when I use it, I don&#x27;t burn my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is light and yet effective. I have not had any skin reactions to it.</li>
            <li> Actually it does make my face looks a bit of chalky....I&#x27;m Asian.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a &#x27;lotion&#x27;, it feels too thick.&lt;br /&gt;But still I&#x27;d like to say it&#x27;s a very good sunscreen especially for sensitive skin. I went fishing in the last few days, and I applied the sunscreen every 2.5 hours as usual. My skin keeps a healthy white look during the trip and feels moisturized all the day.</li>
            <li> It sits on your skin and makes you look like a white faced clown.</li>
            <li> Better than the face sunscreen by neutrogena. Not as smelly but isn&#x27;t as spreadable. Will run out soon for sure.</li>
            <li> good quality product that does what its supposed to do and as advertised.good quality product that does what it is supposed to do as advertised</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to fragrances.  This sunscreen has no fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily.  It does noticeably whiten my complexion.  It seems Neutrogena&#x27;s Sensitive Skin sunscreen is identical to their baby sunscreen.  I use both and will buy whichever is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I usually use Neutrogena Sport Face SPF 70+, but decided to give this one a try. It is very hard to blend in. I have to really rub it in to try to get rid of whiteness on my skin. My skin is dry and I do not use any other moisturizer before applying the sunscreen. This product makes my skin almost flaky. I will go back to Neutrogena Sport Face SPF 70+, which blends in much easier and works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Everything makes me break out or get dermatitis....fun when you hit a certain age :-/. I had been using Clinique face sunscreen for years, until it started to make my skin react this summer.  Tried a couple of other sensitive skin sunscreens...no luck.  Then tried this Neutrogena formula...worked like a charm.  No reactions, and good sun protection.</li>
            <li> The other brands give me chemical burns or a bumpy rash on my face...this one does not!! I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen keeps me from burning and doesnt feel greasy.  I do have to really wash with soap and water to get it off, but that means it works well in water!  It does give you a bit of whitish glow, I would rather that than allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, unscented, reasonably priced, and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Walmart. Had a Major allergic reaction to this product. If you have truly sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> I am very committed to protecting my face from sun damage and so use a sunscreen with a high SPF every day. I can&#x27;t say whether this truly is the \\&quot;#1 Dermatologist Recommended\\&quot; as it says on the label. But I can confirm that it DOES HAVE the highest level I&#x27;ve found of the ingredient MY OWN dermatologist recommended (i.e. titanium dioxide) for best protection. The product does leave a whitish cast to my skin because it needs a bit of time to get absorbed. But I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and will keep doing so.</li>
            <li> so far the lightest and easy to blend natural sunblock containing titanium dioxide</li>
            <li> While I liked that it does not contain harsh chemicals, it sweat off of me any my children within minutes.  We applied in the air-conditioned car before arriving at a park.  Within 10 minutes of walking in the heat, you could see it beading up and rolling off of us.  I had to buy something else to provide protection from the sun.  I can only assume it would be even more useless in the water.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this brand of sunscreen because it&#x27;s for sensitive skin. Other big name brands really seemed to burn my face so this seemed a safe bet: WRONG! This was even worse. My skin burned a little when putting it on but just in places on my face. I assumed my skin must be too dry and that&#x27;s why it was irritated. But I put it on the next day with the same result only 100 times worse: my skin felt like it was on fire. I carefully wiped it off with a cool cloth and immediately felt much relief. My face now looks very sunburned and is covered with white flakes similar to excema. What a disappointment to buy a quality name brand and expensive to boot only to find it burned worse than the less expensive brand. I&#x27;ve been reading up on this online and think I&#x27;ll try the zinc type protection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it anymore because it leaves a white film wherever I apply it. I look ghostly!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to do that but I don&#x27;t like it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; product caused an extensive rash from one of the &amp;#34;inactive&amp;#34; ingredients.  I am still combatting this rash with oral and topical medication.  Buyer beware!  Amazon&#x27;s return policy was excellent.</li>
            <li> works well. i use it on myself and my horse&#x27;s white nose</li>
            <li> I bought this product before a recent vacation, preferring the titanium and zinc oxide ingredients to the chemical ingredients found in so many other sunscreens. Unfortunately, I broke out in a red bumpy rash on my chest and neck the second day I used it, which worsened over the next day or so with continued use. I don&#x27;t have absolute proof that the lotion caused the rash, but it went away within days of switching away from the product to a lower SPF lotion containing a lower percentage of titanium oxide.</li>
            <li> We use this on my son, he has eczema and this is the only brand that we have found that does not make his skin hurt. Would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin, and living in sunny Arizona, I&#x27;ve gone through probably hundreds of dollars worth of sun products to find one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I saw this product in the store the other day and thought I&#x27;d try it, I love the texture, for me, it wasn&#x27;t too greasy and left a &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; finish when absorbed. It does leave a very slight white haze but I personally like that because my face has a reddish tint to it so the white haze masks that. A little definitely goes a long way, don&#x27;t glob it on or you will look like a ghost. I&#x27;ve always found that applying this 15-30 minutes before heading outside works the best. Also re-apply throughout the day. I&#x27;ve also read that the baby pure &amp; free is almost the exact product to this, so if you can&#x27;t find this in the stores look for that.</li>
            <li> I am one of the unfortunate people who developed a rash when using this product. Kind of disappointing given the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; forumla. I didn&#x27;t notice the breakout until the second day I applied it so I had a nice red rash going on my face for about 5 days which ironically looked like sunburn. I&#x27;ve tried many zinc/titanium oxide bases sunscreens and this is the first one I&#x27;ve had a bad reaction to. I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell of the product either and it&#x27;s not easy to get rid of the white cast it leaves on your skin although that&#x27;s fairly common with this type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Smells lighter and wipes on as well as the regular baby neutrogena free and clear. It does leave your child&#x27;s skin looking a bit pasty/chalk-like but I couldn&#x27;t care less about looks as long as my son is safe from the sun and isn&#x27;t using other brands which contain WAY more chemicals. FYI, no, this isn&#x27;t organic and chemical free but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than most sunscreens within the same price range and it&#x27;s consistency makes it waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love this Sunscreen. I have one in my car and I have one in my bathroom.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when applied. When I go running, as I&#x27;m a runner, I apply some on and it great.  Just right. Thank you Amazon and thank you Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve bought it twice, forgetting after the first time that this is the one that does not blend at all with the skin, so it leaves a heavy white cast. My husband is so frustrated that I purchased it a second time after it took him a good 15 minutes to get it off his face the first time he used it!!!</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, but be careful to apply sparingly. If you apply too much you&#x27;ll end up with a chalky white face.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena put the weird helioplex in its standard sunscreen, so I tried this.  It made me break out with pimples like I was 15 again.  Not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because skin cancer and wrinkle prevention are important to me! Plus, it had more sunscreen for a lower cost as compared to Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Face SPF 55+ sunscreen. Okay, well, I know it is SPF 60, but this does not go on smooth at all! My whole face is white after I put it on, and it is so thick that I described it to my boyfriend as \\&quot;putting on thick mayonnaise\\&quot; all over my face. This would probably be good for a long day at the beach, but I bought this for everyday wear and it does not look good.</li>
            <li> perfect for even the most sensitive</li>
            <li> There are few things less pleasant than putting sunblock on your face. It always smells icky, feels oily going on and attracts every speck of dust or salt or sand that is in the air leaving your face gritty and dirty. This smelled neutral went on smooth and was not sticky at all after application.</li>
            <li> The only sunblock my allergic skin can tolerate</li>
            <li> I have encountered allergic reactions due to over exposure to the sun. These reactions included but were not limited to: facial swelling, lip swelling with yellow fluid, and non-itchy bumps on arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I did not want these conditions to limit my traveling lifestyle. I booked a vacation one year and traveled to six Carribean islands including stops at Barbados, Puerto Rico, and Cozumel, Mexico. Barbados was brutal in terms of dry heat and sun, Puerto Rico was less intense, Cozumel was the median.&lt;br /&gt;I would apply this product once out of the shower in the morning and during breakfast I would take one Zyrtec 10mg. I will be out in the sun for six hours and reapply as needed (sweat, etc). My activities included parasailing, horseback riding, and water skiing. This product paired with my over-the-counter medicine protected me enough in the brutal Carribean weather. Although thick and matte, it is well worth it. I have not had any allergic relations to over exposure of the sun since I have been using this product, paired with Zyrtec 10mg of course. I would recommend it be used with and oral allergy medicine whether it be over-the-counter or prescribed. We usually forget that our internal body has a lot to do with how our external body turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.S.</li>
            <li> I must be the elusive sensitive male.  Skinwise, anyway.  Over the past 2 years I have developed a progressively worsening hypersensitivity - allergy to any skin block or sunscreen that uses ingredients that are absorbed by the skin.  I itch, I tear, and my skin tingles.  I tried ALL of the blockers and screens that were labeled &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ... none of them worked.  This is the only one that did.</li>
