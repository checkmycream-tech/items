            <li> Not sure if it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it 5 is I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet.</li>
            <li> am 77 and have had my wrinkles for a long time.  </li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got allergy after using them, rashes all around my face and also made my lips very dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure whether these items were left on the store shelf too long, as I have never purchased this brand before.</li>
            <li> There was not much product in the night cream</li>
            <li> I used it maybe 10 times and the container is empty .</li>
            <li> While you may save a few dollars, it does not come with a money back guarantee as if you were to buy from a brand partner like me.</li>
            <li> , the night cream was missing...had to get a partial refund</li>
            <li> I have photos of fake Nerium that has yellow dye mixed with Oil of Olay that turns skin yellow.</li>
            <li> and it beat out every other product relating to cellulite and tightening and firming of the thighs, waist, stomach and arms.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so well sealed and the bottle is dark</li>
            <li> The video says it could take awhile to see a dramatic change, but with what I have had so far, thats no problem.  </li>
            <li> Started using this product a few weeks ago, and I have to admit, I have noticed some change.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to fade a few age spots, and improve my complexion.  </li>
            <li> No huge difference</li>
            <li> No Different  to my skin, I used 2 set of day and Night, every single day for 2 Months, sorry , No Good,</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works.</li>
            <li> I feel like I threw away $100. :/</li>
            <li> The items arrived in new condition, however, the night cream looks off colored (a yellowish-brown) and has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> We know our products work, just buy from the company so you can get a refund if you are unhappy.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the product, it works, diminishing&#x27;s wrinkles.</li>
            <li> There was not much product in the night cream I used it maybe 10 times and the container is empty . The packaging is so well sealed and the bottle is dark so I can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s left . No problem with the day cream still using this.</li>
            <li> It is really giving me an even skin tone</li>
            <li> A month in ... No huge difference but I am willing to give it the 3 month challenge . I am young .Product new in boxes.</li>
            <li> I love the product, however the packaging is very deceiving.  Only 1 ounce.  Wish they had it in larger amount.</li>
            <li> product seems to be as advertised. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> love the product - thank you</li>
            <li> Did not find the product any different than a $10 drugstore face cream, in texture or smell. My skin broke out immediately after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!! It is just the best !!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be perfect for the fine lines on my forehead. However,  after 3 weeks of using it I noticed headaches all the time and swelling. The fine lines on my forehead really didn&#x27;t show a difference in my before and after either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price too!!</li>
            <li> ...got skin problems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gf said I look twenty years younger.....ummm...the tube this stuff comes in?...was beamed back from the 23rd century somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna open one up and see what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Techie in me craves satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Great product ... great customer service.</li>
            <li> Well first of all Nerium Representatives are not allowed to sell on Amazon, EBay or Craigslist or at garage Sales. So this person does not have Integrity to begin with. While you may save a few dollars, it does not come with a money back guarantee as if you were to buy from a brand partner like me. I have photos of fake Nerium that has yellow dye mixed with Oil of Olay that turns skin yellow. Or Noxzema or whatever unethical people use to lure you in. The REAL products work very well work and I would be happy to sell it to you legally and with a full 30 day money back guarantee. The products are all natural and plant based . Yes it has patented plant extract in them do work wonders on your skin, just make sure you get it from someone like me! Every company has a few bad apples in them but for the majority we are honest, loving, caring and sharing! We know our products work, just buy from the company so you can get a refund if you are unhappy. Our newest product is an Anti Cellulite cream called &amp;#34;FIRM&amp;#34; that just came out last week and it beat out every other product relating to cellulite and tightening and firming of the thighs, waist, stomach and arms. I have more information for you just go to my website and I will call you. Only I will have this info and I will call you. Hope this helps you all! Machellej.theneriumlook.com</li>

            <li> Luv this stuff... Good price</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and my friend loves it.</li>
            <li> Is really good my sister and me de verdad nos encanto a mi hermana se le ve su cara blanca</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of the night cream my mom gave me. I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently but when I learned more about it, I started using it on a regular basis. I am in my mid 30s and my pores are beginning to show more and I have discoloration on my forehead from sun damage. I truly feel these creams are improving both, especial since I use them daily now. Only reason I did not give it 5 is I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet.</li>
            <li> The items arrived in new condition, however, the night cream looks off colored (a yellowish-brown) and has a bad smell. I am not sure whether these items were left on the store shelf too long, as I have never purchased this brand before.</li>
            <li> it makes me look 10 years younger I have used so many products this one works. I get somments on how my skin looks all the time worth it.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a few weeks ago, and I have to admit, I have noticed some change.  My skin looks brighter, and the pores look smaller. The night cream feels so good as it seems to tighten the skin just before bed.  The day cream is a great moisturizer. I use nothing else, because the color looks more even. I gave a 5 star rating because I have been excited at what I have already experianced. The video says it could take awhile to see a dramatic change, but with what I have had so far, thats no problem.  I would recomend this product to anyone who cares what their skin look like.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the product.  I couldn&#x27;t get the cream to come out of the pump bottle no matter how many times I tried to use the pump.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a sample of the Nerium products and was pleased with the results, so I decided to try to products for a month and see if I liked the results. Really like the day moisturizer and is very light and not a heavy moisturizer. Yes, I would receommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles &amp; when shipped I received 2 night bottles. I&#x27;m going to order the day cream but I figured I would keep the 2 bottles because I have been happy with the tightening effects &amp; visibly reduced fine lines. I will continue to use this product, I have been very happy so far. The magic of the oleander, quite Amazing !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it can see the different working on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> This product is seen works perfect , thanks, I will buy again as soon as my cream finish , I love it</li>
            <li> My daughter an I have been using Nerium AD for a month now, and we can REALLY tell the difference in our skin.</li>
            <li> Nerium works! I love this stuff. My skin tone evens out and my fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li> For a week is good after 2 weeks I observed that I have rashes in my face and very itchy ..</li>
            <li> Product just as advertised.  Brand new in sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over two years and I have people compliment me every day about my skin.  All you do is cleanse your skin and use your day cream and at night cleanse your skin and use your night cream.  So simple, great of results.  Take a picture of your face close up when you start and take another in two months.  You and everyone else will notice a remarkable change.  I am 68 and loving my skin for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I have not seen very much improvement because I have not been using it very long. I am hoping that I will seen it in the near future.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend.  I have very dry skin.  I feel my skin has more moisture in it now.  Good Feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, but the night cream drys my skin. I had ti mix it with Benifits day cream to be comfortable. Not sure if it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I am nearly finished with 6 weeks.  It is a good face cream and good to have just one cream for night and one for day.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell it made any difference at all with lines and wrinkles, but it does leave your skin looking and feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I am 77 and have had my wrinkles for a long time.  It might be different for someone younger</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great seller! Would def buy again!</li>
            <li> Only received day cream and no night cream!!</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to use a simple system, totally natural and botanical product with great results. And being able to earn the Night cream for free through the customer loyalty program with a Brand Partner is the way to go. You can also get the Day cream for FREE FOR LIFE for a limited time with Brand Partners and you have a 30 day money back guaranty. Gotta love a company full of integrity and a product with incredible results!</li>
            <li> I received a sample from a friend and decided to purchase the whole product.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it make my skin feel, I can actually feel my face tighten with the Night&lt;br /&gt;Cream.  The day cream is wonderful, makes my skin feel soft and not dull.</li>
            <li> No Different  to my skin, I used 2 set of day and Night, every single day for 2 Months, sorry , No Good,</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works wonderful on mature skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got allergy after using them, rashes all around my face and also made my lips very dry and cracked.  Can I return them and get full refund?</li>
            <li> This is NOT a miracle cream. I was hoping to fade a few age spots, and improve my complexion.  The only change that I noticed with consistent use of this product was the breakout on my forehead. I feel like I threw away $100. :/</li>
            <li> what ever - another one</li>
            <li> I do like the products. Can&#x27;t tell yet how well it works.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my order. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Only the day cream came, the night cream was missing...had to get a partial refund</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Doesn&#x27;t lighten or even out complexion.  Didn&#x27;t reduce any wrinkles.  51 yrs old with decent skin, no noticeable difference in before and after shots.</li>
