            <li> I have curly, long dry hair</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this again and plan on trying some of the other products in the Kanechom line.</li>
            <li> First of all, This product was delivered on time HOWEVER, the packaging was sucks!</li>
            <li> and it did not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> The next week after deep conditioning, I had very little shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and very dry.</li>
            <li> Her hair is 4b/c all over but normally very dry.</li>
            <li> After my hair was dried and styled, I have not seen any hair on my comb during my daily styling routine.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair as moisturizing as expected.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and here&#x27;s the green container cracked open and</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it sans any other additives</li>
            <li> I tried adding this to Silicon Mix and really was not impressed, as Silicon Mix contains mineral oil and I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t mineral oil coating my hair during conditioning.</li>
            <li> I ended up using half of this product which I am not amaze.</li>
            <li> Tied it tight and did chores around the house for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Which is hard to find a conditioner thst can do that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a creamy and somewhat thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for thick hair.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased some expensive product lines i.e Beauty4Ashes, Salerm System, and none of them compare to this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also, some ingredients are questionable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great for fine, high porosity, curly hair. I&#x27;m really glad I found it.  Enter Kanchome, light weight, silicone rich conditioners that work great for a wash and go lifestyle, especially if you have high porosity, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly. There were no spilled contents. After one use I can tell that this product has made my hair stronger. After my hair was dried and styled, I have not seen any hair on my comb during my daily styling routine. It did not provide any magical straightening effect, but my hair did feel softer. It has a nice smell. I still had to use a leave in conditioner that helps with detangling after washing my hair. I also had to use a product for shine. Overall I believe this product is good for strengthening African American hair. I would order again. You receive a lot of product for your money.</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural and I love how soft and smooth the hair feels after deep conditioning with this product.  I plan on keeping this in my hair life.  However, I am not using this product as a solo.  I combine it with Silicon Mix after watching Youtube videos.</li>
            <li> i noticed a difference after i used this product in my hair. My hair is wavy and very dry. the kanechom aloe vera gave my hair moisture and strenth my waves are now soft and bouncy. Its great to use as a detangler , almost no hair came out. i love this treatment. It smells great.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deep conditioner I have ever used. I have natural hair. I have curls for days. (3c in the front 4a in the middle/crown and 4b/c in the back) This works soooo good. It always leaves my hair soft, shiny, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Got my sister to use it too. Her hair is 4b/c all over but normally very dry. She does not have the smoothest cuticle but this is magic on her hair. She stole mine and I had to buy another. Leaves our hair so soft and makes detangling curly/kinky textures easy.</li>
            <li> This is a protein treatment product, but it is so very moisturizing.  I mix this product with the silicon mix and they work so perfectly together.  I leave on for about 1 hour,  place a plastic bag on my head and sit under a heat cap, but it tells you to leave on for 30 minutes. I really, really love this product and once you rinse, your hair feels so soft.  I have finally found what works for my hair care routine.  It&#x27;s a creamy and somewhat thick consistency.  I LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT,</li>
            <li> This is awesome product.  I use it with the Silicon Mix Treatment.  I use about a couple of scoops for each product (mix) and apply &amp; rinse after 30 min or longer.  I don&#x27;t use it as a leave-in.  Hair is super soft.  My hair type is 4a/b/c.  Highly recommend as conditioner for the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!! I would buy this again, my hair is natural and my hair is in love, thank u!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The slip was very good! Didn&#x27;t need a lot! Serivce was prompt... Nice size jar.... good smell... I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product has a great smell to it for me it has enhanced my curls, I&#x27;m natural so my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> It leaves my 4c hair super soft and defined</li>
            <li> I was expecting great things about this product, but actually dries and breaks my hair, maybe is because my hair is not curly.</li>
            <li> I rate this product a 5. It is becoming more known the benefits of aloe vera in our diets, as hair &amp; skin treatments, so I decided to try this product for conditioning my very spiraly/coily hair. The conditioner after 1 minute, softened my hair, I could detangle it much easier and it glides onto your hair strands nicely. I love the smell (fresh/leafy) and you do get a lot of product. In the past I have purchased some expensive product lines i.e Beauty4Ashes, Salerm System, and none of them compare to this conditioner. The next week after deep conditioning, I had very little shedding and breakage. I also used a small amount as a leave in, works even better!! It came within 3 days of ordering, the package/wrapping was great, it came in a box nicely wrapped.</li>
            <li> was my first time using this particular conditioner and was surprised ..I LOVED IT!! the fragrance was great it moisturized well and quickly , left the hair super soft and manageable (shiny too) and easy to work with -would and have recommended to friends -love it!</li>
            <li> This is my new &amp;#34;Hair Crack&amp;#34;! I&#x27;ve been transitioning for nearly a year now and it has been difficult to get consistent hairstyles when much of my hair has two totally different textures. I ordered this after watching a YouTube video of another lady who was having the same hair woes as I was...dry, frizzy hair. The product arrived Thursday and I tried it this weekend. I shampooed as normal and used this as a deep conditioner. I put it in, put a processing cap and a plastic bag on. Tied it tight and did chores around the house for about an hour. When I rinsed it out my hair felt smooth, soft and silky like it was full of moisture. Will be doing this once a month to pamper my hair; especially since I live in Georgia. The heat here is hell on a girl&#x27;s hair. lol.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent, and the product did not hold up to what it said. I ended up giving the product to my mother, and she liked it. So, I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of preference and hair type. My hair is thick and her&#x27;s is fine. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky after applying this conditioner. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and in transition.  I love this conditioner.  It works well on my many texture that I currently have. Which is hard to find a conditioner thst can do that. I only use it along as a deep conditiner, most utube channel say mix with silicon but I choose not too. It softy my hair while helping to keep it detangling.</li>
            <li> I purhased this product to use along with another product called Silicon Mix. The combo was great and I think the conditioner is good by itself.</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair as moisturizing as expected. Also, some ingredients are questionable. Got it cheap so will use until gone.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this conditioner. I left it in overnight and my hair was super soft in the morning. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and this conditioner is to light for my hair type.  This would be great if you have medium textured hair.  I prefer the one with the shea butter.  That one is rich enough to use as a leave-in/styling cream.</li>
            <li> I love using this product on my hair. Whenever I deep condition with it, it leaves my hair very soft and moisturized. It is a really good size container and I have been able to use it for a very long time. I have a lot of hair, but a little goes a long way with this product. I think it makes a great leave-in as well. I will definitely order this again and plan on trying some of the other products in the Kanechom line.</li>
            <li> Very good deep conditioner. Made my hair very soft and has a mild scent. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> It was just okay. I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in the condition of my hair. I purchased this formula and the Kanechom Ceramidas formula and like the consistency of this formula better between the two. I tried adding this to Silicon Mix and really was not impressed, as Silicon Mix contains mineral oil and I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t mineral oil coating my hair during conditioning. I have curly hair and it needs moisture, not mineral oil. I continue to use it sans any other additives and I just don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about, as it is good but not great. If I catch this on sale, I will order again but I&#x27;m not likely to buy it again without the benefit of a sale. I will try another Kanechom formula to see if a different formula will suit me better.</li>
            <li> love love love my brazilian hair</li>
            <li> Really Good Deep Conditioner..!!! A Must Buy</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair turned out after using this product! My curls were amazing, soft and manageable. I loved it.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with another product &amp;#34;silicone mix conditioner&amp;#34;. I have heard so much about it and it did not live up to the hype. It did nothing for my hair. I really couldn&#x27;t tell any differences. I love mizani hydrafuse mixed with kerafuse makes my hair feel extremely soft and detangled.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. Moisturizing and provides tremendous softening to natural hair. I will never go without!!!&lt;br /&gt;Saturate hair, put on a baggie for 20 minutes rinse and begin your styling process.</li>
            <li> It came fast and I use it every week on my hair and my kids hair I&#x27;m going to try the whole line of products</li>
            <li> First of all, This product was delivered on time HOWEVER, the packaging was sucks! I opened the box and here&#x27;s the green container cracked open and stuff was over all the box. I ended up using half of this product which I am not amaze. I have curly, long dry hair and it did NOT see or feel to make my hair softer. It was ok product!! I must say the SILICONE MIX WAS AMAZING....</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, the content in the bottle is plenty. I have been using the product after I died my hair  and the sensation on my hair and scalp is pretty fresh, I feel like it really hidrate the hair. The only comment is that the design of the sticker in the bottle is different han the one I the picture.</li>
