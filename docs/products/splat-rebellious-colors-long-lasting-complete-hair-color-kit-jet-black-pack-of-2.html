            <li>so i ordered it off amazon i am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>and i am happy</li>
            <li>They have discontinued it in stores but am happy I can buy it through here.</li>
            <li>Awesome exact color as shown!</li>
            <li>so very happy that it was delivered fast</li>
            <li>Great product and amazing color , ive been looking for a jet black color and honestly this is the one!!</li>
            <li>Love this hair dye</li>
            <li>For this money you can buy way better stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try a stain to see if it would work better.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand, do what it says and more if you follow instructions, without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this product because it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already significantly faded.</li>
            <li>It is runny but, the product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It works really well I will buy more ...</li>
            <li>This is by far the best jet black hair coloring kit available.</li>
            <li>This is a one step coloring process because it is a direct dye and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair damaged like most chemical dyes.</li>
            <li>This dye is worth it.  </li>
            <li>That may just be a dyeing thing, but I don&#x27;t know since I rarely do it.</li>
            <li>I was excited for a hair dye that would last more than a month without fading.</li>
            <li>First of all, you would think they make it cream like for easier application..</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and it lasts a very long time (especially the longer you leave it in)!</li>
            <li>It is very effective and was easy to use with minimal mess, my hair was shiny afterward and manageable not drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful shade and the smell isn&#x27;t bad unlike most dyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the crimson, did a great job, now I want to go back black</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wipe up off of stuff easily like hair dye does, even if you think you&#x27;ve wiped it away fast enough....</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>you weren&#x27;t Flash fast :&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>but when it arrived,both boxes were soaking wet,torn,the splat oxide leaked so the whole box smelled like vineger and the packets</li>
            <li>Kind of runny tho and missing the applicator</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate mY sensitive scalp and is such a beautiful shiny black that doesn&#x27;t seem to fade!</li>
            <li>My hair never turns brown and stays a gorgeous shiny black for MONTHS, the only reason I ever have to re-stain my hair is because my roots grow out.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this line of hair color, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of color and the coverage of gray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for the last 15 years or so (mostly black) and this is by far the best black I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally blonde, so when my roots come in I tend to them right away.</li>
            <li>But it is super thin and drips easily</li>
            <li>This is the darkest black I have ever seen and is true to the box advertisment.</li>
            <li>If you want jet black hair that&#x27;s exactly what you get!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I felt like I shed too many hairs in the process of dyeing.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a long lasting color!</li>

            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a long lasting color!</li>
            <li> It is not a permanent dye, however the results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It has been two weeks and the black color has completely faded out.</li>
            <li> Application was easy but a little messy since it&#x27;s a little on the watery side.</li>
            <li> This color also last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Only black product that really turns the hair black!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my roots as well as the other dyes in the amount of time I have traditionally taken.</li>
            <li> , I have natural black hair with few grey popping out,  after holding for 1.5 hr...</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands that advertise jet black results, this dye actually leaves your hair in the deepest black shade possible.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like it would be even darker than the other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is a stain so be careful!</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble with traditional black dyes washing out and turning brown after about a month, sometimes less.</li>
            <li> it came a bit late and that caused me to worry cuz i have had sellers rip me off before used it next day</li>
            <li> Made it soo convenient because I usually buy 2 boxes anyway for my long hair</li>
            <li> I use jet black dye on my hair.</li>
            <li> And unlike manic panic&#x27;s raven hair dye, your hair will not turn green when it fades.</li>
            <li> and it is still VERY BLACK.</li>
            <li> Like others have said it was a bit difficult to get the cream into the bottle but not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Leave this on for at least an hour if you want it to be permanent.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fade to weird colors because it doesn&#x27;t have any other color base, just black.</li>
            <li> wrong, color mixture is close to water consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> Soon disappointed :(</li>

            <li> It works really well I will buy more ... Kind of runny tho and missing the applicator</li>
            <li> I like this dye, but I don&#x27;t think I will make it a regular of mine. I use jet black dye on my hair. I&#x27;m naturally blonde, so when my roots come in I tend to them right away. I was attracted to this product because it&#x27;s cruelty free and it seemed like it would be even darker than the other colors I&#x27;ve used. It didn&#x27;t cover my roots as well as the other dyes in the amount of time I have traditionally taken. This color probably would have looked similar, I just would have had to leave it on longer.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dye this is the best color but the store never have it&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend product&lt;br /&gt;And so very happy that it was delivered fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful shade and the smell isn&#x27;t bad unlike most dyes. But it is super thin and drips easily and it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I dyed my hair about three weeks ago and it&#x27;s already significantly faded. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this line of hair color, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of color and the coverage of gray. It is very effective and was easy to use with minimal mess, my hair was shiny afterward and manageable not drying. I recommend.</li>
            <li> so i ordered it off amazon i am happy with my purchase it came a bit late and that caused me to worry cuz i have had sellers rip me off before used it next day and i am happy</li>
            <li> First of all, you would think they make it cream like for easier application..wrong, color mixture is close to water consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have natural black hair with few grey popping out,  after holding for 1.5 hr... it still there.  Oh and they dont include conditioner. For this money you can buy way better stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought this was semi permanent but turns out it&#x27;s permanent. I can&#x27;t use it, oh well, and I didn&#x27;t know this was a 2 pack either until it arrived.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this color!! This is the darkest black I have ever seen and is true to the box advertisment. This is a one step coloring process because it is a direct dye and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair damaged like most chemical dyes. It doesn&#x27;t fade to weird colors because it doesn&#x27;t have any other color base, just black. It&#x27;s been 2 months since I have used this color and it is still VERY BLACK. I also loved the packaging set of 2!! Made it soo convenient because I usually buy 2 boxes anyway for my long hair so I am very happy with this product. They have discontinued it in stores but am happy I can buy it through here. Will definitely be buying again!! I recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I love this product they don&#x27;t test on animals. And unlike manic panic&#x27;s raven hair dye, your hair will not turn green when it fades. haha</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble with traditional black dyes washing out and turning brown after about a month, sometimes less. I figured I&#x27;d try a stain to see if it would work better.  IO M G did it ever! My hair never turns brown and stays a gorgeous shiny black for MONTHS, the only reason I ever have to re-stain my hair is because my roots grow out. The longest I&#x27;ve gone was 3 months because I couldn&#x27;t find the product locally, Amazon to the rescue. The consistency is runny but that&#x27;s actually beneficial because it&#x27;s easier to saturate your hair. Leave this on for at least an hour if you want it to be permanent.  It won&#x27;t fry your hair, it&#x27;s not like traditional hair dye. This is a stain so be careful! It doesn&#x27;t wipe up off of stuff easily like hair dye does, even if you think you&#x27;ve wiped it away fast enough....you weren&#x27;t Flash fast :&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Only black product that really turns the hair black!</li>
            <li> Awesome exact color as shown!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best jet black hair coloring kit available. Unlike other brands that advertise jet black results, this dye actually leaves your hair in the deepest black shade possible. It is not a permanent dye, however the results are long lasting. I have used it for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> Great product! 2 year user, now if only the luscious raspberry came in a pack of 2 for this price.</li>
            <li> Love this brand, do what it says and more if you follow instructions, without damaging your hair. I&#x27;ve tried the crimson, did a great job, now I want to go back black so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used so I thought I would order a pack of two but when it arrived,both boxes were soaking wet,torn,the splat oxide leaked so the whole box smelled like vineger and the packets were torn.never ordering from here again</li>
