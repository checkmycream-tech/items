            <li>Thank you for such an effective product!</li>
            <li>I started feeling a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>My fine lines appear more diminished and there is a more healthy radiant glow to my chest area, instead of the dry leather appearance.  </li>
            <li>And best of all, my skin feels soft and younger than ever before.  </li>
            <li>rejuvenates the look and feel of my skin right away!</li>
            <li>rejuvenates the look and feel of my skin right away!</li>
            <li>Will keep using it, many thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>From the reviews, people are saying you can literally see the changes in your skin right away and the before and after photos are pretty convincing.</li>
            <li>This cream is made in Canada in Certified Facilities and is completely cruelty free, paraben free, and non-toxic!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>The look of the bottle is modern and clean!</li>
            <li>But your neck is one of the first places to show signs of aging, so it needs some love too…lots of love actually.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well, to my surprise!</li>
            <li>My Mother-in-Law knows of my obsession and gifted me a bottle of this, Advanced neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream, which just might be the only Anaiti product I did not already have!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, with a subtle citrusy smell, like the others - this one a touch more in the lemon realm with an undercurrent I cannot identify.</li>

            <li>ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li>My skin started showing signs of aging and sun spots and it was both embarrassing and a reminder of how old I am getting :)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from all of the instant gratification of this cream, it&#x27;s showing some really nice results after just a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li>basically, I use a lot of Anaiti products, and feel they work best when used with each other daily!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t ever really paid much attention to my skin, but I noticed a couple of months ago that all those afternoons on the golf course and basketball court had given me fine lines on my neck.</li>

            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but kinda “taut” right after using it.</li>
            <li>And, the left side of my neck more closely matches the right side.</li>

            <li> , it goes on light</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an effective product!</li>
            <li> I started feeling a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> My fine lines appear more diminished and there is a more healthy radiant glow to my chest area, instead of the dry leather appearance.  </li>
            <li> And best of all, my skin feels soft and younger than ever before.  </li>
            <li> rejuvenates the look and feel of my skin right away!</li>
            <li> rejuvenates the look and feel of my skin right away!</li>
            <li> Will keep using it, many thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, people are saying you can literally see the changes in your skin right away and the before and after photos are pretty convincing.</li>
            <li> This cream is made in Canada in Certified Facilities and is completely cruelty free, paraben free, and non-toxic!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> The look of the bottle is modern and clean!</li>
            <li> But your neck is one of the first places to show signs of aging, so it needs some love too…lots of love actually.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well, to my surprise!</li>
            <li> My Mother-in-Law knows of my obsession and gifted me a bottle of this, Advanced neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream, which just might be the only Anaiti product I did not already have!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, with a subtle citrusy smell, like the others - this one a touch more in the lemon realm with an undercurrent I cannot identify.</li>
            <li> ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li> ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li> My skin started showing signs of aging and sun spots and it was both embarrassing and a reminder of how old I am getting :)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from all of the instant gratification of this cream, it&#x27;s showing some really nice results after just a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li> basically, I use a lot of Anaiti products, and feel they work best when used with each other daily!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever really paid much attention to my skin, but I noticed a couple of months ago that all those afternoons on the golf course and basketball court had given me fine lines on my neck.</li>
            <li> My neck looked more firm, and my skin was tightened, making it look more</li>
            <li> My neck looked more firm, and my skin was tightened, making it look more</li>
            <li> I’ve barely started applying lotion to my neck and chest areas in the last couple of years because I honestly didn’t realize how important it was before that.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but kinda “taut” right after using it.</li>
            <li> And, the left side of my neck more closely matches the right side.</li>
            <li> My neck and chest skin is now lifted, smoother, and has a natural glow to it!&lt;br /&gt;-My fine lines and wrinkles have been reduced</li>

            <li> Anaiti has put years of research into the formula of this Neck and Decollete Cream, which includes two main ingredients: Matrixyl, and SesaFlashTM!</li>

            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> But so far, I really like what I&#x27;m seeing and</li>
            <li> use this everyday and feel confident that it’s protecting my skin.</li>

            <li> My fair skin has had a lot of sun exposure, so my chest was starting to look a little tough and leathery before I started using the cream.</li>
            <li> already got dark spots, lines and wrinkles, but the sagging skin on my neck is a real worry.</li>
            <li> It worked very fast and I saw results in only a few days.</li>
            <li> My problem was how little there was (2 oz) in that large (misleading) dispenser.  </li>

            <li> The sun and wind has damaged his skin over the years and he has tried all kinds of creams and oils had it just leaves his skin oily, but still dry, red,  and scaly.  </li>

            <li> Some other products I have used in the past have caused that &#x60;prickly&#x27; sensation when it is first applied, not so with this one.</li>

            <li> This 2 fl oz pump bottle will last me a while since a little goes</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wait to get dressed after I apply it, and since it only takes a little dab to cover my chest and neck</li>
            <li> After just a few months, what was once rough, limp and uneven skin is now so much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and already the rough patches are gone, the redness is decreasing, and the skin tone is evening out.  </li>
            <li> In my teens and twenties I spent a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Plus, hours upon hours spent in the car commuting</li>
            <li> Not very pretty!</li>
            <li> Small lines have appeared in my cleavage and my neck is looking older than the years I claim - or at least it was.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day (instead of recommended twice a day) and ran out in less than a month.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkle lines have gotten finer and less visible.  </li>
            <li> The cream has made my chest skin less leathery and almost supple</li>
            <li> skin is pale and ruddy, bordering on extremely sensitive with diagnosed Rosacea - finding skin care products that work for me, and work for my skin is an expensive effort, one that has caused me countless problems in the past.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for about a month now, and use it in my everyday beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> It’s supposed to tighten and firm the skin and provide anti-aging results.</li>
            <li> You can use it everyday, in either the morning or at night, and it can be worn under serum or makeup.</li>
            <li> and it just reminds me that I need to apply lotion to these areas everyday.</li>
            <li> Of course, my skin is still a little looser in places than it was in my 30s, but at least it&#x27;s not as wrinkled or as blotchy as it was before.</li>
            <li> His skin is just so much healthier and saved him a trip to the doctor because he was worried he had a skin condition that was making him react so badly to shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is thick and creamy, which makes it glide over skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is thick and creamy, which makes it glide over skin</li>
            <li> It was getting so bad he was starting not to shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid to use it on my face as it seems to be specifically for neck and chest</li>
            <li> that become severely worse every time he shaves.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I noticed that wrinkles significantly decreased and started disappearing.</li>
            <li> Then I have the red blotches that just look terrible and give my skin that very uneven tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not perfect yet -- after decades of sun exposure, that might never happen, I guess.</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:62db01dce442485ed3d72deac1148668]]I have had dry skin for many years now. Tried lots of products too but nothing compares to the Neck and Decollete Cream by Anaiti. It worked very fast and I saw results in only a few days. A great byproduct is that my skin on my neck is smoother and I am noticing that my wrinkles are disappearing!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any outstanding results.  I&#x27;ll try another product next time.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:18702028ba0d49bc920bed46e64abf38]]Great product that worked amazingly well! made my neck area super smooth and wrinkle-free. also easy to use and did not irritate my skin at all. i love the pump applicator because it is super simple to use and also the packaging looks great in my bathroom. overall, difficult to find this type of product and i am so happy that i found it because it really works!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:617ad98182073f23fc446b68b7476c12]]Most of my skin care products are now Anaiti products - and I love every one of them. My Mother-in-Law knows of my obsession and gifted me a bottle of this, Advanced neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream, which just might be the only Anaiti product I did not already have! Like almost everything else, Anaiti has made another winner.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pale and ruddy, bordering on extremely sensitive with diagnosed Rosacea - finding skin care products that work for me, and work for my skin is an expensive effort, one that has caused me countless problems in the past. When I first came across this line, I was hesitant, but the reviews were good, so I dove in and bought two products. Since then I have invested much more and my skin is thankful.&lt;br /&gt;The Neck and the D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area and the first ones to show the signs of aging. We often overlook them when applying sunscreen and wear low cut shirts to enhance our appearance, all the while exposing ourselves to harmful rays and free radicals. I know my own d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; was red and aged, it was obviously more sun damaged than parts of my skin that are generally covered. Small lines have appeared in my cleavage and my neck is looking older than the years I claim - or at least it was. Now, it is smoothing out - and while not 100% better than it was, it is 100% better for my age.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is thick and smooth, it goes on easy and absorbs quickly. Some other products I have used in the past have caused that &#x60;prickly&#x27; sensation when it is first applied, not so with this one. I worried about that for a week or so, concerned that the lack of sensation indicated a lack of effectiveness - but I needn&#x27;t have worried. The redness across my chest is lighting and the rough feel of my skin is notably changing. The smell is pleasant, with a subtle citrusy smell, like the others - this one a touch more in the lemon realm with an undercurrent I cannot identify. I can wear this alone or under makeup if I choose.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love it.in all, I love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Used it for over a month and noticed no difference at all. I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s an ok skin cream, but did nothing for wrinkles or firming.</li>
            <li> I just love Anaiti Neck Firming Cream!  It is an amazing product and does just what it says it will do.  It comes in a nice pump bottle so you have great control of the amount of product needed.  It is a thick and creamy consistency that goes on smooth that easily absorbs well.  It just takes a dab to cover your neck and decollete area.  The scent is a citrus and so refreshing and not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;he skin on my neck and chest after years of sun has a leathery, dry appearance and that makes the fine lines very noticeable.  Then I have the red blotches that just look terrible and give my skin that very uneven tone.  I started using this product and already the rough patches are gone, the redness is decreasing, and the skin tone is evening out.  My fine lines appear more diminished and there is a more healthy radiant glow to my chest area, instead of the dry leather appearance.  I am so amazed how fast it is working on my skin.  I cannot wait as I have just started using the cream and I know it is just going to get better with time.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been having problems with his neck area also when shaving.  He has been getting red, scaly patches on his neck that become severely worse every time he shaves. The sun and wind has damaged his skin over the years and he has tried all kinds of creams and oils had it just leaves his skin oily, but still dry, red,  and scaly.  I told him to try this cream and his results are also amazing.  He has not more dry flakes or the bright red patches on his neck after a few uses.  When he shaves the appearance of red irritated skin from the razor is completely gone.  It was getting so bad he was starting not to shave.  His skin is just so much healthier and saved him a trip to the doctor because he was worried he had a skin condition that was making him react so badly to shaving.  I am so happy he is not longer embarrassed about showing his neck area and trying to hide it under his beard stubble anymore.

            <li> So pleased with this neck firming and tightening cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream was a gift from a friend and I was more than happy to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I already got dark spots, lines and wrinkles, but the sagging skin on my neck is a real worry. I tried out Advanced Neck and Décolleté Cream, and I have never been so pleased. I just put it on in the morning under make up and get on with my day. After just a few months, what was once rough, limp and uneven skin is now so much smoother and firmer. I really didn&#x27;t believe such a transformation was possible without some really expensive dermatologist skin care product. Of course, my skin is still a little looser in places than it was in my 30s, but at least it&#x27;s not as wrinkled or as blotchy as it was before. And, now I can go to my exercise class and the club in v-neck shirts without feeling self-conscious.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7925e5be0eb78c3d2c92cb26577ca2bb]] I love this yummy cream for my decollete. It&#x27;s all natural and feels great!</li>
            <li> The product does have a pleasant smell and gives the skin a very nice glow. I still feel as though I have the turkey neck effect, but not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have had wonderful results with this line products I noticed that my neck is tighter and firmer than before and the chest area is looking fantastic i have been getting compliments on my overall skin appearance i received this product free for by bias opinion</li>
            <li> Takes time but it works</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free for review and I love this stuff! really helped tone my skin and give me a lift appearance</li>
            <li> I work hard to keep myself fit and healthy. I work out, I stay active and I watch what I eat most of the time. I hadn&#x27;t ever really paid much attention to my skin, but I noticed a couple of months ago that all those afternoons on the golf course and basketball court had given me fine lines on my neck. I found this anti-aging cream online, and it&#x27;s pretty amazing. Already, my skin seems tighter and the lines are much fainter. I would definitely recommend it to other men who want to keep wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> There are certain areas of my body that don’t get a lot of lotion love, and unfortunately, my neck is one of them. I’ve barely started applying lotion to my neck and chest areas in the last couple of years because I honestly didn’t realize how important it was before that. But your neck is one of the first places to show signs of aging, so it needs some love too…lots of love actually. This has some great ingredients, like Matrixyl and Sesaflash, which are really proven to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this everyday and feel confident that it’s protecting my skin. But for men and women who already have signs of aging on their skin, this can provide even better results. It’s supposed to tighten and firm the skin and provide anti-aging results. From the reviews, people are saying you can literally see the changes in your skin right away and the before and after photos are pretty convincing. I like using it and will get my mom to try it too so that I can see how she feels about it. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, but kinda “taut” right after using it. It’s really hydrating, not drying at all. It smells nice, a little lemony or citrusy, but the smell doesn’t last long. You can use it everyday, in either the morning or at night, and it can be worn under serum or makeup. Great stuff, no complaints at all and it just reminds me that I need to apply lotion to these areas everyday.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to do what it says.  I will continue to use it.  It was received on time.</li>
            <li> It works great as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well.  My problem was how little there was (2 oz) in that large (misleading) dispenser.  I used it once a day (instead of recommended twice a day) and ran out in less than a month.  Since I&#x27;ve never really used any other product for neck/chest, I will try others and see if this is really any better.</li>
            <li> In my teens and twenties I spent a lot of time in the sun.  What was great then, is not so great now!  My skin started showing signs of aging and sun spots and it was both embarrassing and a reminder of how old I am getting :)  I began seeing a dermatologist years ago but it was cost prohibitive and I didn&#x27;t like the idea of using chemicals to try to lighten the spots.  I&#x27;ve now been using Anaiti&#x27;s products, and every time I look in the mirror I can SEE it working.  The sun spots are nearly gone.  Wrinkle lines have gotten finer and less visible.  And best of all, my skin feels soft and younger than ever before.  It&#x27;s nice to feel attractive once again, and I have Anaiti to thank for it :)</li>
            <li> I looked for a dermatologist recommended skin care product to help my sagging neck skin and found Anaiti. A few weeks later I noticed a big difference. The wrinkles from my neck and chest are nearly gone. Thank you for such an effective product!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well, to my surprise! I like the smell, it goes on light and it&#x27;s not greasy at all AND the most important thing for me, it doesn&#x27;t cause pimples on my chest or neck. I&#x27;m a little afraid to use it on my face as it seems to be specifically for neck and chest but I sure wish the had a cream like this specifically for the face!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! Highly recommend it! My since is looking so much more healthier! Definitely ordering again. You should, too.</li>
            <li> I was advised to use this product by a friend because my skin is naturally very dry and she claimed that this cream could help me. I decided to give it a go and was pleasantly surprised. The product is really good - 100% corresponds with the description and works perfectly well. After just a couple of uses I started feeling a significant improvement. My skin got smoother and energised. Furthermore, I noticed that wrinkles significantly decreased and started disappearing. Will keep using it, many thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this neck and decollete cream! It&#x27;s got a lightweight, smooth feel and a super-pleasant aroma (at first it smells a little lemon-y to me, and then it has a hint of peppermint or something like it). It dries quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait to get dressed after I apply it, and since it only takes a little dab to cover my chest and neck, I think it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all of the instant gratification of this cream, it&#x27;s showing some really nice results after just a couple of weeks of use. My fair skin has had a lot of sun exposure, so my chest was starting to look a little tough and leathery before I started using the cream. Plus, hours upon hours spent in the car commuting made the left side of my neck look rough and red compared to the right side of my neck. Not very pretty! The cream has made my chest skin less leathery and almost supple (I&#x27;m giving it a couple of more weeks for supple to happen, then I&#x27;m shooting for dewy!). And, the left side of my neck more closely matches the right side. It&#x27;s still not perfect yet -- after decades of sun exposure, that might never happen, I guess. But so far, I really like what I&#x27;m seeing and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s probably not intended for this, but I usually wipe whatever of the cream&#x27;s left on my hand onto my left forearm which is also pretty sun-damaged. With not very consistent use, my forearm is looking a bit more evenly toned, which makes me really happy and not quite so self-conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this cream again, and I plan to order some as Christmas presents for my sisters, mom and close friends.</li>
