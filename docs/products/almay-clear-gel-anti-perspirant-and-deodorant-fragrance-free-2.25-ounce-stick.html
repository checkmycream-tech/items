            <li>Price seems fair...</li>
            <li>In my case, I bought it chiefly because of the good reviews and the listing as hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Good protection without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a 220 pound athlete, with my fair share of armpit hair.</li>
            <li>Ever since Mitchum changed their formula I&#x27;ve been searching for a good gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll probably take me awhile to go thru 6 sticks, but this was the best deal available on amazon.</li>
            <li>great, love it, very pleased, shipped on time</li>
            <li>And I am so happy to be able to buy it though Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My husband is allergic to many anti-perspirants and this is great.</li>
            <li>The world will love you!</li>
            <li>I hope the never stop making this because I love it!</li>
            <li>a good citizen, GO FRAGRANCE FREE!</li>
            <li>Arrived in nice packaging.</li>
            <li>as always gentile but effective</li>
            <li>I think they own it..</li>
            <li>Really, the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>For most people I believe it should prove to be a good product.</li>
            <li>I bough a 6 pack of this and no itching, no rashes no allergic reactions of any kind.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, it doesn&#x27;t irritate me but wish to have more than 2.25OZ.  </li>
            <li>It is unscented and effective.</li>
            <li>Best deodorant for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Thanks very good product recommended 100%</li>
            <li>This item is perfect for those of us who are sensitive to scented products.  </li>
            <li>For Sensitive skin it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>Purchased this and have been very happy so far.</li>
            <li>Sure is also Amazing</li>
            <li>Good product, salicylate free for those with fibromyalgia on the guai protocol</li>
            <li>Almay Clear Gel, anti-perspirant and deodorant is effective, scent-free, easy to apply, and best of all non-animal tested.</li>
            <li>So I would have to say, the price I paid for 6 was good, but for only 5 to work, not so good!</li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly and arrived in good order.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to get it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love Almay deodorant but my drug store can&#x27;t keep it on the shelf.</li>
            <li>Fresh\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sexy</li>
            <li>Deodorant of champions.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Was so glad when I found this here and</li>
            <li>applies better than before, more evenly.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite way to shop.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and Almay is the one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it more than one star because it works; however this is not the deodorant pictured.  </li>
            <li>These are switch products with many customers vying for a deodorant that works and does not itch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many problems with deodorants.  </li>
            <li>improved dispenser on top</li>
            <li>Used to use the solid and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>For many people, it is aluminum that leads to the allergic reactions with antiperspirants and this has proven to be the situation with me.</li>
            <li>This deodorant was just ok.</li>
            <li>it did its job temporarily but had too many consequences.</li>
            <li>The most important review I could give Almay is that it works!  </li>
            <li>Glad I could get it here.  </li>
            <li>Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s very effective and yet gentle on under arm skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it, great price, no mess and does the job.</li>
            <li>A great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin....works great for me.</li>
            <li>joking aside, this stuff is great for my sensitive skin, stops body odor, and reduces sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And equally importantly, it keeps the sweat smell away.  :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to buy it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is not that easy for me to find, so</li>
            <li>This product has a definate and strong menthol fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The Almay product itself works fine.  </li>
            <li>It does work fine as an anit-perspirant and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product that I have found so far for sensitive skin and it works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon was the only place I could find this deodorant readily available, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I think it is stain free on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>How cheap can they get?</li>
            <li>I need something fragrance free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>This scentless allergy free formulation works well in my experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to try a fragrance free product but have found the lack of scent a fantastic improvement.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance free, therefore it does not clash my my lotions or perfumes.  </li>
            <li>The stuff works and is fragrance free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin, this is a good anti-perspirant to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and love this product!</li>
            <li>Excellent product especially for persons with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>What is pictured is the original formula/packaging which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but well worth the hunt!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the scented brand, but found that the scent bothered my nose a bit.</li>
            <li>original review</li>
            <li>It works fine, dries faster, and the tube lasts much longer, compared to dispensing more.</li>
            <li>With so many holes, it is too easy to administer more gel than necessary.</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it in bulk at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I have delicate skin and Almay works wonderful for me.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this very affordable Almay version.</li>
            <li>This product works great - the only anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve found that does not cause an allergic reaction AND it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, there are more holes at the top where the product comes out, but they extend too close to the edge so when the cap is replaced it inevitably pushes product over the side.</li>
            <li>Very mild and gentle.</li>
            <li>This one finally solved the problem, plus I don&#x27;t have any more deodorant stains on my clothes!  </li>
            <li>I recently learned that I am allergic to most fragrances (and basically all deoderants) and am so lucky to have discovered this product!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most deodorants I wore before.</li>
            <li>girls love me because i am sensitive.</li>
            <li>My husband must have the most sensitive skin on the planet.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer available in my local pharmacy, so I&#x27;m really glad Amazon helps me continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Nothing to interfere with body spray or cologne if I choose to use those things and no artificial scent or body odor if not.</li>
            <li>The only kind i can use.</li>
            <li>Almay is a bit pricey, however well worth it...</li>
            <li>Never found anything better for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Try Almay gel deodorant and you will not have to run around looking for the right one for you.</li>
            <li>Even though the weight might be right, one evaluates the amount by looking at a container.</li>
            <li>And the price is right too.</li>
            <li>Good price and less chemicals.</li>
            <li>My Physician recommended this fragrance fee, dye free product for the family&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Almay keeps me fresh and dry all day, which is very important as I am on the move quite a bit a work, and in close proximity with patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad that Amazon carries this as my local stores do not.</li>
            <li>It is the only hypo-allergenic deodorant I can find (although I&#x27;m sure there must be others.)</li>
            <li>..discovered the Almay Solid and used it for so many years, I cannot even remember.</li>
            <li>that worked pretty well, but it cost about $7 for each deodorant container; it was quite</li>
            <li>last thing I love about this product is the price.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I have been able to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it was because it was on sale.</li>
            <li>Almay has never failed.  </li>
            <li>Love the clear gel, no mess.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a number of years and still feel 100% positive about it.</li>
            <li>I like unscented deoderant, and this is great for sensitive skin and has a very low \\&quot;toxicity\\&quot; rating on the EWG&#x27;s skin deep website.</li>
            <li>While the scent isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; it is subtle and fresh and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me want to wash my armpits after a couple hours of wear.</li>
            <li>Unlike my previous antiperspirant, the Almay does not leave any underarm stains and seems reasonably effective as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I always ordered or bought a large number of them at a time..</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and fresh for 24 hours and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect but very good.</li>
            <li>Truly fragrance free - have used it forever and have a hard time finding it in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>you know if the solid is available I would really appreciate it.</li>
            <li>In this almay product I found a deodorant that is both reliable and gentle to my skin as well.</li>
            <li>, I have not broken out since I started using Almay.</li>
            <li>And if you do find it, it&#x27;s twice as much.</li>
            <li>Amazon saves me so much gas not having to run to the store to buy them one at a time.</li>
            <li>It does protect me during the whole day.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>they discontinued Almay Solid, fragrance free, hypoallergenic antiperspirant...</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, I started seeing..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently decided to go fragrance and dye free, which is why I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li>It feels sticky and itchy and it doesn&#x27;t work like the solid fragrance free Almay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for months, and really like it.</li>
            <li>He has no issue using it and it works really well.</li>
            <li>it isnt always available in local CVS and Walgreens...</li>
            <li>Thanks Almay for your products.</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And deoderants don&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>This is now a very hard-to-find product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having it.</li>
            <li>The only deodorant that not only keeps me smelling nice but doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of other anti-perspirants and travel a LOT in warm clients so need protection I can trust....</li>
            <li>so it comes out nice and even out of lots of small holes instead of three large holes.  </li>
            <li>(but the same is true of many other deodorants)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Solid bar is longer lasting but this should cover most of the day.</li>
            <li>He has tried every fragrance-free hypoallergenic deodorant on the market and most make him itch so much he scratches himself raw.</li>
            <li>Almay Clear Gel, Anti- Perspirant &amp; Deodorant really works and all day.</li>
            <li>any rate, the Almay Sensitive Skin deodorant (fragrance free clear gel) has finally provided relief for my husband.</li>
            <li>My 88-year old mother (who is very allergic and very sensitive to perfumed products) also uses this product, with no problems.</li>
            <li>is not as effective in controlling pesrpiration and dispenses from 50 little holes which decreases the overall yield substantially.</li>
            <li>I received Almays &#x27;New and Improved&#x27; product  </li>
            <li>I have found my new anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended if you have developed sensitivity to other products</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I sweat a lot, and this brand works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I use Almay because I have very, very sensitive underarms.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin under my arms.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to people of all shapes and sizes, with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>&quot; then it would have warranted a higher rating simply as an antiperspirant, but I purchased it based on their implication that it would serve the purposes of people allergic to antiperspirants and in my case, this did not prove to be the case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first one that not only worked, but doesn&#x27;t make my underarms break</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as clinical strength, but it is considerably cheaper and it works better than other regular strength deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not only has this completely eliminated the irritation I was experiencing with other aluminum formulations, it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>After a lot of trial and error research I found that this was the only deodorant product that I could use that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, while at the same time being just as effective as any other quality deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using the old stuff for years but this new version seems to &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; from the bottle. . .</li>
            <li>One can only hope they will go back to the old style top in the near future.  </li>
            <li>With the new design, this product is becoming less affordable and I prefer the multiple slit design it used to have.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon because it is hard to find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I am glad I can buy it in bulk on amazon as it is hard to find in North Alabama.</li>
            <li>Once I found Almay Clear Gel, I have never used anything else.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is for&lt;br /&gt;you.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years, without issue or complaint.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>How I really, really wish that Almay still made the solid stick deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve become sensitive to it and started to get breakouts under my arms.</li>
            <li>My wife is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have always been allergic to metals including the aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex that&#x27;s in nearly all anti-perspirants, even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones and all of them</li>
            <li>or it just sweats away completely.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they changed the formula, but now this stuff is complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can wear most deodorants, but this is the only antiperspirant that I can wear everyday.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few deoderants I can use without getting significant underarm irritation.</li>
            <li>When you consider the air space both above and below the actual product, this container is only 1/2 full.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation is that if you tend to allergic reactions with antiperspirants, then first try just one to test out before placing larger orders.</li>
            <li>This new edition of the product is on the opposite end of the goodness scale from the old edition.  </li>
            <li>This is the new \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; one that must have a different formula.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I am on my new batch of bottles and my only complaint is that I am not fond of the new design with the multiple holes on top.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to fragrances and have used almay unscented deodorants in the past and they were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>While the effectiveness might vary for each individual, it certainly works for this fair-haired, light-skinned individual.  </li>
            <li>A little bit pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>However, webmd stated clearly that theses 4 keys will cause itchy and irritation such as: aluminum, paraben, alcohol and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This one, however, is fast drying and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>We found one that worked (Gillette Clinical - fragrance-free - for Sensitive Skin) but now that appears to have been discontinued, and until we found this Almay product he had gone back to not wearing deodorant, and risking smelling sweaty, because he just can&#x27;t stand the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant that he likes.</li>
            <li>Several years ago I developed a sensitivity to deodorants/antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have allergic reactions to most deodorants and although I am a man I had been using a secret for woman unscented deodorant for a while</li>
            <li>Please note that my 3 star rating is based on my personal experience with the Almzy Clear Gel and my subsequent allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I suddenly developed a severe and uncomfortable reaction to the antiperspirant that I had used for many years and went in search of a hypoallergenic version.</li>
            <li>We have been using this for at least 15 years and it always goes out of stock quickly at local super store.  </li>

            <li> Price seems fair...</li>
            <li> In my case, I bought it chiefly because of the good reviews and the listing as hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Good protection without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a 220 pound athlete, with my fair share of armpit hair.</li>
            <li> Ever since Mitchum changed their formula I&#x27;ve been searching for a good gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably take me awhile to go thru 6 sticks, but this was the best deal available on amazon.</li>
            <li> great, love it, very pleased, shipped on time</li>
            <li> And I am so happy to be able to buy it though Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to many anti-perspirants and this is great.</li>
            <li> The world will love you!</li>
            <li> I hope the never stop making this because I love it!</li>
            <li> a good citizen, GO FRAGRANCE FREE!</li>
            <li> Arrived in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> as always gentile but effective</li>
            <li> I think they own it..</li>
            <li> Really, the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> For most people I believe it should prove to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I bough a 6 pack of this and no itching, no rashes no allergic reactions of any kind.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it doesn&#x27;t irritate me but wish to have more than 2.25OZ.  </li>
            <li> It is unscented and effective.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Thanks very good product recommended 100%</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for those of us who are sensitive to scented products.  </li>
            <li> For Sensitive skin it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> Purchased this and have been very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Sure is also Amazing</li>
            <li> Good product, salicylate free for those with fibromyalgia on the guai protocol</li>
            <li> Almay Clear Gel, anti-perspirant and deodorant is effective, scent-free, easy to apply, and best of all non-animal tested.</li>
            <li> So I would have to say, the price I paid for 6 was good, but for only 5 to work, not so good!</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly and arrived in good order.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to get it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love Almay deodorant but my drug store can&#x27;t keep it on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Fresh\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sexy</li>
            <li> Deodorant of champions.  :-)  </li>
            <li> Was so glad when I found this here and</li>
            <li> applies better than before, more evenly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite way to shop.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands and Almay is the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it more than one star because it works; however this is not the deodorant pictured.  </li>
            <li> These are switch products with many customers vying for a deodorant that works and does not itch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many problems with deodorants.  </li>
            <li> improved dispenser on top</li>
            <li> Used to use the solid and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> For many people, it is aluminum that leads to the allergic reactions with antiperspirants and this has proven to be the situation with me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was just ok.</li>
            <li> it did its job temporarily but had too many consequences.</li>
            <li> The most important review I could give Almay is that it works!  </li>
            <li> Glad I could get it here.  </li>
            <li> Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s very effective and yet gentle on under arm skin.  </li>
            <li> I love it, great price, no mess and does the job.</li>
            <li> A great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin....works great for me.</li>
            <li> joking aside, this stuff is great for my sensitive skin, stops body odor, and reduces sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And equally importantly, it keeps the sweat smell away.  :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to buy it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is not that easy for me to find, so</li>
            <li> This product has a definate and strong menthol fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The Almay product itself works fine.  </li>
            <li> It does work fine as an anit-perspirant and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have found so far for sensitive skin and it works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon was the only place I could find this deodorant readily available, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I think it is stain free on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> How cheap can they get?</li>
            <li> I need something fragrance free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> This scentless allergy free formulation works well in my experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to try a fragrance free product but have found the lack of scent a fantastic improvement.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance free, therefore it does not clash my my lotions or perfumes.  </li>
            <li> The stuff works and is fragrance free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin, this is a good anti-perspirant to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and love this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product especially for persons with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> What is pictured is the original formula/packaging which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> but well worth the hunt!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the scented brand, but found that the scent bothered my nose a bit.</li>
            <li> original review</li>
            <li> It works fine, dries faster, and the tube lasts much longer, compared to dispensing more.</li>
            <li> With so many holes, it is too easy to administer more gel than necessary.</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it in bulk at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin and Almay works wonderful for me.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this very affordable Almay version.</li>
            <li> This product works great - the only anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve found that does not cause an allergic reaction AND it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, there are more holes at the top where the product comes out, but they extend too close to the edge so when the cap is replaced it inevitably pushes product over the side.</li>
            <li> Very mild and gentle.</li>
            <li> This one finally solved the problem, plus I don&#x27;t have any more deodorant stains on my clothes!  </li>
            <li> I recently learned that I am allergic to most fragrances (and basically all deoderants) and am so lucky to have discovered this product!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most deodorants I wore before.</li>
            <li> girls love me because i am sensitive.</li>
            <li> My husband must have the most sensitive skin on the planet.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer available in my local pharmacy, so I&#x27;m really glad Amazon helps me continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to interfere with body spray or cologne if I choose to use those things and no artificial scent or body odor if not.</li>
            <li> The only kind i can use.</li>
            <li> Almay is a bit pricey, however well worth it...</li>
            <li> Never found anything better for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Try Almay gel deodorant and you will not have to run around looking for the right one for you.</li>
            <li> Even though the weight might be right, one evaluates the amount by looking at a container.</li>
            <li> And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> Good price and less chemicals.</li>
            <li> My Physician recommended this fragrance fee, dye free product for the family&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Almay keeps me fresh and dry all day, which is very important as I am on the move quite a bit a work, and in close proximity with patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad that Amazon carries this as my local stores do not.</li>
            <li> It is the only hypo-allergenic deodorant I can find (although I&#x27;m sure there must be others.)</li>
            <li> ..discovered the Almay Solid and used it for so many years, I cannot even remember.</li>
            <li> that worked pretty well, but it cost about $7 for each deodorant container; it was quite</li>
            <li> last thing I love about this product is the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I have been able to use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it was because it was on sale.</li>
            <li> Almay has never failed.  </li>
            <li> Love the clear gel, no mess.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and still feel 100% positive about it.</li>
            <li> I like unscented deoderant, and this is great for sensitive skin and has a very low \\&quot;toxicity\\&quot; rating on the EWG&#x27;s skin deep website.</li>
            <li> While the scent isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; it is subtle and fresh and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me want to wash my armpits after a couple hours of wear.</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous antiperspirant, the Almay does not leave any underarm stains and seems reasonably effective as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I always ordered or bought a large number of them at a time..</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and fresh for 24 hours and is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect but very good.</li>
            <li> Truly fragrance free - have used it forever and have a hard time finding it in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> you know if the solid is available I would really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> In this almay product I found a deodorant that is both reliable and gentle to my skin as well.</li>
            <li> , I have not broken out since I started using Almay.</li>
            <li> And if you do find it, it&#x27;s twice as much.</li>
            <li> Amazon saves me so much gas not having to run to the store to buy them one at a time.</li>
            <li> It does protect me during the whole day.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> they discontinued Almay Solid, fragrance free, hypoallergenic antiperspirant...</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay, I started seeing..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently decided to go fragrance and dye free, which is why I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li> It feels sticky and itchy and it doesn&#x27;t work like the solid fragrance free Almay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for months, and really like it.</li>
            <li> He has no issue using it and it works really well.</li>
            <li> it isnt always available in local CVS and Walgreens...</li>
            <li> Thanks Almay for your products.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And deoderants don&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> This is now a very hard-to-find product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having it.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that not only keeps me smelling nice but doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of other anti-perspirants and travel a LOT in warm clients so need protection I can trust....</li>
            <li> so it comes out nice and even out of lots of small holes instead of three large holes.  </li>
            <li> (but the same is true of many other deodorants)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid bar is longer lasting but this should cover most of the day.</li>
            <li> He has tried every fragrance-free hypoallergenic deodorant on the market and most make him itch so much he scratches himself raw.</li>
            <li> Almay Clear Gel, Anti- Perspirant &amp; Deodorant really works and all day.</li>
            <li> any rate, the Almay Sensitive Skin deodorant (fragrance free clear gel) has finally provided relief for my husband.</li>
            <li> My 88-year old mother (who is very allergic and very sensitive to perfumed products) also uses this product, with no problems.</li>
            <li> is not as effective in controlling pesrpiration and dispenses from 50 little holes which decreases the overall yield substantially.</li>
            <li> I received Almays &#x27;New and Improved&#x27; product  </li>
            <li> I have found my new anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended if you have developed sensitivity to other products</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I sweat a lot, and this brand works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I use Almay because I have very, very sensitive underarms.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin under my arms.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to people of all shapes and sizes, with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; then it would have warranted a higher rating simply as an antiperspirant, but I purchased it based on their implication that it would serve the purposes of people allergic to antiperspirants and in my case, this did not prove to be the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first one that not only worked, but doesn&#x27;t make my underarms break</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as clinical strength, but it is considerably cheaper and it works better than other regular strength deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not only has this completely eliminated the irritation I was experiencing with other aluminum formulations, it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> After a lot of trial and error research I found that this was the only deodorant product that I could use that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, while at the same time being just as effective as any other quality deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using the old stuff for years but this new version seems to &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; from the bottle. . .</li>
            <li> One can only hope they will go back to the old style top in the near future.  </li>
            <li> With the new design, this product is becoming less affordable and I prefer the multiple slit design it used to have.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find it on Amazon because it is hard to find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I am glad I can buy it in bulk on amazon as it is hard to find in North Alabama.</li>
            <li> Once I found Almay Clear Gel, I have never used anything else.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is for&lt;br /&gt;you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, without issue or complaint.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> How I really, really wish that Almay still made the solid stick deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve become sensitive to it and started to get breakouts under my arms.</li>
            <li> My wife is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have always been allergic to metals including the aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex that&#x27;s in nearly all anti-perspirants, even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones and all of them</li>
            <li> or it just sweats away completely.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they changed the formula, but now this stuff is complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can wear most deodorants, but this is the only antiperspirant that I can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few deoderants I can use without getting significant underarm irritation.</li>
            <li> When you consider the air space both above and below the actual product, this container is only 1/2 full.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is that if you tend to allergic reactions with antiperspirants, then first try just one to test out before placing larger orders.</li>
            <li> This new edition of the product is on the opposite end of the goodness scale from the old edition.  </li>
            <li> This is the new \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; one that must have a different formula.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I am on my new batch of bottles and my only complaint is that I am not fond of the new design with the multiple holes on top.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrances and have used almay unscented deodorants in the past and they were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> While the effectiveness might vary for each individual, it certainly works for this fair-haired, light-skinned individual.  </li>
            <li> A little bit pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> However, webmd stated clearly that theses 4 keys will cause itchy and irritation such as: aluminum, paraben, alcohol and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This one, however, is fast drying and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> We found one that worked (Gillette Clinical - fragrance-free - for Sensitive Skin) but now that appears to have been discontinued, and until we found this Almay product he had gone back to not wearing deodorant, and risking smelling sweaty, because he just can&#x27;t stand the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant that he likes.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I developed a sensitivity to deodorants/antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have allergic reactions to most deodorants and although I am a man I had been using a secret for woman unscented deodorant for a while</li>
            <li> Please note that my 3 star rating is based on my personal experience with the Almzy Clear Gel and my subsequent allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I suddenly developed a severe and uncomfortable reaction to the antiperspirant that I had used for many years and went in search of a hypoallergenic version.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for at least 15 years and it always goes out of stock quickly at local super store.  </li>
            <li> No other brand works as well, is dry on contact..</li>
            <li> I find that if you use a little to much, it causes a strange yellow, stiff-feeling spot on white t-shirts.  </li>
            <li> (I actually like the runny gel consistency more than the white solid type deodorants, because that solid white stuff of other deodorants is so difficult to remove once it has rubbed off on</li>
            <li> Of course, I have applied too much before a noticed a small bit of white flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started developing rashes from using regular deodorants a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> What I received looks different from the photo on Amazon: it is \\&quot;Almay Sensitive Skin\\&quot; with a pale blue label</li>
            <li> The Almay is definitely fragrance free and seems unlikely to cause any staining.</li>
            <li> , my husband did not have the same luck with the still allegedly hypoallergenic \\&quot;powder\\&quot; fragrance Almay product that looks similar to this one: he does think the powder one made him itch.</li>
            <li> I loved my Almay Solid, but hate Revlon..</li>
            <li> My family and I have been using Almay Clear Gel deodorant for years, but all of them from this last order (I bought a six pack) was a wet drippy mess.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I was disappointed because it seemed my allergic responses were continuing, but eventually I decided to retry the product and since then I have noticed that while allergic reactions have not entirely ceased, they are, in fact, significantly less than I had experienced with previous antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your armpits sticky for a long time.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the product begins leaking from the bottom, near the wheel is that dispenses the product.</li>
            <li> I read about this being a good rating on the environmental working group cosmetic data base.</li>
            <li> It needs to dry before you put on clothes.</li>
            <li> #1 is that the gel takes a while to dry</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> but you have to &amp;#34;dial&amp;#34; it up and it comes out wet and takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> The cost of H/S to send to me and return back is $12.16 which is not worth to return where as the product itself for a pack of 6 is $15.07.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry!  </li>
            <li> it is quite wet so allow time for it to dry before dressing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And as long as I apply a thin layer, the product IS clear and doesn&#x27;t turn my clothes white.</li>
            <li> I had some concerns about buying a gel because my previous experience with a gel was that it took too long to dry.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a deororant that I can wear due to my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but that is better than break outs or ugly rashes and irritation burning or hurting</li>
            <li> It does not have any harsh smell, so the only way someone can tell that I am wearing it is that I do not smell like B.O.  </li>
            <li> my husband has been using this for years but getting harder and harder to find at stores, saw it on amazon and purchased a pack and now have for a while</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> If you put clothes over it while it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wet, it makes my skin sore, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that claim to be hypoallergenic, but this is my go to.  </li>
            <li> this is one antiperspirant hubby can use due to his sensitivity to propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li> Other anti-perspirants and deodorants</li>
            <li> a little sticky and takes time to dry</li>
            <li> but I read endless reviews and complaints about this being discontinued..and by the way, it went on dried, no fragrance at all and kept you dry all day..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly half of what the other brands cost.</li>
            <li> Take advantage of this offer since it can be hard to find at local supermarkets.</li>
            <li> When my local store no longer carried this I had a hard time finding a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super expensive and I feel it works very well.</li>
            <li> when I raise some for application, liquid comes from it and drips down the side. .</li>
            <li> And another pro, for me, is that it has not (so far) left those annoying white marks on my clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply without it dripping all over the bathroom counter, and it takes forever to dry on my skin</li>
            <li> After a few uses the container is a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Then get dressed in clothes washed in laundry detergent loaded with dyes and perfumes and rinsed with a dye and fragrance loaded fabric softener and dried with perfumed dryer sheet.</li>
            <li> Spray on untold amounts of designer fragrance that smells like toxic waste and guess what YOU</li>
            <li> It works well and isn&#x27;t as messy as some of the gel products/</li>
            <li> Makes the rounds of the local drugstores (which mostly do not carry it) unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to find at times...</li>
            <li> No more lumps and bumps under my arms from harsher deodorants.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Almay for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> It is not worthwhile to return the order</li>
            <li> I suggest that Amazon should show the composition of the product at the back so noone will wrongly purchase like me.</li>
            <li> Have tried other non irritating products like Dove and non could be used repeatedly with out irritation.</li>
            <li> Lately, I find it hard to find in the stores or drugstores, so when I do see it I buy a few so as not to run out.  </li>
            <li> so hard that it will rip out your armpit hair (literally) when you lift your arms over your head or try to pull out a clump, so I was forced to trim the area to no more than an 1/4 inch to keep them from ripping out.</li>
            <li> However, the plastic container changed recently and the new version is awful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> and once it does it dries HARD.</li>
            <li> least I THINK it is this product.</li>
            <li> A bar lasts forever (seriously, months) and it prevents any odor and serious sweating for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant for me that: (1) works; (2) does not give me an allergic reaction; and (iii) is non-perfumed.  </li>
            <li> is broken.  </li>
            <li> and i have tired every thing..</li>
            <li> It is also not great if you&#x27;re planning to store it in a bag where it might not be upright, the gel comes through the dispenser, ending up in the cap.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with skin irritation and don&#x27;t find the gel clammy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be returning these.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use any deodorant.</li>
            <li> Sad, it will be discontinued.</li>
            <li> When I started looking for an alternative, either the anti-perspirant didn&#x27;t work or the deodorant failed me.</li>
            <li> I deducted stars because it caused the color on some of my shirts to lighten in the armpit area, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> very expensive and not great</li>
            <li> used sparingly it does the job without itching like crazy</li>
            <li> From itching, to irritation, to painful underarms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS: (1) you do have to keep the deodorant upright, as, otherwise, the quite runny gel does leak out.&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li> I feel deceived and disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I wish they would rethink this stupid decision.</li>
            <li> Bad move Almay!</li>
            <li> I used to have the worst rashes from deodorant ..</li>
            <li> The gel is nasty -</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well. No sensitivities to this product.</li>
            <li> Almay Clear Gel, anti-perspirant and deodorant is effective, scent-free, easy to apply, and best of all non-animal tested. NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS!</li>
            <li> Very good seller and very good product!! Was shipped quickly and arrived in good order.</li>
            <li> Excellent product especially for persons with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No rash or itching.  I have ultra sensitive skin.  So glad to be able to get it on Amazon.  Makes the rounds of the local drugstores (which mostly do not carry it) unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 10 or 15 years because it does not interfere with my fibromyalgia treatment protocol. I like buying it by the 6 pack because it is cheaper that way. Would recommend 100% since it also works great!</li>
            <li> Thanks very good product recommended 100%</li>
            <li> The Almay product itself works fine.  It is hypoallergenic and solves issues with sensitivity.  It does work fine as an anit-perspirant and is fragrance free.  I think it is stain free on my clothes.  However, Almay has a disconcerting habit of filling the container short.  Sometimes well below the amount specified.  How cheap can they get?</li>
            <li> Avoid rashes by avoiding unneeded dyes and perfumes. Why bathe with one perfume, shampoo with another, the add another fragrance to your underarms. Then get dressed in clothes washed in laundry detergent loaded with dyes and perfumes and rinsed with a dye and fragrance loaded fabric softener and dried with perfumed dryer sheet. Spray on untold amounts of designer fragrance that smells like toxic waste and guess what YOU REEK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that your reeking presence is an irritant to the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be a good citizen, GO FRAGRANCE FREE! The world will love you!</li>
            <li> Works well and not skin issues!</li>
            <li> great, love it, very pleased, shipped on time</li>
            <li> Great deodorant! Basically the only one I can use as I have sensitivity issues.  I have used it for more than 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that claim to be hypoallergenic, but this is my go to.  Very mild and gentle. It gets the job done without causing any rashes, itching, or breakouts. It does not have any harsh smell, so the only way someone can tell that I am wearing it is that I do not smell like B.O.  I am so glad that Amazon carries this as my local stores do not.</li>
            <li> I did not buy from Amazon but wanted to comment on the product.  I thought this would be a solid stick type gel but you have to &amp;#34;dial&amp;#34; it up and it comes out wet and takes a long time to dry. Yuck</li>
            <li> If you get a reaction to antiperspirants, try this. I can wear most deodorants, but this is the only antiperspirant that I can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Only product I can use that I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> A great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this about 10 years, and it is the only deodorant I can use with getting a rash.  It works great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for those of us who are sensitive to scented products.  I hope the never stop making this because I love it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to most deodorants I wore before. In this almay product I found a deodorant that is both reliable and gentle to my skin as well. Take advantage of this offer since it can be hard to find at local supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant, I have not broken out since I started using Almay.</li>
            <li> I love Almay deodorant but my drug store can&#x27;t keep it on the shelf. I can go into 6 of them and it&#x27;s all sold out. I just wish these 6 packs came in the Aloe scent but it&#x27;s hard to find. And if you do find it, it&#x27;s twice as much. Stock up!</li>
            <li> girls love me because i am sensitive.</li>
            <li> Almay is truly non-scent.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and I like buying it in a six pack ... Amazon saves me so much gas not having to run to the store to buy them one at a time.</li>
            <li> this is one antiperspirant hubby can use due to his sensitivity to propylene glycol.  works beautifully</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product will not be without it</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry!  I had to do all my morning tasks with my arms up. 2 stars because once it dries it works.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant which doesn&#x27;t make my underarms&lt;br /&gt;itch and hurt.  If you have sensitive skin, this is for&lt;br /&gt;you.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s very effective and yet gentle on under arm skin.  Keeps you dry and fresh for 24 hours and is fragrance free.  Excellent value from Amazon in multi unit package.  This is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, without issue or complaint. It is the only hypo-allergenic deodorant I can find (although I&#x27;m sure there must be others.) I started ordering it from Amazon after my local pharmacy stopped carrying it. I have never had a problem with skin irritation and don&#x27;t find the gel clammy or uncomfortable. Also, in my experience, I have never noticed any fragrance from the product. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to use hypo-allergenic deodorant. Of course, everyone has different experiences and expectations, but for me, it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> my husband has been using this for years but getting harder and harder to find at stores, saw it on amazon and purchased a pack and now have for a while</li>
            <li> For Sensitive skin it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> as always gentile but effective</li>
            <li> It works great. No sweat and no rash!</li>
            <li> Neither I nor my husband can do without this dependable product.  It has been a mainstay for several years now.  I always order several since I don&#x27;t find it at the drug store.</li>
            <li> It is really good. It doesn&#x27;t stain my cloth. It does protect me during the whole day. Perfect. So I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently learned that I am allergic to most fragrances (and basically all deoderants) and am so lucky to have discovered this product!  Works great and NO ALLERGIES!  Such a relief.</li>
            <li> What I do not understand...they discontinued Almay Solid, fragrance free, hypoallergenic antiperspirant...I used to have the worst rashes from deodorant ..then I used Clinique..very expensive and not great..discovered the Almay Solid and used it for so many years, I cannot even remember. I always ordered or bought a large number of them at a time..I could no longer find them anywhere..and panic set in. Much to my dismay, I started seeing..Discontinued..I ran to Ebay, Amazon..none around..but I read endless reviews and complaints about this being discontinued..and by the way, it went on dried, no fragrance at all and kept you dry all day..no odor either..THE BEST..so I wish they would rethink this stupid decision. No other brand works as well, is dry on contact.. I loved my Almay Solid, but hate Revlon..I think they own it..hence the one star.</li>
            <li> Throughout my gradeschool years, I always had issues with perspiring..to the point I was too embarrassed to even raise my hand in class. So, I switched to clinical strength deodorant to try to combat the problem..that worked pretty well, but it cost about $7 for each deodorant container; it was quite expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently decided to go fragrance and dye free, which is why I&#x27;ve started using this product. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as clinical strength, but it is considerably cheaper and it works better than other regular strength deodorants I&#x27;ve used. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I sweat a lot, and this brand works well for me.  Yay and hooray!</li>
            <li> No allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I use Almay because I have very, very sensitive underarms.  This product was introduced to me by my doctor and I have been buying it for years. Lately, I find it hard to find in the stores or drugstores, so when I do see it I buy a few so as not to run out.  No more lumps and bumps under my arms from harsher deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant i can use without getting a rush</li>
            <li> awesome quality and loooks,great product,awesome quality and loooks,nice to carry and also so comfortable to work ,very nice look and carrying capacity is excellent.</li>
            <li> This new edition of the product is on the opposite end of the goodness scale from the old edition.  I threw away the six containers that I purchased.</li>
            <li> This works great if you have stinky arm pits but don&#x27;t want to put a bunch of chemicals on.  Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband must have the most sensitive skin on the planet. He has tried every fragrance-free hypoallergenic deodorant on the market and most make him itch so much he scratches himself raw. We found one that worked (Gillette Clinical - fragrance-free - for Sensitive Skin) but now that appears to have been discontinued, and until we found this Almay product he had gone back to not wearing deodorant, and risking smelling sweaty, because he just can&#x27;t stand the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I THINK it is this product. This is what I ordered. What I received looks different from the photo on Amazon: it is \\&quot;Almay Sensitive Skin\\&quot; with a pale blue label (I will try to upload a photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the Almay Sensitive Skin deodorant (fragrance free clear gel) has finally provided relief for my husband. No itching, and it does work. I do hope that when we repeat the order we will get the same stuff! And another pro, for me, is that it has not (so far) left those annoying white marks on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: (1) you do have to keep the deodorant upright, as, otherwise, the quite runny gel does leak out.&lt;br /&gt;(2) it is quite wet so allow time for it to dry before dressing. (I actually like the runny gel consistency more than the white solid type deodorants, because that solid white stuff of other deodorants is so difficult to remove once it has rubbed off on clothing.)&lt;br /&gt;(3) you might want to trim underarm hair a bit if using this (but the same is true of many other deodorants)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my husband did not have the same luck with the still allegedly hypoallergenic \\&quot;powder\\&quot; fragrance Almay product that looks similar to this one: he does think the powder one made him itch.</li>
            <li> Five stars!!!!  Absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I can use!</li>
            <li> Our local supermarket and pharmacy no longer carry Almay.  It&#x27;s the only deodorant that works for me and doesn&#x27;t make my pits itch!</li>
            <li> It feels sticky and itchy and it doesn&#x27;t work like the solid fragrance free Almay.  How I really, really wish that Almay still made the solid stick deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use this gel again--I will be giving away the remaining 5 that came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know if the solid is available I would really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like fragrance-free products. But, I figure, if the product works properly I&#x27;ll know and I won&#x27;t smell like anything! So that is how I know this works well for me, I don&#x27;t smell AT ALL! I will stick with this until they stop carrying it, and after that I will continue to wear fragrance-free anti-perspirant. I would rather smell like my perfume or lotion than \\&quot;Cotton Fresh\\&quot; or \\&quot;Sexy Intrigue\\&quot; mixed with body odor... not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as long as I apply a thin layer, the product IS clear and doesn&#x27;t turn my clothes white. Of course, I have applied too much before a noticed a small bit of white flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I love about this product is the price. It&#x27;s nearly half of what the other brands cost. I would urge anyone to try this!</li>
            <li> Deodorant of champions.  :-)  Really, the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth the money. Especially great in the summer when the cool application feels great. A bit of a challenge in the winter...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Almay for the past 3 years. It&#x27;s been excellent  until the packaging changed. Since then I&#x27;ve become sensitive to it and started to get breakouts under my arms. I hope only the packaging has changed and not the formula.</li>
            <li> Faster than the local Cvs!</li>
            <li> I returned this because the item I received was not the one in the picture, which has been discontinued and this is why I was looking for it online.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a deororant that I can wear due to my very sensitive skin.  When my local store no longer carried this I had a hard time finding a replacement.  Was so glad when I found this here and the price was great too.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! What is pictured is the original formula/packaging which is what I wanted. I received Almays &#x27;New and Improved&#x27; product  is not as effective in controlling pesrpiration and dispenses from 50 little holes which decreases the overall yield substantially. It is not worthwhile to return the order so I&#x27;ll just suffer the mistake.</li>
            <li> Item received was not item pictured.  I feel deceived and disappointed.</li>
            <li> They improved the application head so it comes out nice and even out of lots of small holes instead of three large holes.  applies better than before, more evenly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am allergic to fragrances and this is perfect for me with no irritation.  And I am so happy to be able to buy it though Amazon.  My favorite way to shop.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin, this is a good anti-perspirant to use.  I was glad to find it on Amazon because it is hard to find it in the stores. You can order a pack at a time, so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This product works great - the only anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve found that does not cause an allergic reaction AND it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warning: This is a gel, not a stick. That might not be obvious. Why does that matter?&lt;br /&gt;- It needs to dry before you put on clothes. If you put clothes over it while it&#x27;s still wet it could stain your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;- When traveling, you have to treat this as a liquid / gel for the TSA. You can treat sticks like regular luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Use the smallest amount you can. It works fine, dries faster, and the tube lasts much longer, compared to dispensing more.</li>
            <li> I read about this being a good rating on the environmental working group cosmetic data base. It&#x27;s not super expensive and I feel it works very well. Good price and less chemicals.</li>
            <li> I need something fragrance free and hypoallergenic. This stuff does the trick and does not cause a problem with my dainty skin. I have tried many brands and Almay is the one.</li>
            <li> Almost every deodorant I&#x27;ve tried irritates my armpits, so when my wife found this deodorant I gave it a try and thankfully doesn&#x27;t make my armpits sore and itchy. While the scent isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; it is subtle and fresh and most importantly doesn&#x27;t make me want to wash my armpits after a couple hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it more than one star because it works; however this is not the deodorant pictured.  This is the new \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; one that must have a different formula.  I find that if you use a little to much, it causes a strange yellow, stiff-feeling spot on white t-shirts.  Wish they would go back to selling the one pictured.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be returning these.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant that he likes.</li>
            <li> Almay Clear Gel, Anti- Perspirant &amp; Deodorant really works and all day.These are switch products with many customers vying for a deodorant that works and does not itch. Try Almay gel deodorant and you will not have to run around looking for the right one for you. I know, I have been using this product for years with the utmost in satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Adler, Music Critic</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.  I love it, great price, no mess and does the job. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only antiperspirant I can use. No irritation.</li>
            <li> My Physician recommended this fragrance fee, dye free product for the family&#x27;s sensitive skin! It works well and isn&#x27;t as messy as some of the gel products/</li>
            <li> Great gel , great price</li>
            <li> Several years ago I developed a sensitivity to deodorants/antiperspirants.  This is the only brand I have been able to use.  I am glad I can buy it in bulk on amazon as it is hard to find in North Alabama.</li>
            <li> I tend to have allergic reactions to most deodorants and although I am a man I had been using a secret for woman unscented deodorant for a while and then it started bothering me. Purchased this and have been very happy so far.</li>
            <li> This came in a timely manner and was a 6pack.  I am just now getting to use the 3rd one from the pack and the bottom button that dials up the gel is broken.  Time has expired for me to make a return.  So I would have to say, the price I paid for 6 was good, but for only 5 to work, not so good!</li>
            <li> I have problems with deodorants causing rashes and itching under my arms, but this one does not have any side effects at all, and it doesn&#x27;t make stains on my clothing, either.  I&#x27;ve used it for months, and really like it.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use any deodorant. It was nice to be able to buy it at a reasonable price. The packaging was great and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is the only antiperspirant I&#x27;m not allergic to. A bar lasts forever (seriously, months) and it prevents any odor and serious sweating for 12 hours. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> best anti-perspirant ever if you have any sensitivity issues with armpits....a little sticky and takes time to dry but that is better than break outs or ugly rashes and irritation burning or hurting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many problems with deodorants.  From itching, to irritation, to painful underarms.  This scentless allergy free formulation works well in my experience.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I get stress sweat and it smell on day i don&#x27;t use this and i have tired every thing.. Solid bar is longer lasting but this should cover most of the day. Sure is also Amazing</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and love this product! It&#x27;s no longer available in my local pharmacy, so I&#x27;m really glad Amazon helps me continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product has a definate and strong menthol fragrance.  I am allergic to fragrances and have used almay unscented deodorants in the past and they were fragrance free.  I am returning this product for a refund.</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to many anti-perspirants and this is great. He has no issue using it and it works really well.</li>
            <li> not quite spot and protects&lt;br /&gt;is durable and the price is excellent also odorless to people who do not like the smell is excellent</li>
            <li> Great. My wife is sensitive to fragrance. This is the only antiperspirant she uses.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that not only keeps me smelling nice but doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits. Love the clear gel, no mess.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and still feel 100% positive about it. I love that I can buy it in bulk at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> improved dispenser on top</li>
            <li> Hands-down, the best antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only has this completely eliminated the irritation I was experiencing with other aluminum formulations, it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try a fragrance free product but have found the lack of scent a fantastic improvement. Nothing to interfere with body spray or cologne if I choose to use those things and no artificial scent or body odor if not.</li>
            <li> I buy these every six months. Saves time going to the grocery store. Especially when all don&#x27;t carry this.  This works great for men or women.</li>
            <li> Truly fragrance free - have used it forever and have a hard time finding it in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin under my arms.  Other anti-perspirants and deodorants I&#x27;ve tried makes my skin break out.  Once I found Almay Clear Gel, I have never used anything else.  It is a little hard to find at times...but well worth the hunt!</li>
            <li> The only kind i can use.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and years. Sad, it will be discontinued. Bad move Almay!</li>
            <li> Good product, salicylate free for those with fibromyalgia on the guai protocol</li>
            <li> Price seems fair... I purchased online bc it isnt always available in local CVS and Walgreens... This is one of the few deoderants I can use without getting significant underarm irritation. (Male, BTW). Strongly recommended if you have developed sensitivity to other products</li>
            <li> I have used several types of deodorants and they all caused me itching and irritation.  I search on webmd and finds out that Almay has dermatologist and allergy tested therefore I should give it a try.  I found the item sold on Amazon.  However, webmd stated clearly that theses 4 keys will cause itchy and irritation such as: aluminum, paraben, alcohol and fragrance.  However, when I looked at the picture ad, Amazon did not show us the ingredients at the back to determine that we should or should not buy it.  I suggest that Amazon should show the composition of the product at the back so noone will wrongly purchase like me. The cost of H/S to send to me and return back is $12.16 which is not worth to return where as the product itself for a pack of 6 is $15.07.</li>
            <li> My husband has allergies and this is the only deodorant that does not cause him to break out.  Thanks Almay for your products.</li>
            <li> When you consider the air space both above and below the actual product, this container is only 1/2 full. Even though the weight might be right, one evaluates the amount by looking at a container.</li>
            <li> Used to use the solid and I was very happy with it. They don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore. The gel is nasty - it&#x27;s wet, it makes my skin sore, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin....works great for me.</li>
            <li> The Almay is definitely fragrance free and seems unlikely to cause any staining. Unlike my previous antiperspirant, the Almay does not leave any underarm stains and seems reasonably effective as an antiperspirant. For most people I believe it should prove to be a good product. In my case, I bought it chiefly because of the good reviews and the listing as hypoallergenic. However, it contains aluminum sesquichlorphydrate (the key here is \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot;. For many people, it is aluminum that leads to the allergic reactions with antiperspirants and this has proven to be the situation with me. Please note that my 3 star rating is based on my personal experience with the Almzy Clear Gel and my subsequent allergic reaction to it. Had it not been advertised as \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; then it would have warranted a higher rating simply as an antiperspirant, but I purchased it based on their implication that it would serve the purposes of people allergic to antiperspirants and in my case, this did not prove to be the case. I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 4, 2014 update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my reviews from 3 stars to 4 stars. Initially, I was disappointed because it seemed my allergic responses were continuing, but eventually I decided to retry the product and since then I have noticed that while allergic reactions have not entirely ceased, they are, in fact, significantly less than I had experienced with previous antiperspirants. My only recommendation is that if you tend to allergic reactions with antiperspirants, then first try just one to test out before placing larger orders.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have found so far for sensitive skin and it works well. Have tried other non irritating products like Dove and non could be used repeatedly with out irritation. Good Job Almay!</li>
            <li> The only deodorant for me that: (1) works; (2) does not give me an allergic reaction; and (iii) is non-perfumed.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 5 years with no problems.  My 88-year old mother (who is very allergic and very sensitive to perfumed products) also uses this product, with no problems.</li>
            <li> No scent. No residue. Performs perfectly. I have found my new anti-perspirant and deodorant. Even the unscented versions offered by various brands often have a scent. I&#x27;m so happy this one is truly unscented!!</li>
            <li> This is terrible. Leaves your armpits sticky for a long time. I definitely do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out but doesn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating or smelling.</li>
            <li> desde que la doctora me lo recomendo no deje de usarlo y de hecho compre 6 (pack de 6) para que nunca se me acabe y tambien compartir con mi familia la calidad de este desodorante almay.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was just ok. I deducted stars because it caused the color on some of my shirts to lighten in the armpit area, very frustrating. It is also not great if you&#x27;re planning to store it in a bag where it might not be upright, the gel comes through the dispenser, ending up in the cap. It&#x27;s quite a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wear colored shirts, and don&#x27;t take your deodorant anywhere, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant for people with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The deodorant still works well for me. However, the plastic container changed recently and the new version is awful. After a few uses the product begins leaking from the bottom, near the wheel is that dispenses the product. Also, there are more holes at the top where the product comes out, but they extend too close to the edge so when the cap is replaced it inevitably pushes product over the side. After a few uses the container is a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Good protection without any irritation.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I discovered Almay deodorant 12 years ago and have not used anything else since.  I never have to worry about an underarm odor problem with Almay.  Some of my local stores don&#x27;t carry it, so I hunt the internet for places to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have always been allergic to metals including the aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex that&#x27;s in nearly all anti-perspirants, even the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones and all of them cause me to break out within 20 mins. And deoderants don&#x27;t really help. I bough a 6 pack of this and no itching, no rashes no allergic reactions of any kind. 2 problems: #1 is that the gel takes a while to dry and once it does it dries HARD. so hard that it will rip out your armpit hair (literally) when you lift your arms over your head or try to pull out a clump, so I was forced to trim the area to no more than an 1/4 inch to keep them from ripping out. #2 when you start to sweat it rehydrates and runs, sometimes gluing your shirt to your armpit or sides or it just sweats away completely. it did its job temporarily but had too many consequences. I will run out/ sell the rest of what I have and then try the powder form but I will not be getting the gel again.</li>
            <li> Good price, excellent service - thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it doesn&#x27;t irritate me but wish to have more than 2.25OZ.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The ONLY brand of deodorant that I can use, that doesn&#x27;t cause me to have an underarm rash. I originally bought the scented brand, but found that the scent bothered my nose a bit. Switched to unscented, and haven&#x27;t looked back (2 years now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they ever stop making this, I will be buying a lifetime supply before it goes off the shelves!!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it was because it was on sale. Now I buy it because I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 220 pound athlete, with my fair share of armpit hair. (That&#x27;s a mouthful...wait, I hope it isn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All joking aside, this stuff is great for my sensitive skin, stops body odor, and reduces sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to people of all shapes and sizes, with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin and Almay works wonderful for me.  Its fragrance free, therefore it does not clash my my lotions or perfumes.  The most important review I could give Almay is that it works!  Almay keeps me fresh and dry all day, which is very important as I am on the move quite a bit a work, and in close proximity with patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars for Almay,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not five stars?  Almay is a bit pricey, however well worth it...</li>
            <li> This is now a very hard-to-find product.  After a lot of trial and error research I found that this was the only deodorant product that I could use that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, while at the same time being just as effective as any other quality deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was the only place I could find this deodorant readily available, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> used sparingly it does the job without itching like crazy</li>
            <li> Ever since Mitchum changed their formula I&#x27;ve been searching for a good gel. This fits the bill. Keeps me dry and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that I will use.  Glad I could get it here.  Thanks Amazon for having it.</li>
            <li> Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>
            <li> Been using the old stuff for years but this new version seems to &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; from the bottle. . . when I raise some for application, liquid comes from it and drips down the side. . don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on but I don&#x27;t see how it will keep me from sweating if the product itself sweats. . .</li>
            <li> The stuff works and is fragrance free and hypoallergenic. A little bit pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> It was just what i needed</li>
            <li> I like unscented deoderant, and this is great for sensitive skin and has a very low \\&quot;toxicity\\&quot; rating on the EWG&#x27;s skin deep website. I try not to use anti-persperant, but sometimes, I need to. So this is my go-to for anti-persperant. It&#x27;ll probably take me awhile to go thru 6 sticks, but this was the best deal available on amazon.</li>
            <li> I started developing rashes from using regular deodorants a long time ago.  When I started looking for an alternative, either the anti-perspirant didn&#x27;t work or the deodorant failed me. This product from Almay solves all of those problems. While the effectiveness might vary for each individual, it certainly works for this fair-haired, light-skinned individual.  And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> 2016 updated review:  My family and I have been using Almay Clear Gel deodorant for years, but all of them from this last order (I bought a six pack) was a wet drippy mess.  It&#x27;s hard to apply without it dripping all over the bathroom counter, and it takes forever to dry on my skin (I&#x27;ve actually started resorting to drying this deodorant with a hair dryer!).  Perhaps they changed the formula, but now this stuff is complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review: I always had issues with underarm rashes, regardless of which brand of deodorant I tried.  This one finally solved the problem, plus I don&#x27;t have any more deodorant stains on my clothes!  And equally importantly, it keeps the sweat smell away.  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of other anti-perspirants and travel a LOT in warm clients so need protection I can trust.... Almay has never failed.  I never have a problem with underarm irritation  and the scent-less formulation works for me too.  This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Not perfect but very good.</li>
            <li> Works when others did not. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Never found anything better for sensitive skin.  We have been using this for at least 15 years and it always goes out of stock quickly at local super store.  It is not that easy for me to find, so when I do I always have to stock up.  That being said, I am on my new batch of bottles and my only complaint is that I am not fond of the new design with the multiple holes on top.  With so many holes, it is too easy to administer more gel than necessary. (No doubt a marketing decision to garner the results of what is happening to us.)  We are going through this stuff like water, and I cannot imagine we are the only family experiencing this phenomenon.  With the new design, this product is becoming less affordable and I prefer the multiple slit design it used to have.  One can only hope they will go back to the old style top in the near future.  In the meantime, I may try covering some of the holes with heavy-duty tape.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I have used for over 20 years.  No staining, no scent.  Just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I suddenly developed a severe and uncomfortable reaction to the antiperspirant that I had used for many years and went in search of a hypoallergenic version. I was pleased to find this very affordable Almay version. I had some concerns about buying a gel because my previous experience with a gel was that it took too long to dry. This one, however, is fast drying and long lasting.  It is unscented and effective. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally gone through 20 different deodorants and all of them gave me the same sweat rash as the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first one that not only worked, but doesn&#x27;t make my underarms break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy it up in bulk so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it going out of stock LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not the pits ....</li>
