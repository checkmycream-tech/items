    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My wife is VERY happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Another plus is the delightful smell.</li>
            <li>repeat 2-3 weekly (for best results).</li>
            <li>This Biore product is perfect and priced for any budget!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Invisible pores and a flawless complexion?</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were both very happy with it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling great</li>
            <li>This felt great over my skin which was itchy from sunburn that is peeling.</li>
            <li>the micro-crystals worked great.  </li>
            <li>Happy to say, it did not.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective product.</li>
            <li>Charcoal products are supposed to be particularly good at pulling out oil and dirt from skin, so I was happy to try the charcoal pore</li>
            <li>The scent is mildy pleasant.</li>
            <li>Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Yep those are still for sale and amazon had a good deal.</li>
            <li>This cleanser did a good job of reducing the size of my pores</li>
            <li>After using for awhile, I can say that this product does do a good job of cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean, polished and it smells awesome!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>My pores have always been an issue and I love the difference this made!</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again and again!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>I bought this at Walgreens today and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>(Who doesn&#x27;t love how you can see the dirt/debris that is lifted from the pores!)</li>
            <li>Good product, but it would be a better deal if they gave you 5-6oz in a bottle instead of 3oz.</li>
            <li>Immediately rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer is an excellent product that leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>And it is very easy to use; you just massage it onto your face with just one pump of cream + warm water to rinse it</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent--that may be the allergen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for that, this is the perfect scrub for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>Biore is by far the best all around.</li>
            <li>- it is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I thought the scent was just okay; it wasn&#x27;t offensive.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the product is more like an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so I&#x27;m typically on top of washing my face.</li>
            <li>This one is my most favorite one.</li>
            <li>, that is as refreshing as the cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and I have used so many face washes..</li>
            <li>I love this as part of my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>Love the dispense mechanism, product works well,  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and smell of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Biore nose and face strips for years and love them.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll know more when I continue using it.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;pore minimizer&amp;#34; dispenses with a nice pump the amount you need to clean your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I wrote to the company to ask if this product contained the beads, which are becoming banned in many areas.  </li>
            <li>His large nose pores were clean and my cheek pores were greatly minimized and our skin is more smoother..</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin soft and glowing and my pores are greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a great cleaner and so far, it does appear to be shrinking the pores on my face.</li>
            <li>I picked this cleanser up more for the cleansing and tightening properties than for the pore minimizing, so this review will focus primarily on those features.</li>
            <li>The cleanser washed off easily and my skin felt tighter immediately after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is a gel with really fine charcoal particles to act as the exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Since I have very sensitive skin, I wondered if repeated usage would irritate my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Price point - wow, a very nice feeling, effective product at a decent price</li>
            <li>This scrub is almost fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and exfoliates brilliantly.  </li>
            <li>This is  a good facial cleanser that smells great and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>and this keeps my skin smooth and not bumpy.</li>
            <li>If your in need of a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer for a week now and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Overall I was really pleased with this wash, particularly for a &#x27;grocery store&#x27; type brand, as it has been much more effective than many pricier brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>And it actually smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>My skin looked healthy and radiant after my first use and each time I cleansed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face did not feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent is short lived; gone by the time you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>In fact, it kind of reminds me of the old Biore mask that you had to peel off, but in this case, no peeling off, it&#x27;s just the product working and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who this would be good for:  anyone with blackheads and oily skin, who is not actually allergic to much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have been using it for several weeks and report good results.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has a mildly abrasive texture that feels cleansing but not overly</li>
            <li>the fragrance is fairly mild.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be a great overall cleanser that left my skin very smooth after without any breakouts.</li>
            <li>guys, there are skin care products that you need...a cleanser to remove the dirt and oil and purify the skin (use in the morning), an exfoliant that helps further the cell renewal process and lifting off the top layer of dead skin cells (best to use at night), a toner for hydration and lotion with SPF</li>
            <li>I used it two days later, and it worked even better!</li>
            <li>It also gets a bit dry and flaky so I really like this product because it works great as an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>process is quite simple as you wash your face with warm water and you pump the charcoal pore minimizer on your hands and lather your face.  </li>
            <li>and I am actually quite thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But so far, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>the tightening and radiance go away pretty quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use, my eyebrow area was incredibly itchy and the entire area around my eyes was red and irritated.</li>
            <li>anything, right after you are done, you will start to feel your face feel as if there is still product on your face.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say the actually product is amazing</li>
            <li>This product does not work for my skin type, which is combination, nor did it work for my son, who is oily and has very large pores.</li>
            <li>While the recommended dosage is one full pump, I found that I didn&#x27;t need as much - a &amp;#34;pea and a half&amp;#34; was sufficient.</li>
            <li>so it was very strange to have this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>so I used it a few more times by itself to make sure it was the culprit and indeed it was.</li>
            <li>Just wish it contained less ingredients, but for the money it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Directions are quite simple: put warm water on face and hands, pump once into hands, lather, and gently rub on face.</li>
            <li>After using it, the skin on my race felt tighter but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li>I used my usual facial essence and moisturizer afterwards and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>The cream feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t know if it was used or not the sticker was already removed were it kept it sealed first time that this has happen to me</li>
            <li>mentioned above, I love the way the pump is set up.</li>
            <li>After using the product my face felt tighter but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li>The biggest shock was when I went to use it for the first time and out</li>
            <li>My skin was visibly clearer and brighter after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>love the product I actually use it as a body wash and nothing makes me feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I will most likely not switch to this product permanently.</li>
            <li>The Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>With the first application, the pores on my nose went away, and stayed that way until the evening.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the texture/consistency of this wash -- will it be gritty, foamy/sudsy, overly fragrant -- and was pleased with what was a fairly mild wash that isn&#x27;t too abrasive or rough and</li>
            <li>Since my large pores are mostly on my nose and surrounding areas, I will continue to use the scrub there only, and skip it on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, I really like the way this makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work fairly well - hard to tell without extended use</li>
            <li>Bummed because was really hoping it would make my disgustingly huge nose pores smaller-</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, not at oily and</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t really intensely get into skincare...</li>
            <li>it really just cleans them well</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower very night.</li>
            <li>The dispenser works very well and a dime sized bit of solution is dispensed on each compression.</li>
            <li>Cleans face and blemishes and really smooths my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>Here is the response I got (and the response was very quick):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will stick with my Ivory soap and BufPuf - altough who knows how much harm the BufPufs are doing in the landfill.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice anything</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very drying, although it&#x27;s not irritating, even if you have rosacea.</li>
            <li>(I have to say my chin and nose really looked a lot &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after using this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re really expecting pores to shrink or be minimized, you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does work very well.</li>
            <li>it was not nice, and I&#x27;m delighted to report that it has disappeared since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is ok, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll appreciate this products ability to clean deep and flush it your pores.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first time I used an exfoliating product that uses natural charcoal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I woke up the next day with a face full of hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cleanser is slightly grainy but not overly abrasive, has a very clean but not perfumey smell - foamed and rinsed very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see or feel a difference between the two products except that Biore is black (from the added charcoal, I suppose) and it has more of a gel consistency than the NIVEA.  </li>
            <li>The solution is relatively odor free which is a benefit to me as I am moderately sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Touting that you will see results after just one use is a pretty big claim; while it wasn&#x27;t entirely accurate for this user I definitely noticed a reduction in the blackheads that pepper my nose within three uses.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t feel as though this product lives up to its expectations in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless as a facial cleanser it foams up well, smells awesome and leaves my skin soft and ready for my evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing, my face felt clean (but not dry or tight) and smooth.</li>
            <li>Seems to clear up the skin really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid-forties natural redhead with very oily skin and rosacea.  </li>
            <li>wise- not sure if that is related to product or not.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try especially for the price.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s been no negative side effects that I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li>but if I don&#x27;t use it every day, the blackheads come right back.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and all my breakouts have cleared as well as ZERO new breakouts.</li>
            <li>The one draw back is that the cleanser is dark grey, which may bother some folks; however, the smell is pleasant, and it works as described, so I like it.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in years!</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t find anything that has worked for that!</li>
            <li>After using it 2 or 3 times per week for several week my pores are smaller and my skin looks better overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product works great and each time I have used Biore, I haven&#x27;t really been disappointed with their products because they have worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>Got this for my wife, and the first time she used it, she left it on longer than the instructions say, which is to wash away IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li>My skin smells so fresh and clean for at least an hour after using this pore minimizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually need as much as is distributed and the product would last longer if I had more control of the flow.</li>
            <li>My advice is to only use it no more than three times a week because it can be drying, and best to use at night with a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li>: Charcoal is way down on the ingredient list (3rd to last) but this probably makes it more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Tiny little grains, lovely delivery.  </li>
            <li>product itself is black, thick, and creamy, with very fine \\&quot;grit\\&quot; in it for mild exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>like there was no hope for clear skin.</li>
            <li>It does a god job of light exfoliation without causing trouble with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean pores quite well, and by doing so, it does make them appear less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>: it takes a minute or two to rinse it off completely.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin however.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product and plan to continue to use it 2 to 3 times a week and replace it once it is done, especially at this price</li>
            <li>It really helped to reduce my pores, especially around my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have far fewer breakouts too.</li>
            <li>I felt it working on my cheek area, forehead, near my nose</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really believe there&#x27;s such a product that minimizes pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have to be choosy with my cleaning</li>
            <li>Some people might be able to use this daily; but even if you have oily skin, try using it every few days to start with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that next morning my skin was so soft and my make-up became more brighter look than usual.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh and not tight, like other brands do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s black, but rinses thoroughly, leaving skin smooth and ready for whatever further treatment is necessary.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed my pores are smaller in appearance and my skin actually feels healthy vs dried out and starving for moisture.</li>
            <li>I had tried another new face wash at the same time</li>
            <li>Granted I was using plain bar soap and a wash cloth before switching to this but the results over just a few days of using Biore was amazing.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant contained in this product is Alumina which removes dull, rough, damaged skin cells from the surface allowing healthy new cells to emerge.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s similar to an old school</li>
            <li>It felt nice on the skin, but was difficult to rinse off.</li>
            <li>It dispenses easily from the pump and you only need a very small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe that, as the only other time that has happened to me was when I took oral doxycycline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, certainly, pores can be cleaned and made to look less visible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle on the skin, despite the dubious dark, gritty color.</li>
            <li>If you have deep or large pores that tend to gunk up and leave your face dotted with black pores</li>
            <li>There was slight exfoliating action and even my sensitive skin was not reddened or itchy post use.</li>
            <li>My face feels tight after I wash it with this because it dries it out so much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Happy to say, it did not.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product.</li>
            <li> Charcoal products are supposed to be particularly good at pulling out oil and dirt from skin, so I was happy to try the charcoal pore</li>

            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>

            <li> (Who doesn&#x27;t love how you can see the dirt/debris that is lifted from the pores!)</li>
            <li> Good product, but it would be a better deal if they gave you 5-6oz in a bottle instead of 3oz.</li>
            <li> Immediately rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer is an excellent product that leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> And it is very easy to use; you just massage it onto your face with just one pump of cream + warm water to rinse it</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent--that may be the allergen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for that, this is the perfect scrub for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Biore is by far the best all around.</li>
            <li> - it is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I thought the scent was just okay; it wasn&#x27;t offensive.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the product is more like an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I&#x27;m typically on top of washing my face.</li>
            <li> This one is my most favorite one.</li>
            <li> , that is as refreshing as the cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and I have used so many face washes..</li>
            <li> I love this as part of my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> Love the dispense mechanism, product works well,  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and smell of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Biore nose and face strips for years and love them.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll know more when I continue using it.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;pore minimizer&amp;#34; dispenses with a nice pump the amount you need to clean your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I wrote to the company to ask if this product contained the beads, which are becoming banned in many areas.  </li>
            <li> His large nose pores were clean and my cheek pores were greatly minimized and our skin is more smoother..</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin soft and glowing and my pores are greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a great cleaner and so far, it does appear to be shrinking the pores on my face.</li>
            <li> I picked this cleanser up more for the cleansing and tightening properties than for the pore minimizing, so this review will focus primarily on those features.</li>
            <li> The cleanser washed off easily and my skin felt tighter immediately after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is a gel with really fine charcoal particles to act as the exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, I wondered if repeated usage would irritate my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Price point - wow, a very nice feeling, effective product at a decent price</li>
            <li> This scrub is almost fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and exfoliates brilliantly.  </li>
            <li> This is  a good facial cleanser that smells great and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> and this keeps my skin smooth and not bumpy.</li>
            <li> If your in need of a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer for a week now and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Overall I was really pleased with this wash, particularly for a &#x27;grocery store&#x27; type brand, as it has been much more effective than many pricier brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> And it actually smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> My skin looked healthy and radiant after my first use and each time I cleansed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face did not feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent is short lived; gone by the time you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> In fact, it kind of reminds me of the old Biore mask that you had to peel off, but in this case, no peeling off, it&#x27;s just the product working and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who this would be good for:  anyone with blackheads and oily skin, who is not actually allergic to much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have been using it for several weeks and report good results.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a mildly abrasive texture that feels cleansing but not overly</li>
            <li> the fragrance is fairly mild.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be a great overall cleanser that left my skin very smooth after without any breakouts.</li>
            <li> guys, there are skin care products that you need...a cleanser to remove the dirt and oil and purify the skin (use in the morning), an exfoliant that helps further the cell renewal process and lifting off the top layer of dead skin cells (best to use at night), a toner for hydration and lotion with SPF</li>
            <li> I used it two days later, and it worked even better!</li>
            <li> It also gets a bit dry and flaky so I really like this product because it works great as an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> process is quite simple as you wash your face with warm water and you pump the charcoal pore minimizer on your hands and lather your face.  </li>
            <li> and I am actually quite thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But so far, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> the tightening and radiance go away pretty quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use, my eyebrow area was incredibly itchy and the entire area around my eyes was red and irritated.</li>
            <li> anything, right after you are done, you will start to feel your face feel as if there is still product on your face.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say the actually product is amazing</li>
            <li> This product does not work for my skin type, which is combination, nor did it work for my son, who is oily and has very large pores.</li>
            <li> While the recommended dosage is one full pump, I found that I didn&#x27;t need as much - a &amp;#34;pea and a half&amp;#34; was sufficient.</li>
            <li> so it was very strange to have this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> so I used it a few more times by itself to make sure it was the culprit and indeed it was.</li>
            <li> Just wish it contained less ingredients, but for the money it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Directions are quite simple: put warm water on face and hands, pump once into hands, lather, and gently rub on face.</li>
            <li> After using it, the skin on my race felt tighter but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li> I used my usual facial essence and moisturizer afterwards and my skin felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> The cream feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t know if it was used or not the sticker was already removed were it kept it sealed first time that this has happen to me</li>
            <li> mentioned above, I love the way the pump is set up.</li>
            <li> After using the product my face felt tighter but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> The biggest shock was when I went to use it for the first time and out</li>
            <li> My skin was visibly clearer and brighter after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> love the product I actually use it as a body wash and nothing makes me feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I will most likely not switch to this product permanently.</li>
            <li> The Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> With the first application, the pores on my nose went away, and stayed that way until the evening.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the texture/consistency of this wash -- will it be gritty, foamy/sudsy, overly fragrant -- and was pleased with what was a fairly mild wash that isn&#x27;t too abrasive or rough and</li>
            <li> Since my large pores are mostly on my nose and surrounding areas, I will continue to use the scrub there only, and skip it on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, I really like the way this makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well - hard to tell without extended use</li>
            <li> Bummed because was really hoping it would make my disgustingly huge nose pores smaller-</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, not at oily and</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t really intensely get into skincare...</li>
            <li> it really just cleans them well</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower very night.</li>
            <li> The dispenser works very well and a dime sized bit of solution is dispensed on each compression.</li>
            <li> Cleans face and blemishes and really smooths my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> Here is the response I got (and the response was very quick):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I will stick with my Ivory soap and BufPuf - altough who knows how much harm the BufPufs are doing in the landfill.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice anything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very drying, although it&#x27;s not irritating, even if you have rosacea.</li>
            <li> (I have to say my chin and nose really looked a lot &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after using this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re really expecting pores to shrink or be minimized, you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does work very well.</li>
            <li> it was not nice, and I&#x27;m delighted to report that it has disappeared since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is ok, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll appreciate this products ability to clean deep and flush it your pores.  </li>
            <li> but this is the first time I used an exfoliating product that uses natural charcoal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I woke up the next day with a face full of hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cleanser is slightly grainy but not overly abrasive, has a very clean but not perfumey smell - foamed and rinsed very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see or feel a difference between the two products except that Biore is black (from the added charcoal, I suppose) and it has more of a gel consistency than the NIVEA.  </li>
            <li> The solution is relatively odor free which is a benefit to me as I am moderately sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Touting that you will see results after just one use is a pretty big claim; while it wasn&#x27;t entirely accurate for this user I definitely noticed a reduction in the blackheads that pepper my nose within three uses.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t feel as though this product lives up to its expectations in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless as a facial cleanser it foams up well, smells awesome and leaves my skin soft and ready for my evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing, my face felt clean (but not dry or tight) and smooth.</li>
            <li> Seems to clear up the skin really well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-forties natural redhead with very oily skin and rosacea.  </li>
            <li> wise- not sure if that is related to product or not.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try especially for the price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been no negative side effects that I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t use it every day, the blackheads come right back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and all my breakouts have cleared as well as ZERO new breakouts.</li>
            <li> The one draw back is that the cleanser is dark grey, which may bother some folks; however, the smell is pleasant, and it works as described, so I like it.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in years!</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t find anything that has worked for that!</li>
            <li> After using it 2 or 3 times per week for several week my pores are smaller and my skin looks better overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product works great and each time I have used Biore, I haven&#x27;t really been disappointed with their products because they have worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, and the first time she used it, she left it on longer than the instructions say, which is to wash away IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> My skin smells so fresh and clean for at least an hour after using this pore minimizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually need as much as is distributed and the product would last longer if I had more control of the flow.</li>
            <li> My advice is to only use it no more than three times a week because it can be drying, and best to use at night with a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> : Charcoal is way down on the ingredient list (3rd to last) but this probably makes it more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Tiny little grains, lovely delivery.  </li>
            <li> product itself is black, thick, and creamy, with very fine \\&quot;grit\\&quot; in it for mild exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> like there was no hope for clear skin.</li>
            <li> It does a god job of light exfoliation without causing trouble with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean pores quite well, and by doing so, it does make them appear less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> : it takes a minute or two to rinse it off completely.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin however.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and plan to continue to use it 2 to 3 times a week and replace it once it is done, especially at this price</li>
            <li> It really helped to reduce my pores, especially around my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have far fewer breakouts too.</li>
            <li> I felt it working on my cheek area, forehead, near my nose</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really believe there&#x27;s such a product that minimizes pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be choosy with my cleaning</li>
            <li> Some people might be able to use this daily; but even if you have oily skin, try using it every few days to start with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that next morning my skin was so soft and my make-up became more brighter look than usual.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel fresh and not tight, like other brands do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black, but rinses thoroughly, leaving skin smooth and ready for whatever further treatment is necessary.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed my pores are smaller in appearance and my skin actually feels healthy vs dried out and starving for moisture.</li>
            <li> I had tried another new face wash at the same time</li>
            <li> Granted I was using plain bar soap and a wash cloth before switching to this but the results over just a few days of using Biore was amazing.</li>
            <li> The exfoliant contained in this product is Alumina which removes dull, rough, damaged skin cells from the surface allowing healthy new cells to emerge.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s similar to an old school</li>
            <li> It felt nice on the skin, but was difficult to rinse off.</li>
            <li> It dispenses easily from the pump and you only need a very small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe that, as the only other time that has happened to me was when I took oral doxycycline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, certainly, pores can be cleaned and made to look less visible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle on the skin, despite the dubious dark, gritty color.</li>
            <li> If you have deep or large pores that tend to gunk up and leave your face dotted with black pores</li>
            <li> There was slight exfoliating action and even my sensitive skin was not reddened or itchy post use.</li>
            <li> My face feels tight after I wash it with this because it dries it out so much.</li>
            <li> and I feel like this size bottle will last a long while.</li>
            <li> We both found the Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer to be overly drying, so neither of us could use it for long enough to see if it shrank our pores.</li>
            <li> The Biore website doesn&#x27;t have a search engine, so it&#x27;s not clear if this is actually gluten-free.</li>
            <li> the dry red patches are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black color is a little offsetting at first</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it everyday because it dries up my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is not professional microdemabrasion,</li>
            <li> Just be careful depending on your skin type...if you tend to have dry skin like myself, don&#x27;t over-do it; especially in the winter weather.</li>
            <li> It starts out as black, but after rubbing it in my palms and on my face for a minute or so, it turns white as it deep cleans my pores.</li>
            <li> I had what looked like a large blackhead on my nose, which, I was told was actually from a broken blood vessel.</li>
            <li> I wish other facial products used this type of system.</li>
            <li> , it looks to me that alumina (aluminum oxide), is not plastic, but the phrasing makes me wonder if it could have other issues that could cause it to be banned in the future.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, this product (or any other) cannot actually &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; the size of pores but rather alter their appearance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or itchy.  </li>
            <li> I would say I have combination skin that has been extremely dry this winter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little abrasive, but not so much that it rubs your face raw.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with adult acne for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t need that much personally, so I compress the bottle only half way to get less solution.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers well and has a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to it to scrub deep.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are to wet one&#x27;s face and hands, then to spread one pump of the charcoal pore minimizer, to rub it in and then rinse immediately.  </li>
            <li> I see absolutely no difference with this stuff...</li>
            <li> I also use the pore strips but find them a bit messy compared to the traditional pore strips</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the $$ side due to the limited amount of product in each bottle but it does go a long ways.  </li>
            <li> I use the buf puf every other day or so with the Biore cleanser, and the other times I wash my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely drying.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something other than just  an exfoliating scrub for my face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer and I would plan to try the other products in the charcoal line.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to the product, which suggests not more than 2-3 uses per week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;Easy to pack up for travel or other out-of-home use</li>
            <li> skin became a little bit dry afterwards</li>
            <li> The scrub particles were not too rough although it took a little time cleaning off the layer on my face.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, if you have a break-out it may be hard to isolate/</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s hard to control the amount I use.</li>
            <li> Nothing to hate about it, nothing to love about it, it does the job.</li>
            <li> so I may update this review down the line.  </li>
            <li> Had not cut down on breakouts or black heads.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t buy drugstore brands but figured I&#x27;d take a chance on this since charcoal is well charcoal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with something less drying.</li>
            <li> Using it two or three times a week, my forehead, nose and surrounding area are less oily than they were.</li>
            <li> came this BLACK ooze.  </li>
            <li> Yep, the product is black.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I wasn&#x27;t expecting black.  </li>
            <li> (Freeman charcoal and black sugar polishing mask)</li>
            <li> However, I would caution a user to use just a bit and to apply slight pressure to skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this product isn&#x27;t the prettiest thing - a black gel like cleanser -</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected out of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few minutes, my cheeks/sides of my face (which are drier than the rest of my oily skin) began to burn slightly and feel tight.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my skin care and the brands I use.  When I read about charcoal and it&#x27;s benefits I decided I had to try.  I typically don&#x27;t buy drugstore brands but figured I&#x27;d take a chance on this since charcoal is well charcoal.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This leaves my skin soft and glowing and my pores are greatly reduced.  My pores have always been an issue and I love the difference this made!</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few weeks but my skin has gotten slightly worse, acne wise- not sure if that is related to product or not.  Bummed because was really hoping it would make my disgustingly huge nose pores smaller- maybe it will eventually, my fingers are crossed!  So far I can&#x27;t find anything that has worked for that!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but I try to exfoliate regularly to minimize my pores and prevent blackheads.  Charcoal products are supposed to be particularly good at pulling out oil and dirt from skin, so I was happy to try the charcoal pore minimizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pore minimizer comes out through a pump which leaked a little by the time it arrived. While the recommended dosage is one full pump, I found that I didn&#x27;t need as much - a &amp;#34;pea and a half&amp;#34; was sufficient. The instructions are to wet one&#x27;s face and hands, then to spread one pump of the charcoal pore minimizer, to rub it in and then rinse immediately.  After using it, the skin on my race felt tighter but not uncomfortably so.  I used my usual facial essence and moisturizer afterwards and my skin felt wonderful. To tell just how well it works, I&#x27;ll have to try it for extended period of time (twice a week instead of my regular exfoliant), and can update my review.  But in the meantime, I&#x27;ve added it to my skin regimen and it seems a bargain for its quality.</li>
            <li> My wife is VERY happy with this product. She says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this Biore Charcoal deep cleanser. The cream feels soft and smooth. I like the feel of the charcoal micro-crystals element in the cream during massaging. The scent is mildy pleasant. After I put it on, my skin feels noticeably smoother; it&#x27;s really a big difference! And it is very easy to use; you just massage it onto your face with just one pump of cream + warm water to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that some people might consider a problem: it takes a minute or two to rinse it off completely. So, if you are in a rush, that could be annoying. Personally, though, I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin became a little bit dry afterwards so I recommend to put lotion on the face after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that next morning my skin was so soft and my make-up became more brighter look than usual.  I want to use it every day but it says &amp;#34;use up to 2-3 times per week.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It broke my face out after 2 washes. I do have sensitive skin however. I also didn&#x27;t see minimization of my pores.</li>
            <li> This is  a good facial cleanser that smells great and leaves my skin feeling very soft. However I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has improved the appearance of my pores in any way. I have always been bothered by the size of the pores around my nose and am always looking for something that will do just as this product claims to do: minimize them. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t feel as though this product lives up to its expectations in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless as a facial cleanser it foams up well, smells awesome and leaves my skin soft and ready for my evening moisturizer. I use this product in between my face cleansing/make-up removing wipe and night time face cream.</li>
            <li> Just received it not happy the packaging looked like was already open because the liquid was already out I was so looking forward to using it but I can&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t know if it was used or not the sticker was already removed were it kept it sealed first time that this has happen to me not happy 😡 Then the cap won&#x27;t close ..</li>
            <li> Horrible product- Wish the manufacturer kept with marketing and making the Biore Pore Detoxifying Foam Cleanser - it is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Having used just about every pore minimizer/scrub/acne product known to man, I had almost zero expectations that this product would do anything. \\&quot;Visible results after one use?\\&quot;  Uh-huh. Suuuure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is black, thick, and creamy, with very fine \\&quot;grit\\&quot; in it for mild exfoliation.  It felt nice on the skin, but was difficult to rinse off. My face did not feel clean afterwards. But my pores had shrunk! I really couldn&#x27;t believe that, as the only other time that has happened to me was when I took oral doxycycline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few minutes, my cheeks/sides of my face (which are drier than the rest of my oily skin) began to burn slightly and feel tight. Since my large pores are mostly on my nose and surrounding areas, I will continue to use the scrub there only, and skip it on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because this doesn&#x27;t rinse well, and I had to use a toner to get off the (invisible) residue.  But I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product. Just be careful depending on your skin type...if you tend to have dry skin like myself, don&#x27;t over-do it; especially in the winter weather. Some people might be able to use this daily; but even if you have oily skin, try using it every few days to start with. Charcoal (just like kaolin clay) draws out the impurities it can bring everything to the surface at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned above, I love the way the pump is set up. I wish other facial products used this type of system. Efficient and prevents the introduction of germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Charcoal is way down on the ingredient list (3rd to last) but this probably makes it more gentle on the skin. At the same time, if you have a break-out it may be hard to isolate/determine if the charcoal is the culprit or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, alumina, sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropy, betaine, sorbitol, glycerine, laureth-4, carboxolic acid, ethylhexylglycerin, acrylates/C10-30 alklacrylate crosspolymer, xanthan gum, methylparaben, fragrance, sodium hydroxide, polyqauternium-39, ethylparaben, disodium EDTA, charcoal powder, benzophenone-4, methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how it actually reduced the size of my pores and made my face smoother. I love it and will buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> This product is a gel with really fine charcoal particles to act as the exfoliant. This felt great over my skin which was itchy from sunburn that is peeling. The gel actually relieved some of the itching. It left my face feeling soft. I have had this for only a week, so it is still too soon to tell if my pores are being reduced. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for that, this is the perfect scrub for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for a couple of weeks and am blown away by the difference. Granted I was using plain bar soap and a wash cloth before switching to this but the results over just a few days of using Biore was amazing. My skin is much smoother, not at oily and the dry red patches are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use I decided to up the exfoliation by using this with a buf puf. Yep those are still for sale and amazon had a good deal. I use the buf puf every other day or so with the Biore cleanser, and the other times I wash my face I just use the Biore. I am a convert.</li>
            <li> This cleanser did a good job of reducing the size of my pores but I didn&#x27;t find the results to be long-lasting.  This is a product that needs to be used on a daily basis to see results.  I thought the scent was just okay; it wasn&#x27;t offensive.  The texture of the product is more like an exfoliant. It does have some grit to it so if that bothers you this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  After using the product my face felt tighter but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no difference with this stuff... Perhaps it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t really intensely get into skincare... I have oily skin, so I&#x27;m typically on top of washing my face. But this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference to my pores. It&#x27;s extremely drying. My face feels tight after I wash it with this because it dries it out so much. I have to apply lotion afterward because it&#x27;s so drying. I like the consistency- like a gel with some abrasive charcoal bits. And it actually smells pretty good! I haven&#x27;t had any sort of a reaction (I know some people complain of redness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this. I&#x27;ll stick with something less drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already signed up for subscribe and save of this product after using it for a few weeks.  It&#x27;s a little on the $$ side due to the limited amount of product in each bottle but it does go a long ways.  If you have deep or large pores that tend to gunk up and leave your face dotted with black pores then you&#x27;ll appreciate this products ability to clean deep and flush it your pores.  It does NOT make your pores smaller... it really just cleans them well so they &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; smaller.  This is somewhat misleading.  The dispenser works well, it&#x27;s similar to an old school AquaFresh toothpaste pump and you only need to use about the same amount as you would to brush your teeth.  It lathers well and has a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to it to scrub deep.  The black color is a little offsetting at first but it lathers white.  Good product, but it would be a better deal if they gave you 5-6oz in a bottle instead of 3oz.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my eyebrow area was incredibly itchy and the entire area around my eyes was red and irritated. I had tried another new face wash at the same time so I used it a few more times by itself to make sure it was the culprit and indeed it was. It irritated my skin so bad that my face itched the entire day. I do not have sensitive skin at all so it was very strange to have this kind of reaction. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Using it two or three times a week, my forehead, nose and surrounding area are less oily than they were. I had what looked like a large blackhead on my nose, which, I was told was actually from a broken blood vessel. Whatever it was. it was not nice, and I&#x27;m delighted to report that it has disappeared since I started using this product. Saved me an expensive laser treatment at the dermatologist&#x27;s. Pleasant scent is short lived; gone by the time you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Looooooove this! I have tried a lot of cleansers from organic to harsh, from cheap to crazy expensive, from over the counter to prescription wash. This one is my most favorite one. It makes my skin feel clean, polished and it smells awesome!!!  And it&#x27;s affordable. I can&#x27;t use it everyday because it dries up my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; as it claims to be, but I still like it. It definitely helps with the blackheads. The bottle suggests that you use it 2-3 times a week but if I don&#x27;t use it every day, the blackheads come right back. It makes my skin super soft and smells amazing. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something other than just  an exfoliating scrub for my face. This is pretty good. My face feels clean after using it. One pump is plenty to wash your face. I use this in the shower very night. I don&#x27;t know if it does any mind-blowing type stuff to my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t harm anything. I probably won&#x27;t be a regular user of this, but I&#x27;ll buy it once in a while.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, with oily T zone and breakouts on chin, cheeks, forehead, and very painful deep cystic acne now and then. I have suffered with adult acne for the past 2 years. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and all my breakouts have cleared as well as ZERO new breakouts. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in years! I have also noticed my pores are smaller in appearance and my skin actually feels healthy vs dried out and starving for moisture. I have tried and failed: Neutrogena acne treatment kits; Proactive; Clearasil; Burts Bees; Prescription creaks and antibiotics. Nothing has worked until this product! Please try this out, especially if you were getting like I was and feeling like there was no hope for clear skin. I use this twice daily and just can&#x27;t recommend this product enough it&#x27;s life changing! Bye bye cover up!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with my pores immediately after using this wash. I use it before bed twice a week and I feel like this size bottle will last a long while. Definitely worth a try especially for the price. Clinique is pushing the same charcoal face wash for $27.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well - hard to tell without extended use so I may update this review down the line.  Skin did feel smoother and &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after use though.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or itchy.  The biggest shock was when I went to use it for the first time and out came this BLACK ooze.  Yep, the product is black.  For whatever reason, I wasn&#x27;t expecting black.  But hey, I&#x27;m also a guy and can&#x27;t say as though my day to day routine revolves around beauty products if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great cleaner and so far, it does appear to be shrinking the pores on my face.</li>
            <li> I picked this cleanser up more for the cleansing and tightening properties than for the pore minimizing, so this review will focus primarily on those features. My thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The dispenser works very well and a dime sized bit of solution is dispensed on each compression. (I don&#x27;t need that much personally, so I compress the bottle only half way to get less solution.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The solution is relatively odor free which is a benefit to me as I am moderately sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The cleanser has a mildly abrasive texture that feels cleansing but not overly harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The cleanser washed off easily and my skin felt tighter immediately after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. My skin looked healthy and radiant after my first use and each time I cleansed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Price point - wow, a very nice feeling, effective product at a decent price, that is as refreshing as the cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The color of the product is off-putting, an ugly grey black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The cleanser does not suds up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This is not professional microdemabrasion, the tightening and radiance go away pretty quickly after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and plan to continue to use it 2 to 3 times a week and replace it once it is done, especially at this price point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I am a product junky and I have used so many face washes.. I bought this at Walgreens today and I&#x27;m in love! You can feel your skin breathing when u finish washing. I also use the pore strips but find them a bit messy compared to the traditional pore strips but they did seem to work also. But anyways you will not regret buying this product! I can feel my skin already clearing up! XD</li>
            <li> Love this! Somewhat feels like a scrub!</li>
            <li> I love this as part of my cleansing routine. I used it twice a week along with steaming and a clay mask. It really helped to reduce my pores, especially around my nose and cheeks. I have far fewer breakouts too. My advice is to only use it no more than three times a week because it can be drying, and best to use at night with a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer is an excellent product that leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean. It starts out as black, but after rubbing it in my palms and on my face for a minute or so, it turns white as it deep cleans my pores. The charcoal feels like it is drawing out all the impurities and blackheads. My skin was visibly clearer and brighter after the first time I used it. After using it 2 or 3 times per week for several week my pores are smaller and my skin looks better overall. The only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s hard to control the amount I use. One squeeze of the handle distributes a pre-measured amount of Biore. I don&#x27;t usually need as much as is distributed and the product would last longer if I had more control of the flow. Another plus is the delightful smell. My skin smells so fresh and clean for at least an hour after using this pore minimizer. I will continue to use Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer and I would plan to try the other products in the charcoal line.</li>
            <li> Cleans face and blemishes and really smooths my skin.  I have really oily skin and this keeps my skin smooth and not bumpy.</li>
            <li> First I want to say the actually product is amazing but it&#x27;s a ripe off... This is the same product as the Biore Charcoal Cleanser in a smaller bottle.  You can buy the Biore Charcoal Cleanser on Amazon for $3.86 and its 6.7 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product I actually use it as a body wash and nothing makes me feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of pore minimizing products. Biore is by far the best all around.</li>
            <li> Another bad and now the last Biore product purchase.  I&#x27;ve tried all the deep pore product line and I&#x27;ve been truly disappointed. If your in need of a great facial scrub. I have finally found the holy grail... (Freeman charcoal and black sugar polishing mask)</li>
            <li> Love the dispense mechanism, product works well,  Just wish it contained less ingredients, but for the money it&#x27;s good stuff.  I would only buy again if I got a deal on it.  Nothing to hate about it, nothing to love about it, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Was opened when I received it.  Other than that it is ok, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I have used Biore products for years but this is the first time I used an exfoliating product that uses natural charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is quite simple as you wash your face with warm water and you pump the charcoal pore minimizer on your hands and lather your face.  Then you wash immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have utilized this for a few days and I have not had problems with any burning sensation, nor did it smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, right after you are done, you will start to feel your face feel as if there is still product on your face.  In fact, it kind of reminds me of the old Biore mask that you had to peel off, but in this case, no peeling off, it&#x27;s just the product working and the micro-crystals worked great.  I felt it working on my cheek area, forehead, near my nose and I am actually quite thrilled with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For guys, there are skin care products that you need...a cleanser to remove the dirt and oil and purify the skin (use in the morning), an exfoliant that helps further the cell renewal process and lifting off the top layer of dead skin cells (best to use at night), a toner for hydration and lotion with SPF if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, definitely continue to use the cleanser for when you wake up, use the Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer before you go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product works great and each time I have used Biore, I haven&#x27;t really been disappointed with their products because they have worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Touting that you will see results after just one use is a pretty big claim; while it wasn&#x27;t entirely accurate for this user I definitely noticed a reduction in the blackheads that pepper my nose within three uses.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the texture/consistency of this wash -- will it be gritty, foamy/sudsy, overly fragrant -- and was pleased with what was a fairly mild wash that isn&#x27;t too abrasive or rough and the fragrance is fairly mild.  I would say I have combination skin that has been extremely dry this winter and this wash doesn&#x27;t seem to exacerbate the dryness.  Overall I was really pleased with this wash, particularly for a &#x27;grocery store&#x27; type brand, as it has been much more effective than many pricier brands I have tried.  This is likely to be a product I will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> First of all, I really like the way this makes my face feel.  It does a god job of light exfoliation without causing trouble with my sensitive skin.  However, after I started using this I learned about the trouble that the micro-beads used in face washes are causing with our water ecosystem.  I wrote to the company to ask if this product contained the beads, which are becoming banned in many areas.  Here is the response I got (and the response was very quick):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The exfoliant contained in this product is Alumina which removes dull, rough, damaged skin cells from the surface allowing healthy new cells to emerge. This ingredient does not meet the currently regulatory definition of a microplastic bead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it looks to me that alumina (aluminum oxide), is not plastic, but the phrasing makes me wonder if it could have other issues that could cause it to be banned in the future.  This makes me uncomfortable about buying more.  Perhaps I will stick with my Ivory soap and BufPuf - altough who knows how much harm the BufPufs are doing in the landfill.</li>
            <li> Used on myself and husband. Directions are quite simple: put warm water on face and hands, pump once into hands, lather, and gently rub on face. Immediately rinse with warm water. repeat 2-3 weekly (for best results). The scrub particles were not too rough although it took a little time cleaning off the layer on my face.  The smell was fine, the color was a little gruesome to me, but the immediate result was clear with both of us. His large nose pores were clean and my cheek pores were greatly minimized and our skin is more smoother.. I will definitely be keeping this around!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of weeks now.  I switched from NIVEA MEN face scrub in order to try this product.  I don&#x27;t see or feel a difference between the two products except that Biore is black (from the added charcoal, I suppose) and it has more of a gel consistency than the NIVEA.  I have not experienced the results claimed on the packaging.  I will most likely not switch to this product permanently.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, and the first time she used it, she left it on longer than the instructions say, which is to wash away IMMEDIATELY.  She had a bit of a redness reaction to her cheeks, which make sense since there&#x27;s carbon bits in this.  I tried it also, it immediately pulls away all oil, dirt, grime in seconds.  Unbelievable stuff.  Seems to clear up the skin really well.  Follow the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice anything but I like how my skins feels so theres that?</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every &amp;#34;pore reducing cleanser&amp;#34; in the drugstore. I&#x27;ve used this three times a week for two weeks now. It has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> Had not cut down on breakouts or black heads. Does not dry out skin. No better than cheaper products. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer does exactly what it says. It reduces the size of pores in one application. I have been using this for over a week, using it as directed (2-3 times a week). With the first application, the pores on my nose went away, and stayed that way until the evening. I used it two days later, and it worked even better! Since I have very sensitive skin, I wondered if repeated usage would irritate my fair skin. Happy to say, it did not. No redness or soreness at all. In the past, I&#x27;ve used some very expensive and brand-named pore cleansers...no more. This Biore product is perfect and priced for any budget! Recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s a little abrasive, but not so much that it rubs your face raw. I love the feel and smell of it. It makes my face feel fresh and not tight, like other brands do. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;pore minimizer&amp;#34; dispenses with a nice pump the amount you need to clean your face and neck.  It reminds me a bit of an apricot scrub, but the scrubbing particles are finer.  There is definitely a &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to the product, which suggests not more than 2-3 uses per week.  It seems to clean pores quite well, and by doing so, it does make them appear less noticeable.  The one draw back is that the cleanser is dark grey, which may bother some folks; however, the smell is pleasant, and it works as described, so I like it.</li>
            <li> Tiny little grains, lovely delivery.  This scrub is almost fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, and exfoliates brilliantly.  It&#x27;s black, but rinses thoroughly, leaving skin smooth and ready for whatever further treatment is necessary.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-forties natural redhead with very oily skin and rosacea.  I thought this was neat--it made my pores instantly smaller. However, I woke up the next day with a face full of hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it is:  tiny particles of charcoal in a flower-scented gel, meant to be used as a face wash two or three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does:  this minimizes pores, instantly, just like the claims on the package.  It&#x27;s also very drying, although it&#x27;s not irritating, even if you have rosacea. It causes hives, though. It has a very strong scent--that may be the allergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who this would be good for:  anyone with blackheads and oily skin, who is not actually allergic to much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this has no gluten-containing ingredients, but it doesn&#x27;t say, \\&quot;gluten-free,\\&quot; on the package. The Biore website doesn&#x27;t have a search engine, so it&#x27;s not clear if this is actually gluten-free. I actually emailed the company to ask if this is, in fact, gluten-free, and they never responded.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this product (or any other) cannot actually &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; the size of pores but rather alter their appearance. After using for awhile, I can say that this product does do a good job of cleaning out my pores. I can&#x27;t say they look smaller however, they do look a lot cleaner and that is why I would use this product regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing, my face felt clean (but not dry or tight) and smooth. There was slight exfoliating action and even my sensitive skin was not reddened or itchy post use. However, I would caution a user to use just a bit and to apply slight pressure to skin. I suspect some folks are rubbing a bit too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Biore nose and face strips for years and love them. (Who doesn&#x27;t love how you can see the dirt/debris that is lifted from the pores!) and I will continue to use them. This product is NOT a replacement for them from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add this product to my skin care regimen as a weekly or bi-weekly cleanser. (I have to say my chin and nose really looked a lot &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after using this product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Easy to dispense and use&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Easy to pack up for travel or other out-of-home use&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Doesn&#x27;t smell or have any type of fragrance (a plus for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;If you&#x27;re really expecting pores to shrink or be minimized, you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net-net: Think of it as a deep facial cleanser for periodic use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected out of this product. Invisible pores and a flawless complexion? A miracle, perhaps? Unfortunately, my family received no miraculous results. This product does not work for my skin type, which is combination, nor did it work for my son, who is oily and has very large pores. We both found the Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer to be overly drying, so neither of us could use it for long enough to see if it shrank our pores. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really believe there&#x27;s such a product that minimizes pores. In fact, I think it&#x27;s been proven. However, certainly, pores can be cleaned and made to look less visible. I&#x27;ve used this Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer for a week now and so far, so good. I have combination oily skin and darker pores on my nose, which I hate. It also gets a bit dry and flaky so I really like this product because it works great as an exfoliant. It&#x27;s also gentle on the skin, despite the dubious dark, gritty color. And there&#x27;s hardly and scent which is huge for me since I can&#x27;t abide any face products that smell bad. There&#x27;s plenty of product in the bottle so it should last you quite a while, especially since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it at one time. There&#x27;s been no negative side effects that I&#x27;ve seen but I&#x27;ll know more when I continue using it. But so far, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this product isn&#x27;t the prettiest thing - a black gel like cleanser - but it does work very well. Both my husband and I have been using it for several weeks and report good results. He has problems with pores and it did indeed minimize (although not eliminate) pores. I found it to be a great overall cleanser that left my skin very smooth after without any breakouts. I have sensitive skin and have to be choosy with my cleaning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is slightly grainy but not overly abrasive, has a very clean but not perfumey smell - foamed and rinsed very well. It dispenses easily from the pump and you only need a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both very happy with it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
