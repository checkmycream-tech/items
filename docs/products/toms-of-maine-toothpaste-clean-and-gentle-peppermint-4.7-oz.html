            <li>It has a good consistency that holds up on the brush (not runny like Burt&#x27;s Bees).</li>
            <li>(what was the foam good for anyway?</li>
            <li>Taste is good.</li>
            <li>Good product, the price is obscene for just one tube.</li>
            <li>It also tastes good and whitens my teeth.</li>
            <li>To be honest, though, it&#x27;s not as good at polishing stains as a grittier toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>Great if you are looking for a sls free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>understand it acts as a foaming agent, but it feels like soap to me, and even my own saliva tastes foul for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is a pleasant mint flavor, and I find the lack of foam to be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>(I tried both ways and my teeth are better with the fluoride) to anything else.</li>
            <li>This is quite simply the best toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Sorry for being so in depth, but I am sure this will be valuable information to some.</li>
            <li>but it does an excellent job at cleaning and maintaining oral hygiene just like any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Very gentle in my mouth and has a nice taste.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product, better than what I thought was my favorite (Burt&#x27;s Bees).</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) free.</li>
            <li>He also says it makes his teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product because it is the only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t cause me canker soars but it has a funny after taste</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and they were justified.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Love it all the same though.</li>
            <li>(To be honest, if you are going crazy over tonsil stones/halitosis/etc, or any other problem in your life for that matter, it&#x27;s best to see what is being inputted into said scenario</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for canker sore sufferers!</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li>I switched to this brand after Rembrandt discontinued their Gentle formula toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I suffer from chronic canker sores, and this toothpaste works very well to prevent them.</li>
            <li>This really made me think about life for a while..</li>
            <li>It tastes pleasant and subtly minty.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling as thoroughly clean as some of the big brands, though I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s all mental.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are decent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend still, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Research that I have done online, along with personal experience/experimentation/observation has shown me that SLS messes with natural hormone levels; and comparing this toothpaste to your regular ultrabrite or colgate, ingredients in regular toothpaste have been responsible for spikes in dermal acne around my face, canker sores on my tongue and mouth, and halitosis/tonsil stones.</li>
            <li>What confused me most is why I would get tonsil stones using regular toothpaste, but I realized that it caused my tonsils to swell, and just the same was happening with my tongue.</li>
            <li>Other than the high cost  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only toothpaste that cured by canker sore issue. The lack of SLS (sodium laureth sulfate) helps keep canker sores at bay. To be honest, though, it&#x27;s not as good at polishing stains as a grittier toothpaste. Love it all the same though.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes truly terrible. Weird weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I just received this toothpaste, and therefore have only just started using it. I give it four stars, with re-evaluation to follow. I searched for and purchased this toothpaste because it has no SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) in it.  Some references suggest that SLS can cause canker sores in the mouth.  SLS is not really needed in toothpaste, as it is a foaming agent.  Neither my primary doctor nor my dentist offered any treatment for the continuous canker sores on my tongue that I have been dealing with in the past few months.  Research found this possible causal link, and as I have nothing to lose, I decided to try it.  The toothpaste is a pleasant mint flavor, and I find the lack of foam to be just fine.  Only time will tell if it helps stop the canker sores.</li>
            <li> Amazing results. My gums felt like they were on fire until I started using this. Won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my son gets horrible canker sores and I suspected the SLS additive in most toothpaste. Tom&#x27;s of Maqine does not contain SLS. I had high hopes and they were justified.  My son has not had a canker sore since he started using this toothpaste and he likes the taste. He also says it makes his teeth feel really clean.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I must use SLS-free toothpaste due to allergy. There are not many options out there. And the options are usually always lacking something and very expensive. This is my new favorite product, better than what I thought was my favorite (Burt&#x27;s Bees). It has a good consistency that holds up on the brush (not runny like Burt&#x27;s Bees). It tastes pleasant and subtly minty. It has the added fluoride and whitening that I want and usually have to sacrifice to get SLS-free. Highly recommend this for canker sore sufferers! Glad I found this. Will be reordering to restock my bathroom cabinet with Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. It foams less than SLS-containing types, but after getting used to this I find that I prefer it as a feature (what was the foam good for anyway? it was just messy). Taste is good. Ingredients are decent. I like the peppermint over other flavors and I prefer Tom&#x27;s SLS-free peppermint with fluoride (I tried both ways and my teeth are better with the fluoride) to anything else.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. Very gentle in my mouth and has a nice taste. I would buy again. the price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I switched to this brand after Rembrandt discontinued their Gentle formula toothpaste. I suffer from chronic canker sores, and this toothpaste works very well to prevent them. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste for me. Because of my decreasing gums. It has no SLS in it, and has a great taste.Leaves your teeth with a polish feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product because it is the only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t cause me canker soars but it has a funny after taste</li>
            <li> Other than the high cost  I like this produce.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best toothpaste I have ever used. I was looking for something without sodium lauryl sulfate, not for any health reasons, but because I find the feeling and taste displeasing. I mean, really, why not brush with shampoo or soap if your water is fluorinated? Remember when our parents punished us that way? Why do we put it in toothpaste? Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand it acts as a foaming agent, but it feels like soap to me, and even my own saliva tastes foul for hours afterwards. That plus the odd taste of the artificial sweeteners finally got to me. Baking soda and other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; alternatives eliminated the aftertastes, but were not much better to brush with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste lathers nicely, smells, and tastes wonderful. Well done, Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> Great for canker sore sufferers.  Doesn&#x27;t lather or foam up as well as regular toothpastes because it&#x27;s SLS-free, but that&#x27;s what makes those toothpastes extremely painful on canker sores.  This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth as minty fresh tasting as other toothpastes, but definitely worth the tradeoff to not be irritating and painful on canker sores.</li>
            <li> Those of you affected by SLS like I am will take this toothpaste as a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research that I have done online, along with personal experience/experimentation/observation has shown me that SLS messes with natural hormone levels; and comparing this toothpaste to your regular ultrabrite or colgate, ingredients in regular toothpaste have been responsible for spikes in dermal acne around my face, canker sores on my tongue and mouth, and halitosis/tonsil stones. What confused me most is why I would get tonsil stones using regular toothpaste, but I realized that it caused my tonsils to swell, and just the same was happening with my tongue. Obviously not a good thing to be putting that &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; in my mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry for being so in depth, but I am sure this will be valuable information to some. (To be honest, if you are going crazy over tonsil stones/halitosis/etc, or any other problem in your life for that matter, it&#x27;s best to see what is being inputted into said scenario; the problem can lie in the least expected cases; herein toothpaste was causing adverse oral effects. Case in point. This really made me think about life for a while.. anyways...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used coconut oil to brush, this feels about the same but with a hint of peppermint. Fairly bland but it does an excellent job at cleaning and maintaining oral hygiene just like any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good product, the price is obscene for just one tube. I misread it. Other sellers have for half the price. What a mistake!</li>
            <li> No SLS, so no canker sores or sensitivity. Great taste and has fluoride. I am a retired dentist and recommended this, and CloSys for bad breath and gum disease. Highly recommend still, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone..</li>
            <li> I order this toothpaste on a regular basis. I had read that sodium lauryl sulfate could contribute to having canker sores and I was desperate to try anything that would help. This toothpaste is SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) free. I believe it helps. It also tastes good and whitens my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great if you are looking for a sls free toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling as thoroughly clean as some of the big brands, though I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s all mental. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year with no cavities.</li>
            <li> Canker sore sufferer? Buy this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of SLS in their formulation is a godsend for those who are allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using anything else and still suffering, throw out your current toothpaste, buy this, and get relief.</li>
