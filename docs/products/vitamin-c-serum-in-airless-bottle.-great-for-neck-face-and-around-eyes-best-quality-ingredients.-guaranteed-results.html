            <li>THE APPEARANCE OF FINE LINES AND WRIINKLESI and will help DIMINISH THE APPEARANCE OF SCARS, ECZEMA, STRETCH MARKS AND ACNE Skin.</li>
            <li>I got huge pimples on some areas of my face.</li>
            <li>A light weight serum with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is made to be airless and o air seeps in even while usage making it a contamination free product.</li>
            <li>It comes in an attractive bottle which delivers the serum without allowing air back into the bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle is super, won&#x27;t let in light or air.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin is nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>may be great for some people but it caused my skin to develop dry patches, flaky skin</li>

            <li>My skin looks and feels soft and smooth !  </li>
            <li>I did not know if the yellowish was ok, but have now learned this means it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li>Really helped with my smile lines!</li>
            <li>Also, because my skin has been perpetually dry, I noticed that I have been developing fine lines on the sides of my nose – which bugged me more than I care to admit.</li>
            <li>I usually use it under some moisturizer and it works great.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I don’t have the dry patches around my eye area that I have been constantly plagued with but most importantly, it has been working miracles on the fine lines that I have started to develop on the sides of my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>this serum does exactly what it days</li>
            <li>, I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month, but I noticed results in the first three days of use.</li>
            <li>It has only gotten better since then.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product over a long period of time, but in the short time that I&#x27;ve used it, I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The serum is light weight  and soft.</li>
            <li>Products that include vitamin C have always been one of my favorite things to put on my skin, and this product is no different.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li>You get purely whats inside the bottle since the day it was packed each time you use it.</li>
            <li>, my Face feels really sticky.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Most of my product went down the drain because the lid was stuck from leaking after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply all you have to do is wash your face as usual with your cleanser and warm water and blot dry so face and neck still damp and apply vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this serum ensures that my skin is less problematic and gets hydrated.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>This started out ok for the first two days, then as I kept using it I started to notice these small red dots where I had applied the stuff and had to throw the whole thing away...</li>
            <li>works really well, and you can definitely feel a difference the moment it touches your skin.</li>
            <li>After putting it on before bed, I wake up with soft skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum makes your face so soft and it will glow.</li>
            <li>When I finally got the top off it poured and wasted in my sink.</li>
            <li>Skin Secret Vitamin C Serum has many benefits, including promoting skin hydration and locking in moisture to protect skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>The seller was wonderfully easy to work with and the product got to me a lot faster than expected especially in icy conditions!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different facial serums and this one certainly tops my list.</li>

            <li> and I think with daily use it should last little over a month.</li>

            <li> A little sticky on fingers and skin when applying.  </li>

            <li> It also helps fight those nasty wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> but I always end up so frustrated because the dry patches in my skin never goes away.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried a few different facial serums and this one certainly tops my list. During the coder months, my face tends to get a little dry. Once I put this on, it&#x27;s not overly greasy or sticky. I usually use it under some moisturizer and it works great. I can also see that it evens out my skin as well... definitely a beauty staple for me!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this serum ensures that my skin is less problematic and gets hydrated. Before I learned about this product, I only use moisturizers and creams but I always end up so frustrated because the dry patches in my skin never goes away. Also, because my skin has been perpetually dry, I noticed that I have been developing fine lines on the sides of my nose – which bugged me more than I care to admit. I am happy to share with all of you that since using this serum under my morning moisturizer in the morning and under my repair cream at night, my skin has been looking hydrated! I also noticed that I don’t have the dry patches around my eye area that I have been constantly plagued with but most importantly, it has been working miracles on the fine lines that I have started to develop on the sides of my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitame C Serum</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is lovely.  Works wonders for your skin</li>
            <li> Just trying to recover and keep my skin healthy.  A light weight serum with no fragrance.  I apply after cleansing and toning.  Adds shine and quickly tightens skin.  A little sticky on fingers and skin when applying.  Not sure about long term as have only used just recently.  Has some exceptional ingredients: aloe, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid. Feels incredible on my skin so far.  Product in exchange for an unbiased review.  Update:  I have been using this serum for almost 2 months and I love it!!  My skin looks and feels soft and smooth !  Definitely helps my skin.  Thank you !</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERYDAY. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review. I absolutely love love love this serum!!! I use it with the micro needle roller system 1.0 this serum does exactly what it days, I will be purchasing more in the future! You only have to use just a small amount which goes a long way! This makes the skin and neck feel so Smith and look refreshed! The seller was wonderfully easy to work with and the product got to me a lot faster than expected especially in icy conditions!</li>
            <li> Most of my product went down the drain because the lid was stuck from leaking after the first use. When I finally got the top off it poured and wasted in my sink. I&#x27;m not sure how well the product is but the bottle is an issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my clients. I&#x27;ve been using different serums with my dermapen treatment and I wanted to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well, and you can definitely feel a difference the moment it touches your skin. My only concern is how sticky it is.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it on someone or I wear it myself, my Face feels really sticky.</li>
            <li> This product in combined with the hydrochloric acid helps to drastically reduce the appearance of folds in the face due to tiredness. I have been using it for a month, but I noticed results in the first three days of use. It has only gotten better since then. I will recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I ordered the product and received a bottle. When I used it it came out brown, then yellow. Previous purchase from a different provider was clear, so I returned it and bought a 2nd bottle. Same thing. I did not know if the yellowish was ok, but have now learned this means it&#x27;s old. It burns. Two tries/2 bad orders. I won&#x27;t try again.</li>
            <li> This started out ok for the first two days, then as I kept using it I started to notice these small red dots where I had applied the stuff and had to throw the whole thing away... Waist of money for me, but it might work out for someone else. But I would recommend to someone I knew to waist there money on a useless product.</li>
            <li> Love the gentle effective formula. Great actives for skin! The bottle is super, won&#x27;t let in light or air.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and instantly soften my facial skin. Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works nicely.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product over a long period of time, but in the short time that I&#x27;ve used it, I am happy with the results.  The serum is light weight  and soft. It&#x27;s easy to apply.  After putting it on before bed, I wake up with soft skin.  Products that include vitamin C have always been one of my favorite things to put on my skin, and this product is no different.  I look forward to adding it to my beauty regimen.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It did nothing to my skin. It feels very sticky and dry after applying and clogged my pores so badly I got huge pimples on some areas of my face. I haven&#x27;t seen actual pimples on me for over 20 years! But this product did it. :(</li>
            <li> I have a couple of vitamin C serums and I alternate them. I have been using this for a month now and I use this after I use my derma roller. I noticed that my skin is nice and soft and smooth. It does not irritate my skin after I use derma roller but keeps it hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a bottle with a dispenser and I think with daily use it should last little over a month. The serum does not have a fragrance, it is light and it gets absorbed in the skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrific serum.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> may be great for some people but it caused my skin to develop dry patches, flaky skin</li>
            <li> If you need amazing skin then you need a product free of any contamination, and this product claims to be just that. The bottle is made to be airless and o air seeps in even while usage making it a contamination free product. You get purely whats inside the bottle since the day it was packed each time you use it. Skin Secret Vitamin C Serum has many benefits, including promoting skin hydration and locking in moisture to protect skin from drying out. It helps in relieving stress lines and keeps you moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is cute and very handy to keep in my purse and carry it around anytime.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product.  Irritation  and burning sensation once applied to  face.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum in Airless Pump works wonders. It is so easy to apply all you have to do is wash your face as usual with your cleanser and warm water and blot dry so face and neck still damp and apply vitamin C serum. This serum makes your face so soft and it will glow. It also helps fight those nasty wrinkles and fine lines. The serum doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it so don&#x27;t dry my face out. Best of all its cruelty free. When I was given the chance to try this serum during a promotion at a discount I jumped at it for my honest review. I would highly recommend this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Has firmed and tightened my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Really helped with my smile lines!</li>
            <li> After reading about the Vitamin C serum online I found these claims: &amp;#34;REDUCE THE APPEARANCE OF FINE LINES AND WRIINKLESI and will help DIMINISH THE APPEARANCE OF SCARS, ECZEMA, STRETCH MARKS AND ACNE Skin. I tried the Vitamin C Serum in the Airless Bottle and found it to be a very thick serum which needs only a small amount to be effective. It comes in an attractive bottle which delivers the serum without allowing air back into the bottle. This helps keep it from becoming contaminated. It goes on smoothly and feels very rich on my skin. I will have to try it out for a while to see just how well it works on my &amp;#60;gasp&amp;#62; wrinkles but from what I&#x27;ve read, Vitamin C Serum is supposed to be very good at producing collagen and protecting skin from free radicals. It is also supposed to be good for all skin types.</li>
