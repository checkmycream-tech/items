            <li>The conditioner is just as nice.</li>
            <li>which is alot of stress for my kind of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never would have thought that I would spend this kind of money on shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The mint formula gives the head a nice sensation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have color treated hair, but, I tried it because I wanted a gentle shampoo that was also a great moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is runnier with a nice peppermint smell and tingling of the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Wen</li>
            <li>This is a great product, well worth the investment!</li>
            <li>This is my first review - mostly because I have never been so impressed by a product that I wanted to review it.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair product!!!!</li>
            <li>At the salon it left an awesome tingling sensation and i loved it.</li>
            <li>I had used a sample of this from my hair stylist and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t swallow the huge salon price tag for the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for those who have curly or textured hair, but for my straight, fine, highlighted and colored hair, these are the PERFECT products!  </li>
            <li>But today, I used this shampoo/conditioner for the very first time, and already my hair feels amazing!  </li>
            <li>First off: This is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I love these products &amp; they were shipped to me very quickly - within 3 days of my order!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is a very light lavendar fragrance and the conditioner smells like peppermint.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>forward\\&quot; so others can experience this product as well :)</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo because it keeps the underside of my hair brown, and the top strawberry blonde with platinum highlights perfect!  </li>
            <li>so volume is what I look for and they have many products for styling.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SO many and learned my lesson - more money doesn&#x27;t guarantee a better product, in most cases.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great hydrating product that gives much vibrance and shine to hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used before and love it myself</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s laureth sulfate free!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a interesting surprise for myself.</li>
            <li>And it has a fantastic smell!</li>
            <li>I still need more shine and moisture, though...</li>
            <li>This price is unbeatable for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair once maybe twice a week and these products are perfect for me.</li>
            <li>After my trial period all I can say is I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>First of all the fragrance is amazing, you&#x27;ll want to use it as a body wash as well!</li>
            <li>The conditioner has mint in it which is refreshing &amp; will make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>but it was more time consuming and gave me flakes for some reason.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of going was getting my hair washed.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this treat.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Most important it&#x27;s not tested on animals and uses no animal products.</li>
            <li>It is extremely strong so be prepared for this.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong it cleared up my sinuses in a couple of seconds lol&lt;</li>
            <li>Something that was kind of funny is that in the Conditioner there is peppermint.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The original Pureology concept was great, however, it has been boughten by Redkin and has gone far from it&#x27;s original mission statement.</li>
            <li>This specific type (purple bottle/hydrating formula) has some sort of mint in the conditioner, so it feels great when you use it and let it sit in your hair for a minute or so while showering.</li>
            <li>Buy cruelty free.</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky and smooth now</li>
            <li>and they were fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The smell was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My hair is light and clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The original bottles I purchased have lasted me 4 months</li>
            <li>They are all worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Shampoo is great for adding moisture to dry hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how clean it leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it felt clean but still moisturized.  </li>
            <li>but I thought the conditioner was nothing special.  </li>
            <li>This is certainly not a miracle product, but it is pretty good!  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of the different types of Pureology hair products, and this one works the best on my chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Very, very noticeable improvements... soft, healthy and shiny!  </li>
            <li>thing I really don&#x27;t like about the shampoo is its strong \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>Now I simply blowdry my hair and it looks healthy and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very silkily smooth and not so frizzy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it so worth it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin on my face and most shampoos will cause a rash but not Pureology.  </li>
            <li>I found that the cost is worth the product if you stick to the instructions and use a dime-size each time you wash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth the money you pay for it</li>
            <li>there must be natural scents that smell better than this...</li>
            <li>I cannot get over how soft and healthy my hair feels now</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so strong, but so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, shiny, easy to brush and comb through, and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>The service was fast, friendly and efficient and I highly recommend them!  </li>
            <li>The smell is really hard to stomach in an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty darn</li>
            <li>I love these products so much, I now invest in the 33 oz bottles and they last forever!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner because a dime sized amount goes through my long hair like silk.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested a shampoo that was sulfate free and a conditioner that was parabin free due to the extenive coloring of my hair.</li>
            <li>I will be certain to purchase from them again and hope you do too.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a top-line shampoo, and it works very well, but I still have yet to find the \\&quot;one\\&quot; shampoo that my hair loves in return.</li>
            <li>I had to use more conditioner (probably 1 1/2 to 2 quarter-sized amounts), but as I stated, my hair was VERY dry.  </li>
            <li>The smell is unique (very minty), and there is a definite improvement even after the first use.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and your hair feels light, not weighed down.</li>
            <li>Fantastic delivery, 7 days earlier than expected...love this product..really helps my itchy scalp and the conditioner works very well.</li>
            <li>after 10 days of use I saw a real change in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell and lather of the shampoo is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pureology really helped to keep the color and has kept it hydrated.  </li>
            <li>conditioner really tingles the scalp as it penetrates - feels</li>
            <li>considering how much you paid for highlights.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes your whole head tingle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the shampoo to lather since other sulfate free shampoos that I have tried were hard to work through my hair, but this shampoo lathers up great.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair softer than most other shampoos and conditioners-although it does not get my hair as detangled as I would prefer, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>as I love this stuff, I have to stick to Nexxus &amp; Matrix products, due to price.</li>
            <li>I am going back to my cheaper Nature&#x27;s gate shampoo that makes my hair clean with no synthetic perfumes, no rashes, no chemicals and no $40</li>
            <li>plan on having my mom try it, she&#x27;s been looking for a shampoo that will leave her hair clean the next morning since she tends to wash it at night.  </li>
            <li>silky.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad shampoo , but definitely not so \\&quot; pure\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I always expect a miracle every time I try a new product!  </li>
            <li>It became silky and healthy looking-- no longer \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that over time, the condition of my hair will improve and I&#x27;ll be able to use less.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner in particular contains mint which can strip the hair follicles and irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I googles and the pureology line came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Just a little more of the conditioner since it&#x27;s thicker.</li>
            <li>I am very chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li>Pureology is a pretty good product for my difficult hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using the green Pureology and decided I needed more Hydrating one</li>
            <li>Skip the grocery store shampoo, this is well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of the product (minty) but the results more than make up for it.  </li>
            <li>I only had to use a tiny amount (smaller than dime-size) and there was more than enough lather to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>and makes up for the money that I used to go through buying new shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate Shampoo: Rose, Sandalwood, and Green Tea, Soy, Oat, and Wheat, Ylang Ylang, Bergamot, Anise, and Patchouli Hydrate Condition: Peppermint, Sage, and Rosemary, Soy, Oat, and Wheat, Jojoba Esters and Shea Butter, Peppermint and Corn Mint Essential Oils</li>
            <li>When you spend so much money to keep your hair looking the same color as your daughters&#x27;, hiding the grey, using a good shampoo can make a REALLY big difference in how long the color lasts.  </li>
            <li>( I think is a lot of money for a small 8 oz bottle of shampoo) and see if it would work magic in my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually never leave reviews</li>
            <li>I would most likely buy other products from this company...</li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a small amount of shampoo and it lathers really well, but you need to use a lot more of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really did not want to throw the $40 shampoo down the trash, so kept giving it more tries.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very thick and concentrated and lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair clean longer and a lot less oily.  </li>
            <li>a natural</li>
            <li>Pureology doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;coat\\&quot; your hair, leaving it feeling naturally</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair now feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have nearly the damage that I used to</li>
            <li>I understand they are making this all natural and vegan but</li>
            <li>My old stylist used to use this on me whenever i would have my hair colored.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update....., so I am more vain then I thought I was and even though this shampoo is full of chemicals and does cause a mild rash off and on, the other scalp issues are not soo bad, and somewhat diminished.</li>
            <li>My hair type is poker straight, normal thickness, tends to get oily/weighed down, and is color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers like no other and you don&#x27;t need to use alot.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This was a very good deal--this product is usually on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels much healthier and looks fuller than shampoos loaded with sulfates and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>This means it&#x27;ll last a long time and since I&#x27;ve never spent such a high price for shampoo and conditioner  </li>
            <li>I have highly processed hair that is already naturally coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li>I mean, c&#x27;mon, we&#x27;re talking shampoo to clean your hair, and conditioner to moisturize it...</li>
            <li>It left my coarse and dry hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s hard to get over the price, but it is so worth every penny.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product, well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This is my first review - mostly because I have never been so impressed by a product that I wanted to review it.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product!!!!</li>
            <li> At the salon it left an awesome tingling sensation and i loved it.</li>
            <li> I had used a sample of this from my hair stylist and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t swallow the huge salon price tag for the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for those who have curly or textured hair, but for my straight, fine, highlighted and colored hair, these are the PERFECT products!  </li>
            <li> But today, I used this shampoo/conditioner for the very first time, and already my hair feels amazing!  </li>
            <li> First off: This is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I love these products &amp; they were shipped to me very quickly - within 3 days of my order!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a very light lavendar fragrance and the conditioner smells like peppermint.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> forward\\&quot; so others can experience this product as well :)</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo because it keeps the underside of my hair brown, and the top strawberry blonde with platinum highlights perfect!  </li>
            <li> so volume is what I look for and they have many products for styling.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO many and learned my lesson - more money doesn&#x27;t guarantee a better product, in most cases.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great hydrating product that gives much vibrance and shine to hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used before and love it myself</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s laureth sulfate free!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a interesting surprise for myself.</li>
            <li> And it has a fantastic smell!</li>
            <li> I still need more shine and moisture, though...</li>
            <li> This price is unbeatable for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once maybe twice a week and these products are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> After my trial period all I can say is I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> First of all the fragrance is amazing, you&#x27;ll want to use it as a body wash as well!</li>
            <li> The conditioner has mint in it which is refreshing &amp; will make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> but it was more time consuming and gave me flakes for some reason.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part of going was getting my hair washed.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this treat.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Most important it&#x27;s not tested on animals and uses no animal products.</li>
            <li> It is extremely strong so be prepared for this.</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong it cleared up my sinuses in a couple of seconds lol&lt;</li>
            <li> Something that was kind of funny is that in the Conditioner there is peppermint.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The original Pureology concept was great, however, it has been boughten by Redkin and has gone far from it&#x27;s original mission statement.</li>
            <li> This specific type (purple bottle/hydrating formula) has some sort of mint in the conditioner, so it feels great when you use it and let it sit in your hair for a minute or so while showering.</li>
            <li> Buy cruelty free.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silky and smooth now</li>
            <li> and they were fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The smell was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My hair is light and clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The original bottles I purchased have lasted me 4 months</li>
            <li> They are all worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great for adding moisture to dry hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how clean it leaves my hair.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it felt clean but still moisturized.  </li>
            <li> but I thought the conditioner was nothing special.  </li>
            <li> This is certainly not a miracle product, but it is pretty good!  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of the different types of Pureology hair products, and this one works the best on my chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Very, very noticeable improvements... soft, healthy and shiny!  </li>
            <li> thing I really don&#x27;t like about the shampoo is its strong \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> Now I simply blowdry my hair and it looks healthy and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very silkily smooth and not so frizzy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it so worth it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my face and most shampoos will cause a rash but not Pureology.  </li>
            <li> I found that the cost is worth the product if you stick to the instructions and use a dime-size each time you wash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth the money you pay for it</li>
            <li> there must be natural scents that smell better than this...</li>
            <li> I cannot get over how soft and healthy my hair feels now</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so strong, but so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, shiny, easy to brush and comb through, and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li> The service was fast, friendly and efficient and I highly recommend them!  </li>
            <li> The smell is really hard to stomach in an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty darn</li>
            <li> I love these products so much, I now invest in the 33 oz bottles and they last forever!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner because a dime sized amount goes through my long hair like silk.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested a shampoo that was sulfate free and a conditioner that was parabin free due to the extenive coloring of my hair.</li>
            <li> I will be certain to purchase from them again and hope you do too.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a top-line shampoo, and it works very well, but I still have yet to find the \\&quot;one\\&quot; shampoo that my hair loves in return.</li>
            <li> I had to use more conditioner (probably 1 1/2 to 2 quarter-sized amounts), but as I stated, my hair was VERY dry.  </li>
            <li> The smell is unique (very minty), and there is a definite improvement even after the first use.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean and your hair feels light, not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Fantastic delivery, 7 days earlier than expected...love this product..really helps my itchy scalp and the conditioner works very well.</li>
            <li> after 10 days of use I saw a real change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell and lather of the shampoo is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pureology really helped to keep the color and has kept it hydrated.  </li>
            <li> conditioner really tingles the scalp as it penetrates - feels</li>
            <li> considering how much you paid for highlights.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes your whole head tingle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the shampoo to lather since other sulfate free shampoos that I have tried were hard to work through my hair, but this shampoo lathers up great.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer than most other shampoos and conditioners-although it does not get my hair as detangled as I would prefer, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> as I love this stuff, I have to stick to Nexxus &amp; Matrix products, due to price.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my cheaper Nature&#x27;s gate shampoo that makes my hair clean with no synthetic perfumes, no rashes, no chemicals and no $40</li>
            <li> plan on having my mom try it, she&#x27;s been looking for a shampoo that will leave her hair clean the next morning since she tends to wash it at night.  </li>
            <li> silky.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad shampoo , but definitely not so \\&quot; pure\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I always expect a miracle every time I try a new product!  </li>
            <li> It became silky and healthy looking-- no longer \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that over time, the condition of my hair will improve and I&#x27;ll be able to use less.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner in particular contains mint which can strip the hair follicles and irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I googles and the pureology line came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Just a little more of the conditioner since it&#x27;s thicker.</li>
            <li> I am very chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li> Pureology is a pretty good product for my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the green Pureology and decided I needed more Hydrating one</li>
            <li> Skip the grocery store shampoo, this is well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of the product (minty) but the results more than make up for it.  </li>
            <li> I only had to use a tiny amount (smaller than dime-size) and there was more than enough lather to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> and makes up for the money that I used to go through buying new shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate Shampoo: Rose, Sandalwood, and Green Tea, Soy, Oat, and Wheat, Ylang Ylang, Bergamot, Anise, and Patchouli Hydrate Condition: Peppermint, Sage, and Rosemary, Soy, Oat, and Wheat, Jojoba Esters and Shea Butter, Peppermint and Corn Mint Essential Oils</li>
            <li> When you spend so much money to keep your hair looking the same color as your daughters&#x27;, hiding the grey, using a good shampoo can make a REALLY big difference in how long the color lasts.  </li>
            <li> ( I think is a lot of money for a small 8 oz bottle of shampoo) and see if it would work magic in my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually never leave reviews</li>
            <li> I would most likely buy other products from this company...</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount of shampoo and it lathers really well, but you need to use a lot more of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really did not want to throw the $40 shampoo down the trash, so kept giving it more tries.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very thick and concentrated and lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair clean longer and a lot less oily.  </li>
            <li> a natural</li>
            <li> Pureology doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;coat\\&quot; your hair, leaving it feeling naturally</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair now feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have nearly the damage that I used to</li>
            <li> I understand they are making this all natural and vegan but</li>
            <li> My old stylist used to use this on me whenever i would have my hair colored.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update....., so I am more vain then I thought I was and even though this shampoo is full of chemicals and does cause a mild rash off and on, the other scalp issues are not soo bad, and somewhat diminished.</li>
            <li> My hair type is poker straight, normal thickness, tends to get oily/weighed down, and is color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers like no other and you don&#x27;t need to use alot.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was a very good deal--this product is usually on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels much healthier and looks fuller than shampoos loaded with sulfates and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> This means it&#x27;ll last a long time and since I&#x27;ve never spent such a high price for shampoo and conditioner  </li>
            <li> I have highly processed hair that is already naturally coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li> I mean, c&#x27;mon, we&#x27;re talking shampoo to clean your hair, and conditioner to moisturize it...</li>
            <li> It left my coarse and dry hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to get over the price, but it is so worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and you use so little of the product with every wash that it really</li>
            <li> price is a little high for me</li>
            <li> it contains only natural products but in the future I think I will use the shampoo and find another conditioner (and save a little money).</li>
            <li> I have no doubts that the shampoo will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I will attach a pic with the list, because it will take too long to type all the hundreds of chemical</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo after being fed up with the color (to cover the grey) fading after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> There are absolutely no oils or residues left in my hair after using them.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I find that in the long run these products SAVE me money.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll throw out all those partial open bottles of hair products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I feel the cost evens out since it lasts so long - I would buy two bottles to</li>
            <li> and I have long hair!  </li>
            <li> It rehydrated my dry, damaged, and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry wavy hair and struggled with finding shampoo that didn&#x27;t turn my hair into hay except Wen conditioning creme.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get that dry scratchy feeling.  </li>
            <li> For the average person&#x27;s hair, I would totally recommend this shampoo</li>
            <li> When I use Pureology, I find that not only do I need to use less of the product at a time to get the job done, but  I can sometimes go up to 3-5 days without washing.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was over processed and became very dry.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but definitely worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I recently spent a lot of money coloring and highlighting my hair</li>
            <li> No more weighed down hair and the dryness has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the bottles last forever since you only need to use a very small amount of each.</li>
            <li> if it were not for this product, I would not be able to color my hair, it makes it so soft and workable, with out it its dry and awful, cant even get a comb through it with out this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts forever because you only use a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical but</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair every other day to ensure that it didn&#x27;t get dried-out.  </li>
            <li> but as other reviews stated, I use about the size of a silver dollar to shampoo my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is extremely hydrating.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, so</li>
            <li> I have hard water problems in my home and no shampoo and conditioner has been able to counter act the drying effects my hair suffers because of it.</li>
            <li> The combination of winter, color treating, blow drying, and very hard water left my hair feeling quite dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> even though it is expensive, it will last you a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> This duo along with herstyler syrum has allowed me to trim my ends less often.  </li>
            <li> I am black and my hair has been relaxed and colored</li>
            <li> The conditioner is so invigorating, especially if you rinse with cold water, your scalp just comes alive, and the smell is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday, I hated my hair so much that I was ready to chop it all off.  </li>
            <li> is a lot less frizzy and fried looking.  </li>
            <li> Talk about a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> It is quite unpleasant especially when your hair is wet, smells like a wet dog or wet carpet.  </li>
            <li> I have dry thin hair which is a bad combo because moisturizers weigh it down and volumizers dry it out too much.  </li>
            <li> also dried out my scalp and made it itchy afterwards and gave me a rash on my chest and body.</li>
            <li> It dried my scalp out and made my hair oilier.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I disliked it.</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with hydrating shampoos, after a few weeks my hair gets weighed down and oily.  </li>
            <li> But I always keep this in my shower to use at least once per week, not matter what other passing fads I am trying.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, wavy and somewhat dry/coarse hair and pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner leave it feeling silky and moisturized--but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick very dry hair and after 2 days my hair has never felt softer.</li>
            <li> It makes your scalp very very cold and fresh feeling while you massage it in.</li>
            <li> I know its expensive, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t use any of my usual leave-in conditioners or serums, as I wanted to see the results from just the Pureology.)  </li>
            <li> I have dirty blond hair that I&#x27;ve been highlighting for years and it was starting to look fried.  </li>
            <li> And NO MORE FLAKES!  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and keep it dyed</li>
            <li> (My husband is getting tired of me telling him to feel my hair.)  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed using this product nor any of the other products Puregology makes.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells weird</li>
            <li> but I have very tough hair.</li>
            <li> So it may be expensive but mine lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li> but i am still extremely disappointed that the duo tingles at the salon but not at home.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very disappointed. I am very chemically sensitive. So after reading reviews of this shampoo and reading the description on Amazon, I decided to take a big $40 risk, ( I think is a lot of money for a small 8 oz bottle of shampoo) and see if it would work magic in my hair. This is what is listed on the Amazon description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate Shampoo: Rose, Sandalwood, and Green Tea, Soy, Oat, and Wheat, Ylang Ylang, Bergamot, Anise, and Patchouli Hydrate Condition: Peppermint, Sage, and Rosemary, Soy, Oat, and Wheat, Jojoba Esters and Shea Butter, Peppermint and Corn Mint Essential Oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality this is what is printed on the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water, sodium cocoyl isethinoate, sodium laury sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfusuccinate, sodium laruly sarcosinate, cocoamidopropyl betaine, glycol disterate, clycereth-26, decyl glucoside, and on and on and on........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the list goes o and on, hundreds of chemical ingredients, color and synthetic \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; I will attach a pic with the list, because it will take too long to type all the hundreds of chemical ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This description is sooo misleading, this is not in any form a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also dried out my scalp and made it itchy afterwards and gave me a rash on my chest and body. I am going back to my cheaper Nature&#x27;s gate shampoo that makes my hair clean with no synthetic perfumes, no rashes, no chemicals and no $40 flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....., so I am more vain then I thought I was and even though this shampoo is full of chemicals and does cause a mild rash off and on, the other scalp issues are not soo bad, and somewhat diminished. I really did not want to throw the $40 shampoo down the trash, so kept giving it more tries. My hair is pretty darn silky.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad shampoo , but definitely not so \\&quot; pure\\&quot;. I would like to attach&amp;eacute; a pic of the ingredients, if I can figure out how to do so....</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great for adding moisture to dry hair. Continued use will only improve the texture and shine. It is expensive, but I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and liked the shampoo but I thought the conditioner was nothing special.  They need to reverse the size of the bottles for this combo. You only need to use a small amount of shampoo and it lathers really well, but you need to use a lot more of the conditioner. I do like that it contains only natural products but in the future I think I will use the shampoo and find another conditioner (and save a little money).</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner combination for color-treated hair.  And it lasts forever because you only use a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo after being fed up with the color (to cover the grey) fading after 2 weeks.  Love the product.  A little goes a long way.  I love how my head tingles with the conditioner!</li>
            <li> if it were not for this product, I would not be able to color my hair, it makes it so soft and workable, with out it its dry and awful, cant even get a comb through it with out this product. I know its expensive, and a little goes a long way and it so worth it.</li>
            <li> This costs about $35/each at Target or the supermarket, more at the salon - this is a great deal!  I get my hair highlighted rebgularly and the Pureology line keeps my hair hydrated and the color lasts between trips to the salon.  This specific type (purple bottle/hydrating formula) has some sort of mint in the conditioner, so it feels great when you use it and let it sit in your hair for a minute or so while showering.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my face and most shampoos will cause a rash but not Pureology.  I have thin hair and keep it dyed and it looks the best ever.  It is expensive but definitely worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blond hair that I&#x27;ve been highlighting for years and it was starting to look fried.  I gave Pureology hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner a try and I&#x27;m never going back!  I was hesitant about the price but after doing research I found that buying the duo online is the cheapest way to go.  I bought this back in August and four months later I haven&#x27;t run out of product!  I have long hair and you use so little of the product with every wash that it really lasts-- and makes up for the money that I used to go through buying new shampoo/conditioner every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of the product (minty) but the results more than make up for it.  At first I was skeptical but after 10 days of use I saw a real change in my hair.  It became silky and healthy looking-- no longer \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and less frizzy.  Now I simply blowdry my hair and it looks healthy and shiny!  Pureology doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;coat\\&quot; your hair, leaving it feeling naturally soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product especially if you color treat your hair!  I found that the cost is worth the product if you stick to the instructions and use a dime-size each time you wash.  The original bottles I purchased have lasted me 4 months and I have long hair!  I usually never leave reviews but I thought I would \\&quot;play it forward\\&quot; so others can experience this product as well :)</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo because it keeps the underside of my hair brown, and the top strawberry blonde with platinum highlights perfect!  I never have fading of my color anymore.  I love this conditioner because a dime sized amount goes through my long hair like silk.  This duo along with herstyler syrum has allowed me to trim my ends less often.  Perfect for color treated hair that goes through heat styling!</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair clean longer and a lot less oily.  I would definitely buy this products again.</li>
            <li> I started using Purology products about a year ago upon the suggestion of my hairdresser and couldn&#x27;t use anything else! My hair feels much healthier and looks fuller than shampoos loaded with sulfates and other chemicals. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!! Oh, and the bottles last forever since you only need to use a very small amount of each. So it may be expensive but mine lasted almost a year!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested a shampoo that was sulfate free and a conditioner that was parabin free due to the extenive coloring of my hair. My hair was very dry. It had lost its shine and smoothness. Pureology was one brand recommended. It is very nice. The smell and lather of the shampoo is more than I expected. It rinses clean and your hair feels light, not weighed down. The conditioner is just as nice. It has a very nice peppermint smell and leaves your hair and scalp feeling rejuvenized, for lack of a better way to \\&quot;say\\&quot; it. No more weighed down hair and the dryness has diminished considerably. My hair feels better!!! I would recommend Pureology to anyone trying to take care of their hair, whether color treated or not.</li>
            <li> First off: This is a great deal.  Getting the shampoo and conditioner together for this price is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second off: This is the ONLY shampoo and conditioner that I will ever use on my hair again.  My hair is VERY thick and dry.  This shampoo leaves it feeling and looking amazing.  The conditioner has mint, which gives your scalp a tingling sensation when you use it that is amazing.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used this condition for my color treated hair.  I am black and my hair has been relaxed and colored which is alot of stress for my kind of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pureology really helped to keep the color and has kept it hydrated.  My hairdresser was impressed by the color after 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner really tingles the scalp as it penetrates - feels good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money you pay for it considering how much you paid for highlights.</li>
            <li> Not all shampoos can be used when you have extensions... but this one is great.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Pureology products years ago.  My stylist suggested I use it since I was doing two chemical processes to my hair (color and perm).  You will not believe how good your hair feels after using the hydrating formula of shampoo and conditioner.  It also makes your scalp tingle!  You will not be disappointed using this product nor any of the other products Puregology makes.  I have straight fine hair so volume is what I look for and they have many products for styling.  They are all worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I always expect a miracle every time I try a new product!  This is certainly not a miracle product, but it is pretty good!  It makes my hair softer than most other shampoos and conditioners-although it does not get my hair as detangled as I would prefer, I would recommend it. I have dry thin hair which is a bad combo because moisturizers weigh it down and volumizers dry it out too much.  Pureology is a pretty good product for my difficult hair.</li>
            <li> The original Pureology concept was great, however, it has been boughten by Redkin and has gone far from it&#x27;s original mission statement. This shampoo/conditioner in particular contains mint which can strip the hair follicles and irritate the scalp. The mint is way too drying that will strip hair color and cause split ends. It dried my scalp out and made my hair oilier.</li>
            <li> I never would have thought that I would spend this kind of money on shampoo and conditioner.  I have tried SO many and learned my lesson - more money doesn&#x27;t guarantee a better product, in most cases.  My hair stylist turned me onto Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner about six years ago.  I can&#x27;t speak for those who have curly or textured hair, but for my straight, fine, highlighted and colored hair, these are the PERFECT products!  The difference is remarkable.  My hair is so soft, shiny, easy to brush and comb through, and tangle-free.  There are absolutely no oils or residues left in my hair after using them.  In fact, I find that in the long run these products SAVE me money.  I used to wash my hair every other day to ensure that it didn&#x27;t get dried-out.  When I use Pureology, I find that not only do I need to use less of the product at a time to get the job done, but  I can sometimes go up to 3-5 days without washing.  That&#x27;s how clean it leaves my hair.  Very often after a few days, I still don&#x27;t have a sign of grease buildup in my hair.  And, oh yes, it smells sooo good!  The shampoo is a very light lavendar fragrance and the conditioner smells like peppermint.  I love these products so much, I now invest in the 33 oz bottles and they last forever!</li>
            <li> This product is a great hydrating product that gives much vibrance and shine to hair. The mint formula gives the head a nice sensation.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I don&#x27;t have color treated hair, but, I tried it because I wanted a gentle shampoo that was also a great moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve been using this for three months, and my hair feels and looks better than ever!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mother as a Christmas present. It&#x27;s the only shampoo and conditioner she&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve used before and love it myself</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair dresser. Works well, smells great. Most important it&#x27;s not tested on animals and uses no animal products. Buy cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Awesome organic shampoo and conditioner, leaves hair shiny and manageable and best of al it&#x27;s laureth sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for 2 years and I absolutely love it.  The conditioner is so invigorating, especially if you rinse with cold water, your scalp just comes alive, and the smell is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> I have been using the green Pureology and decided I needed more Hydrating one so I got this one. Great product, Doesn&#x27;t strip the color from your hair. I enjoy the scent and a little bit goes a long way. Something that was kind of funny is that in the Conditioner there is peppermint. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I tried it. It is extremely strong so be prepared for this. It makes your scalp very very cold and fresh feeling while you massage it in. The scent was so strong it cleared up my sinuses in a couple of seconds lol&lt;br /&gt;It was a interesting surprise for myself. I can&#x27;t say that I disliked it. Just wasn&#x27;t prepared for it. Lovely product and good price for the Shampoo and Conditioner!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have become a shampoo snob.  When you spend so much money to keep your hair looking the same color as your daughters&#x27;, hiding the grey, using a good shampoo can make a REALLY big difference in how long the color lasts.  This shampoo is terrific!  Sometimes I am swayed to try different products.  But I always keep this in my shower to use at least once per week, not matter what other passing fads I am trying.  A little goes a very long way, so even though it is expensive, it will last you a long, long time.  And it has a fantastic smell!</li>
            <li> Fantastic delivery, 7 days earlier than expected...love this product..really helps my itchy scalp and the conditioner works very well. I would most likely buy other products from this company...prices are fair.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a top-line shampoo, and it works very well, but I still have yet to find the \\&quot;one\\&quot; shampoo that my hair loves in return. The smell is unique (very minty), and there is a definite improvement even after the first use. I still need more shine and moisture, though... but I have very tough hair. For the average person&#x27;s hair, I would totally recommend this shampoo</li>
            <li> Talk about a little dab will do ya. WOW. That&#x27;s all you need, about the size of a dime of shampoo in your hand and you get lather like you won&#x27;t believe. Just a little more of the conditioner since it&#x27;s thicker. This means it&#x27;ll last a long time and since I&#x27;ve never spent such a high price for shampoo and conditioner  that&#x27;s a very good thing. I have very thick very dry hair and after 2 days my hair has never felt softer. I&#x27;ve not felt the tingling that others talked about and was looking forward to it, but hey it smells great and works great. I guess I&#x27;ll throw out all those partial open bottles of hair products that I&#x27;ve tried. Yeah, extra cabinet space. I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I had used a sample of this from my hair stylist and loved it, but couldn&#x27;t swallow the huge salon price tag for the shampoo and conditioner. This price is unbeatable for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Pureology products are the best out there. I have tried several of the different types of Pureology hair products, and this one works the best on my chemically treated hair.  I totally recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this set. I didn&#x27;t expect the shampoo to lather since other sulfate free shampoos that I have tried were hard to work through my hair, but this shampoo lathers up great. The conditioner makes your whole head tingle. It rehydrated my dry, damaged, and color treated hair. My hair now feels soft and silky. I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> My hair salon uses Pureology products, and I LOVE the scent!  But it&#x27;s the most expensive line of hair-care products I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I mean, c&#x27;mon, we&#x27;re talking shampoo to clean your hair, and conditioner to moisturize it...&lt;br /&gt;Much as I love this stuff, I have to stick to Nexxus &amp; Matrix products, due to price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth the price. The product shampoo does not strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural oils. The conditioner is moisturizing. It left my coarse and dry hair soft and manageable. If you have hair like me, then try it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes my hair so strong, but so soft and shiny!  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This a great product!  It has helped restore health and shine to my hair. I don&#x27;t have nearly the damage that I used to</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner duo are amazing. Regularily sold for over $60 in salons, I couldn&#x27;t pass this deal up. I have hard water problems in my home and no shampoo and conditioner has been able to counter act the drying effects my hair suffers because of it. My hair is so silky and smooth now I can&#x27;t believe it. Skip the grocery store shampoo, this is well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of the pureology hydrate products and after using them jumped on line to see who had the best deal on them--through Amazon.com I found sweanbeauty and they were fantastic.  The service was fast, friendly and efficient and I highly recommend them!  I will be certain to purchase from them again and hope you do too. The product itself is wonderful. I have naturally thick, wavy and somewhat dry/coarse hair and pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner leave it feeling silky and moisturized--but not weighed down.  I only wash my hair once maybe twice a week and these products are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> My hair was over processed and became very dry.  These products are putting the life back in my hair.  Thank you Pureology.</li>
            <li> I have highly processed hair that is already naturally coarse and dry.  This shampoo and conditioner is seriously amazing.  The shampoo lathers like no other and you don&#x27;t need to use alot.  I noticed a big difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I waited 2 weeks after receiving the shampoo to leave a review.  I find that two weeks allows you to truly see how a shampoo works for your hair.  After my trial period all I can say is I love this shampoo.  My hair is light and clean and moisturized.  I usually have an issue with hydrating shampoos, after a few weeks my hair gets weighed down and oily.  This shampoo provides the perfect balance.  My hair type is poker straight, normal thickness, tends to get oily/weighed down, and is color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little high for me but as other reviews stated, I use about the size of a silver dollar to shampoo my medium length hair.  Two weeks in and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it.  I feel the cost evens out since it lasts so long - I would buy two bottles to it&#x27;s one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on having my mom try it, she&#x27;s been looking for a shampoo that will leave her hair clean the next morning since she tends to wash it at night.  I think this will work perfect for her!</li>
            <li> I recently spent a lot of money coloring and highlighting my hair so I was looking for a product to make the color last longer.  I googles and the pureology line came highly recommended.  I bought a 8.5oz set and was very happy with the result.  The shampoo is very thick and concentrated and lathers up nicely.  The conditioner is runnier with a nice peppermint smell and tingling of the scalp.  It makes my hair very silkily smooth and not so frizzy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 thing I really don&#x27;t like about the shampoo is its strong \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; smell.  It is quite unpleasant especially when your hair is wet, smells like a wet dog or wet carpet.  My husband hates the smell also.  I understand they are making this all natural and vegan but there must be natural scents that smell better than this... The smell is really hard to stomach in an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> First of all the fragrance is amazing, you&#x27;ll want to use it as a body wash as well! It smells like Aveda products but is superior in quality. The conditioner has mint in it which is refreshing &amp; will make your scalp tingle. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first review - mostly because I have never been so impressed by a product that I wanted to review it.  I have always had extremely dry wavy hair and struggled with finding shampoo that didn&#x27;t turn my hair into hay except Wen conditioning creme.  I liked the Wen but it was more time consuming and gave me flakes for some reason.  This shampoo is extremely hydrating.  When I rinsed my hair I didn&#x27;t get that dry scratchy feeling.  Instead, it felt clean but still moisturized.  The smell was fantastic.  And NO MORE FLAKES!  Loved the conditioner.  It was minty and made my skin tingle.  This is my new favorite hair product!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these products &amp; they were shipped to me very quickly - within 3 days of my order! Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> My old stylist used to use this on me whenever i would have my hair colored. At the salon it left an awesome tingling sensation and i loved it. My favorite part of going was getting my hair washed. I saved enough money to buy the conditioner, and i found out later from my stylist that the shampoo was what made your scalp tingle. So, i just bought the shampoo, and it does nothing. The shampoo smells weird and i don&#x27;t care for it. I love the conditioner because it smells great but i am still extremely disappointed that the duo tingles at the salon but not at home.</li>
            <li> Pureology Hydrate Shampoo is excellent.  Has a nice, clean smell.  This was a very good deal--this product is usually on the expensive side.  I enjoyed this treat.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I hated my hair so much that I was ready to chop it all off.  (Not kidding.  I had to walk away from a pair of safety scissors to prevent the temptation.)  The combination of winter, color treating, blow drying, and very hard water left my hair feeling quite dry and rough.  But today, I used this shampoo/conditioner for the very first time, and already my hair feels amazing!  Very, very noticeable improvements... soft, healthy and shiny!  (I didn&#x27;t use any of my usual leave-in conditioners or serums, as I wanted to see the results from just the Pureology.)  I know it&#x27;s hard to get over the price, but it is so worth every penny.  I have no doubts that the shampoo will last a very long time.  I only had to use a tiny amount (smaller than dime-size) and there was more than enough lather to clean my hair.  (Just over shoulder length.)  I had to use more conditioner (probably 1 1/2 to 2 quarter-sized amounts), but as I stated, my hair was VERY dry.  I&#x27;m hoping that over time, the condition of my hair will improve and I&#x27;ll be able to use less.  I cannot get over how soft and healthy my hair feels now, I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it!  (My husband is getting tired of me telling him to feel my hair.)  This is a great product, well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I began using the Purology Shampoo and Conditioner each time I shampoo and have reduced how often I need to shampoo.  I have been using it with Marrocan oil and my hair is a lot less frizzy and fried looking.  It&#x27;s getting healthier each time I shampoo.</li>
