    <ol>
            <li>I noticed that this works best if applied before sleep and after bath.</li>
            <li>Perfect to wear in the morning under make up.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful eye cream,</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This is a very good product.</li>
            <li>incredible price buy it</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t like to let my circles win the war, and so I bought into yet another product claiming to work miracles.</li>
            <li>Has great consistency.</li>
            <li>And the great thing is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the botanic ingredients and because I prefer to support &amp;#34;non-mainstream&amp;#34; companies for most of my skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I will surely buy again!</li>
            <li>smells nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>With this product,  you can really see that organic creams are the best option.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion</li>
            <li>Package came nicely sealed and quickly so that was good</li>
            <li>Very light</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>What I love the most about this product is the price and the size.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>you will love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a light lotion consistency and gets absorbed very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Eye cream is fine, but can&#x27;t say I would recommend.</li>
            <li>but what I can say is this cream is light</li>
            <li>Anyway, it’s a good gel and makes my sensitive areas softer.</li>
            <li>I even use it during the day to keep that fresh feel the gel gives!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve notice that it is an extraordinary moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I use this gel everyday and delighted by the results - the skin under eyes looks smooth, matte and even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helped with my developing crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Good for dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to male and female species alike :) and will surely buy another one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel 100% safe using a product which ingredients are listed on purpose in a different  language..</li>
            <li>This gave me results in the first week with using twice a day.</li>
            <li>Thus far it appears to moisturize sufficiently and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I hope is helping my eyes because I have very dry skin and want to hydrate more</li>
            <li>I like the instant soothing effect, and the light consistency.</li>
            <li>It is cooling, mousturizing and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive, no smell, does not irritate eyes, very gentle.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed, works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>for the fragrance, I think it should be in an eyecream since its a very sensitive skin and would absorb all the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Circles exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is most of the labeling is in Russian</li>
            <li>But it took about 3 days for the rings to clear up.</li>
            <li>After having this for a few weeks, I went back to Amazon and ordered this brand&#x60;s face serum, shampoo, conditioner, and face wash, love them all.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say it completely gets rid of the dark circles but they have lightened up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> other similar products sting  </li>

            <li> I have had dark circles my entire life and you would think that I would learn not to believe the hype.</li>
            <li> The cream-gel is nourishing and a little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I get a lot of bags under my eyes due to working all through the night.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> I fall asleep with contact lenses in my eyes which guarantees dark circles and puffiness due to the lack of oxygen.</li>
            <li> i noticed the dark circles fading until they do not exist.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t improve your dark circles</li>
            <li> I’ve used face creams, face serums from Natura Siberica, and no it’s time for cream gel for dark circles.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever used in the past has ever helped the appearance of the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> And the puffiness usually disappears minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for several months now and it made a dramatic difference!</li>
            <li> (My wife used the Aveeno Shitake complex but lately they changed the formula and that STINGS like hell in the eyes.).</li>
            <li> Rub it slowly</li>
            <li> , sorry.</li>
            <li> Doesnt make your eyes feel weird or hurt your eye.</li>
            <li> I work a lot in with the computer, so in the evening I look horrible and can’t look in the mirror.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This works as good (if not better) than some expensive eye creams I have tried (e.g., Lancome, Estee Lauder). It is light weight and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of bags under my eyes due to working all through the night. And the next day, I end up looking like a zombie! I tried this product for several months now and it made a dramatic difference! Of course it won&#x27;t work in a day. But it took about 3 days for the rings to clear up. When I apply this on, the product feels like it&#x27;s working through the skin. Instead of my eyes feeling dry and saggy, it feels tighter and moisturized. I recommend this product. I know it&#x27;s not going to be for everyone, but people should give it a try. It definitely works for me.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, no smell, does not irritate eyes, very gentle. I am in love. Makes my eyes look brighter and the skin tighter. I will surely buy again!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is a very good product. I noticed that this works best if applied before sleep and after bath. Another thing that i noticed is that it DOES NOT sting the way other similar products sting  once they land up in the eye  (My wife used the Aveeno Shitake complex but lately they changed the formula and that STINGS like hell in the eyes.). Since, It is quite possible that some of the amount that is rubbed underneath the eye will &amp;#34;travel to&amp;#34; inside of the eyes and that&#x27;s when the problem starts. It will make the eyes red and itchy and they look swollen. Nothing sort with this creme. It DOES NOT make DRACULA EYES, sorry. It rather keeps them humane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should use 1/10 of a pea globe. That is enough for one under eye. Rub it slowly and it penetrates under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to male and female species alike :) and will surely buy another one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this gel everyday and delighted by the results - the skin under eyes looks smooth, matte and even. I even use it during the day to keep that fresh feel the gel gives! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The cream-gel is nourishing and a little dab goes a long way.  I was impressed by the botanic ingredients and because I prefer to support &amp;#34;non-mainstream&amp;#34; companies for most of my skin care products.  I will submit another review in future regarding the dark under eye circles.  Thus far it appears to moisturize sufficiently and absorbs quickly.  Looking forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles my entire life and you would think that I would learn not to believe the hype. But I don&#x27;t like to let my circles win the war, and so I bought into yet another product claiming to work miracles. Circles exactly the same. Eye cream is fine, but can&#x27;t say I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the instant soothing effect, and the light consistency. It is cooling, mousturizing and fast absorbing. Perfect to wear in the morning under make up.  What I love the most about this product is the price and the size.  The only thing I dislike, is that all Natura Siberica&#x27;s products say &amp;#34;Export quality&amp;#34; in the bottle and the rest is all in Russian. I don&#x27;t feel 100% safe using a product which ingredients are listed on purpose in a different  language.. so I probably won&#x27;t  purchase again.</li>
            <li> Package came nicely sealed and quickly so that was good I never used eye cream before so I cAn&#x27;t compare to another product but what I can say is this cream is light smells nice and I hope is helping my eyes because I have very dry skin and want to hydrate more</li>
            <li> I fall asleep with contact lenses in my eyes which guarantees dark circles and puffiness due to the lack of oxygen. Stress, commute, and coffee add up to the mix. I tried many different creams and figured they were useless. Only this one seems to get the job done, I have noticed the difference within a week.</li>
            <li> Good for dark circles and puffiness. I like the texture and pde in ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this eye cream.  It has a light lotion consistency and gets absorbed very nicely.  I intend to try all their products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 7 months ago and Im still using it daily! i noticed the dark circles fading until they do not exist. -1 for the fragrance, I think it should be in an eyecream since its a very sensitive skin and would absorb all the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t improve your dark circles but I&#x27;ve notice that it is an extraordinary moisturizer. With this product,  you can really see that organic creams are the best option.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but did not see any improvement</li>
            <li> I’ve used face creams, face serums from Natura Siberica, and no it’s time for cream gel for dark circles. Easily absorbed, works very well on dry skin. I work a lot in with the computer, so in the evening I look horrible and can’t look in the mirror. I used it after shower in the evening. Anyway, it’s a good gel and makes my sensitive areas softer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It is so luxurious, and affordable.  After having this for a few weeks, I went back to Amazon and ordered this brand&#x60;s face serum, shampoo, conditioner, and face wash, love them all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful eye cream, incredible price buy it you will love it. The only draw back is most of the labeling is in Russian</li>
            <li> Has great consistency. Doesnt make your eyes feel weird or hurt your eye. Very light n good,..just started using, will see if it works. Also the item was shipped sooner ....</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever used in the past has ever helped the appearance of the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. This gave me results in the first week with using twice a day. I can&#x27;t say it completely gets rid of the dark circles but they have lightened up quite a bit. And the puffiness usually disappears minutes after applying. And the great thing is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. It&#x27;s also helped with my developing crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines. Love this stuff.</li>
