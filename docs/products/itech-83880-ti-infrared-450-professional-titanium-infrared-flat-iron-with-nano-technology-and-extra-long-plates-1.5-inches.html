            <li> It was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Im an african american female and i have always had problems with my flat irons not getting my new growth straight. When i saw this product i read reviews and i decided that i would try it out. This product is definately worth the money. I have very thick course hair and after using this flat iron, my hair has never been more straight and bouncy. Its even super soft. I absolutely love the infrared technology part of it. This is just by far the best flat iron that i have ever owned and believe me i have tried tons of them. Ive tried the chi, fhi, and the instyler too and this one is the best one. Its definately worth the price. Im not getting paid to write this review, although it would be nice lol, but it really is an awesome flat iron. Im glad i made the decision to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural African-American kinky hair.  Flat irons would get my hair semi-staight, but it would still be poofy at my ends or it wouldn&#x27;t last long in the weather.  This flat iron gets my hair straight as if I have a relaxer!  My only gripe is my roots don&#x27;t seem as straight with this one as other flat irons, but it still does it&#x27;s job.  Update: When I originally made this review I was not using the temp setting at it&#x27;s highest.  One day, I had my mom do it and she used it at it&#x27;s highest setting and got my hair super straight including the roots.  I now set it at the highest and am able to get my roots straight.  And the top setting has not damaged my hair, like I was originally afraid of.</li>
            <li> No issues. No complaints. Styling is easy and it doesn&#x27;t snag my ends. Recommended by my stylist and a great price, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon.com and for 89 $ because I read that it had an automatic dual voltage since I am leaving for Saudi Arabia. As I connected it to the power supply ,the iTech produced a weird sound and smoke with sparkles of fire as I tossed it away.My husband tried it again with anther 110 V power supply.Still the same problem.I was too busy moving so I did&#x27;t have the time to write my review.Also, returning it will cost a lot.So, this iron really was a bug mistake. Plz don&#x27;t risk buying a malfunction .</li>
            <li> this is the second infrared brand flat iron that I bought after the croc infrared which died after 3 months.. so I tried this one.. and  I did love it!&lt;br /&gt;However after 9 months it suddenly stopped working!&lt;br /&gt;bought a second one recently and took extra care of it once again in case it was my fault but nothing! no matter what I did after a month it didn&#x27;t want to heat up!&lt;br /&gt;This is last infrared flat iron that I will ever purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good flat iron! but I don&#x27;t think it worth ANY money to keep repurchasing for malfunctioning.. Hope this review can help to save your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great flat iron, my favorite,</li>
            <li> Lovely lasted forever. Nice and hot&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Great Flatiron. Does exactly what  I need it to do. Only thing I would like different is where the on/off button is. It&#x27;s not in the best place and easy to turn off while straightening hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the mother of all flat irons.  It&#x27;s Infared light actually makes your hair really smooth.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and the temperture control it amazing!!! 100 stars *****</li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair. I was so sceptical about buying a flat iron off the internet, and also one Ive never heard of before. But this iron is amazing! It gives me a fresh out of the salon chair look. I use the infrared but i dont use it at the temp it says to in the instructions. And I have hard to tame thick Asian hair! It Leaves ur hair straight even threw weather and sweat! This is THE PRODUCT TO BY! For the price and quality. I will be a forever hairart itech customer!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I ever have, I red the rewius about it but I never thought I found it my most important tool for my every day hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can´t live with out it.</li>
            <li> Amazing to use on long thick hair</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever used and in half the time.</li>
            <li> She says that it heats up almost instantaneously and that it does not stick or burn her hair. Thats good enough for me!</li>
            <li> This iron works like a charm it shines your hair smooths it and shines your hair you can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
            <li> WAS A GIFT TO MY COUSIN FOR HER 15TH BIRTHDAY AND SHE LOVES IT!! PRODUCT WAS BRAND NEW AND WORKS PERFECT. THANKS.</li>
