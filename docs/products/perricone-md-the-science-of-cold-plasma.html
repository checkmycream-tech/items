    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a excellent product</li>
            <li>However...I love everything Dr. Perricone makes EXCEPT this line of products!</li>
            <li>The eye cream, I&#x27;ll be honest, does not do as well as I would want.</li>
            <li>Will not order more.</li>
            <li>I just re ordered more product, nut this time</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t found anything else to do better.</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s working better than I thought.</li>
            <li>2nd time around using this product and it&#x27;s magnificent!</li>
            <li>I am seeing some results, but the compliments I get are even better</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, it feels good on my skin, my skin feels good the next day.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and delivery was even sooner as expected.</li>
            <li>Dr. Perricone firms my face, makes it softer, gets rid of the dark pigmentation and is just awesome.</li>
            <li>I am usually not hyper sensitive to good skin care products but these made me break out in pimples.</li>
            <li>Very good product for people like me who have lost a lot of weight and have a lot of loose skin especially in the neck area to tighten and replenish the skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>I only ordered my favorite product(s) out of the set.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any more wrinkles in the last 5 years around my eyes</li>
            <li>The is not to say I&#x27;n not seeing results, just not as fast, as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement in my skin while using this product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll try something new.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend these if you have sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I cannot live without the cold plasma face cream, the blue plasma brightens my face, the sub-D has done wonders on my neck.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> but You send me other &amp;#34;The Science of Plasma&amp;#34; and I buy The Science of Cold Plasma.</li>
            <li> I never leave negative reviews and feel guilty for doing so here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not seeing the dramatic results the website quoted.  </li>
            <li> and I am a sashimi fanatic!!</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> Also it has an unpleasant fish smell.</li>
            <li> I got a horrible rash from all 4 of these products.</li>

            <li> This is a excellent product but You send me other &amp;#34;The Science of Plasma&amp;#34; and I buy The Science of Cold Plasma.</li>
            <li> Just started using it but it smells like fish. I can&#x27;t get past the smell. Will not order more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivery was even sooner as expected. Thank you...</li>
            <li> I never leave negative reviews and feel guilty for doing so here. However...I love everything Dr. Perricone makes EXCEPT this line of products! It smelled like mackerel sashimi all over my face and I am a sashimi fanatic!! Unless you are a big fish fan, I cannot recommend this. Sorry...</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, it feels good on my skin, my skin feels good the next day.  I&#x27;m just not seeing the dramatic results the website quoted.  The is not to say I&#x27;n not seeing results, just not as fast, as I&#x27;d like.  I just re ordered more product, nut this time I only ordered my favorite product(s) out of the set.</li>
            <li> Smells like fish and gave me a rash</li>
            <li> I got a horrible rash from all 4 of these products. I do not recommend these if you have sensitive skin it is far to harsh.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells like fish when you put it on your face so your pillow case also gets smelly after laying on it.  I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement in my skin while using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 58 and have tried a lot of face products over the years. Who hasn&#x27;t?  I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Perricone products for 5 years now. Sometimes I&#x27;ll try something new. After a month I always regret it. Dr. Perricone firms my face, makes it softer, gets rid of the dark pigmentation and is just awesome. I cannot live without the cold plasma face cream, the blue plasma brightens my face, the sub-D has done wonders on my neck. The eye cream, I&#x27;ll be honest, does not do as well as I would want. But I haven&#x27;t found anything else to do better. I haven&#x27;t gotten any more wrinkles in the last 5 years around my eyes so maybe it&#x27;s working better than I thought.</li>
            <li> I think I am allergic to these products.  They make me break out.  I am usually not hyper sensitive to good skin care products but these made me break out in pimples.</li>
            <li> Very good product for people like me who have lost a lot of weight and have a lot of loose skin especially in the neck area to tighten and replenish the skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> 2nd time around using this product and it&#x27;s magnificent!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the skin texture or reduction in wrinkles. Also it has an unpleasant fish smell.</li>
            <li> i was expecting to recieve the product as shown, because one of my favorites is blue plasma for night and recieved something completey different,very upset over this ,i have had no luck on recieving correct product,i want a refund or what i actually ordered,</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my aunt she broke out with a red rash all over her face . when I tried to get a refund from Guthy Renker  the sales rep gave me an attitude and told me no I cant . I had to call back a second time and threaten bbb to get a refund . I would not recommend this product to anyone .</li>
            <li> still using it every day. I am seeing some results, but the compliments I get are even better</li>
            <li> Works well but couldn&#x27;t stand the fishy smell! Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
