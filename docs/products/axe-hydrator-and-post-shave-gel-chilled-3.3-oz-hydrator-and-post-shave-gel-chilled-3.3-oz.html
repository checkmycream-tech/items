            <li>works great, feels good on my face</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re fighting off wrinkles, irritation or helping your skin recover from a sunburn, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I tried this out, it feels good but the scent is just overpowering and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>This is also a good gel when you think your skin is about to irritate.  </li>
            <li>Axe has made a good product line with</li>
            <li>They both loved the post shave gel and both</li>
            <li>real clean feel for hours!</li>
            <li>The gel feels amazing on my face</li>
            <li>Nice product, not of everyone,</li>
            <li>If you are the kind of guy going for that Axe Effect, this post-shave gel will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Switching to a gel-based aftershave was nice.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice \\&quot;minty-like\\&quot; fragrance afterwards for a nice finishing touch.</li>
            <li>He said it was easy to use, felt great and was refreshing and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surely, this is not the primary purpose meant for this product&#x27;s use, but it worked for me and I am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It keeps them smelling good which is always important.</li>
            <li>It also has a very light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in moisturizing, which is great, because any man should know that after shaving, you tend to be a little oily, and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many gels over the years</li>
            <li>it all over me....smells sexy like a man.  </li>
            <li>I love AXE products.</li>
            <li>guess what I love it</li>
            <li>This post shave gel really works great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I bet you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results as I was.</li>
            <li>It did burn my eyes a bit, but it smelled nice and not like cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Really love this post shave...</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I really love this after shave.</li>
            <li>He likes the \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; after shave better.</li>
            <li>Seems to provide more moisturizing than the splash on lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing yet not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s latest shave line.  </li>
            <li>Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products.</li>
            <li>The more I used this product, the tighter my face became.  </li>
            <li>It has a really good smell that is just right and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>when he tried this one, he said that it has a very clean minty smell and makes your face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Best aftercare I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>This Axe after shave gel is a good way to cool off your skin after those hot shaves or any shave where your skin is still warm and supple.  </li>
            <li>The Axe Men&#x27;s line of body products are all quite good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It really makes your face feel good and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to wash off.</li>
            <li>the strong scent Axe puts in their products.</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing with no burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>In terms of performance, you can expect a really clean shave; additionally, this product has a great smell and leaves your skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>they were fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it and find it&#x27;s adequate, but nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li>This one goes very well with the face soap and the shaving gel, and I would even say the three items can make a nice inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li>Axe Face Hydrator Post Shave Gel also works as a Day and Night Moisturizer leaving your skin feeling smooth all day and night.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you face smooth and lubricated after a shave.</li>
            <li>The smell is intense too, kind of like whatever cologne</li>
            <li>My nephew says it is a good product, soothes the burn from shaving and leaves your skin soft and \\&quot;burn\\&quot; free.</li>
            <li>Every time I shave or wash my face, I squirt the gooey, bluish-white gel into my right palm and smear it all over my face, mostly on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product and definitely recommended.  </li>
            <li>It feels kind of like petroleum jelly going on, but dries quickly without much residue.  </li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and cool.</li>
            <li>Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>dry skin, no residue and one happy husband.</li>
            <li>I found the smell to be a mix of mint and sweet 7-up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; just cool-</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gel&#x27;s cooling effect is great, but it&#x27;s not the only positive aspect of this product.</li>
            <li>A nice application of cool and tingling gel will calm your skin down nicely.  </li>
            <li>ABSORED INTO THE SKIN QUICKLY</li>
            <li>After applying the gel, the product quickly cools any irritation from a shave, and has no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>This gel is very easy to apply and it is also quick-drying and not messy.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and the cool gel feeling is refreshing and last for several hours.</li>
            <li>For the last two years, I&#x27;ve been using Nivea after shave lotion, and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This hydrator and cooling gel does a great job on my face.with an added benefit of a slight skin tightner.</li>
            <li>It lets you feel ok about getting a really close shave, because once you put this on, it feels a bit slimy at first, but then you rub it in, and it will moisturize your skin and prevent any post shave razor type burn.  </li>
            <li>If you still have some irritation after that, I think this product is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Axe Face Hydrator is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product that enhances the shave by moisturizing the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I use and love many of the other products in the Axe line.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t exactly subtle, but it&#x27;s refreshing and nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not long lasting.</li>
            <li>It smells very manly and great and is not overwhelmingly stinky like some of the AXE</li>
            <li>the bottom line, though, I just don&#x27;t think I need a product like this enough to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this gel and will continue to use it, and would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Its a bit sticky but really refreshing and definitely it will wake you up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will definitely get some more of this to use.</li>
            <li>This product does have a cooling effect and nice scent, but nothing distinguishes this from other shaving gels.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit, and the fragrance is masculine and pleasant, without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the other products in the Chilled line (face soap and shaving gel) and the scent is the exact same as this after shave gel, but for some reason, this scent is most fitting as an after-shave gel as it is what I expect after-shave gel to smell like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp and clean feeling and something that I&#x27;ve added to my regiment and it appears to be healing my face faster between shaves, especially any unplanned irritation...</li>
            <li>You can easily wear your favorite cologne because it&#x27;s not going to be competition, it&#x27;s fairly subtle after it dries.  </li>
            <li>The combination of menthol and alcohol stung my skin as much as it stimulated it, but the irritation was soon over.  </li>
            <li>While it is a cool/refreshing gel, there&#x27;s just a bit too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bummer though, because it appears that AXE has discontinued this whole line of face/shave products.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really like this.  </li>
            <li>He said that he used it with the chilled shaving gel and really likes the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised to find that this Axe product has a very gentle cooling feeling that makes my face feel nice and tight after a shave.  </li>
            <li>The gel is slightly chilled so when it comes out it feels cool to the touch and goes on smoothly after shaving.</li>
            <li>- Duh!? :P</li>
            <li>It definitely feels cool going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, let me say that the Axe Face Hydrator appears and smells masculine.  </li>
            <li>If you have a lot of skin irritation or dryness after shaving, my first recommendation would be to try a new razor and a new shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I use this product every morning after showering and shaving highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest that this was largely due to the fact that I only associated the Axe brand with body sprays and deodorant.</li>
            <li>When the tingling wore off, my face definitely felt smooth and fresh, and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering, so people who like a little wake-up kick in the morning and enjoy a rugged old-fashioned cologne smell should definitely try this product, but it was a little more than I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and moisturized, and the scent was milder than expected from Axe.  </li>
            <li>I normally just use a splash on lotion for aftershave.</li>
            <li>Love the cooling sensation it gives after shaving, without any heavy or oily moisturizing, in which I use a moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li>Product is definitely geared to men as it has distinctly manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found a new after shave gel.</li>
            <li>it has cucumber and some other nice herbals in it, and after you shave, you put it on once you dry your face instead of aftershave.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not overwhelming as with so many of these products.</li>
            <li>Surprised that Axe would make something for a grown man!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and usually anything touching my skin after a shave is bothersome.  </li>
            <li>It has a rather strong minty/menthol smell which is quite invigorating and fades away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might want to sniff a little at your local Walgreens or CVS before you buy, just to be sure you like the smell.</li>
            <li>My normally clear complexion also became pimply.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m a wuss, maybe my skin is just sensitive, but I can&#x27;t imagine somebody would like this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how well this product delivered.</li>
            <li>Dove Men+Care Sensitive +</li>
            <li>Never thought I needed one as a guy, I really wish I would have found something like this earlier.</li>
            <li>My face is too sensitive for the Axe Face Hydrator.  </li>
            <li>Lots of brand name products ranging from all sorts of creams, perfumes, and other fancy things, and then in the middle of that you&#x27;ll find this cheap thing that I was not supposed to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Sure, you could purchase 100% generic products for less money, but you&#x27;ve likely already decided not to if you&#x27;ve considered any of these options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it seems a little strong.</li>
            <li>But my legs got extra TLC, moisture and care and skin was very soft to touch afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The left side is definitely a little bit smoother and has a tiny bit more friction, but not enough to make a difference to me.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I expected a strong cooling sensation as I have felt from other products that made the same claim.  </li>
            <li>This product neither hydrates nor cools my sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets trying it.  </li>
            <li>If  you don&#x27;t wear any other fragrance, people probably won&#x27;t notice unless they get really close.</li>
            <li>However, it dries quickly and continues to dry until my face feels tight.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, after a few minutes, it evaporates nicely and adds on a subtle sheen.  </li>
            <li>This performs adequately but not spectacularly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My nephew says it is a good product, soothes the burn from shaving and leaves your skin soft and \\&quot;burn\\&quot; free.</li>
            <li> Every time I shave or wash my face, I squirt the gooey, bluish-white gel into my right palm and smear it all over my face, mostly on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product and definitely recommended.  </li>
            <li> It feels kind of like petroleum jelly going on, but dries quickly without much residue.  </li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and cool.</li>
            <li> Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> dry skin, no residue and one happy husband.</li>
            <li> I found the smell to be a mix of mint and sweet 7-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; just cool-</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gel&#x27;s cooling effect is great, but it&#x27;s not the only positive aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> A nice application of cool and tingling gel will calm your skin down nicely.  </li>
            <li> ABSORED INTO THE SKIN QUICKLY</li>
            <li> After applying the gel, the product quickly cools any irritation from a shave, and has no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> This gel is very easy to apply and it is also quick-drying and not messy.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and the cool gel feeling is refreshing and last for several hours.</li>
            <li> For the last two years, I&#x27;ve been using Nivea after shave lotion, and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> This hydrator and cooling gel does a great job on my face.with an added benefit of a slight skin tightner.</li>
            <li> It lets you feel ok about getting a really close shave, because once you put this on, it feels a bit slimy at first, but then you rub it in, and it will moisturize your skin and prevent any post shave razor type burn.  </li>
            <li> If you still have some irritation after that, I think this product is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Axe Face Hydrator is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product that enhances the shave by moisturizing the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use and love many of the other products in the Axe line.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t exactly subtle, but it&#x27;s refreshing and nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> It smells very manly and great and is not overwhelmingly stinky like some of the AXE</li>
            <li> the bottom line, though, I just don&#x27;t think I need a product like this enough to buy more.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gel and will continue to use it, and would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Its a bit sticky but really refreshing and definitely it will wake you up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely get some more of this to use.</li>
            <li> This product does have a cooling effect and nice scent, but nothing distinguishes this from other shaving gels.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, and the fragrance is masculine and pleasant, without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the other products in the Chilled line (face soap and shaving gel) and the scent is the exact same as this after shave gel, but for some reason, this scent is most fitting as an after-shave gel as it is what I expect after-shave gel to smell like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp and clean feeling and something that I&#x27;ve added to my regiment and it appears to be healing my face faster between shaves, especially any unplanned irritation...</li>
            <li> You can easily wear your favorite cologne because it&#x27;s not going to be competition, it&#x27;s fairly subtle after it dries.  </li>
            <li> The combination of menthol and alcohol stung my skin as much as it stimulated it, but the irritation was soon over.  </li>
            <li> While it is a cool/refreshing gel, there&#x27;s just a bit too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bummer though, because it appears that AXE has discontinued this whole line of face/shave products.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really like this.  </li>
            <li> He said that he used it with the chilled shaving gel and really likes the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised to find that this Axe product has a very gentle cooling feeling that makes my face feel nice and tight after a shave.  </li>
            <li> The gel is slightly chilled so when it comes out it feels cool to the touch and goes on smoothly after shaving.</li>
            <li> - Duh!? :P</li>
            <li> It definitely feels cool going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, let me say that the Axe Face Hydrator appears and smells masculine.  </li>
            <li> If you have a lot of skin irritation or dryness after shaving, my first recommendation would be to try a new razor and a new shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I use this product every morning after showering and shaving highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest that this was largely due to the fact that I only associated the Axe brand with body sprays and deodorant.</li>
            <li> When the tingling wore off, my face definitely felt smooth and fresh, and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering, so people who like a little wake-up kick in the morning and enjoy a rugged old-fashioned cologne smell should definitely try this product, but it was a little more than I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and moisturized, and the scent was milder than expected from Axe.  </li>
            <li> I normally just use a splash on lotion for aftershave.</li>
            <li> Love the cooling sensation it gives after shaving, without any heavy or oily moisturizing, in which I use a moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> Product is definitely geared to men as it has distinctly manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found a new after shave gel.</li>
            <li> it has cucumber and some other nice herbals in it, and after you shave, you put it on once you dry your face instead of aftershave.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming as with so many of these products.</li>
            <li> Surprised that Axe would make something for a grown man!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and usually anything touching my skin after a shave is bothersome.  </li>
            <li> It has a rather strong minty/menthol smell which is quite invigorating and fades away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might want to sniff a little at your local Walgreens or CVS before you buy, just to be sure you like the smell.</li>
            <li> My normally clear complexion also became pimply.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m a wuss, maybe my skin is just sensitive, but I can&#x27;t imagine somebody would like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how well this product delivered.</li>
            <li> Dove Men+Care Sensitive +</li>
            <li> Never thought I needed one as a guy, I really wish I would have found something like this earlier.</li>
            <li> My face is too sensitive for the Axe Face Hydrator.  </li>
            <li> Lots of brand name products ranging from all sorts of creams, perfumes, and other fancy things, and then in the middle of that you&#x27;ll find this cheap thing that I was not supposed to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Sure, you could purchase 100% generic products for less money, but you&#x27;ve likely already decided not to if you&#x27;ve considered any of these options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it seems a little strong.</li>
            <li> But my legs got extra TLC, moisture and care and skin was very soft to touch afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The left side is definitely a little bit smoother and has a tiny bit more friction, but not enough to make a difference to me.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I expected a strong cooling sensation as I have felt from other products that made the same claim.  </li>
            <li> This product neither hydrates nor cools my sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets trying it.  </li>
            <li> If  you don&#x27;t wear any other fragrance, people probably won&#x27;t notice unless they get really close.</li>
            <li> However, it dries quickly and continues to dry until my face feels tight.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, after a few minutes, it evaporates nicely and adds on a subtle sheen.  </li>
            <li> This performs adequately but not spectacularly.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I highly recommend trying this one out.</li>
            <li> It stings, it dries out my skin (uncomfortably so) and it can be extremely strong in the smell department.  </li>
            <li> A very small amount of it will cover your whole face, so I think the can will last a while.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you&#x27;re having skin irritation or want to capture that last 2% of grooming perfection, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pleasurable cool but an annoying painful \\&quot;cold\\&quot; sensation from the menthol, which apparently when applied to a freshly shaven face feels extra potent.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve stopped using them because of how long it takes to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a test, I tried using the hydrator gel only on the left side of my face for a week, and the difference is slight if any.  </li>
            <li> last element which I appreciate in this product design is, unlike other products on the market, the can dispenses a sensible amount for each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved in the shower, then spread on some of this gel a few minutes later, and it definitely woke me up.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, my face became very dry, red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> The hydrating formula helps my skin from drying out, but it doesn&#x27;t ever feel oily or too wet.  </li>
            <li> I used have tried it both in combination with the Axe chilled shave gel and with other non-chilled shave gels.</li>
            <li> Received other items from Axe...</li>
            <li> There is an immediate and intense tingling/stinging sensation, not quite painful but not too far from it.  </li>
            <li> My husband did try it...but could only use once with residue in bottom of hard plastic cylinder.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Axe Face Hydrator for nearly a week and the side effects continue to grow worse.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also slight.  </li>
            <li> the can just a little less viscous than petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> This one unfortunate experience will not deter me from continuing to test new Axe products.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, it leaves a sticky gel feeling on your face which disappears in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I started using this post shave gel a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> found it worked well without any harsh reactions.</li>
            <li> So after trying this post shave gel twice, it has gone in the garbage to be used no more.</li>
            <li> So when you look at my personal toiletries you&#x27;ll see a variety of expensive products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using gels in the past</li>
            <li> No more burning feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Axe isn&#x27;t so ridiculously priced that you&#x27;re going to pay through the nose and the quality of the product isn&#x27;t lacking.</li>
            <li> you try it as an actual shave gel, trust me, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sensation is chilly but not an overpowering menthol.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that when this says cooling that it meant it had a lot of eucalyptus in it, but that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was that painful.</li>
            <li> my opinion, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the performance and value for money.</li>
            <li> I generally hate the way my skin feels</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hydrator and cooling gel does a great job on my face.with an added benefit of a slight skin tightner.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it leaves a sticky gel feeling on your face which disappears in a few minutes. I found the smell to be a mix of mint and sweet 7-up. I&#x27;m using it and find it&#x27;s adequate, but nothing outstanding. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The Axe Men&#x27;s line of body products are all quite good and reasonably priced. Sure, you could purchase 100% generic products for less money, but you&#x27;ve likely already decided not to if you&#x27;ve considered any of these options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe isn&#x27;t so ridiculously priced that you&#x27;re going to pay through the nose and the quality of the product isn&#x27;t lacking. I&#x27;ve used this as a facial gel in the AM before leaving the house and it has just enough emollient so I can skip having to use a lotion as well. Nice product, not of everyone, but if you&#x27;re fighting off wrinkles, irritation or helping your skin recover from a sunburn, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> would buy again&lt;br /&gt;husband likes it and smells great / keeps skin hydrated / will recommend to others to use</li>
            <li> Great Stuff - already knew that when I ordered</li>
            <li> works great, feels good on my face</li>
            <li> After using it as a shaving cream, I then actually read the instructions and realized that it&#x27;s a POST shave gel, meaning it&#x27;s to be used AFTER shaving. It&#x27;s not supposed to be used for shaving, but after shaving, which I should have realized sooner.  For that aspect, it works great and removes the irritation sometimes caused after shaving.  It smells very manly and great and is not overwhelmingly stinky like some of the AXE products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try it as an actual shave gel, trust me, you will be disappointed. LOL</li>
            <li> I generally hate the way my skin feels after I shave and was looking forward to trying a \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; post shave gel, thinking it would help reduce the after-shave irritation. I used have tried it both in combination with the Axe chilled shave gel and with other non-chilled shave gels. The result was the same: It hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe chilled shave gel hurts. It&#x27;s not a pleasurable cool but an annoying painful \\&quot;cold\\&quot; sensation from the menthol, which apparently when applied to a freshly shaven face feels extra potent. So after trying this post shave gel twice, it has gone in the garbage to be used no more. Perhaps I&#x27;m a wuss, maybe my skin is just sensitive, but I can&#x27;t imagine somebody would like this stuff.</li>
            <li> After shaving with the Chilled shave gel, it just makes sense not to have a different scent competing for the after shave job.  I&#x27;ll reiterate that you should have scrubbed your face with a Axe face wash before shaving and before you put on a moisturizing aftershave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensation is chilly but not an overpowering menthol.  It&#x27;s crisp and clean feeling and something that I&#x27;ve added to my regiment and it appears to be healing my face faster between shaves, especially any unplanned irritation...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many gels over the years and I was surprised at how well this product delivered. I&#x27;ll be honest that this was largely due to the fact that I only associated the Axe brand with body sprays and deodorant. In terms of performance, you can expect a really clean shave; additionally, this product has a great smell and leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last element which I appreciate in this product design is, unlike other products on the market, the can dispenses a sensible amount for each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the performance and value for money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I continue to try Axe products. I like the description but what I can&#x27;t get over is the strong scent Axe puts in their products. I tried this out, it feels good but the scent is just overpowering and gives me a headache. I also tried the [[ASIN:B00A0J0ABK Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Post Shave Balm]]  and that is what I prefer over the Axe post shave gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use post shave gel too often but I always keep some on hand.  Ideally, I want it to be cooling, soothing and smell good.  I have tried the other products in the Chilled line (face soap and shaving gel) and the scent is the exact same as this after shave gel, but for some reason, this scent is most fitting as an after-shave gel as it is what I expect after-shave gel to smell like.  This one goes very well with the face soap and the shaving gel, and I would even say the three items can make a nice inexpensive gift.</li>
            <li> If you are the kind of guy going for that Axe Effect, this post-shave gel will do the trick.  The scent isn&#x27;t exactly subtle, but it&#x27;s refreshing and nice on the skin.  You might want to sniff a little at your local Walgreens or CVS before you buy, just to be sure you like the smell.</li>
            <li> Best aftercare I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> This product exploded inside the package.  I think something in the cooling aspect did not like Florida heat even though mailman left it in the 72 degree day shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it all over me....smells sexy like a man.  My husband did try it...but could only use once with residue in bottom of hard plastic cylinder.  The packkging was cracked in several places.  Received other items from Axe...they were fine.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of skin irritation or dryness after shaving, my first recommendation would be to try a new razor and a new shave cream.  If you still have some irritation after that, I think this product is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: it&#x27;s basically a goo that comes out of the can just a little less viscous than petroleum jelly.  It feels kind of like petroleum jelly going on, but dries quickly without much residue.  A very small amount of it will cover your whole face, so I think the can will last a while.  It definitely feels cool going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottom line, though, I just don&#x27;t think I need a product like this enough to buy more.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m also using [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe&#x27;s \\&quot;Shield\\&quot; Shave Gel]], but my face is plenty protected and hydrated without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, I tried using the hydrator gel only on the left side of my face for a week, and the difference is slight if any.  The left side is definitely a little bit smoother and has a tiny bit more friction, but not enough to make a difference to me.  On the other hand, if you&#x27;re having skin irritation or want to capture that last 2% of grooming perfection, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the hydrator that was designed for women named H2O, except this is for me.  I love AXE products.</li>
            <li> Axe Face Hydrator Chilled and Cooling Post Shave Gel, is a great addition to your Axe collection. The gel is slightly chilled so when it comes out it feels cool to the touch and goes on smoothly after shaving. It has a rather strong minty/menthol smell which is quite invigorating and fades away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe Face Hydrator Post Shave Gel also works as a Day and Night Moisturizer leaving your skin feeling smooth all day and night. I absolutely love this gel and will continue to use it, and would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the cool gel feeling is refreshing and last for several hours.</li>
            <li> So when you look at my personal toiletries you&#x27;ll see a variety of expensive products. Lots of brand name products ranging from all sorts of creams, perfumes, and other fancy things, and then in the middle of that you&#x27;ll find this cheap thing that I was not supposed to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well guess what I love it and it&#x27;s the only product I use after shaving. Its a bit sticky but really refreshing and definitely it will wake you up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of pumps and you are out.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing with no burning sensation.  Leaves skin smooth and hydrated.  Very nice product and definitely recommended.  The scent is not overwhelming as with so many of these products.</li>
            <li> This post shave gel really works great. It is very easy to apply. It really makes your face feel good and refreshed. It has a really good smell that is just right and not too overpowering. Will definitely get some more of this to use.</li>
            <li> great PRODUCT. NOT GREASY OR STICKY. ABSORED INTO THE SKIN QUICKLY AN DOES NOT LEAVE A FEELING OF WEARIG A MASK. I LIKE THE WAY IT LEAVES MY SKIN FEEL. KEEPS MY SKIN NOT PEALING WHICH HAPPENS SOMESTIMES. GIVE IT A TRY.</li>
            <li> This was well received by my husband, the toughest critic around! He said it was easy to use, felt great and was refreshing and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No dry skin, no residue and one happy husband.</li>
            <li> I started using this post shave gel a few weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the results. The gel feels amazing on my face and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results. This post shave gel will be a part of my shaving routine for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel&#x27;s cooling effect is great, but it&#x27;s not the only positive aspect of this product. It&#x27;s easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to wash off. I&#x27;ve stopped using gels in the past and I&#x27;ve stopped using them because of how long it takes to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Axe Face Hydrator is worth a try. I bet you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results as I was.</li>
            <li> Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel looks and feels like slime.  After shaving, I applied it and was concerned that my face would look and feel like it was covered in a layer of shiny slime all day.  Thankfully, after a few minutes, it evaporates nicely and adds on a subtle sheen.  My face felt smooth and moisturized, and the scent was milder than expected from Axe.  It did burn my eyes a bit, but it smelled nice and not like cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;cooling,\\&quot; as you might expect, if from menthol.  The combination of menthol and alcohol stung my skin as much as it stimulated it, but the irritation was soon over.  Overall, a nice product that enhances the shave by moisturizing the skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Actually cools and refreshes.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Feels great and soothing.</li>
            <li> Really love this post shave...price was great and delivery time was excellent!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used different after shave products, some just burned and dried my face out, and others left my skin feeling very oily.  For the last two years, I&#x27;ve been using Nivea after shave lotion, and have been very pleased with it.  I thought I would give this gel a try.  With it claiming to be \\&quot;chilled dn cooling\\&quot; I expected a strong cooling sensation as I have felt from other products that made the same claim.  I was quite surprised to find that this Axe product has a very gentle cooling feeling that makes my face feel nice and tight after a shave.  After applying the gel, the product quickly cools any irritation from a shave, and has no greasy residue.  It also has a very light scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses.  I think I&#x27;ve found a new after shave gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Axe hair gel for years and I love them. Now I have a chance to try out their after shave products. As always, Axe products are excellent. I used the \\&quot;generic\\&quot; after shave and it felt like I applied rubbing alcohol to my face. It literally burned my face. I used to take a deep breath before applying the generic after shave. Yes, it was that painful. I used the Axe this morning and I felt like heaven. No more burning feeling. My face felt smooth and cool. The \\&quot;minty\\&quot; feeling lasted for about 30 mins. I really love this after shave. Will definitely recommend it to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;P/S: My dad doesn&#x27;t like the Axe. He says it&#x27;s too \\&quot;soft\\&quot;. He likes the \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; after shave better. So, I guess it depends on your \\&quot;taste\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I normally just use a splash on lotion for aftershave. Switching to a gel-based aftershave was nice. Seems to provide more moisturizing than the splash on lotion. The only thing is that it seems a little strong. While it is a cool/refreshing gel, there&#x27;s just a bit too much alcohol. Would recommend it to friends, but I probably won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Love the cooling sensation it gives after shaving, without any heavy or oily moisturizing, in which I use a moisturizer over it.  It&#x27;s light in moisturizing, which is great, because any man should know that after shaving, you tend to be a little oily, and this is perfect.  I use on my face and my head (bald, so I shave it twice a week).  It&#x27;s a bummer though, because it appears that AXE has discontinued this whole line of face/shave products.  I&#x27;ve tried many products, including your nicer, costly products, but for the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  I will miss it if it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it works! No kid scent real clean feel for hours! I&#x27;ll be getting more!! Surprised that Axe would make something for a grown man! They have my respect, now. This stuff is even better than Jack Blacks after Gel!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Axe brand shaving gel for shaving my legs.  After shower, I followed it by applying Axe post shave gel that has dual purpose: it hydrates the skin and cools skin off.  Product is definitely geared to men as it has distinctly manly fragrance.  But my legs got extra TLC, moisture and care and skin was very soft to touch afterwards.  Surely, this is not the primary purpose meant for this product&#x27;s use, but it worked for me and I am quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> After shave isn&#x27;t always my friend.  It stings, it dries out my skin (uncomfortably so) and it can be extremely strong in the smell department.  On a whim, I decided to give this a shot and I have to say that I really like this.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and usually anything touching my skin after a shave is bothersome.  The hydrating formula helps my skin from drying out, but it doesn&#x27;t ever feel oily or too wet.  It feels healthy.  The smell is also slight.  It is refreshing yet not overbearing.  A little goes a long way, and I highly recommend trying this one out.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works in well. Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin and I have no quirks about this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soothes Skin&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in Well&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant Aroma&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None - Duh!? :P</li>
            <li> This Axe after shave gel is a good way to cool off your skin after those hot shaves or any shave where your skin is still warm and supple.  This is also a good gel when you think your skin is about to irritate.  A nice application of cool and tingling gel will calm your skin down nicely.  This gel is very easy to apply and it is also quick-drying and not messy.  It also has a nice \\&quot;minty-like\\&quot; fragrance afterwards for a nice finishing touch.</li>
            <li> Axe has made a good product line with it&#x27;s latest shave line.  I was afraid that when this says cooling that it meant it had a lot of eucalyptus in it, but that&#x27;s not the case.  It&#x27; just cool- it has cucumber and some other nice herbals in it, and after you shave, you put it on once you dry your face instead of aftershave.  It lets you feel ok about getting a really close shave, because once you put this on, it feels a bit slimy at first, but then you rub it in, and it will moisturize your skin and prevent any post shave razor type burn.  It only takes a little bit, and the fragrance is masculine and pleasant, without being overwhelming.  You can easily wear your favorite cologne because it&#x27;s not going to be competition, it&#x27;s fairly subtle after it dries.  If  you don&#x27;t wear any other fragrance, people probably won&#x27;t notice unless they get really close.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes your face after shaving and smells great. I use this product every morning after showering and shaving highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Got this to try a face moisturizer. Never thought I needed one as a guy, I really wish I would have found something like this earlier. Works great!</li>
            <li> My teenage son uses AXE product a lot, so when he tried this one, he said that it has a very clean minty smell and makes your face feel refreshed. He said that he used it with the chilled shaving gel and really likes the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> This product does have a cooling effect and nice scent, but nothing distinguishes this from other shaving gels. This performs adequately but not spectacularly.  I would not purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products. It keeps them smelling good which is always important. They both loved the post shave gel and both found it worked well without any harsh reactions. A+</li>
            <li> Leaves you face smooth and lubricated after a shave.</li>
            <li> My nephew says it is a good product, soothes the burn from shaving and leaves your skin soft and \\&quot;burn\\&quot; free. The scent is pleasant and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely know when you&#x27;ve rubbed this gel into all the areas of your face that you just shaved.  I shaved in the shower, then spread on some of this gel a few minutes later, and it definitely woke me up.  There is an immediate and intense tingling/stinging sensation, not quite painful but not too far from it.  The smell is intense too, kind of like whatever cologne your dad used to use back in the day.  When the tingling wore off, my face definitely felt smooth and fresh, and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering, so people who like a little wake-up kick in the morning and enjoy a rugged old-fashioned cologne smell should definitely try this product, but it was a little more than I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, is a luxury item that I would never have purchased for myself.  The Amazon Vine Program graciously mailed it to me and I was eager to use it.  First, let me say that the Axe Face Hydrator appears and smells masculine.  Every time I shave or wash my face, I squirt the gooey, bluish-white gel into my right palm and smear it all over my face, mostly on my cheeks.  It looks and tingles like shaving gel.  However, it dries quickly and continues to dry until my face feels tight.  The more I used this product, the tighter my face became.  After a few days, my face became very dry, red and irritated.  My normally clear complexion also became pimply.  Soon, my face was burning, even hours after I had used the Axe Face Hydrator.  This product neither hydrates nor cools my sensitive facial skin.  Instead, it dries and burns it.  I have used the Axe Face Hydrator for nearly a week and the side effects continue to grow worse.  I will definitely stop using this product.  My face is too sensitive for the Axe Face Hydrator.  I have no regrets trying it.  I use and love many of the other products in the Axe line.  This one unfortunate experience will not deter me from continuing to test new Axe products.  In the meantime, I will be on the lookout for another brand of face hydrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
