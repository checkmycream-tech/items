            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Just what my wife wanted and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I have allergies and this has worked great.</li>
            <li>it also has a great price tag .</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>I bought the medium even though I have fair skin in the winter ----</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>I live in Punta Cana, so I&#x27;m very happy that it also has SPF built in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t itch or otherwise irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light, but is labeled at 300 Medium.  </li>
            <li>Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup for an aging skin.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage and the color blends very well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>I and my friend have used this makeup for about three years and we love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smooths wrinkles and covers spots.  </li>
            <li>I use Retin A (Inhouse Pharmacy online without a prescription) and Retinol cream (Amazon) for anti aging and just wanted a makeup for light even coverage with some SPF also.  </li>
            <li>My friend is light skinned and mine is tan and it works on both our complexions.  </li>
            <li>totally worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and goes on easily without filling up wrinkles in an obvious fashion.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>You need to be consistent with the moisturizer you apply underneath.</li>
            <li>Way too light -- I wanted the same tint as the Smart Shade 300 Almay SPF15.  </li>
            <li>This was a little too drying for me and went on unevenly although it did match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>Only downside was the huge box it was shipped in with signature required.</li>
            <li>I had seen this in the store and it was a bit pricy and didn&#x27;t want to invest if I didn&#x27;t like it so checked out Amazon and found a two pack for a reasonable price so bought it.  </li>
            <li>it really blends.</li>
            <li>I actually have it in medium for summer and light for winter.</li>
            <li>this make-up gives you a more natural look than any other foundation that i have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little lighter than I like in color but for the wintertime, seems appropriate.  </li>
            <li>a heavy makeup anti aging SPF  love</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Unexpectedly, it goes on white like some of the sunscreen lotions but then the shade more or less comes.  </li>
            <li>The 300 shade is a little light</li>
            <li>When I applied the medium shade makeup, it suddenly turned much lighter.</li>
            <li>This foundation really surprised me.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural on my face.  </li>
            <li>It blends in with your natural skin.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to match your skin tone than trying to choose from 50 different shades!  </li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of foundation, but now that I am older, it is necessary.  </li>
            <li>The price for the two tube was a real bargain and they arrived very quickly, extremely well packaged.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, probably will not switch until it gets discontinued.  The only thing is that when our skin changes due to age, it gets hard to match.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought it and I will buy it again. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t itch or otherwise irritate my skin. I live in Punta Cana, so I&#x27;m very happy that it also has SPF built in.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel. Will recommend this item to everyone.</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly, it goes on white like some of the sunscreen lotions but then the shade more or less comes.  It&#x27;s a little lighter than I like in color but for the wintertime, seems appropriate.  It also felt a bit heavier but again, comparing it with another anti-aging foundation, it was about the same.  I think the anti-aging ingredients makes the foundations a bit drier going on or perhaps the SPF20 than without.  I had seen this in the store and it was a bit pricy and didn&#x27;t want to invest if I didn&#x27;t like it so checked out Amazon and found a two pack for a reasonable price so bought it.  I  will continue using and get used to it.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Shipping was fast! Only downside was the huge box it was shipped in with signature required.</li>
            <li> I bought the medium even though I have fair skin in the winter ---- it really blends. It covers blemishes with ease and without giving you a makeup line.  I have used all different brands of foundations, I will be sticking to this one.</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted and at a great price.</li>
            <li> totally worth purchasing. this make-up gives you a more natural look than any other foundation that i have ever used. and its only half of what you would pay for it at the store.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup for an aging skin. It&#x27;s light and goes on easily without filling up wrinkles in an obvious fashion. It is a little inconsistent in the way the color changes according to your skin condition at the time. I was using a citrus based moisturizer to lighten dark spots. When I applied the medium shade makeup, it suddenly turned much lighter. You need to be consistent with the moisturizer you apply underneath. The price for the two tube was a real bargain and they arrived very quickly, extremely well packaged.</li>
            <li> This foundation really surprised me. It has great coverage and the color blends very well with my skin tone. I actually have it in medium for summer and light for winter.</li>
            <li> I use Retin A (Inhouse Pharmacy online without a prescription) and Retinol cream (Amazon) for anti aging and just wanted a makeup for light even coverage with some SPF also.  This was a little too drying for me and went on unevenly although it did match my skin perfectly. It comes out gray and changes to your skintone. I bought two but will be giving them to my hairstylist for her clients to use after waxing. I moved on to ELF primer and ELF foundation which is just about like the MAC line but WAY Cheaper.</li>
            <li> Way too light -- I wanted the same tint as the Smart Shade 300 Almay SPF15.  It is very light, but is labeled at 300 Medium.  Would return it, but I used it once, so it&#x27;s been opened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest makeup!  I have never been a fan of foundation, but now that I am older, it is necessary.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about matching your skin color.  It goes on easily and smooths wrinkles and covers spots.  It looks very natural.  My only complaint is that it is hard to wash off your hands after putting it on.</li>
            <li> gives me the all day coverage I need thankyou</li>
            <li> Yes, it is two tubes!  Good value and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Almay. Factory packaging so it will keep.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  It looks so natural on my face.  Its a keeper!</li>
            <li> I use this foundation daily. My only wish is that they made a darker shade. The 300 shade is a little light but I adjust with other makeup. I have allergies and this has worked great. No reaction.</li>
            <li> I and my friend have used this makeup for about three years and we love it.  It blends in with your natural skin.  My friend is light skinned and mine is tan and it works on both our complexions.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. So much easier to match your skin tone than trying to choose from 50 different shades!  Like that it&#x27;s SPF 20.</li>
            <li> Not good coverage or color.</li>
            <li> Blends in with skin tone not a heavy makeup anti aging SPF  love it also has a great price tag .</li>
