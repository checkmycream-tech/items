            <li>I think I&#x27;m more discouraged that these items are sold as though they are authentic</li>
            <li>and they surely are not cause my nose and anyone elses for that matter don&#x27;t lie.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast great product would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this cologne, so does my husband.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re a million times better off just spending a bit more and purchasing it from a department store.</li>
            <li>This is the upmost  fragrance for men and it stays with you most of the day&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>The vanilla dominates this part, but the spices/woods are still easy to smell.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience of buying from abroad, but I liked it</li>
            <li>Awesome cologne, smells like oriental bakhoor and vanilla but toned down.</li>
            <li>Accurate description.</li>
            <li>This product is great, went to a local mall to buy this first</li>
            <li>I recently bought this for my husband for upcoming Father&#x27;s Day, however, after reading reviews I was a bit apprehensive, I didn&#x27;t want to give my husband a knock off because he wears the best, so he will definitely knows the difference</li>
            <li>Another plus is as far as I know, Le male isn&#x27;t very popular around here</li>
            <li>Once it dies down a bit to the heart notes, I love it even more.</li>
            <li>first i noticed the no serial number on the case it comes in .</li>
            <li>At the top, I notice a big blast of mint, lavender, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>they wanted way more for it, came here and saved money and received the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>my standby, just be aware there are knock offs out there</li>
            <li>New in package, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I really dread even using the stuff now and will probably most likely give it away to someone.</li>
            <li>I get a very vanilla-y spicey/woody sort of vibe from it.</li>
            <li>This part of the fragrance lasts about 5-8 hours on me, projecting very well for about 5.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes this on me and says it smells manly.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read says it gives off a feminine vibe, but I don&#x27;t really get that much.</li>
            <li>I guess some people think vanilla is very feminine.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper will buy again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very seductive</li>
            <li>I gave a star only for quick shipment.</li>
            <li>i collect colognes and was not the first time buying from this company about my sixth perches to date but my last !!</li>
            <li>The money I saved going cheap buying thru Amazon at a discount was not worth it.</li>
            <li>It is just right, not overpowering and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Even though the scent is similar when you first use it, however in a very short time it dissipates and actually has somewhat of a mild stench that remains.</li>
            <li>The notes at the top last on my skin anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>The cologne at first was very strong but within an hour faded, also the bottom of bottle had writing that was lean and lap-sided, also it had a fake stamp or writing that totally rubs off onto my palm, literally I had whitish silver sparkle all over my hand.</li>
            <li>I donÂ´t speak english because I live in Venezuela.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this cologne, it is because once your significant other puts it on, and he definitely will get notice!</li>
            <li>Go easy on the sprays with this guys, I usually use only 2 or 3 sprays and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite strong and heavy yet it doesn&#x27;t stay that long on the skin, maximum 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Le Male is known for its very long longevity and the bottle that I got is a joke compared to the real one.</li>
            <li>Although this smells like the legitimate le male, the fragrance does not less long at all, maybe 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>The cologne has the authentic scent; however, it is very weak and does not last.  </li>

            <li> This is hubby&#x27;s fave...sexy!  Who can say more??  If he loves it and smells sexy....he IS a sexy bitch! :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne! I think every man should own a bottle! I look forward to buying more.</li>
            <li> the fragrance lasts a short time</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for this item since 2006, Macy&#x27;s use to stock it, but discontinued the collection. glad I found it here</li>
            <li> I like this cologne because it stays on the clothes until it is washed.&lt;br /&gt;This is my husband absolutely favorite cologne and that is why I bought it for him.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this cologne, it is because once your significant other puts it on, and he definitely will get notice!</li>
            <li> To start off with the fragrance review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I originally smelled this a year or two ago and hated it for some reason. I smelled it on a piece of paper and just thought it smelt chemical. I got a sample of this from Sephora and loved it. At the top, I notice a big blast of mint, lavender, and vanilla. I get small hints of citrus, but it doesn&#x27;t dominate and I really have to dig for it. The notes at the top last on my skin anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Once it dies down a bit to the heart notes, I love it even more. I get a very vanilla-y spicey/woody sort of vibe from it. The vanilla dominates this part, but the spices/woods are still easy to smell. This part of the fragrance lasts about 5-8 hours on me, projecting very well for about 5. At the base, it&#x27;s pretty much all vanilla for me. The base can linger for another 8 hours or so on me, but obviously it&#x27;s going to be very close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Go easy on the sprays with this guys, I usually use only 2 or 3 sprays and I&#x27;m set. It&#x27;s also a little heavy at first so you might not want to spray the front of your neck if you&#x27;re susceptible to headaches. My girlfriend really likes this on me and says it smells manly. A lot of reviews I&#x27;ve read says it gives off a feminine vibe, but I don&#x27;t really get that much. I guess some people think vanilla is very feminine. Another plus is as far as I know, Le male isn&#x27;t very popular around here / I don&#x27;t smell it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Whenever I order fragrances off Amazon, I get it through Fragrancenet. All of the fragrances I&#x27;ve received from them have been authentic for a good price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper will buy again</li>
            <li> The cologne has the authentic scent; however, it is very weak and does not last.  I am disappointed and will not purchase cologne or perfume again from amazon.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he loved the fragance. I loved it too. It&#x27;s very seductive</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have never given a bad review such as this ever. I would like to discourage anyone to buy this cologne. It is surely a fake product and not the real thing. Even though the scent is similar when you first use it, however in a very short time it dissipates and actually has somewhat of a mild stench that remains. I&#x27;ve even had friends try to pick up on the scent and they couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure where this stuff comes from. You are not able to return it to Amazon once you have it. I bought Joop and Jean Paul Gaultier. These were a trade marks in my arsenal for leaving there tracks for weeks into my clothes if I just hung them on the hanger. The money I saved going cheap buying thru Amazon at a discount was not worth it. I really dread even using the stuff now and will probably most likely give it away to someone. I think I&#x27;m more discouraged that these items are sold as though they are authentic and they surely are not cause my nose and anyone elses for that matter don&#x27;t lie.</li>
            <li> New in package, shipped quickly. Would recommend to others. Accurate description. I hope this was helpful for any one looking for cologne</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne, smells like oriental bakhoor and vanilla but toned down.Bad longevity and projection on my skin. But one of my favourites.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience of buying from abroad, but I liked it</li>
            <li> This product is great, went to a local mall to buy this first they wanted way more for it, came here and saved money and received the exact same thing. Awesome deal! Shipped fast great product would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic.  The scent dissipates after being worn for a few minutes.  The bottle and logo is different from my usual bottle that I have to compare it to. I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 15 years and something is wrong.</li>
            <li> I donÂ´t speak english because I live in Venezuela. But this but purchase was Excelent, and easy! I still expect shipment to Venezuela but from another company of parcels.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne, so does my husband. It is just right, not overpowering and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Although this smells like the legitimate le male, the fragrance does not less long at all, maybe 30 minutes. Le Male is known for its very long longevity and the bottle that I got is a joke compared to the real one. I was even more disappointed when I found out that I could not return it. You&#x27;re a million times better off just spending a bit more and purchasing it from a department store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite strong and heavy yet it doesn&#x27;t stay that long on the skin, maximum 2 hours. The bottle doesn&#x27;t seem so authentic for me, as the printing on the bottle itself is a bit scratched so it could be a fake for all I know.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my husband for upcoming Father&#x27;s Day, however, after reading reviews I was a bit apprehensive, I didn&#x27;t want to give my husband a knock off because he wears the best, so he will definitely knows the difference and I will be quite embarrass to say the least. Anyway, I decided to check product out for its authenticity and hmmm- wow a total knock off. The cologne at first was very strong but within an hour faded, also the bottom of bottle had writing that was lean and lap-sided, also it had a fake stamp or writing that totally rubs off onto my palm, literally I had whitish silver sparkle all over my hand. The sprayer nozzle attached to mouth of bottle had no serial number and was raised a bit, this seriously could cut your finger and same thing for can item came in. Be fore warned, this was a total knock off, I was veeerry disappointed. I gave a star only for quick shipment. This item was purchase from amazon, not a third party.</li>
            <li> This is the upmost  fragrance for men and it stays with you most of the day&lt;br /&gt;Love it. ....</li>
            <li> my standby, just be aware there are knock offs out there</li>
            <li> I have about 2 months without knowing monitoring, I hope to answer that goes with it. I would appreciate your response</li>
