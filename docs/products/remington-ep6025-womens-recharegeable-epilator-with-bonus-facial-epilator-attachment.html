            <li>I can&#x27;t believe what we women do to be beautiful to our men, who probably don&#x27;t have any idea what it takes to have beautiful, hair-free skin!  </li>
            <li>The remingtion is very good and the service was great--as was the price.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s been in great shape ever since.  </li>
            <li>I use this about once per week which is great but</li>
            <li>some found that it worked great, but this one wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great value for the price, and I wish that I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>However, after working great for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great design...</li>
            <li>Considering the amount of money I&#x27;ll save to not buy razors, shaving cream,not to mention the time I&#x27;ll save every day, this is definitely a great investment.</li>
            <li>The additional head piece included with this epilator is great on the face.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>And it was great,</li>
            <li>I even used this on my chin and face and neck and got great results, no numbs or redness.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>But once removed it is great to not have to worry about hair for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>i got a diff one and that one works great</li>

            <li>Otherwise the battery life is awesome and cleaning the unit is a easy.</li>
            <li>This one is best for people with fine hair probably.</li>
            <li>I do, however, have a good number of ingrown hairs on my legs.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and does what it says IF you can tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li>It got rid of the hair really good ---</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my legs and bikini line as well with good results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhoo, it was a good experiment.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as good as I heard.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: for the price, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>about the bikini area, it&#x27;s good to be sitting up while you&#x27;re doing this and having a mirror facing you while you lay on a towel.</li>
            <li>With fairly good reason.</li>
            <li>I bought one for a friend and she also loved it.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as i hoped so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that good product.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>it works good</li>
            <li>This product provides the convenience of both at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you have to have a good tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I honestly feel rejuvenated to some extent.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>good luck maneuvering it on parts that aren&#x27;t flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i looked into epilators and saw this one and saw all the good reviews and noticed walgreens has it for 29.99</li>
            <li>Good quality for your money.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>This product is good to use.</li>
            <li>Good value for money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>and my skin is fair.</li>
            <li>Works good on underarms.</li>
            <li>Stays charged good.</li>
            <li>Good luck on epilating, this has saved me money and time.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to figuring out how to use this to achieve the best results, and it does hurt quite a bit at first, but once you get over that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Some way of grabbing shorter hairs would be better for me, but  until that comes along, I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is very important to hold skin taut!</li>
            <li>It is very important to hold skin taut!</li>
            <li>I used it on my arms too, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am not too happy that my neighbors are able to &#x27;hear&#x27; whatever it is I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>Now if I shave on top on epilating my legs are silky smooth for days and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>The best advice I can give is to be patient at first and keep at it.</li>
            <li>and so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Suck up the beginner&#x27;s pain, and remember the goal is to be able to go 4 weeks without shaving and getting cuts all over you!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Always make sure to rub the area you just manscaped with rubbing alcohol or an alcohol based aftershave!</li>
            <li>My sister suggested this product to me and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Its higher on price but great product!!!!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>But it is much better than the shaving - no cuts!</li>
            <li>got my Remington Epilator today and my life is changed - for the better and permanently!  </li>
            <li>I Love the Remington Epilator!</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>I researched epilators for hours before I decided on this one, and I am SO glad that I did!</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li>I like this one much better faster speeds,less pain!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>OK Ladies!</li>
            <li>Waxing was okay except i had to wait for the hair to be fully grown out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works amazingly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works amazingly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I still rave about how amazing this epilator is and have probably gotten around 10 people to buy one of their own.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, so it may an amazing product</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to women who are looking to have great skin, free of all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>This one seemed to be a favorite and got good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually kind of addicting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any woman who prefers to handle unwanted hair in the privacy of her own home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced I exfoliated to the best of my ability and still had issues, so I have decided to shave maybe once a week, but continue to touch-up with the epilator, because overall, I&#x27;ve gotten great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced I exfoliated to the best of my ability and still had issues, so I have decided to shave maybe once a week, but continue to touch-up with the epilator, because overall, I&#x27;ve gotten great</li>
            <li>My friend did that justdoing her own pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The head of the unit is nicely contoured for that.</li>
            <li>Now another friend of mine borrowed mine (after it was cleaned and wiped with hydrogen peroxide) and likes it and wants one. :D</li>
            <li>I really liked this product</li>
            <li>This is effortless to use and is effective for me already.</li>
            <li>If I got a nice discount I would buy one for my moms birthday.</li>
            <li>Handy to pack in the nice drawstring bag that is included.  </li>
            <li>Also nice to be chargeable which the Braun isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am loving this.  </li>
            <li>When cleaning, rinsing the head is nice</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>help the pain, go running before to get some endorphines, then take a warm shower and epilate.  </li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable epilators with good ratings on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>You do have to kind of look at the bottom</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective under my arms.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s fairly painles--(I&#x27;m amazed at how many people say they couldn&#x27;t tolerate the pain involved).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it, I find the best way to avoid this is hold up my arms as high as I can, keeping the skin taut and swiftly move in circular motions as it plucks away the hairs.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and my hair is fair and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Until there&#x27;s a better and more affordable option - good luck, ladies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and worthy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>epilator head is very easy to change to the precision head (for face/bikini area).</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s just too risky, unless you are ok with drawing in your own eyebrows for a while).</li>
            <li>This is a great epilator, worth the money.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s much more effective - a lot fewer passes are needed to remove the hair to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>and so far is the Braun brand is the best.</li>
            <li>I have ordered her, her own and hope this is better for her than shaving.</li>
            <li>It seems that the direction the head spins is most effective when used the machine face up instead of face</li>
            <li>This is the most effective way for the tweezers to grasp the hairs.</li>
            <li>Not at all like a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li>Luckily for me I was able to use it one my underarms and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair from waxing</li>
            <li>Her hair is very fine</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>The battery life is beginning to not be the best, but other than that, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I can use this charged or connected to the wall, it works great and is priced reasonably!</li>
            <li>I bought this as i did not want to spend a great deal of money on my first epilator in case</li>
            <li>My hair is very light</li>
            <li>Things are very smooth and no in-grown hairs develop for about a week wherever I use it, though I don&#x27;t use it on my underarms</li>
            <li>In general, this is the best epilator I have used for the leg area, but could definitely be better for underarms.   </li>
            <li>I love this worked great the first time.</li>
            <li>I will keep it for use on my lip since its super easy to grab and use (way easier than warming up wax,) but will not use on my legs or bikini area ever ever ever again!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>so it might work better for someone else</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s at a much better price than most.</li>
            <li>but I never used - forgot it in the freezer all the time) and was much more pricey - a top range panasonic.     </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and my legs are smooth (no stubble-ever!)</li>
            <li>gas$ on getting my lip waxed, and looks better than the wax.  </li>
            <li>It leaves stubble on my legs, but nothing notably visible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more years than I can remember.  </li>
            <li>I hoped to be able to watch TV while using it</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a razor or tweezers on hand for missed hairs, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, I was pleased to find out it was already charged.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie - no matter what, the bikini area and underarms will prove to be a pain challenge for sure.  </li>
            <li>But, I was able to work through it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this thing.</li>
            <li>Luckily I am able to return this with no fees, but it bums me out that I will now think twice buying items on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is just OK</li>
            <li>The epilator head has metal tweezers combined with rubberized plastic that feels like it would help stretch the skin out to grab hairs better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hoping that I would be able to do my bikini line for longer results than shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never did that, but the epilator removed most of the hair either by pulling it out from the root or breaking some off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d NEVER thought I&#x27;d ever be able to do my bikini area by myself.</li>
            <li>You can experiment with it, but I&#x27;m guessing most of you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:(4/2012)</li>
            <li>I love this epilator</li>
            <li>I am doing more to exfoliate and hope this helps.</li>
            <li>(It hurts most around the ankles and the fleshy part of your calves.</li>
            <li>But, this is much better.</li>
            <li>Guess who will never have any more of my business.</li>
            <li>At this rate, it will pay for itself since I don&#x27;t have to buy as many disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use it on the rest of my body :)</li>
            <li>It is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>Love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably because I had more hair on my arms?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to waxing at this area, so I was okay about hair being pulled off.</li>
            <li>I found it so much better than waxing or hand tweezing on the arm pits.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s better to epilate at night, so when you wake up, the redness is gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was better, so I thought I&#x27;d try it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more of these for all my daughters.</li>
            <li>Works as should and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>Then I couldn&#x27;t shave on top of the stubble</li>
            <li>u guys please get some thing better</li>
            <li>Definitely much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although there weren&#x27;t many reviews at the time I purchased the Remington EP6025, I was sold on the cordless function of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lower speed is also better for courser hair (under-arms, bikini area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My armpits have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I bought it, thinking it would be better, but in reality it works slower when it is not plugged in.</li>
            <li>, I think I save more just shaving 2 or 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;5 - 10 minutes to shave legs compared to 2 plus hours to make sure you get all the hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having had this for a year, I can confidently say - this thing is just alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using it on my legs is the place that hurts the most</li>
            <li>the smoothness never lasted for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Where there was more or courser hair</li>
            <li>Over time I am sure this will get better (again I&#x27;ve never waxed before just shaved).</li>
            <li>If you turn this so that it&#x27;s going the opposite direction of the hair growth, it does it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I like being able to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in, if the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one works so much better than the Braun I have.</li>
            <li>Looked for a replacement &amp; this fit the bill!  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the cordless rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I guess I should be glad the hair was there because who knows if the seller sometimes cleans the returned ones and sell them as &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Way better than shaving.</li>
            <li>would (it gets better).  </li>
            <li>I bought this to see if it did work and was better than having to go somewhere to have hair removed.</li>
            <li>So barely touching the skin works better than applying any pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The longer the hair is the more it hurts; however, once used to the pain</li>
            <li>I love the travel bag and have re-purposed it for my iphone as I can see and use the phone through the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;13.</li>
            <li>I wish it was wider so that it would epilate more hair in one go, making the process faster.</li>
            <li>But I should get use to it with more uses</li>
            <li>I was scared too but not any more.</li>
            <li>And sing to whatever music you have playing when you do it.  :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>For sure I can tell I&#x27;ve tried every method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best epilator</li>
            <li>the thicker the hair the more you have to go over a spot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with epilators.</li>
            <li>I actually love it more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this one because mine wasn&#x27;t working any more.</li>
            <li>I was able to get through it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get through it.  </li>
            <li>Ouch, no product that rips out your hair by the root will ever be painless, but it does get better after you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I did get ingrown hairs under the top layer of skin even though I exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>Waxing works better</li>
            <li>I returned it wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I know so many of my friends that are using it,</li>
            <li>while it does have more tweezers, I think the remington S&amp;S does a better job at pulling the hairs from the roots.  </li>
            <li>I had before many epilator</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get more of those harmful deoderant chemicals in your body.</li>
            <li>I works better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It gives me more than i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this this epilator.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with use on the underarms, but I get great results on the legs, bikini area, and forearms.  </li>
            <li>I love that the epilator is both corded and cordless.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can be used with the cord and also with rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li>It hurt more on my legs than my face, don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>any case, I LOVE the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day anymore and that my skin is so smooth to the touch!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mostly what I use it for</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i am glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I will use it a couple more times and post an update, but I may end up returning it for a refund..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and im sure with time</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the epilator that I had years ago.</li>
            <li>Much better than having to razor</li>
            <li>Make sure that it is fully charged.</li>
            <li>but the more you do it</li>
            <li>Make sure that the epilator is NOT on the charger.</li>
            <li>and then I still use my shaver, but I mostly use this now.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>But that would cost more money to implement</li>
            <li>Also, you can go over a spot more than once to get missed hairs, unlike waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way it works.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I have tweezed my armpits before and was able to handle the pain</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the epilator would work on her.</li>
            <li>and she was able to finish her legs in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>But, if she is able to do it almost anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nothing that you read is going to be able to prepare you for what it feels like.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a rechargable battery</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; keep it plugged in the bathroom-it is always.</li>
            <li>So glad it is electric &amp; doesn&#x27;t require batteries.</li>
            <li>Yes, the hair grows in slower and after MANY years of doing this, thinner.</li>
            <li>It works best using the smaller attachment.</li>
            <li>It seems to spin faster and have a bit more power to it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have more tweezers, but because it spins faster, I think it works just a bit better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>I love that it can be used cordless.  </li>
            <li>No water function-usually it just missed tones of hairs, breaks them and causes yet more ingrown</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth all the time!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>In addition to it not pulling most of the hair, I was getting ingrown hairs everywhere</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie ladies...when you first start using epilators, it hurts!!!</li>
            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>So much for smooth beautiful legs for &amp;#34;up to 6 weeks&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>especially in the winter, I am much more comfortable and best of all saving money!</li>
            <li>Works good, not quite as efficient as some higher end models I&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it perfect is a light to see all the hairs, but I am very pleased with the purchase and it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It removes all the hair in the area you&#x27;re focusing on in a quick, effective manner.</li>
            <li>after reading the reviews I decided to purchase, glad I did, would recommend this product, easy to use no problems</li>
            <li>the headphones on, your favorite show, sit on a towel or edge of bathtub and smooth away :)</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The carrying pouch is nice to keep everything together, and overall, it&#x27;s a great and easy to use product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got this; it works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t grab at my skin like other epilators</li>
            <li>Luckily it was &#x27;almost&#x27; painless! :-)</li>
            <li>Also the skin remains hair free for more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>So far, great purchase.</li>
            <li>Stick to smooth, more taut areas like legs and</li>
            <li>I think that these nearly microscopic hairs help keep a gal&#x27;s makeup in place, LOL.</li>
            <li>I love my smooth skin after using this.</li>
            <li>and i love how smooth my legs are.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my skin smooth like i want it to be.. :)</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;BTW exfoliation</li>
            <li>That light is most helpful in locating hair that you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li>The epilator doesn&#x27;t catch the very light and fine hairs, which means I still need to shave my legs for a completely smooth feeling (but shaving is 100x easier after epilation.</li>
            <li>For $200 less though - a good buy and am happy.</li>
            <li>believe you need a certain thickness of hair for the product to be able to effectively grasp the hair and rip it out by the follicle.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to operate</li>
            <li>That works well too and is easy to change out.</li>
            <li>By the way, make sure to clean it out with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li>This is an easy review for me to write.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a couple ingrown hairs (just below the surface, and easily removed) but</li>
            <li>Now, my underarm skin is smooth, comfortable, and I have way more confidence wearing tank tops and sleeveless</li>
            <li>Now, my underarm skin is smooth, comfortable, and I have way more confidence wearing tank tops and sleeveless shirts.  </li>
            <li>It works well, and the pain becomes negligible very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>Also, speaking of time, it is very quick.</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with makes cleaning easy</li>
            <li>it comes with for easy travel.</li>
            <li>There was a very mild burning sensation after I used the epilator, but the toner and lotion took care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>head is detachable and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure that you keep the tweezers clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>device itself is easy to use.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s easy, there are two plastic hook/catch thing</li>
            <li>You could easily use it for underarms and bikini instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Legs are the only area i have used the Remington, but with the variety of hair its proven to master, i am confident it would work great anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Legs are the only area i have used the Remington, but with the variety of hair its proven to master, i am confident it would work great anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I will strongly consider purchasing this brand again if this one ever dies (and it&#x27;s not showing any signs of giving up!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this epilator</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>True, this doesn&#x27;t get all of your hairs in one pass which is actually good for me because it would hurt too much if it did!</li>
            <li>When the battery finally quit, I was thrilled to feel good about splurging on a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough it seems to work the best right before the battery dies.</li>
            <li>That would be great, I thought, but mostly I was sold on the generally great reviews and really great price (less than half the price of the Braun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This is an OK product, perhaps after more use I&#x27;ll get the hang of it better as I haven&#x27;t used it much yet.</li>
            <li>The first time you do a section it hurts, but after that you honestly can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>First time using this kind of product.</li>
            <li>The power is sufficient either way.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>I bought this epilator at target about 6 years ago for $85 it still works fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best one I have purchased I had an emoi one previously</li>
            <li>I wanted an epilator that would pull out the fine leg hairs that I have.  </li>
            <li>There was some bleeding when it pulled out some of my fine hair from the root</li>
            <li>My hairs take forever to grow out and they&#x27;re so fine.</li>
            <li>Fine hair needs a lot of time to get rid off.</li>
            <li>It does not do so well with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in &amp;#34;touch-up mode&amp;#34; the battery life is fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does get the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve done laser treatment or even gotten a tattoo, this is just fine.  </li>
            <li>less money &#x3D; great purchase!</li>
            <li>It snaps on easily and securely.  </li>
            <li>(I  have a lot of blond, fine hair.)</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my legs looked after the first time using it, and expect much, much better results in the upcoming uses.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THE SELLER, THE PRODUCT ARRIVED FAST AND SAFE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great investment for a fantastic price (with free Super Saver shipping, no less)!</li>
            <li>I have course hair on my lower legs and fine blonde hair on my thighs and this works great for both areas.</li>
            <li>The fact that you don&#x27;t have to shave as often is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>But it can be used while plugged in which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I ended up tweezing instead (which, by the way, is a HUGE pain in the neck--</li>
            <li>This epilator does what it is supposed to do, it pulls out the hair and leaves it smooth for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but even when I shave with a razor now, my legs don&#x27;t get smooth</li>
            <li>-- they used to be really smooth before I started using this thing.</li>
            <li>This has been working great especially under my arms.</li>
            <li>But keep on using it, and you will see how fabulous it is!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you&#x27;re using this on your face, buy some after epilating cream to soothe your skin.</li>
            <li>agree nothing gets legs as smooth as shaving....</li>
            <li>Somehow, I found a Lady Remington Smooth and Silky.  </li>
            <li>Feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that the regions you epilate will become inflamed.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too concerned though because I don&#x27;t need a completely smooth chest</li>
            <li>The reviews made it sound like it was excruciating pain....</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a readily available benchmark.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping, and this one wasn&#x27;t available through Prime.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product</li>
            <li>continue to use this even when my legs and arms are smooth and it still continues to pick up microscopic hairs</li>
            <li>continue to use this even when my legs and arms are smooth and it still continues to pick up microscopic hairs</li>
            <li>Works great but the hair DOES keep coming back!!!</li>
            <li>enjoy this product cause</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.</li>
            <li>They look smooth and stay that way for days and days.</li>
            <li>but I am comfortable tweezing the one or two</li>
            <li>They feel baby smooth and their getting lighter.</li>
            <li>The guidelines are correct in that the pain gets easier to deal with, but I&#x27;m still working on trying to get that smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy ur hair free body.</li>
            <li>Once the hairs are gone, the machine head glides smoothly over the skin.  </li>
            <li>Once the hairs are gone, the machine head glides smoothly over the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my underarms only since it doesn&#x27;t really do a great job on my legs, I find.  </li>
            <li>But now I have fantastic results with my underarms</li>
            <li>Works GREAT for facial stuff!</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, as with any epilator it will hurt when you use it....</li>
            <li>also used it on my armpits, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck, to be honest.</li>
            <li>the legs do not feel smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li>Razors stopped giving me a smooth shave when I was 15</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>This does the job great plus the facial head is a bonus</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with keeping my legs hair free.</li>
            <li>Now I am hair free for 2 days over a week.</li>
            <li>and when she shaves she is hair free for three days.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try my armpits or bikini line yet</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator 3 years ago and have been really happy with it until recently.</li>
            <li>However, this unit does not have a light.</li>
            <li>The smaller attachment is great for what it&#x27;s intended to be for.</li>
            <li>if had a light I&#x27;d give it a five start.</li>
            <li>This is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly until the&lt;br /&gt;past few months.</li>
            <li>It really does work best when you use the circular motion, and only when you do circular motion</li>
            <li>Does a flawless job even to the more sentitive areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it works cordlessly is very practical; if you are traveling to a place with a different voltage, you can take it along fully charged and you are good to go for one total body epilation.</li>
            <li>No idea if it would be a good choice for a first-timer since that experience is so far removed in my memory.</li>
            <li>to make the package even more attractive you can wash the heads under the running water as it brings 2, one for the body and the other for the face.</li>
            <li>and initially I suspected this might be because it wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>and it does a better job than waxing (mainly because it grabs more than wax)</li>
            <li>This is perfect and I highly recommend it to any woman who is at that point where they get unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>amazingly well for underarm hair, which was my main intended use when I purchased it (never have to shave under there anymore -</li>
            <li>Thighs are not painful at all to me as the hair is fine.</li>
            <li>Got it to use on face primarily - found the small head works best for that with minimum discomfort.</li>
            <li>This epilator might be ideal for you if it&#x27;s your first time epilating or you have had no prior experience with waxing, sugaring, and/or</li>
            <li>and I am very impressed with how little I have to shave now!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and only experienced mild discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found if you go slowly in small circles it works best.</li>
            <li>I had this the first time and i am satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>but it does hurt at first until your skin gets more de-sensitized to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s it, I feel pretty satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I love it, the first time I used it;</li>
            <li>Love it absolutely!</li>
            <li>Ok, I can deal with that for it being the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I was devastated when my machine died last month, but must admit I think I love this model even more!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>It also cuts my time significantly because I used to pluck things by hand.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, I was more than a bit intimidated when I first turned it on.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling if I were more consistent that the results would be even</li>
            <li>Very fine hair and very course hair.</li>
            <li>But I kind of wanted a new one, this one was on sale</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many epilady shavers, and so far, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>But ~ I powered through it knowing that it would help me have clean, stubble-free underarms if I could just bear the pain.    </li>
            <li>With a mini part you can clean a bikini</li>
            <li>Also it came with a brush to clean and a bag ^_^</li>
            <li>, I feel like my money is well spent, and I much prefer it to shaving and waxing, so it&#x27;s the best option.</li>
            <li>So clean it.</li>
            <li>I ended up using tweezers to clean up at the end</li>
            <li>Wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m super happy with this product for turning my beastly legs into short worthy gams.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and love it!</li>
            <li>Also, I am pretty sure the fast speeds cause more hairs to break than are removed from the root.  </li>
            <li>but just so i really want to have an easy way to remove unwanted hairs as fast and effective</li>
            <li>have very fine hair on my face, and my main concern was that the Remington will not epilate them at all.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited, until I started using it.</li>
            <li>ok very keptical...</li>
            <li>From what I can tell from cleaning it, the epilator mostly pulls hair out from the root and it doesn&#x27;t really irritate the skin while doing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of loud, but is tolerable and you&#x27;ll get used to it over time.</li>
            <li>and if there&#x27;s any left over hair that wasn&#x27;t pulled out, then the good ol&#x27; tweezerman tweezers will finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is soooo much faster and gets all the hair, we love it-</li>
            <li>I definitely had to get a good exfoliating sponge to scrub my legs to ward off the ingrowns.</li>
            <li>but I took another reviewers advice and went in circle as fast as I could and made sure to stretch my skin.</li>
            <li>IT IS SO LOUD THAT HONESTLY</li>
            <li>These are nice when compared to others like Philips &amp; Braun which cost nearly $90-$100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I would also like to mention that you may want to make sure you really need the rechargable model.</li>
            <li>really tried to like this product, because who wouldn&#x27;t want to be able to go weeks without having to worry about shaving?</li>
            <li>This is one of the most gentle epilators I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I really like it to epilate my armpits way better than shaving.</li>
            <li>It works for the spots it will pull out but leaves a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good for your upper lip</li>
            <li>I must warn you though the process does hurt quite a bit but to me it&#x27;s worth it to have a smooth shave with no prickly feeling when my legs are touched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick, clean and painless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my tried and true razor.  </li>
            <li>the reviews were not as good as this product (such as a Braun epilator caused people to bleed.)</li>
            <li>If I really decide I love this device</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s not bad at ALL (unless you have the pain tolerance of a flea, I suppose)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and much better than the old puller I was using.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to not have to shave my legs every single day.</li>
            <li>However, this is a good product, and sure beats the mess and time consumption of waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li>Also, my other one had an &#x27;iced&#x27; attachment for cooling (which I have to admit was great for the sting</li>
            <li>The first use took much longer than I expected, so I had to plug in the device to finish the job - great that I didn&#x27;t have to wait hours for it to recharge!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and very fine hair on my legs that I can&#x27;t seem to pull out with the epilator.</li>
            <li>The only con would be that I had to go over the fine hairs more than once or just had to pluck them myself, which is fine since I did that</li>
            <li>so I had to find an alternative quickly over here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quick with it&#x27;s pulling and a heck of</li>
            <li>After using several more times, the degree of pain was reduced more so.</li>
            <li>As for this particular epilator, I love that it can be cordless.</li>
            <li>compre este producto para mi comodidad, y fue dinero perdido, es super doloroso, y no funciona como dicen...</li>
            <li>After waxing for years, I bought this epilator as a quick fix when I don&#x27;t have time to wax.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy to clean, practical with cordless property.</li>
            <li>Now I can quickly pluck my arms, legs, bikini line, and face.</li>
            <li>I have  been using similar products since my teen years, this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>I use a mild unscented lotion after I use it</li>
            <li>I like this one because of the curve of the unit naturally goes over curved areas smoothly and more effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in to work because I highly dislike when cords get in the way.</li>
            <li>If you use any sort of acne medication that forbids you from waxing your brows or upper lip (such as retin-a) DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE OFF THE TOP LAYER OF YOUR SKIN!!!</li>
            <li>even that first day my skin isn&#x27;t as smooth as it is with a razor.  </li>
            <li>so you wont be silky smooth at first</li>
            <li>But this was just my VERY FIRST time ever using an epilator anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if they as a product whole are just kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; or if it&#x27;s this particular brand.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use it..and its exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li>The light on the other epilator I own has a light.</li>
            <li>absolutely love my new Epilator</li>
            <li>It took some getting use to because you have to hold the epilater at the right angle so that the tweezers are working in full effect.</li>
            <li>now it works great, seems like the battery life is slightly diminished now</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>i recemend this as a good starting point for those just getting into an epilator for the first time.</li>
            <li>For a down payment of about $50, it&#x27;s a great investment because I RARELY buy razors or shaving cream anymore.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time on my underarms - youch!  </li>
            <li>And charge it for 16 hrs before using it the first time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie the first time I used it it hurt like a MOTHA-F*&amp;$#R!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, man did it HURT!</li>
            <li>The first time you use this, it&#x27;s a bit mean to you, but for maintenance, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Will update more after have used a few more times!</li>
            <li>When it does come back, I can remove it fairly quickly and much more comfortably.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous but this works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a GREAT little gadget.</li>
            <li>AND it grew back more fine than it was.  </li>
            <li>This fabulous little machine may not be able to give me a facelift, but it sure as tootin&#x27; lifted my spirits.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a few months now, and it works great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do a smooth, close shave, that I was hoping it will do.</li>
            <li>took a while but worth it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $50 on something that wasn&#x27;t worth the pain or the price.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say whether that would ease the pain, but thought it might be worth suggesting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been another trouble spot, so it&#x27;s nice to get such great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been another trouble spot, so it&#x27;s nice to get such great</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so worth the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Phillips epilator for 2 years now and liked it, although it hurt a bit, especially when doing the bikini area.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Remington epilator for years w/great success.</li>
            <li>It is a bit time-consuming, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The hairs were pretty long, so it was a good start to see if this worked.</li>
            <li>Or because my arms are more sensitive?</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite hair removal method.</li>
            <li>but for me its worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this item based on the reviews and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to chuck the razers completely.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a productive pain, and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>While trying every razor imaginable and having sensitive skin, I did more research and discovered \\&quot;Dr</li>
            <li>Not to mention these are more natural and cheaper alternatives to GiGi</li>
            <li>The facial attachment it brings is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>But please stick with it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the free facial epilator - I am able to use it rather close to my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week and rarely shave the days in between.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and read the directions and don&#x27;t press it into your skin but glide it on top; even so, my upper lip is very tender.  </li>
            <li>but results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product and how effective it would be at hair removal, but I found that it does a great job even on the tiniest hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It leaves you extra smooth even better than a wax..</li>
            <li>With waxing i could still see the hair underneath the skin but with this no hair is visible definetly worth it</li>
            <li>And it is a nice solid feeling device.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite thing besides having such smooth legs is that there are no &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Trimming long hair is definitely a good idea, as is doing this right after washing with hot water.</li>
            <li>It does not get every single hair, but it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>I use an old soft toothbrush and warm water to scrub mine then inspect it with the magnifier until it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing to read other reviews so that you know what to expect, or the pain would make you give up without finishing the job.  </li>
            <li>These areas have become almost completely desensitized to the initial pain I experienced when I first started using the epilator, and</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s really cute!  </li>
            <li>It works best if you do a small area at a time and just keep going over that area until it is smooth, then move on to the next area.  </li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m doing everything in sessions and for the parts that I&#x27;ve already done, I can already feel the smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you know you&#x27;re holding it right</li>
            <li>Used this right out of the box and managed to do one leg before the battery died.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe he is right.</li>
            <li>But that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem right?  </li>
            <li>no matter how you rip hairs out from the root it&#x27;s going to hurt, right?  </li>
            <li>I usually do it right</li>
            <li>It takes just the right amount of pressure to move it to the first/slowest speed.</li>
            <li>and i was right.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>and my face is still pretty much hair free.  </li>
            <li>This motor is much stronger than my old model and works much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>They tend to catch and don&#x27;t leave the totally smooth surface the older model did.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I love that my legs stay smooth for so long.</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend 30 dollars more to get an emjoi (the best if you have coarse, hard to remove hair), go for the 72 tweezer one</li>
            <li>In the end I didn&#x27;t really want any special attachments or a wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very large...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very handy when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving every single day, my legs are already smooth from using it the day prior!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make this fast and sweet....  </li>
            <li>Emjoi works great for my underarms and bikini but was small</li>
            <li>It takes more time to use the epilator, but you don&#x27;t have to use it very often and it leaves your skin much smoother than a razor for a much longer time.  </li>
            <li>My fabulous husband bought me this wonderful magnifying glass with a light in it from Ultra Optix, it shows up a lot of ugly including fabric fibers, skin, hair.</li>
            <li>Charging cord is nice and long if you need to use it corded.</li>
            <li>Right after use your pores are very red (but don&#x27;t hurt), but that disappears in hours/overnight to become very smooth.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT TIP FOR NEW MANSCAPERS:</li>
            <li>(When the red light comes on you have to turn it off until the light goes</li>
            <li>, however you&#x27;re looking for a powerful, thorough epilator, skip the Remington EP6025 because it doesn&#x27;t deliver the most efficient hair removal, even on the second faster speed setting.</li>
            <li>This is a great medium priced epilator, especially with the included facial attachment.</li>
            <li>My hair growth is super fast compared to my sisters.</li>
            <li>While it still hurts, it does hurt less than the other and it has a curve which makes it more effective for more places.  </li>
            <li>I am getting more ingrown hairs than I did from shaving, but they aren&#x27;t too bad or too many, and I expect that will fade somewhat as I get more skilled at using the thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to waxing or shaving, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like waxing.</li>
            <li>My legs are still very smooth a week after the 2nd use.  </li>
            <li>Not very painful the 1st time though it had been months since I&#x27;d been able to use the former one.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get a new epilator.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and hair does not come back as quickly - as after using chemical hair removal products, which always used to make me break out.</li>
            <li>con is that it leaves the area more raw looking, more bumpy, and more prone to blemishes than regular shaving (and that&#x27;s every area where you&#x27;d like to use this).</li>
            <li>But with the epilator, they stay decently hair free and with touch-ups maybe 1-2 times a week at this point, the hairs grow back very sparse and mostly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>more ingrown hairs, leaves red bumps afterwards, HURTS the first couple of times</li>
            <li>Just get through that first session with your epilator...</li>
            <li>by the second session you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used shave or wax my legs and underarms, but thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an epilator.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the smaller head for the underarms after the first pass, and that worked better for the curves under there.      </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>and I chose to try a cheaper model first, to see how I like epilation.  </li>
            <li>that will more than likely give smoother results.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that Remington still makes a product similar to mine.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>First, shipping, was told it would take 5 days to get it</li>
            <li>all i can say is that if you have patience, and are willing to go slow, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good on the upper lip, has some trouble with the cruviness in that area, does snag on skin a bit, but otherwise I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It hurts even more and left the skin of my legs bruised!</li>
            <li>It is not painful to use on light facial hair (fuzz), but I haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs yet.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on my face and legs.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, but</li>
            <li>Epilate first</li>
            <li>My only concern is that eventually the unit won&#x27;t be able to hold a charge and may ALWAYS need to be plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only happened to me 2-3 times out of the MANY times</li>
            <li>Obviously, I would charge it more often if I was doing my bikini</li>
            <li>Also love that it has a smaller head for hard-to-reach places.    </li>
            <li>or so it quits and the red light comes on, even after a full charge.</li>
            <li>My first epilator</li>
            <li>It got all the hair off my legs and most of it off my chest &amp; back.</li>
            <li>I have searched for another cord to purchase and was told by a Remington rep on their 800 number that the cord is only available to be purchased with the epilator!</li>
            <li>It does help with the facial hair for sure.</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs first.</li>
            <li>I tried holding it in many different angles.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>So, this was my first epilator, and I read almost all of the reviews trying to decide if it was for me or not.</li>
            <li>I was really interested in getting an epilator.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>(I even tried to use a numbing cream first).</li>
            <li>I did so many review on the Remington EP6025 Womans Recharegeable Epilator  with Bonus Facial Epilator ..........................</li>
            <li>Well this is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It hurt the first time I used it and caused ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I love this and would definitely recommend others to buy it.</li>
            <li>The epilator removed 90% of the hair the first use.</li>
            <li>I have found that you get more bang for your buck if you wait through several hair growth cycles</li>
            <li>I have found that you get more bang for your buck if you wait through several hair growth cycles</li>
            <li>What exactly is this?</li>
            <li>toys is my first ever epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>Just one word to anyone looking to buy their first epilator: it hurts like heck the first time you use it</li>
            <li>I use my epilator sitting on the sofa reading a book; using it in the shower would use up all 80 gallons of hot water, plus</li>
            <li>The Remington I had been using for probably more than 20 years finally died.  </li>
            <li>and yes it hurts the first time, but</li>
            <li>No, it does not get all the hair in the first pass, but it does get the hair when used according to the directions.  </li>
            <li>It is reliable and not expensive.  </li>
            <li>This was the first epilator I have used.  </li>
            <li>Curvy places are harder to effectively do.</li>
            <li>Hair regrowth in the beginning was about two to three days later which for me is better than shaving.</li>
            <li>I broke out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It took me about an hour the first time I used it on my face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it to not have to shave so much.</li>
            <li>An absolute must have product!</li>
            <li>And using this i didn&#x27;t see it for many weeks later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper too!</li>
            <li>a proof I used it today for the first time</li>
            <li>did get two pretty gnarly in grown hairs.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just my experience, and I&#x27;m left to wonder if it would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li>This is my first epliator to try.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a product like this.</li>
            <li>For some reason, after several months of use, I don&#x27;t need to do that any more.</li>
            <li>It was my first epilator</li>
            <li>The first time I did it, it hurt like hell</li>
            <li>that one I paid more for prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is ouchy at first</li>
            <li>First of all, legitimate product that comes as described, well made and durable.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used an epilator.  </li>
            <li>used this product on my face first, mustache area and chin as well as cheeks and jawline, which took about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was nervous about the pain factor because everyone says that it hurts the first time you use it, but as soon as I started using it</li>
            <li>It hurt the first time I used it because I let my leg hair grow out while waiting for this to arrive</li>
            <li>It just removes the top layer like a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I still have hair stubble, even more than I did when using regular razor.</li>
            <li>This was my first buy after lot of search</li>
            <li>This product has worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>I hope that it&#x27;s just because it is my first time using it</li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s gone the first time, this thing makes maintenance a dream.  </li>
            <li>Better than a regular razor though.  </li>
            <li>and that is exactly what this Epilator does...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty scared to attempt it after I sleep for the night.</li>
            <li>Maybe later tomorrow I&#x27;ll have more guts or pain threshold or something</li>
            <li>/&gt;After looking at reviews for several of the top epilators on Amazon, I decided to give this Remington a try.  </li>
            <li>Being a first timer in the world of epilating, i have the fear of the pain, because of some reviews that i have read..</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator..</li>
            <li>If I would have used the larger piece on my armpits it would have hurt much more.</li>
            <li>When I looked online most epilators in this price range did not have the extra attachment unlessyou wanted to pay twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing first...</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In order to get maximum hair removal out of this machine always face the front of the machine (the face where the on/off switch is located)upwards so you can see the pretty flowers.  </li>
            <li>this helps for first timers or for those who feel that this machine does not work as well as it should.</li>
            <li>: Was pretty tolerable for me.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with epilating</li>
            <li>It works  good to begin with after few use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty quick too than tweezing individual hairs in which you have a huge patch of.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty much fast and super fast.  </li>
            <li>, it leaves the skin super smooth and he hair grows back thinner</li>
            <li>Though it never quite thrilled me, I stuck with it due to the sunk cost of $130.  </li>
            <li>I would like to say that I&#x27;m new to epilation and that might be why I&#x27;m not giving a super review.</li>
            <li>It works the best at removing hair with the least amount of times going over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell how many ingrown hairs I get, I did find some on the back of my calf.</li>
            <li>It seems to not be growing back as fast, so I love that.  </li>
            <li>There are enough tweezers to do a good job without several passes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, I would like to reiterate what so many other reviewers have said: The first time you use it, it HURTS!  </li>
            <li>But best of all is no more dry, itchy legs.</li>
            <li>I chose this one based on the positive reviews and because it comes with two heads, one for the face and one for the legs and underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This actually turned out to be a great choice - it has all I need: A detachable top and little brush so you can clean the thing properly, a fast speed (I never use the slow), and easy charging with no need for batteries -</li>
            <li>Doing my bikini area was strange and the head rotated against the direction in which the hair grew, yet most of the hairs it pulled out came out with its roots.</li>
            <li>i wont lie it really hurt the first time</li>
            <li>when I get out of the shower and keep a towel hot to use after some time has passed, it really relaxes/loosens your skin.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed at first.</li>
            <li>It is the best hair removal device I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts less and less every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to moisturize your skin afterwards as well to prevent chaffing and dry skin</li>
            <li>I took ibuprofen to be safe the first time I used it, but the discomfort was minimal.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate and scrub always in the shower than make sure your dry before epilating.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that using it in circular movements as described in the booklet actually makes it more efficient - surprising since my other one has the same top/mechanism but didnt need all that.</li>
            <li>I like the fairly large surface area</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want a large quantity of hair there.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The benefits certainly out way any discomfort.  </li>
            <li>There is no mess and the pain is bare able.</li>
            <li>I was told that witch hazel would help, but it seemed only to irritate my skin more (but I do have very sensitive</li>
            <li>If you can survive the initial epilation, you should be fine moving forward.  </li>
            <li>After repeated sessions, your hair grows back so fine..</li>
            <li>She has tried many different epilators but her favorite with less pain was the Remington EP6025.</li>
            <li>I normally have the type of hair that is a pain to shave because after a clean shave, all it takes is one little goose bump and all the hair magically reappears.</li>
            <li>I am guy who was cursed to have a large amount of body hair, so much that if I don&#x27;t manscape</li>
            <li>I decided to try this epilator out since the price was reasonable and you get 2 heads (large one for the body and a mini one for the face).  </li>
            <li>I did a little research and read reviews and went with this one to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>a warm shower does seem to help the hair come out a little easier, but it works even if your legs are &amp;</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, I actually feel &#x27;clean&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>have a pretty high threshold for pain, and I can&#x27;t even stand to use this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little noisy but who cares with such great results.</li>
            <li>I was quickly able to speed it up, but noticed that if my hair was longer than a 1/4 inch, it either hurt a little more, or simply broke at the surface of the skin.)</li>
            <li>As a caveat to this review, I should add that I have waxed my legs several times and that seems to make a huge difference in how people respond to epilators.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy, and not so light that it feels cheap and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When charging it the red light will never go out signaling it&#x27;s fully charged, which I think is really a con of this device.</li>
            <li>If I remember correctly, my Braun® Silk Epile had removed all the hair back in the day :D. If you are blond, then your legs will look hair free, but when you touch them you feel all kinds of stubble&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to wax but recently moved to Korea and for some reason the waxing available here burns my skin for days.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;m about to charge it the second time and now the indicator light for charging is not working anymore.</li>
            <li>Once you are adjusted to the pain and suck it up, it works very well, although it doesn&#x27;t get every hair after repeated passes.   </li>
            <li>Doing my legs took much longer than the unit can hold a charge (about 20ish minutes)</li>
            <li>My legs are still smooth 4 days later.</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t know how a product will perform unless you test it out.</li>
            <li>So zero regrets on this buy:)</li>
            <li>the indicator light is still red.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.</li>
            <li>Taking the head off and cleaning the foam out seems to help, but my thumb hurts from turning it on and off so much.</li>
            <li>This product only removes really light hairs.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to hold up really well</li>
            <li>The depilatory creams were smelly, didn&#x27;t work well, and I was very concerned about the health of my skin</li>
            <li>but after awhile it just didn&#x27;t hurt so much anymore</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Im very content with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really suggest you to by these this will help you with your side burns and all that hair that you have around your face</li>
            <li>size of this whole product is convenient  to put into your pocket.</li>
            <li>Compared to my legs where I just shrugged it off, doing it on my arms made me really cry out.</li>
            <li>Because after I was done and feeling my face, it felt really really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The indicator light is red and never changes.</li>
            <li>I FOUND THE NOISE INTENSE..</li>
            <li>however it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever REALLY give me the smoothness I seek.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important to exfoliate before using it, and continue to exfoliate when the hair starts growing back.</li>
            <li>This thing works really well on coarser hair (for me, that means under arms and bikini line).</li>
            <li>This is something I really appreciate because I&#x27;m prone to nicking myself with electric shavers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Once I used it though, I found that it does not work very well on the underarms.</li>
            <li>of course it hurt a bit because it is plucking hairs, but if it saves me so much on razors and shaving cream</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I think it must be my nationality and having very well rooted hair.</li>
            <li>Smooth legs at last!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s pain free (no epilator is), but it&#x27;s relatively harmless.</li>
            <li>Epilating is my preferred method of hair removal, the results are really worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am very fair.&lt;br /&gt;9.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I was really upset.</li>
            <li>Then I used it with the button side facing up (which someone had really warned against doing), but this method worked REALLY well for me.</li>
            <li>and btw it really really hurts!!(did</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator..</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast.</li>
            <li>and they had now really thickened up.  </li>
            <li>Being cordless is a real benefit too.  </li>
            <li>I have found that using Witch Hazel then some Aloe when I&#x27;m finished helps to calm my skin and reduce redness that naturally occurs when hair is removed at the root.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks Remington for making a womans product that does a mans job.lol.</li>
            <li>how important something like this is to a woman in her later years.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s a suggestion based on my personal experience: Ever so lightly touch the machine to the area</li>
            <li>I just would briefly and lightly touch the machine to my lip and pull it away when it hurt.  </li>
            <li>I just would briefly and lightly touch the machine to my lip and pull it away when it hurt.  </li>
            <li>really hurts like  </li>
            <li>For the price I got it, I really don&#x27;t have anything to complain about.</li>
            <li>No rashes or breakouts, no stubble, and smooth facial skin!  </li>
            <li>so I am extra smooth.</li>
            <li>Yes my legs were smooth for 2 weeks, but once the hairs grew back...</li>
            <li>It hurts, but not as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It left my legs incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Remington Epilator!</li>
            <li>It shows up what you don&#x27;t want to know but really need to know.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THE MAKER BECAUSE IT HAD A WARNING ON THE BOX</li>
            <li>went straight up to the faster speed since the button slide mechanism is too lax.</li>
            <li>But maintaining is so much easier.</li>
            <li>well and fast in corded mode</li>
            <li>This would hurt so much</li>
            <li>very satified.</li>
            <li>ready for use.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my vanity and it is ready to use at any time.</li>
            <li>decided on this Remington model for it&#x27;s size, reasonable price and the fact that it was corded (but could also be used cordless).</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I used it on my vagina too for a brazillian effect and it also works really well.</li>
            <li>Fast forward 3 months...</li>
            <li>It it nice that it has a different sized head as an extra.</li>
            <li>about the facial epilator, I&#x27;ve used it only once and honestly didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Not painful, more like small pricks on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The most sensitive area was my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>The most sensitive area was my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Epilating in general kind of sucks, but if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t want to shave every day, and don&#x27;t want to continuously throw money and resources down the drain with disposable products, it&#x27;s worth it, and this is a great choice for it.</li>
            <li>After several hours of reading reviews, changing my technique, and downing many glasses of wine to endure the pain, here is the routine i follow now: Exfoliate with shower mittens (and i mean a good good scrubbing), well dried off and NO lotion (not even numbing cream, tried it, no bueno), starting at my ankles</li>
            <li>On the positive, this is a very easy to use device, especially if you remember to keep the skin taught, and the results LAST...</li>
            <li>so my Daughter can have the old one because every time I need to use it, it&#x27;s not in my bathroom;  but $300!!!</li>
            <li>Since I only need to use every week or so and the sting lasts for seconds, it is very worth it.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that the battery dies pretty quick.</li>
            <li>other thing I noticed is that the extremely super fine peach fuzz that should be on the face is still there, but is normal and not noticeable at all.  </li>

            <li>The electrical cord is crimped and must be in just the right position to complete the electrical connection.  </li>
            <li>I tried it first on my arms since I knew that the skin there wasn&#x27;t very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>In the summer months I normally have to shave morning and night!</li>
            <li>Received this product in a white box, not the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is painless and more efficient per stroke than other epilators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I dreaded what other people with better vision may have thought.  </li>
            <li>This is such an upgrade from the original epilators from years ago.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s true that you have to go through the same area several times to get all the hairs out and for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I think that it works slightly better than the other brand I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I got this product for mainly my legs and underarms, but hoped it would be good enough for other areas.</li>
            <li>However, after using this epilator for the first time I have to admit it is well worth it for such a break in the shaving cycle.</li>
            <li>works fast- had an older model(won&#x27;t mention brand) for almost 9 years now-</li>
            <li>So my mom had an old school epilator that was pretty much a torture device for punishment</li>
            <li>I have a decent tolerance for pain, and I&#x27;ve found that if you do the whole area in one shot, you get used to it once you get going</li>
            <li>Because individual hairs grow at different rates, don&#x27;t expect to use this and get silky smooth skin the very first time.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely 5 stars, but what I wanted to learn about most when I looked into this was epilating in general, so that&#x27;s mainly what I&#x27;ll write about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it once and didn&#x27;t get to a second pass on my right leg when I almost passed out from the pain!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves the skinny silky smooth (as long as you exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate)</li>
            <li>, if you are thinking about getting an epilator, I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I would recommend this one, unless you want to spend a lot more money on a more expensive one.  </li>

            <li>After a while you honestly get used to the small amount of pain it delivers.</li>
            <li>And about 2 hours, yes literally TWO full hours, later it seemed like I&#x27;d gotten all those hairs.</li>
            <li>really, the only thing you can do is use this before you head to bed on a day where you aren&#x27;t going to see many people the next day or have the areas exposed where you used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am almost 40 years old and I have always been interested in using an epilator to rid myself of all this unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Using it while it&#x27;s still plugged in ensures full power the entire time I use it.</li>
            <li>it is not useful, why do I need to pay more for it?</li>
            <li>Full legs took me about 45 mins and sometimes would shave in the morning to get those tiny ones i missed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to put up with the pain for the first few times you use it, this product is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>At first my skin seemed fine, but the next day I had a ton of white heads.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the more I do it though, the less time it will take.  </li>
            <li>but less the more you do it.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one would offer much better results than this.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one would offer much better results than this.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if more expensive ones are better</li>
            <li>but this one is decent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it on my legs was super simple.</li>
            <li>that my older model of the Epilady.</li>
            <li>Decent price for an epilator as well.</li>
            <li>thus our follicles are more likely to become infected without proper care.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I loved this because not only does it pull the hair, but I think it pulls off dead skin too.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for my underarms...</li>
            <li>I have tried wax strips, and nair, but this is quick and relatively painless.</li>
            <li>I have found that the pain for me has gotten better on both my second and third epilation.</li>
            <li>I bought the epilator mainly for my face.</li>
            <li>It might work better for thicker hairs in your underarms and...other parts, but I can only imagine the agony of having a dozen hairs ripped out per second in those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find my hairs grow back as quickly as they do with the Emojoi one.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a smaller interchangeable head for smaller areas and more accuracy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: 5 stars, mainly because it met my expectations</li>
            <li>I hesitated whether i should again get a phillips or a braun, as we think more expensive is better.</li>
            <li>It only shaves the top layer of hair and the next day, you have to use it again.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about the epilator is it leaves smooth skin behind and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but I found this product to be just ok.</li>
            <li>I mainly got it for my face and chin.</li>
            <li>I have it, like it, but I have a fancier, more expensive one on my wish list now. :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this especially for the facial attachment and just love it.  </li>
            <li>I do not move on from one particular area until i can no longer feel any pulling.</li>
            <li>Battery life last my entire epilation process.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; to me is honestly more like a tickle, but I have an incredibly high pain tolerance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nad&#x27;s gave me the best, longest lasting results but it was such a mess, took about around an hour every time and my legs would be bumpy and red for a day or so after.  </li>
            <li>I can now go high speed and have mustache and those lovely chin hairs done in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I used it plugged in, as the first charge is 16 hours and my legs were totally smooth and only three weeks later</li>
            <li>I guess I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>The epilator itself looks like a high quality item, comes with protective caps, a brush, and everything.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I wonder how these high dollar ones will preform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I know the directions say use a few times to get used to it, but I totally cannot do my top lip, super sore.</li>
            <li>It does take a little more time, but I can have smoother legs &amp; face every week instead of once a month.  </li>
            <li>Except the back of my knees is a teeny bit sensitve, but NOTHING like at first!</li>
            <li>THAT REALLY HURTS, but if you hold your skin down taut you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I did not know that there is such a large variety available and that there is now a specific name for them--epilators.  </li>
            <li>far as the two speeds on this unit, I absolutely prefer the high speed for all areas of my body, it just seems to minimize discomfort and making the process quicker.</li>
            <li>far as the two speeds on this unit, I absolutely prefer the high speed for all areas of my body, it just seems to minimize discomfort and making the process quicker.</li>
            <li>The hair grows back thin and fine at first, so if you stay on top of it</li>
            <li>Save resources, save money, and I have sensitive skin that got really irritated</li>
            <li>Pat it dry with a clean towel, don&#x27;t rub it, you just got the fibers out.</li>
            <li>Wow, I can&#x27;t believe this really worked.</li>
            <li>I would definitely advise that if you can stick with it, it will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Remington EP6025 for a few months now, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My best advice would be to stick to small areas, moving in a circular direction to slowly clear out small areas and gradually increase the tweeze</li>
            <li>I find it difficult to hold the skin taunt enough to the point that it would be most effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I think waxing is more effective in terms of cleaner hair removal than using an epilator; however, waxing is more costly in the long run and if you&#x27;re on a budget then an epilator is the way to go if you really hate shaving, so the epilator is what I will stick with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a normal reaction.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a distinct difference in the thickness and coarseness in the individual hairs</li>
            <li>I had issues with a cheaper Remington epilator breaking after a few uses, this one is more durable.  </li>
            <li>but you do have to go over the area a few times to get most of the hair.</li>
            <li>I love this thing because the results last so long, but you *will* end up with ingrown hairs if you don&#x27;t do something to prevent them..</li>
            <li>i was surprised, considering the low cost of this item, was sure it probably wouldnt work (and have never used one before), but just the opposite!</li>
            <li>I only attempted using the slower speed (which is still pretty darn fast)...</li>
            <li>Just press the big white button near the top of the device and the head pops off.</li>
            <li>so i stick to the normal one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was a little rough, not knowing what to expect, it feels a little like waxing, but after the first initial treatment is over and done, each time I use it, it is faster, easier, and what an awesome result you get, I have found I use mine, then shower and use my lotions</li>
            <li>Hopefully the more I use it the less it comes in!</li>
            <li>My old Emjoi Spilator had less tweezers and went through many batteries.</li>
            <li>this helps!hose dark roots right under the surface of my skin, even right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice when the epilator is quiet enough to have the TV or radio on, but this product is simply too loud to do anything else while epilating.</li>
            <li>I do wish that red light would go off or change to green or something to signal a full charge.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m looking for a new one</li>
            <li>I trust the name and decided to try the new version.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to epilation and am trying to get the hang of using this.</li>
            <li>Hoping that technology had evolved and eased my pain, now that my epilator died I searched for a new brand.</li>
            <li>I live in France and have a Calor Epillator.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used home-wax strips on a couple of occasions, but was relatively new to ripping hair out of my body.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wanted to live this product.</li>
            <li>This was a product described as new</li>
            <li>Everything was brand new in the package.</li>
            <li>I am new to epilators.  </li>
            <li>I am new to epilating, I heard about it through friends at work.</li>
            <li>those of you new to epilators...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to epilators--I just discovered them about 2 months ago when I bought the Emjoi Dolphin Wet/Dry Epilator Model-AP 17DB.  </li>
            <li>I have average to fine leg hair.   </li>
            <li>In fact, it worked well in this fashion for my underarm area as well (with the different, bigger head), making both my under arms smooth within a span of 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bonus facial epilator that came with this really wasn&#x27;t that much of a help.</li>
            <li>one swipe probably gets rid of like a sixth of the hair and it hurts so much that you really dont wanna go in for a second swipe</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend giving this epilator a try, and, if you happen to not like it, you really aren&#x27;t out as much as you would be by purchasing a Braun or Emjoi.</li>
            <li>the hair growth itself is much sparser and seems to grow more slowly.</li>
            <li>It is very loud when in use.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried my bikini line yet, but I&#x27;m also very sensitive to pain.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really blame the product/manufacturer since I really probably shouldn&#x27;t have used it on such fine, sensitive hairs, but it is what it is, so be careful where you use this thing!!</li>
            <li>I narrowed it down to a couple based on my price range and chose this one because it had high reviews, a smaller attachment and more tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t waxed or epilated recently, it will hurt, and it may not get all the hairs at first...</li>
            <li>But ~ so much better than Nair for face, which burns my skin unbelievably.      </li>
            <li>I recommend this if you are willing to take the initial pain because like my mother always says, \\&quot;Beauty ain&#x27;t painless!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I did one leg as a test when I first got this, 4 days later I was still smoother than 8 hours after shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first go-round on my legs took a combined total of about 4 hours (I was watching TV/movies so it probably could have been done faster).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work that well, and the noise is really loud!</li>
            <li>No problem of in growth - didn&#x27;t see any in growth on first or on subsequent use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also want to note that yes, this unit is loud!</li>
            <li>I also want to note that yes, this unit is loud!</li>
            <li>read all the reviews here and some on other sites and will confirm from my experiences in owning the product about a month or more the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to get hairs that are pretty short too..</li>
            <li>After your first use you will have the second stage of hair come though..</li>
            <li>The Remington EP6025 has double time tweezers and a charger which saves me so much money instead of batteries!</li>
            <li>Even my young daughters are using it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it has truly lived up to the ratings.  </li>
            <li>I even waited three days for the hairs to get longer and the small epilator head still didn&#x27;t pick them up, for the most part.</li>
            <li>I did try it out on my legs and it was about ten times more painful than in the bikini area, which was surprising.</li>
            <li>First and foremost this machine is actually multiple TWEEZERS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to do it.</li>
            <li>The user guide says to charge it a minimum of 16 hours prior to first cordless use.</li>
            <li>I still have my old Remington from 10 years ago!</li>
            <li>I have light skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, there are several tips for first timers that would make using this a lot easier and prevent some mishaps along</li>
            <li>It hurts at first, but once you get through the initial session, maintenance is no problem.</li>
            <li>I read in a fashion magazine&#x27;s blog (can&#x27;t remember which one) that this particular one was given very high ratings, especially for use on the bikini area!  </li>
            <li>(I mean everywhere!), completely pain free after the first time and very practical (the cordless feature is amazing for the hard to reach spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I throw everything in the strong little sack</li>
            <li>After doing a little research online, I have a good routine down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, very easy to hold, has two removable and washable heads (long for legs, short for sensitive areas such as armpits and face), can be used with or without the cord, has two speeds, is not super loud (to me</li>
            <li>And after half an hour trying to get one arm smooth and hair-free</li>
            <li>a slight pinch or pain enjoy</li>
            <li>My legs were soft for almost 2 weeks and even after the first time, the hair grew back thinner and lighter!</li>
            <li>I am also pregnant now so my hair grows faster and shaving has gotten even harder.</li>
            <li>66 years old and way past menopause, the &#x27;cute&#x27; ever-so-tiny peach fuzz on my face that had never bothered me before began to proliferate and lengthen.  </li>
            <li>And, I feel that the results are well worth the trouble of that first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, I feel that the results are well worth the trouble of that first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did the job - quickly, thoroughly and with minimal ingrown hairs (provided I kept up with ex-foliating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The battery is not as strong as using the epilator while plugged in, but is usable in a few instances.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette and while my arm hair etc is pretty light and fine, years of shaving has made my leg hair very dark and course and thick comparatively.</li>
            <li>it gets every single hair and its so worth it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty weak strength wise, sounds like it&#x27;s dying compared to other epilators.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth it.in a few months, I will have to touch up even less and have better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt fine after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>If I had let my chest and back hair grow a little more from shaving</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs, face ( love the little facial attachment), and underarms.  </li>
            <li>It hurts quite a bit with the first use, but after the first time it&#x27;s just like a little sting.</li>
            <li>Certain areas on my body are naturally very prone to ingrown hairs, even if I waxed or shaved (back of thieghs, outside of calfs, and bikini area).  </li>
            <li>and so far it has held up after two years.</li>
            <li>Hairs don&#x27;t get caught into a storage bin, it just falls out onto whatever you&#x27;re standing on or are near of so you may have to have something to prevent it from getting everywhere, or</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product since I have read that it takes some time to see complete results.</li>
            <li>Battery life is probably an hr or so, but the cord is pretty long...</li>
            <li>Planned to completely switch over to just this instead of razors</li>
            <li>While it does, indeed, feel like a torture device (I highly recommend the numbing cream!), it also eliminates my need to shave daily to avoid stubble.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can work on hair in short bursts, as my pain tolerance varies.</li>
            <li>It sounded just as loud as the Philips Satinelle</li>
            <li>It just took a long time to get it all out the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they came back fast and stubbly.  </li>
            <li>just like you would if you went to wax professionally.</li>
            <li>also have skin that is prone to ingrown hairs and is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li>so I can use it for my upper lip ever since I started using my hair does not grow as fast.</li>
            <li>my 13 yr old started to use it and it died-</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WAS WAY TOO LOUD.  </li>
            <li>IF IN FACT THAT&#x27;S HOW LOUD</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t be smooth everyday if I tried.</li>
            <li>Like plucking eyebrows, you get used to the feeling and it stops hurting completely.</li>
            <li>It stings a lil when it&#x27;s in action</li>
            <li>So I returned it and bought emjoi soft caress.</li>
            <li>A bit loud and of course it hurts a bit, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to even with shorter hair than it says you need.</li>
            <li>I have never tried professional waxing and have horror stories from home waxing.</li>
            <li>I gave it a three only because it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it didn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money .</li>
            <li>This thing is so loud</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soft, even shiney.</li>
            <li>I think that these nearly microscopic hairs help keep a gal&#x27;s makeup in place, LOL.re epilating.  </li>
            <li>I finally fixed that problem by getting a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely an investment of time and energy to do this (to do whole bikini area and legs after 4+ weeks, about an hour.</li>
            <li>nearly ALL OF THEM were ingrown...</li>
            <li>The smaller head for the face works really well because of the curves of the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much the 2nd time.  </li>
            <li>Im not going to lie its loud and intimidating</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s old news</li>
            <li>So far I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I would spend nearly $75 just for the summer.</li>
            <li>So, my twelve year old daughter just started to shave</li>
            <li>Use the epilator directly head on towards the direction of the hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Every time I do epilate, though, the hair seems to grow in much thinner with smaller roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a long time to remove all of my hair the first time because it was painful with so much hair, but now it&#x27;s really not bad to do a weekly touch up and have pretty smooth legs, pits, bikini area all the time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I spent on it</li>
            <li>The good thing is, it doesn&#x27;t get any worse for several days to one week.  </li>
            <li>The hair does grow more slowly.  </li>
            <li>Though the hair removal doesn&#x27;t last as long as they say, and doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the hair quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not nearly as painful and takes far less time.</li>
            <li>I wanted a rechargeable device that could do the face and the only products I saw that were available for the face-only were battery operated or if it did do face as well as other body areas</li>
            <li>I was a little scared to try this at first, because who wants a bunch of rotating metal and rubber pieces on their delicates, but my fear was for nothing.</li>
            <li>I expected the charge not last too long but thought maybe more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it all the way up my leg due to sensitivity, but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>and I will admit, the first time I used this on my legs, it was slightly uncomfortable, but not nearly as bad as waxing or an unsightly razor nick, however the first time I used it on my underarms, tears came to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>although I love this product, I am only giving it four stars because it does not pick up my hair when I hold it properly (the button side down)</li>
            <li>but this one is must better and hurts much less the first time after using it the pain in very little</li>
            <li>If you can get through the initial pain of the first 1-2 sessions, then I promise you&#x27;ll never go back to razors.  </li>
            <li>the plastic is worn and there is HAIR on both the main piece and the facial extension.  </li>
            <li>but after that first initial shock, you&#x27;ll never go back to your razor!</li>
            <li>I got this mainly for facial hair.</li>
            <li>She is older and do not  believe in waxing only twee zing .</li>
            <li>It was very hard to get that first epilation done, but I told myself it would be worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always prided myself on having a high tolerance for pain, and this device regularly tested my limits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it twice on my legs, and there is definitely less hair growing back in, and my legs are smooth for longer than between shaves.  </li>
            <li>I began by using the lower speed on my legs, found that I was perfectly okay with the sensation of ripping the hair out by the roots (kind of a tingling, burning sensation at times, and almost feels like tiny shocks, especially behind the knees.)</li>
            <li>The epilator worked great on my upper lip, however I am very used to waxing so not too painful.</li>
            <li>There was some bleeding in the bikini area which took me a long time to get the nerve to do, but not worse than waxing.</li>
            <li>It depends on how long the hair follicle is as to how much it hurts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting red bumps after use is normal afterall hairs were pulled off and at the root.</li>
            <li>I was tired of razor burns and needing to shave pretty much every day since the hair grows so fast!</li>
            <li>It also takes care of that embarrassing facial hair that I would normally pay a salon to wax.</li>
            <li>But I still expected that I would be cringing with pain the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>I spent $55 on it the first time.</li>
            <li>It did not hurt my legs and actually felt good, but on my face, that&#x27;s a different story altogether - it HURT my poor</li>
            <li>One must press the centermost button and THEN drag it up firmly to the first speed setting for fine hair pulling or the highest speed setting above that for coarser hair pulling.</li>
            <li>After, I might be a little spotty, but it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li>Certain areas, like armpits and the back of my knees cause me enough pain to force me to stop.</li>
            <li>I think the only place on my legs that pinched was right around my ankles, but it&#x27;s such a tiny and fleeting pinch that I didn&#x27;t even mind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty convenient and quick... at least for the non-sensitive areas!  </li>
            <li>Unless this thing has a new feature I am unaware of, you can probably find it cheaper else</li>
            <li>Buy it in Target or a physical store where you could see for yourself if the product appears new.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to buy a new epilator</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY if you are new to epilating.</li>
            <li>Because of my bathroom setup and the fact that I&#x27;m not flexible enough to stand with one leg propped up on the counter, I need a new chargeable one.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I turn it back on, the light goes green but the motor hesitates a bit.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, you have to use the facial attachment for just about everything because the larger attachment doesn&#x27;t do contours very well.</li>
            <li>but with still a few hairs left on my upper lip removes it quick and fast with</li>
            <li>Did not do much on the area above my upper lip.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, 30 min max!), but I&#x27;ve found every two weeks is enough to keep hair totally removed (real smoothness lasts about a week).</li>
            <li>Well i don&#x27;t know if i didn&#x27;t research these kind of products properly, BUT, I as tired of the waxing</li>
            <li>The battery didn&#x27;t last long enough the first time I used it (TOO HAIRY!)</li>
            <li>I only use it twice a month now and that&#x27;s all I need to do to keep my legs soft!</li>
            <li>The hair that was pulled out was pretty painless compared to other models.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly</li>
            <li>The power seems to be reduced slightly when I&#x27;m not using it on the cord, but it&#x27;s still going fast enough to really get my hair out.</li>
            <li>it came to the more sensitive areas, there was some discomfort but not unbearable pain as with other epilators in the past.</li>
            <li>It hurts less and less the more you use it.</li>
            <li>Little less pain than the other brands, and that&#x27;s why I know isn&#x27;t do good job.</li>
            <li>but if you go over a certain area in small circles you can usually get MOST of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced more ingrown hairs on my legs, but always just under the surface, never the crazy, inflamed scary ones you hear about...</li>
            <li>I have experienced more ingrown hairs on my legs, but always just under the surface, never the crazy, inflamed scary ones you hear about...</li>
            <li>but I would not recommend epilators in general.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t especially loud and the battery lasts long enough to use on both legs without having to wait to recharge.</li>
            <li>I had a small cheap one (different brand to try it out)</li>
            <li>It barely hurt at all</li>
            <li>I saw that it barely took any of the hair out.  </li>
            <li>The mini-pinching is just the hair being pulled out from the root and the miniscule pain is very fleeting and is to be expected.</li>
            <li>already I&#x27;ve noticed some things have happened if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much \\&quot;loose\\&quot; skin you have, it&#x27;s gonna pinch the skin and the epilator head will stop spinning like its jammed.</li>
            <li>Basically, follow the same procedures if you were going to get a professional wax done.</li>
            <li>It comes partially charged, but you really should charge it up before using it.</li>
            <li>I was paying $60 for just my back, shoulders, and chest to be professionally waxed.</li>
            <li>Have not required using it frequently because it takes a while for the hair grow back.</li>
            <li>so these can&#x27;t be used internationally, just in case if you are a frequent traveler..</li>
            <li>I barely feel this on my legs.</li>
            <li>I use it on my arms and also barely feel anything.</li>
            <li>chose a different brand and ordered directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Initially I tried this torture device and it was completely unbearable.</li>
            <li>I tried recently the smaller head for smaller regions and it works very well</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough to fret about, and plenty to remind me that I&#x27;m getting old.  </li>
            <li>And the first time using it was.... not fun.</li>
            <li>My upper lip is so sensitive - I would rather rip a strip of wax off all at once.</li>
            <li>and the hair grows back soft instead of prickly.</li>
            <li>, I thought I did something wrong to have, honestly about 50 plus</li>
            <li>In terms of sensation, it felt like I was being mini-pinched multiple times simultaneously, which wasn&#x27;t really super unpleasant like most people make it out to be.</li>
            <li>Since it was no longer possible to find replacements for the 24K gold blades I decided to buy a new one - I will NEVER go back to shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is painful in certain places, but, to be honest with you, it doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than getting a tattoo, with the same most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a lot of little white fine hairs that could get long at times</li>
            <li>but it certainly did not hurt the way other epilators or waxing processes have.</li>
            <li>I think in a few months, I will have to touch up even less and have better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am hair free for two weeks if not more!</li>
            <li>This makes most other hair removal methods difficult to use and limits their success.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the little plastic \\&quot;prong\\&quot; thing really does anything to reduce pain, but I guess I should also consider the fact that I don&#x27;t really feel any pain anymore when epilating, because I have been doing it for so long.    </li>
            <li>I normally shave my legs every single day and have stubble within 8 hours.</li>
            <li>But it seems to spin faster than other models I&#x27;ve used which could be why I don&#x27;t feel as much.</li>
            <li>But it seems to spin faster than other models I&#x27;ve used which could be why I don&#x27;t feel as much.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on that one I am glad I bought this one because this one is more efficient and less painful.</li>
            <li>I used the facial attachment to rid of my fuzzy upper lip, and although it got some adjusting to the slight pain, it was well worth it for I saved $5</li>
            <li>I have only used it on my upper lip so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does hurt a little at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>So of course, like other users, at first I noticed my hairs were not growing back well enough, they would be under the skin</li>
            <li>It stings a little bit when  you first use it.  </li>
            <li>At first I felt a little pain</li>
            <li>It is a little loud, but nowhere near as loud as a hair dryer.    </li>
            <li>a lot cheaper in the long run compared to professional waxing assuming the product is durable and won&#x27;t break before the warranty date expiration.</li>
            <li>Just be careful of where you use this thing because I used it on my whole arm and ended up with a rash on my inner elbows and ingrown hairs, following.  </li>
            <li>the tingling soreness and red spots have the night to vanish before you bare your legs (or</li>
            <li>I expected a rash or something (which once again I was willing to deal with to not have to shave for such a long period of time).</li>
            <li>The first few times I turned it on it</li>
            <li>I certainly have one less thing to bother me.  </li>
            <li>Let it dry for a couple of minutes, put it back together and turn it on high to get it a bit dryer then leave it for about 30 minutes before you plug it back in.</li>
            <li>It really cuts down on the frequency of shaving (which I still need to do for knees and bikini line).</li>
            <li>After using this one time I didn&#x27;t really see regrowth for almost a week, and the regrowth that did appear was much thinner and less dark.  </li>
            <li>Paid twice as much for my previous epilator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reason for the four stars is that the tweezer &amp;#34;passage&amp;#34; on the bigger head (meant for the body) is not wide enough.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a little topical steroid like hydrocortisone on your face or the first time on your legs since a lot of hair removed at once is likely to cause inflammation.</li>
            <li>I still use the razor in between but am using it far less frequently.</li>
            <li>My legs don&#x27;t grow in super thick but the hair is coarse.</li>
            <li>As far as pain goes, you will feel as though many pins and needles are pricking you but you become numb to it after the first few minutes.</li>
            <li>Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]] was much</li>
            <li>Shaving long hairs like on the arms for the first time can help too, so that the epilator is less likely to break the hair and instead rip it from the root like its supposed to.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know the battery is dying when the head rotates slowly and the sound isn&#x27;t as loud as previous times.</li>
            <li>You have to be sure and hold skin tight and go in slow circles.</li>
            <li>It will sting a little, However, the hair grows back MUCH slower than shaving, and I have noticed over time that it is growing back</li>

            <li> However, after working great for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great design...</li>
            <li> Considering the amount of money I&#x27;ll save to not buy razors, shaving cream,not to mention the time I&#x27;ll save every day, this is definitely a great investment.</li>
            <li> The additional head piece included with this epilator is great on the face.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> And it was great,</li>
            <li> I even used this on my chin and face and neck and got great results, no numbs or redness.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> But once removed it is great to not have to worry about hair for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> i got a diff one and that one works great</li>
            <li> Attractive and it works.  </li>
            <li> in all a really great product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Its great</li>
            <li> On my legs it works great.</li>
            <li> It lasts and it works great, and that&#x27;s all I want in a product</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> stopped shaving (save touch-ups or emergency situations lol) for a lot of reasons.</li>
            <li> The battery is great and lasts a while</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I have skinny legs and knick myself a lot with razors, so the epilator is a great option for me.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Everything else is great.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it worked great.</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my legs.</li>
            <li> It is a great way to do without a razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> but I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, one of the best buys!</li>
            <li> I have successfully done my legs, lip, armpits, &amp; Brazilian area.  </li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand and contours great to my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it &amp; it works great!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to stay neat between waxing appts!</li>
            <li> looks really pretty though!!! :D</li>
            <li> I am very pleased &amp; happy</li>
            <li> Otherwise the battery life is awesome and cleaning the unit is a easy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the battery life is awesome and cleaning the unit is a easy.</li>
            <li> This one is best for people with fine hair probably.</li>
            <li> I do, however, have a good number of ingrown hairs on my legs.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and does what it says IF you can tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the hair really good ---</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my legs and bikini line as well with good results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhoo, it was a good experiment.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as good as I heard.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: for the price, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> about the bikini area, it&#x27;s good to be sitting up while you&#x27;re doing this and having a mirror facing you while you lay on a towel.</li>
            <li> With fairly good reason.</li>
            <li> I bought one for a friend and she also loved it.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as i hoped so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that good product.</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> it works good</li>
            <li> This product provides the convenience of both at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you have to have a good tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I honestly feel rejuvenated to some extent.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> good luck maneuvering it on parts that aren&#x27;t flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i looked into epilators and saw this one and saw all the good reviews and noticed walgreens has it for 29.99</li>
            <li> Good quality for your money.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> This product is good to use.</li>
            <li> Good value for money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> and my skin is fair.</li>
            <li> Works good on underarms.</li>
            <li> Stays charged good.</li>
            <li> Good luck on epilating, this has saved me money and time.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to figuring out how to use this to achieve the best results, and it does hurt quite a bit at first, but once you get over that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Some way of grabbing shorter hairs would be better for me, but  until that comes along, I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> It is very important to hold skin taut!</li>
            <li> It is very important to hold skin taut!</li>
            <li> I used it on my arms too, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am not too happy that my neighbors are able to &#x27;hear&#x27; whatever it is I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> Now if I shave on top on epilating my legs are silky smooth for days and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> The best advice I can give is to be patient at first and keep at it.</li>
            <li> and so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Suck up the beginner&#x27;s pain, and remember the goal is to be able to go 4 weeks without shaving and getting cuts all over you!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Always make sure to rub the area you just manscaped with rubbing alcohol or an alcohol based aftershave!</li>
            <li> My sister suggested this product to me and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Its higher on price but great product!!!!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> But it is much better than the shaving - no cuts!</li>
            <li> got my Remington Epilator today and my life is changed - for the better and permanently!  </li>
            <li> I Love the Remington Epilator!</li>
            <li> I Love it!</li>
            <li> I researched epilators for hours before I decided on this one, and I am SO glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li> I like this one much better faster speeds,less pain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> OK Ladies!</li>
            <li> Waxing was okay except i had to wait for the hair to be fully grown out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works amazingly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works amazingly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I still rave about how amazing this epilator is and have probably gotten around 10 people to buy one of their own.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, so it may an amazing product</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to women who are looking to have great skin, free of all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This one seemed to be a favorite and got good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually kind of addicting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any woman who prefers to handle unwanted hair in the privacy of her own home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced I exfoliated to the best of my ability and still had issues, so I have decided to shave maybe once a week, but continue to touch-up with the epilator, because overall, I&#x27;ve gotten great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced I exfoliated to the best of my ability and still had issues, so I have decided to shave maybe once a week, but continue to touch-up with the epilator, because overall, I&#x27;ve gotten great</li>
            <li> My friend did that justdoing her own pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> The head of the unit is nicely contoured for that.</li>
            <li> Now another friend of mine borrowed mine (after it was cleaned and wiped with hydrogen peroxide) and likes it and wants one. :D</li>
            <li> I really liked this product</li>
            <li> This is effortless to use and is effective for me already.</li>
            <li> If I got a nice discount I would buy one for my moms birthday.</li>
            <li> Handy to pack in the nice drawstring bag that is included.  </li>
            <li> Also nice to be chargeable which the Braun isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am loving this.  </li>
            <li> When cleaning, rinsing the head is nice</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> help the pain, go running before to get some endorphines, then take a warm shower and epilate.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable epilators with good ratings on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> You do have to kind of look at the bottom</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective under my arms.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s fairly painles--(I&#x27;m amazed at how many people say they couldn&#x27;t tolerate the pain involved).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it, I find the best way to avoid this is hold up my arms as high as I can, keeping the skin taut and swiftly move in circular motions as it plucks away the hairs.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and my hair is fair and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Until there&#x27;s a better and more affordable option - good luck, ladies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and worthy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> epilator head is very easy to change to the precision head (for face/bikini area).</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s just too risky, unless you are ok with drawing in your own eyebrows for a while).</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator, worth the money.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s much more effective - a lot fewer passes are needed to remove the hair to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> and so far is the Braun brand is the best.</li>
            <li> I have ordered her, her own and hope this is better for her than shaving.</li>
            <li> It seems that the direction the head spins is most effective when used the machine face up instead of face</li>
            <li> This is the most effective way for the tweezers to grasp the hairs.</li>
            <li> Not at all like a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Luckily for me I was able to use it one my underarms and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair from waxing</li>
            <li> Her hair is very fine</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> The battery life is beginning to not be the best, but other than that, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I can use this charged or connected to the wall, it works great and is priced reasonably!</li>
            <li> I bought this as i did not want to spend a great deal of money on my first epilator in case</li>
            <li> My hair is very light</li>
            <li> Things are very smooth and no in-grown hairs develop for about a week wherever I use it, though I don&#x27;t use it on my underarms</li>
            <li> In general, this is the best epilator I have used for the leg area, but could definitely be better for underarms.   </li>
            <li> I love this worked great the first time.</li>
            <li> I will keep it for use on my lip since its super easy to grab and use (way easier than warming up wax,) but will not use on my legs or bikini area ever ever ever again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> so it might work better for someone else</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s at a much better price than most.</li>
            <li> but I never used - forgot it in the freezer all the time) and was much more pricey - a top range panasonic.     </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and my legs are smooth (no stubble-ever!)</li>
            <li> gas$ on getting my lip waxed, and looks better than the wax.  </li>
            <li> It leaves stubble on my legs, but nothing notably visible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more years than I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I hoped to be able to watch TV while using it</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a razor or tweezers on hand for missed hairs, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, I was pleased to find out it was already charged.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie - no matter what, the bikini area and underarms will prove to be a pain challenge for sure.  </li>
            <li> But, I was able to work through it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this thing.</li>
            <li> Luckily I am able to return this with no fees, but it bums me out that I will now think twice buying items on amazon.</li>
            <li> It is just OK</li>
            <li> The epilator head has metal tweezers combined with rubberized plastic that feels like it would help stretch the skin out to grab hairs better.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that I would be able to do my bikini line for longer results than shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never did that, but the epilator removed most of the hair either by pulling it out from the root or breaking some off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d NEVER thought I&#x27;d ever be able to do my bikini area by myself.</li>
            <li> You can experiment with it, but I&#x27;m guessing most of you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:(4/2012)</li>
            <li> I love this epilator</li>
            <li> I am doing more to exfoliate and hope this helps.</li>
            <li> (It hurts most around the ankles and the fleshy part of your calves.</li>
            <li> But, this is much better.</li>
            <li> Guess who will never have any more of my business.</li>
            <li> At this rate, it will pay for itself since I don&#x27;t have to buy as many disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it on the rest of my body :)</li>
            <li> It is a lovely product.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably because I had more hair on my arms?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to waxing at this area, so I was okay about hair being pulled off.</li>
            <li> I found it so much better than waxing or hand tweezing on the arm pits.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s better to epilate at night, so when you wake up, the redness is gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was better, so I thought I&#x27;d try it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more of these for all my daughters.</li>
            <li> Works as should and love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> Then I couldn&#x27;t shave on top of the stubble</li>
            <li> u guys please get some thing better</li>
            <li> Definitely much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although there weren&#x27;t many reviews at the time I purchased the Remington EP6025, I was sold on the cordless function of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lower speed is also better for courser hair (under-arms, bikini area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My armpits have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I bought it, thinking it would be better, but in reality it works slower when it is not plugged in.</li>
            <li> , I think I save more just shaving 2 or 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;5 - 10 minutes to shave legs compared to 2 plus hours to make sure you get all the hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having had this for a year, I can confidently say - this thing is just alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using it on my legs is the place that hurts the most</li>
            <li> the smoothness never lasted for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Where there was more or courser hair</li>
            <li> Over time I am sure this will get better (again I&#x27;ve never waxed before just shaved).</li>
            <li> If you turn this so that it&#x27;s going the opposite direction of the hair growth, it does it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like being able to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in, if the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one works so much better than the Braun I have.</li>
            <li> Looked for a replacement &amp; this fit the bill!  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the cordless rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I guess I should be glad the hair was there because who knows if the seller sometimes cleans the returned ones and sell them as &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Way better than shaving.</li>
            <li> would (it gets better).  </li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it did work and was better than having to go somewhere to have hair removed.</li>
            <li> So barely touching the skin works better than applying any pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The longer the hair is the more it hurts; however, once used to the pain</li>
            <li> I love the travel bag and have re-purposed it for my iphone as I can see and use the phone through the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;13.</li>
            <li> I wish it was wider so that it would epilate more hair in one go, making the process faster.</li>
            <li> But I should get use to it with more uses</li>
            <li> I was scared too but not any more.</li>
            <li> And sing to whatever music you have playing when you do it.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> For sure I can tell I&#x27;ve tried every method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best epilator</li>
            <li> the thicker the hair the more you have to go over a spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with epilators.</li>
            <li> I actually love it more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one because mine wasn&#x27;t working any more.</li>
            <li> I was able to get through it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get through it.  </li>
            <li> Ouch, no product that rips out your hair by the root will ever be painless, but it does get better after you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I did get ingrown hairs under the top layer of skin even though I exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> Waxing works better</li>
            <li> I returned it wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I know so many of my friends that are using it,</li>
            <li> while it does have more tweezers, I think the remington S&amp;S does a better job at pulling the hairs from the roots.  </li>
            <li> I had before many epilator</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get more of those harmful deoderant chemicals in your body.</li>
            <li> I works better</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It gives me more than i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with use on the underarms, but I get great results on the legs, bikini area, and forearms.  </li>
            <li> I love that the epilator is both corded and cordless.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can be used with the cord and also with rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li> It hurt more on my legs than my face, don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> any case, I LOVE the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day anymore and that my skin is so smooth to the touch!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mostly what I use it for</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and i am glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> I will use it a couple more times and post an update, but I may end up returning it for a refund..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and im sure with time</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the epilator that I had years ago.</li>
            <li> Much better than having to razor</li>
            <li> Make sure that it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> but the more you do it</li>
            <li> Make sure that the epilator is NOT on the charger.</li>
            <li> and then I still use my shaver, but I mostly use this now.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> But that would cost more money to implement</li>
            <li> Also, you can go over a spot more than once to get missed hairs, unlike waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the way it works.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I have tweezed my armpits before and was able to handle the pain</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the epilator would work on her.</li>
            <li> and she was able to finish her legs in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> But, if she is able to do it almost anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing that you read is going to be able to prepare you for what it feels like.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a rechargable battery</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; keep it plugged in the bathroom-it is always.</li>
            <li> So glad it is electric &amp; doesn&#x27;t require batteries.</li>
            <li> Yes, the hair grows in slower and after MANY years of doing this, thinner.</li>
            <li> It works best using the smaller attachment.</li>
            <li> It seems to spin faster and have a bit more power to it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have more tweezers, but because it spins faster, I think it works just a bit better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I love that it can be used cordless.  </li>
            <li> No water function-usually it just missed tones of hairs, breaks them and causes yet more ingrown</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth all the time!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> In addition to it not pulling most of the hair, I was getting ingrown hairs everywhere</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie ladies...when you first start using epilators, it hurts!!!</li>
            <li> Very worth the money!</li>
            <li> So much for smooth beautiful legs for &amp;#34;up to 6 weeks&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> especially in the winter, I am much more comfortable and best of all saving money!</li>
            <li> Works good, not quite as efficient as some higher end models I&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it perfect is a light to see all the hairs, but I am very pleased with the purchase and it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It removes all the hair in the area you&#x27;re focusing on in a quick, effective manner.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews I decided to purchase, glad I did, would recommend this product, easy to use no problems</li>
            <li> the headphones on, your favorite show, sit on a towel or edge of bathtub and smooth away :)</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The carrying pouch is nice to keep everything together, and overall, it&#x27;s a great and easy to use product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got this; it works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t grab at my skin like other epilators</li>
            <li> Luckily it was &#x27;almost&#x27; painless! :-)</li>
            <li> Also the skin remains hair free for more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far, great purchase.</li>
            <li> Stick to smooth, more taut areas like legs and</li>
            <li> I think that these nearly microscopic hairs help keep a gal&#x27;s makeup in place, LOL.</li>
            <li> I love my smooth skin after using this.</li>
            <li> and i love how smooth my legs are.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my skin smooth like i want it to be.. :)</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;BTW exfoliation</li>
            <li> That light is most helpful in locating hair that you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> The epilator doesn&#x27;t catch the very light and fine hairs, which means I still need to shave my legs for a completely smooth feeling (but shaving is 100x easier after epilation.</li>
            <li> For $200 less though - a good buy and am happy.</li>
            <li> believe you need a certain thickness of hair for the product to be able to effectively grasp the hair and rip it out by the follicle.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to operate</li>
            <li> That works well too and is easy to change out.</li>
            <li> By the way, make sure to clean it out with the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li> This is an easy review for me to write.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a couple ingrown hairs (just below the surface, and easily removed) but</li>
            <li> Now, my underarm skin is smooth, comfortable, and I have way more confidence wearing tank tops and sleeveless</li>
            <li> Now, my underarm skin is smooth, comfortable, and I have way more confidence wearing tank tops and sleeveless shirts.  </li>
            <li> It works well, and the pain becomes negligible very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> Also, speaking of time, it is very quick.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with makes cleaning easy</li>
            <li> it comes with for easy travel.</li>
            <li> There was a very mild burning sensation after I used the epilator, but the toner and lotion took care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> head is detachable and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure that you keep the tweezers clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> device itself is easy to use.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s easy, there are two plastic hook/catch thing</li>
            <li> You could easily use it for underarms and bikini instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Legs are the only area i have used the Remington, but with the variety of hair its proven to master, i am confident it would work great anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Legs are the only area i have used the Remington, but with the variety of hair its proven to master, i am confident it would work great anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I will strongly consider purchasing this brand again if this one ever dies (and it&#x27;s not showing any signs of giving up!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this epilator</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> True, this doesn&#x27;t get all of your hairs in one pass which is actually good for me because it would hurt too much if it did!</li>
            <li> When the battery finally quit, I was thrilled to feel good about splurging on a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough it seems to work the best right before the battery dies.</li>
            <li> That would be great, I thought, but mostly I was sold on the generally great reviews and really great price (less than half the price of the Braun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This is an OK product, perhaps after more use I&#x27;ll get the hang of it better as I haven&#x27;t used it much yet.</li>
            <li> The first time you do a section it hurts, but after that you honestly can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> First time using this kind of product.</li>
            <li> The power is sufficient either way.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> I bought this epilator at target about 6 years ago for $85 it still works fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best one I have purchased I had an emoi one previously</li>
            <li> I wanted an epilator that would pull out the fine leg hairs that I have.  </li>
            <li> There was some bleeding when it pulled out some of my fine hair from the root</li>
            <li> My hairs take forever to grow out and they&#x27;re so fine.</li>
            <li> Fine hair needs a lot of time to get rid off.</li>
            <li> It does not do so well with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in &amp;#34;touch-up mode&amp;#34; the battery life is fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does get the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve done laser treatment or even gotten a tattoo, this is just fine.  </li>
            <li> less money &#x3D; great purchase!</li>
            <li> It snaps on easily and securely.  </li>
            <li> (I  have a lot of blond, fine hair.)</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my legs looked after the first time using it, and expect much, much better results in the upcoming uses.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THE SELLER, THE PRODUCT ARRIVED FAST AND SAFE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great investment for a fantastic price (with free Super Saver shipping, no less)!</li>
            <li> I have course hair on my lower legs and fine blonde hair on my thighs and this works great for both areas.</li>
            <li> The fact that you don&#x27;t have to shave as often is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> But it can be used while plugged in which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I ended up tweezing instead (which, by the way, is a HUGE pain in the neck--</li>
            <li> This epilator does what it is supposed to do, it pulls out the hair and leaves it smooth for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but even when I shave with a razor now, my legs don&#x27;t get smooth</li>
            <li> -- they used to be really smooth before I started using this thing.</li>
            <li> This has been working great especially under my arms.</li>
            <li> But keep on using it, and you will see how fabulous it is!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you&#x27;re using this on your face, buy some after epilating cream to soothe your skin.</li>
            <li> agree nothing gets legs as smooth as shaving....</li>
            <li> Somehow, I found a Lady Remington Smooth and Silky.  </li>
            <li> Feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that the regions you epilate will become inflamed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too concerned though because I don&#x27;t need a completely smooth chest</li>
            <li> The reviews made it sound like it was excruciating pain....</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a readily available benchmark.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping, and this one wasn&#x27;t available through Prime.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product</li>
            <li> continue to use this even when my legs and arms are smooth and it still continues to pick up microscopic hairs</li>
            <li> continue to use this even when my legs and arms are smooth and it still continues to pick up microscopic hairs</li>
            <li> Works great but the hair DOES keep coming back!!!</li>
            <li> enjoy this product cause</li>
            <li> Easy clean up.</li>
            <li> They look smooth and stay that way for days and days.</li>
            <li> but I am comfortable tweezing the one or two</li>
            <li> They feel baby smooth and their getting lighter.</li>
            <li> The guidelines are correct in that the pain gets easier to deal with, but I&#x27;m still working on trying to get that smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy ur hair free body.</li>
            <li> Once the hairs are gone, the machine head glides smoothly over the skin.  </li>
            <li> Once the hairs are gone, the machine head glides smoothly over the skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my underarms only since it doesn&#x27;t really do a great job on my legs, I find.  </li>
            <li> But now I have fantastic results with my underarms</li>
            <li> Works GREAT for facial stuff!</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, as with any epilator it will hurt when you use it....</li>
            <li> also used it on my armpits, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck, to be honest.</li>
            <li> the legs do not feel smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> Razors stopped giving me a smooth shave when I was 15</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> This does the job great plus the facial head is a bonus</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with keeping my legs hair free.</li>
            <li> Now I am hair free for 2 days over a week.</li>
            <li> and when she shaves she is hair free for three days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try my armpits or bikini line yet</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator 3 years ago and have been really happy with it until recently.</li>
            <li> However, this unit does not have a light.</li>
            <li> The smaller attachment is great for what it&#x27;s intended to be for.</li>
            <li> if had a light I&#x27;d give it a five start.</li>
            <li> This is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It has worked perfectly until the&lt;br /&gt;past few months.</li>
            <li> It really does work best when you use the circular motion, and only when you do circular motion</li>
            <li> Does a flawless job even to the more sentitive areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it works cordlessly is very practical; if you are traveling to a place with a different voltage, you can take it along fully charged and you are good to go for one total body epilation.</li>
            <li> No idea if it would be a good choice for a first-timer since that experience is so far removed in my memory.</li>
            <li> to make the package even more attractive you can wash the heads under the running water as it brings 2, one for the body and the other for the face.</li>
            <li> and initially I suspected this might be because it wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li> and it does a better job than waxing (mainly because it grabs more than wax)</li>
            <li> This is perfect and I highly recommend it to any woman who is at that point where they get unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> amazingly well for underarm hair, which was my main intended use when I purchased it (never have to shave under there anymore -</li>
            <li> Thighs are not painful at all to me as the hair is fine.</li>
            <li> Got it to use on face primarily - found the small head works best for that with minimum discomfort.</li>
            <li> This epilator might be ideal for you if it&#x27;s your first time epilating or you have had no prior experience with waxing, sugaring, and/or</li>
            <li> and I am very impressed with how little I have to shave now!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and only experienced mild discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found if you go slowly in small circles it works best.</li>
            <li> I had this the first time and i am satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> but it does hurt at first until your skin gets more de-sensitized to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s it, I feel pretty satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I love it, the first time I used it;</li>
            <li> Love it absolutely!</li>
            <li> Ok, I can deal with that for it being the first time using it.</li>
            <li> I was devastated when my machine died last month, but must admit I think I love this model even more!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> It also cuts my time significantly because I used to pluck things by hand.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I was more than a bit intimidated when I first turned it on.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling if I were more consistent that the results would be even</li>
            <li> Very fine hair and very course hair.</li>
            <li> But I kind of wanted a new one, this one was on sale</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many epilady shavers, and so far, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> But ~ I powered through it knowing that it would help me have clean, stubble-free underarms if I could just bear the pain.    </li>
            <li> With a mini part you can clean a bikini</li>
            <li> Also it came with a brush to clean and a bag ^_^</li>
            <li> , I feel like my money is well spent, and I much prefer it to shaving and waxing, so it&#x27;s the best option.</li>
            <li> So clean it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using tweezers to clean up at the end</li>
            <li> Wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m super happy with this product for turning my beastly legs into short worthy gams.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and love it!</li>
            <li> Also, I am pretty sure the fast speeds cause more hairs to break than are removed from the root.  </li>
            <li> but just so i really want to have an easy way to remove unwanted hairs as fast and effective</li>
            <li> have very fine hair on my face, and my main concern was that the Remington will not epilate them at all.</li>
            <li> and I was super excited, until I started using it.</li>
            <li> ok very keptical...</li>
            <li> From what I can tell from cleaning it, the epilator mostly pulls hair out from the root and it doesn&#x27;t really irritate the skin while doing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kind of loud, but is tolerable and you&#x27;ll get used to it over time.</li>
            <li> and if there&#x27;s any left over hair that wasn&#x27;t pulled out, then the good ol&#x27; tweezerman tweezers will finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is soooo much faster and gets all the hair, we love it-</li>
            <li> I definitely had to get a good exfoliating sponge to scrub my legs to ward off the ingrowns.</li>
            <li> but I took another reviewers advice and went in circle as fast as I could and made sure to stretch my skin.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO LOUD THAT HONESTLY</li>
            <li> These are nice when compared to others like Philips &amp; Braun which cost nearly $90-$100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> I would also like to mention that you may want to make sure you really need the rechargable model.</li>
            <li> really tried to like this product, because who wouldn&#x27;t want to be able to go weeks without having to worry about shaving?</li>
            <li> This is one of the most gentle epilators I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like it to epilate my armpits way better than shaving.</li>
            <li> It works for the spots it will pull out but leaves a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good for your upper lip</li>
            <li> I must warn you though the process does hurt quite a bit but to me it&#x27;s worth it to have a smooth shave with no prickly feeling when my legs are touched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick, clean and painless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my tried and true razor.  </li>
            <li> the reviews were not as good as this product (such as a Braun epilator caused people to bleed.)</li>
            <li> If I really decide I love this device</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s not bad at ALL (unless you have the pain tolerance of a flea, I suppose)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use and much better than the old puller I was using.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to not have to shave my legs every single day.</li>
            <li> However, this is a good product, and sure beats the mess and time consumption of waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> Also, my other one had an &#x27;iced&#x27; attachment for cooling (which I have to admit was great for the sting</li>
            <li> The first use took much longer than I expected, so I had to plug in the device to finish the job - great that I didn&#x27;t have to wait hours for it to recharge!  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and very fine hair on my legs that I can&#x27;t seem to pull out with the epilator.</li>
            <li> The only con would be that I had to go over the fine hairs more than once or just had to pluck them myself, which is fine since I did that</li>
            <li> so I had to find an alternative quickly over here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quick with it&#x27;s pulling and a heck of</li>
            <li> After using several more times, the degree of pain was reduced more so.</li>
            <li> As for this particular epilator, I love that it can be cordless.</li>
            <li> compre este producto para mi comodidad, y fue dinero perdido, es super doloroso, y no funciona como dicen...</li>
            <li> After waxing for years, I bought this epilator as a quick fix when I don&#x27;t have time to wax.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy to clean, practical with cordless property.</li>
            <li> Now I can quickly pluck my arms, legs, bikini line, and face.</li>
            <li> I have  been using similar products since my teen years, this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li> I use a mild unscented lotion after I use it</li>
            <li> I like this one because of the curve of the unit naturally goes over curved areas smoothly and more effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in to work because I highly dislike when cords get in the way.</li>
            <li> If you use any sort of acne medication that forbids you from waxing your brows or upper lip (such as retin-a) DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE OFF THE TOP LAYER OF YOUR SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> even that first day my skin isn&#x27;t as smooth as it is with a razor.  </li>
            <li> so you wont be silky smooth at first</li>
            <li> But this was just my VERY FIRST time ever using an epilator anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if they as a product whole are just kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; or if it&#x27;s this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use it..and its exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li> The light on the other epilator I own has a light.</li>
            <li> absolutely love my new Epilator</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to because you have to hold the epilater at the right angle so that the tweezers are working in full effect.</li>
            <li> now it works great, seems like the battery life is slightly diminished now</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> i recemend this as a good starting point for those just getting into an epilator for the first time.</li>
            <li> For a down payment of about $50, it&#x27;s a great investment because I RARELY buy razors or shaving cream anymore.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time on my underarms - youch!  </li>
            <li> And charge it for 16 hrs before using it the first time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie the first time I used it it hurt like a MOTHA-F*&amp;$#R!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, man did it HURT!</li>
            <li> The first time you use this, it&#x27;s a bit mean to you, but for maintenance, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Will update more after have used a few more times!</li>
            <li> When it does come back, I can remove it fairly quickly and much more comfortably.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous but this works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT little gadget.</li>
            <li> AND it grew back more fine than it was.  </li>
            <li> This fabulous little machine may not be able to give me a facelift, but it sure as tootin&#x27; lifted my spirits.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few months now, and it works great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do a smooth, close shave, that I was hoping it will do.</li>
            <li> took a while but worth it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $50 on something that wasn&#x27;t worth the pain or the price.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say whether that would ease the pain, but thought it might be worth suggesting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been another trouble spot, so it&#x27;s nice to get such great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been another trouble spot, so it&#x27;s nice to get such great</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so worth the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Phillips epilator for 2 years now and liked it, although it hurt a bit, especially when doing the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> and I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Remington epilator for years w/great success.</li>
            <li> It is a bit time-consuming, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The hairs were pretty long, so it was a good start to see if this worked.</li>
            <li> Or because my arms are more sensitive?</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite hair removal method.</li>
            <li> but for me its worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the reviews and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t able to chuck the razers completely.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a productive pain, and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> While trying every razor imaginable and having sensitive skin, I did more research and discovered \\&quot;Dr</li>
            <li> Not to mention these are more natural and cheaper alternatives to GiGi</li>
            <li> The facial attachment it brings is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> But please stick with it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the free facial epilator - I am able to use it rather close to my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week and rarely shave the days in between.  </li>
            <li> Be sure and read the directions and don&#x27;t press it into your skin but glide it on top; even so, my upper lip is very tender.  </li>
            <li> but results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product and how effective it would be at hair removal, but I found that it does a great job even on the tiniest hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It leaves you extra smooth even better than a wax..</li>
            <li> With waxing i could still see the hair underneath the skin but with this no hair is visible definetly worth it</li>
            <li> And it is a nice solid feeling device.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite thing besides having such smooth legs is that there are no &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Trimming long hair is definitely a good idea, as is doing this right after washing with hot water.</li>
            <li> It does not get every single hair, but it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> I use an old soft toothbrush and warm water to scrub mine then inspect it with the magnifier until it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing to read other reviews so that you know what to expect, or the pain would make you give up without finishing the job.  </li>
            <li> These areas have become almost completely desensitized to the initial pain I experienced when I first started using the epilator, and</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s really cute!  </li>
            <li> It works best if you do a small area at a time and just keep going over that area until it is smooth, then move on to the next area.  </li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m doing everything in sessions and for the parts that I&#x27;ve already done, I can already feel the smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you know you&#x27;re holding it right</li>
            <li> Used this right out of the box and managed to do one leg before the battery died.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe he is right.</li>
            <li> But that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem right?  </li>
            <li> no matter how you rip hairs out from the root it&#x27;s going to hurt, right?  </li>
            <li> I usually do it right</li>
            <li> It takes just the right amount of pressure to move it to the first/slowest speed.</li>
            <li> and i was right.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> and my face is still pretty much hair free.  </li>
            <li> This motor is much stronger than my old model and works much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> They tend to catch and don&#x27;t leave the totally smooth surface the older model did.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I love that my legs stay smooth for so long.</li>
            <li> I would much rather spend 30 dollars more to get an emjoi (the best if you have coarse, hard to remove hair), go for the 72 tweezer one</li>
            <li> In the end I didn&#x27;t really want any special attachments or a wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very large...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very handy when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving every single day, my legs are already smooth from using it the day prior!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this fast and sweet....  </li>
            <li> Emjoi works great for my underarms and bikini but was small</li>
            <li> It takes more time to use the epilator, but you don&#x27;t have to use it very often and it leaves your skin much smoother than a razor for a much longer time.  </li>
            <li> My fabulous husband bought me this wonderful magnifying glass with a light in it from Ultra Optix, it shows up a lot of ugly including fabric fibers, skin, hair.</li>
            <li> Charging cord is nice and long if you need to use it corded.</li>
            <li> Right after use your pores are very red (but don&#x27;t hurt), but that disappears in hours/overnight to become very smooth.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT TIP FOR NEW MANSCAPERS:</li>
            <li> (When the red light comes on you have to turn it off until the light goes</li>
            <li> , however you&#x27;re looking for a powerful, thorough epilator, skip the Remington EP6025 because it doesn&#x27;t deliver the most efficient hair removal, even on the second faster speed setting.</li>
            <li> This is a great medium priced epilator, especially with the included facial attachment.</li>
            <li> My hair growth is super fast compared to my sisters.</li>
            <li> While it still hurts, it does hurt less than the other and it has a curve which makes it more effective for more places.  </li>
            <li> I am getting more ingrown hairs than I did from shaving, but they aren&#x27;t too bad or too many, and I expect that will fade somewhat as I get more skilled at using the thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to waxing or shaving, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much like waxing.</li>
            <li> My legs are still very smooth a week after the 2nd use.  </li>
            <li> Not very painful the 1st time though it had been months since I&#x27;d been able to use the former one.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get a new epilator.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and hair does not come back as quickly - as after using chemical hair removal products, which always used to make me break out.</li>
            <li> con is that it leaves the area more raw looking, more bumpy, and more prone to blemishes than regular shaving (and that&#x27;s every area where you&#x27;d like to use this).</li>
            <li> But with the epilator, they stay decently hair free and with touch-ups maybe 1-2 times a week at this point, the hairs grow back very sparse and mostly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> more ingrown hairs, leaves red bumps afterwards, HURTS the first couple of times</li>
            <li> Just get through that first session with your epilator...</li>
            <li> by the second session you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used shave or wax my legs and underarms, but thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an epilator.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the smaller head for the underarms after the first pass, and that worked better for the curves under there.      </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> and I chose to try a cheaper model first, to see how I like epilation.  </li>
            <li> that will more than likely give smoother results.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that Remington still makes a product similar to mine.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> First, shipping, was told it would take 5 days to get it</li>
            <li> all i can say is that if you have patience, and are willing to go slow, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as good on the upper lip, has some trouble with the cruviness in that area, does snag on skin a bit, but otherwise I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It hurts even more and left the skin of my legs bruised!</li>
            <li> It is not painful to use on light facial hair (fuzz), but I haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs yet.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my face and legs.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, but</li>
            <li> Epilate first</li>
            <li> My only concern is that eventually the unit won&#x27;t be able to hold a charge and may ALWAYS need to be plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only happened to me 2-3 times out of the MANY times</li>
            <li> Obviously, I would charge it more often if I was doing my bikini</li>
            <li> Also love that it has a smaller head for hard-to-reach places.    </li>
            <li> or so it quits and the red light comes on, even after a full charge.</li>
            <li> My first epilator</li>
            <li> It got all the hair off my legs and most of it off my chest &amp; back.</li>
            <li> I have searched for another cord to purchase and was told by a Remington rep on their 800 number that the cord is only available to be purchased with the epilator!</li>
            <li> It does help with the facial hair for sure.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs first.</li>
            <li> I tried holding it in many different angles.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> So, this was my first epilator, and I read almost all of the reviews trying to decide if it was for me or not.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in getting an epilator.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> (I even tried to use a numbing cream first).</li>
            <li> I did so many review on the Remington EP6025 Womans Recharegeable Epilator  with Bonus Facial Epilator ..........................</li>
            <li> Well this is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> It hurt the first time I used it and caused ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this and would definitely recommend others to buy it.</li>
            <li> The epilator removed 90% of the hair the first use.</li>
            <li> I have found that you get more bang for your buck if you wait through several hair growth cycles</li>
            <li> I have found that you get more bang for your buck if you wait through several hair growth cycles</li>
            <li> What exactly is this?</li>
            <li> toys is my first ever epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> Just one word to anyone looking to buy their first epilator: it hurts like heck the first time you use it</li>
            <li> I use my epilator sitting on the sofa reading a book; using it in the shower would use up all 80 gallons of hot water, plus</li>
            <li> The Remington I had been using for probably more than 20 years finally died.  </li>
            <li> and yes it hurts the first time, but</li>
            <li> No, it does not get all the hair in the first pass, but it does get the hair when used according to the directions.  </li>
            <li> It is reliable and not expensive.  </li>
            <li> This was the first epilator I have used.  </li>
            <li> Curvy places are harder to effectively do.</li>
            <li> Hair regrowth in the beginning was about two to three days later which for me is better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I broke out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It took me about an hour the first time I used it on my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it to not have to shave so much.</li>
            <li> An absolute must have product!</li>
            <li> And using this i didn&#x27;t see it for many weeks later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper too!</li>
            <li> a proof I used it today for the first time</li>
            <li> did get two pretty gnarly in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s just my experience, and I&#x27;m left to wonder if it would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li> This is my first epliator to try.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this.</li>
            <li> For some reason, after several months of use, I don&#x27;t need to do that any more.</li>
            <li> It was my first epilator</li>
            <li> The first time I did it, it hurt like hell</li>
            <li> that one I paid more for prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is ouchy at first</li>
            <li> First of all, legitimate product that comes as described, well made and durable.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an epilator.  </li>
            <li> used this product on my face first, mustache area and chin as well as cheeks and jawline, which took about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was nervous about the pain factor because everyone says that it hurts the first time you use it, but as soon as I started using it</li>
            <li> It hurt the first time I used it because I let my leg hair grow out while waiting for this to arrive</li>
            <li> It just removes the top layer like a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I still have hair stubble, even more than I did when using regular razor.</li>
            <li> This was my first buy after lot of search</li>
            <li> This product has worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> I hope that it&#x27;s just because it is my first time using it</li>
            <li> But once it&#x27;s gone the first time, this thing makes maintenance a dream.  </li>
            <li> Better than a regular razor though.  </li>
            <li> and that is exactly what this Epilator does...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty scared to attempt it after I sleep for the night.</li>
            <li> Maybe later tomorrow I&#x27;ll have more guts or pain threshold or something</li>
            <li> /&gt;After looking at reviews for several of the top epilators on Amazon, I decided to give this Remington a try.  </li>
            <li> Being a first timer in the world of epilating, i have the fear of the pain, because of some reviews that i have read..</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator..</li>
            <li> If I would have used the larger piece on my armpits it would have hurt much more.</li>
            <li> When I looked online most epilators in this price range did not have the extra attachment unlessyou wanted to pay twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing first...</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In order to get maximum hair removal out of this machine always face the front of the machine (the face where the on/off switch is located)upwards so you can see the pretty flowers.  </li>
            <li> this helps for first timers or for those who feel that this machine does not work as well as it should.</li>
            <li> : Was pretty tolerable for me.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with epilating</li>
            <li> It works  good to begin with after few use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty quick too than tweezing individual hairs in which you have a huge patch of.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty much fast and super fast.  </li>
            <li> , it leaves the skin super smooth and he hair grows back thinner</li>
            <li> Though it never quite thrilled me, I stuck with it due to the sunk cost of $130.  </li>
            <li> I would like to say that I&#x27;m new to epilation and that might be why I&#x27;m not giving a super review.</li>
            <li> It works the best at removing hair with the least amount of times going over and over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell how many ingrown hairs I get, I did find some on the back of my calf.</li>
            <li> It seems to not be growing back as fast, so I love that.  </li>
            <li> There are enough tweezers to do a good job without several passes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, I would like to reiterate what so many other reviewers have said: The first time you use it, it HURTS!  </li>
            <li> But best of all is no more dry, itchy legs.</li>
            <li> I chose this one based on the positive reviews and because it comes with two heads, one for the face and one for the legs and underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This actually turned out to be a great choice - it has all I need: A detachable top and little brush so you can clean the thing properly, a fast speed (I never use the slow), and easy charging with no need for batteries -</li>
            <li> Doing my bikini area was strange and the head rotated against the direction in which the hair grew, yet most of the hairs it pulled out came out with its roots.</li>
            <li> i wont lie it really hurt the first time</li>
            <li> when I get out of the shower and keep a towel hot to use after some time has passed, it really relaxes/loosens your skin.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed at first.</li>
            <li> It is the best hair removal device I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts less and less every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to moisturize your skin afterwards as well to prevent chaffing and dry skin</li>
            <li> I took ibuprofen to be safe the first time I used it, but the discomfort was minimal.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate and scrub always in the shower than make sure your dry before epilating.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that using it in circular movements as described in the booklet actually makes it more efficient - surprising since my other one has the same top/mechanism but didnt need all that.</li>
            <li> I like the fairly large surface area</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want a large quantity of hair there.  </li>
            <li> I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The benefits certainly out way any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> There is no mess and the pain is bare able.</li>
            <li> I was told that witch hazel would help, but it seemed only to irritate my skin more (but I do have very sensitive</li>
            <li> If you can survive the initial epilation, you should be fine moving forward.  </li>
            <li> After repeated sessions, your hair grows back so fine..</li>
            <li> She has tried many different epilators but her favorite with less pain was the Remington EP6025.</li>
            <li> I normally have the type of hair that is a pain to shave because after a clean shave, all it takes is one little goose bump and all the hair magically reappears.</li>
            <li> I am guy who was cursed to have a large amount of body hair, so much that if I don&#x27;t manscape</li>
            <li> I decided to try this epilator out since the price was reasonable and you get 2 heads (large one for the body and a mini one for the face).  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and read reviews and went with this one to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li> a warm shower does seem to help the hair come out a little easier, but it works even if your legs are &amp;</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I actually feel &#x27;clean&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> have a pretty high threshold for pain, and I can&#x27;t even stand to use this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy but who cares with such great results.</li>
            <li> I was quickly able to speed it up, but noticed that if my hair was longer than a 1/4 inch, it either hurt a little more, or simply broke at the surface of the skin.)</li>
            <li> As a caveat to this review, I should add that I have waxed my legs several times and that seems to make a huge difference in how people respond to epilators.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, and not so light that it feels cheap and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When charging it the red light will never go out signaling it&#x27;s fully charged, which I think is really a con of this device.</li>
            <li> If I remember correctly, my Braun® Silk Epile had removed all the hair back in the day :D. If you are blond, then your legs will look hair free, but when you touch them you feel all kinds of stubble&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to wax but recently moved to Korea and for some reason the waxing available here burns my skin for days.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;m about to charge it the second time and now the indicator light for charging is not working anymore.</li>
            <li> Once you are adjusted to the pain and suck it up, it works very well, although it doesn&#x27;t get every hair after repeated passes.   </li>
            <li> Doing my legs took much longer than the unit can hold a charge (about 20ish minutes)</li>
            <li> My legs are still smooth 4 days later.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t know how a product will perform unless you test it out.</li>
            <li> So zero regrets on this buy:)</li>
            <li> the indicator light is still red.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.</li>
            <li> Taking the head off and cleaning the foam out seems to help, but my thumb hurts from turning it on and off so much.</li>
            <li> This product only removes really light hairs.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold up really well</li>
            <li> The depilatory creams were smelly, didn&#x27;t work well, and I was very concerned about the health of my skin</li>
            <li> but after awhile it just didn&#x27;t hurt so much anymore</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Im very content with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really suggest you to by these this will help you with your side burns and all that hair that you have around your face</li>
            <li> size of this whole product is convenient  to put into your pocket.</li>
            <li> Compared to my legs where I just shrugged it off, doing it on my arms made me really cry out.</li>
            <li> Because after I was done and feeling my face, it felt really really soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The indicator light is red and never changes.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THE NOISE INTENSE..</li>
            <li> however it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever REALLY give me the smoothness I seek.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really important to exfoliate before using it, and continue to exfoliate when the hair starts growing back.</li>
            <li> This thing works really well on coarser hair (for me, that means under arms and bikini line).</li>
            <li> This is something I really appreciate because I&#x27;m prone to nicking myself with electric shavers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Once I used it though, I found that it does not work very well on the underarms.</li>
            <li> of course it hurt a bit because it is plucking hairs, but if it saves me so much on razors and shaving cream</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I think it must be my nationality and having very well rooted hair.</li>
            <li> Smooth legs at last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s pain free (no epilator is), but it&#x27;s relatively harmless.</li>
            <li> Epilating is my preferred method of hair removal, the results are really worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am very fair.&lt;br /&gt;9.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I was really upset.</li>
            <li> Then I used it with the button side facing up (which someone had really warned against doing), but this method worked REALLY well for me.</li>
            <li> and btw it really really hurts!!(did</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator..</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast.</li>
            <li> and they had now really thickened up.  </li>
            <li> Being cordless is a real benefit too.  </li>
            <li> I have found that using Witch Hazel then some Aloe when I&#x27;m finished helps to calm my skin and reduce redness that naturally occurs when hair is removed at the root.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks Remington for making a womans product that does a mans job.lol.</li>
            <li> how important something like this is to a woman in her later years.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s a suggestion based on my personal experience: Ever so lightly touch the machine to the area</li>
            <li> I just would briefly and lightly touch the machine to my lip and pull it away when it hurt.  </li>
            <li> I just would briefly and lightly touch the machine to my lip and pull it away when it hurt.  </li>
            <li> really hurts like  </li>
            <li> For the price I got it, I really don&#x27;t have anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> No rashes or breakouts, no stubble, and smooth facial skin!  </li>
            <li> so I am extra smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes my legs were smooth for 2 weeks, but once the hairs grew back...</li>
            <li> It hurts, but not as much as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It left my legs incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Remington Epilator!</li>
            <li> It shows up what you don&#x27;t want to know but really need to know.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THE MAKER BECAUSE IT HAD A WARNING ON THE BOX</li>
            <li> went straight up to the faster speed since the button slide mechanism is too lax.</li>
            <li> But maintaining is so much easier.</li>
            <li> well and fast in corded mode</li>
            <li> This would hurt so much</li>
            <li> very satified.</li>
            <li> ready for use.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my vanity and it is ready to use at any time.</li>
            <li> decided on this Remington model for it&#x27;s size, reasonable price and the fact that it was corded (but could also be used cordless).</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I used it on my vagina too for a brazillian effect and it also works really well.</li>
            <li> Fast forward 3 months...</li>
            <li> It it nice that it has a different sized head as an extra.</li>
            <li> about the facial epilator, I&#x27;ve used it only once and honestly didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Not painful, more like small pricks on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The most sensitive area was my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> The most sensitive area was my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Epilating in general kind of sucks, but if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t want to shave every day, and don&#x27;t want to continuously throw money and resources down the drain with disposable products, it&#x27;s worth it, and this is a great choice for it.</li>
            <li> After several hours of reading reviews, changing my technique, and downing many glasses of wine to endure the pain, here is the routine i follow now: Exfoliate with shower mittens (and i mean a good good scrubbing), well dried off and NO lotion (not even numbing cream, tried it, no bueno), starting at my ankles</li>
            <li> On the positive, this is a very easy to use device, especially if you remember to keep the skin taught, and the results LAST...</li>
            <li> so my Daughter can have the old one because every time I need to use it, it&#x27;s not in my bathroom;  but $300!!!</li>
            <li> Since I only need to use every week or so and the sting lasts for seconds, it is very worth it.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that the battery dies pretty quick.</li>
            <li> other thing I noticed is that the extremely super fine peach fuzz that should be on the face is still there, but is normal and not noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li> other thing I noticed is that the extremely super fine peach fuzz that should be on the face is still there, but is normal and not noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li> The electrical cord is crimped and must be in just the right position to complete the electrical connection.  </li>
            <li> I tried it first on my arms since I knew that the skin there wasn&#x27;t very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> In the summer months I normally have to shave morning and night!</li>
            <li> Received this product in a white box, not the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> It is painless and more efficient per stroke than other epilators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I dreaded what other people with better vision may have thought.  </li>
            <li> This is such an upgrade from the original epilators from years ago.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s true that you have to go through the same area several times to get all the hairs out and for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I think that it works slightly better than the other brand I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for mainly my legs and underarms, but hoped it would be good enough for other areas.</li>
            <li> However, after using this epilator for the first time I have to admit it is well worth it for such a break in the shaving cycle.</li>
            <li> works fast- had an older model(won&#x27;t mention brand) for almost 9 years now-</li>
            <li> So my mom had an old school epilator that was pretty much a torture device for punishment</li>
            <li> I have a decent tolerance for pain, and I&#x27;ve found that if you do the whole area in one shot, you get used to it once you get going</li>
            <li> Because individual hairs grow at different rates, don&#x27;t expect to use this and get silky smooth skin the very first time.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely 5 stars, but what I wanted to learn about most when I looked into this was epilating in general, so that&#x27;s mainly what I&#x27;ll write about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it once and didn&#x27;t get to a second pass on my right leg when I almost passed out from the pain!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves the skinny silky smooth (as long as you exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate)</li>
            <li> , if you are thinking about getting an epilator, I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I would recommend this one, unless you want to spend a lot more money on a more expensive one.  </li>

            <li> After a while you honestly get used to the small amount of pain it delivers.</li>
            <li> And about 2 hours, yes literally TWO full hours, later it seemed like I&#x27;d gotten all those hairs.</li>
            <li> really, the only thing you can do is use this before you head to bed on a day where you aren&#x27;t going to see many people the next day or have the areas exposed where you used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 years old and I have always been interested in using an epilator to rid myself of all this unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Using it while it&#x27;s still plugged in ensures full power the entire time I use it.</li>
            <li> it is not useful, why do I need to pay more for it?</li>
            <li> Full legs took me about 45 mins and sometimes would shave in the morning to get those tiny ones i missed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to put up with the pain for the first few times you use it, this product is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> At first my skin seemed fine, but the next day I had a ton of white heads.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the more I do it though, the less time it will take.  </li>
            <li> but less the more you do it.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one would offer much better results than this.  </li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one would offer much better results than this.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if more expensive ones are better</li>
            <li> but this one is decent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it on my legs was super simple.</li>
            <li> that my older model of the Epilady.</li>
            <li> Decent price for an epilator as well.</li>
            <li> thus our follicles are more likely to become infected without proper care.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I loved this because not only does it pull the hair, but I think it pulls off dead skin too.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for my underarms...</li>
            <li> I have tried wax strips, and nair, but this is quick and relatively painless.</li>
            <li> I have found that the pain for me has gotten better on both my second and third epilation.</li>
            <li> I bought the epilator mainly for my face.</li>
            <li> It might work better for thicker hairs in your underarms and...other parts, but I can only imagine the agony of having a dozen hairs ripped out per second in those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find my hairs grow back as quickly as they do with the Emojoi one.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a smaller interchangeable head for smaller areas and more accuracy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: 5 stars, mainly because it met my expectations</li>
            <li> I hesitated whether i should again get a phillips or a braun, as we think more expensive is better.</li>
            <li> It only shaves the top layer of hair and the next day, you have to use it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the epilator is it leaves smooth skin behind and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but I found this product to be just ok.</li>
            <li> I mainly got it for my face and chin.</li>
            <li> I have it, like it, but I have a fancier, more expensive one on my wish list now. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this especially for the facial attachment and just love it.  </li>
            <li> I do not move on from one particular area until i can no longer feel any pulling.</li>
            <li> Battery life last my entire epilation process.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; to me is honestly more like a tickle, but I have an incredibly high pain tolerance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s gave me the best, longest lasting results but it was such a mess, took about around an hour every time and my legs would be bumpy and red for a day or so after.  </li>
            <li> I can now go high speed and have mustache and those lovely chin hairs done in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I used it plugged in, as the first charge is 16 hours and my legs were totally smooth and only three weeks later</li>
            <li> I guess I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself looks like a high quality item, comes with protective caps, a brush, and everything.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I wonder how these high dollar ones will preform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know the directions say use a few times to get used to it, but I totally cannot do my top lip, super sore.</li>
            <li> It does take a little more time, but I can have smoother legs &amp; face every week instead of once a month.  </li>
            <li> Except the back of my knees is a teeny bit sensitve, but NOTHING like at first!</li>
            <li> THAT REALLY HURTS, but if you hold your skin down taut you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I did not know that there is such a large variety available and that there is now a specific name for them--epilators.  </li>
            <li> far as the two speeds on this unit, I absolutely prefer the high speed for all areas of my body, it just seems to minimize discomfort and making the process quicker.</li>
            <li> far as the two speeds on this unit, I absolutely prefer the high speed for all areas of my body, it just seems to minimize discomfort and making the process quicker.</li>
            <li> The hair grows back thin and fine at first, so if you stay on top of it</li>
            <li> Save resources, save money, and I have sensitive skin that got really irritated</li>
            <li> Pat it dry with a clean towel, don&#x27;t rub it, you just got the fibers out.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe this really worked.</li>
            <li> I would definitely advise that if you can stick with it, it will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Remington EP6025 for a few months now, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My best advice would be to stick to small areas, moving in a circular direction to slowly clear out small areas and gradually increase the tweeze</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to hold the skin taunt enough to the point that it would be most effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I think waxing is more effective in terms of cleaner hair removal than using an epilator; however, waxing is more costly in the long run and if you&#x27;re on a budget then an epilator is the way to go if you really hate shaving, so the epilator is what I will stick with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a normal reaction.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a distinct difference in the thickness and coarseness in the individual hairs</li>
            <li> I had issues with a cheaper Remington epilator breaking after a few uses, this one is more durable.  </li>
            <li> but you do have to go over the area a few times to get most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing because the results last so long, but you *will* end up with ingrown hairs if you don&#x27;t do something to prevent them..</li>
            <li> i was surprised, considering the low cost of this item, was sure it probably wouldnt work (and have never used one before), but just the opposite!</li>
            <li> I only attempted using the slower speed (which is still pretty darn fast)...</li>
            <li> Just press the big white button near the top of the device and the head pops off.</li>
            <li> so i stick to the normal one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was a little rough, not knowing what to expect, it feels a little like waxing, but after the first initial treatment is over and done, each time I use it, it is faster, easier, and what an awesome result you get, I have found I use mine, then shower and use my lotions</li>
            <li> Hopefully the more I use it the less it comes in!</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi Spilator had less tweezers and went through many batteries.</li>
            <li> this helps!hose dark roots right under the surface of my skin, even right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice when the epilator is quiet enough to have the TV or radio on, but this product is simply too loud to do anything else while epilating.</li>
            <li> I do wish that red light would go off or change to green or something to signal a full charge.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking for a new one</li>
            <li> I trust the name and decided to try the new version.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to epilation and am trying to get the hang of using this.</li>
            <li> Hoping that technology had evolved and eased my pain, now that my epilator died I searched for a new brand.</li>
            <li> I live in France and have a Calor Epillator.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used home-wax strips on a couple of occasions, but was relatively new to ripping hair out of my body.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wanted to live this product.</li>
            <li> This was a product described as new</li>
            <li> Everything was brand new in the package.</li>
            <li> I am new to epilators.  </li>
            <li> I am new to epilating, I heard about it through friends at work.</li>
            <li> those of you new to epilators...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to epilators--I just discovered them about 2 months ago when I bought the Emjoi Dolphin Wet/Dry Epilator Model-AP 17DB.  </li>
            <li> I have average to fine leg hair.   </li>
            <li> In fact, it worked well in this fashion for my underarm area as well (with the different, bigger head), making both my under arms smooth within a span of 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bonus facial epilator that came with this really wasn&#x27;t that much of a help.</li>
            <li> one swipe probably gets rid of like a sixth of the hair and it hurts so much that you really dont wanna go in for a second swipe</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend giving this epilator a try, and, if you happen to not like it, you really aren&#x27;t out as much as you would be by purchasing a Braun or Emjoi.</li>
            <li> the hair growth itself is much sparser and seems to grow more slowly.</li>
            <li> It is very loud when in use.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried my bikini line yet, but I&#x27;m also very sensitive to pain.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really blame the product/manufacturer since I really probably shouldn&#x27;t have used it on such fine, sensitive hairs, but it is what it is, so be careful where you use this thing!!</li>
            <li> I narrowed it down to a couple based on my price range and chose this one because it had high reviews, a smaller attachment and more tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t waxed or epilated recently, it will hurt, and it may not get all the hairs at first...</li>
            <li> But ~ so much better than Nair for face, which burns my skin unbelievably.      </li>
            <li> I recommend this if you are willing to take the initial pain because like my mother always says, \\&quot;Beauty ain&#x27;t painless!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I did one leg as a test when I first got this, 4 days later I was still smoother than 8 hours after shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first go-round on my legs took a combined total of about 4 hours (I was watching TV/movies so it probably could have been done faster).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well, and the noise is really loud!</li>
            <li> No problem of in growth - didn&#x27;t see any in growth on first or on subsequent use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also want to note that yes, this unit is loud!</li>
            <li> I also want to note that yes, this unit is loud!</li>
            <li> read all the reviews here and some on other sites and will confirm from my experiences in owning the product about a month or more the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to get hairs that are pretty short too..</li>
            <li> After your first use you will have the second stage of hair come though..</li>
            <li> The Remington EP6025 has double time tweezers and a charger which saves me so much money instead of batteries!</li>
            <li> Even my young daughters are using it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it has truly lived up to the ratings.  </li>
            <li> I even waited three days for the hairs to get longer and the small epilator head still didn&#x27;t pick them up, for the most part.</li>
            <li> I did try it out on my legs and it was about ten times more painful than in the bikini area, which was surprising.</li>
            <li> First and foremost this machine is actually multiple TWEEZERS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to do it.</li>
            <li> The user guide says to charge it a minimum of 16 hours prior to first cordless use.</li>
            <li> I still have my old Remington from 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> I have light skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there are several tips for first timers that would make using this a lot easier and prevent some mishaps along</li>
            <li> It hurts at first, but once you get through the initial session, maintenance is no problem.</li>
            <li> I read in a fashion magazine&#x27;s blog (can&#x27;t remember which one) that this particular one was given very high ratings, especially for use on the bikini area!  </li>
            <li> (I mean everywhere!), completely pain free after the first time and very practical (the cordless feature is amazing for the hard to reach spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I throw everything in the strong little sack</li>
            <li> After doing a little research online, I have a good routine down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, very easy to hold, has two removable and washable heads (long for legs, short for sensitive areas such as armpits and face), can be used with or without the cord, has two speeds, is not super loud (to me</li>
            <li> And after half an hour trying to get one arm smooth and hair-free</li>
            <li> a slight pinch or pain enjoy</li>
            <li> My legs were soft for almost 2 weeks and even after the first time, the hair grew back thinner and lighter!</li>
            <li> I am also pregnant now so my hair grows faster and shaving has gotten even harder.</li>
            <li> 66 years old and way past menopause, the &#x27;cute&#x27; ever-so-tiny peach fuzz on my face that had never bothered me before began to proliferate and lengthen.  </li>
            <li> And, I feel that the results are well worth the trouble of that first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, I feel that the results are well worth the trouble of that first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did the job - quickly, thoroughly and with minimal ingrown hairs (provided I kept up with ex-foliating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The battery is not as strong as using the epilator while plugged in, but is usable in a few instances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brunette and while my arm hair etc is pretty light and fine, years of shaving has made my leg hair very dark and course and thick comparatively.</li>
            <li> it gets every single hair and its so worth it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty weak strength wise, sounds like it&#x27;s dying compared to other epilators.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth it.in a few months, I will have to touch up even less and have better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt fine after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> If I had let my chest and back hair grow a little more from shaving</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, face ( love the little facial attachment), and underarms.  </li>
            <li> It hurts quite a bit with the first use, but after the first time it&#x27;s just like a little sting.</li>
            <li> Certain areas on my body are naturally very prone to ingrown hairs, even if I waxed or shaved (back of thieghs, outside of calfs, and bikini area).  </li>
            <li> and so far it has held up after two years.</li>
            <li> Hairs don&#x27;t get caught into a storage bin, it just falls out onto whatever you&#x27;re standing on or are near of so you may have to have something to prevent it from getting everywhere, or</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product since I have read that it takes some time to see complete results.</li>
            <li> Battery life is probably an hr or so, but the cord is pretty long...</li>
            <li> Planned to completely switch over to just this instead of razors</li>
            <li> While it does, indeed, feel like a torture device (I highly recommend the numbing cream!), it also eliminates my need to shave daily to avoid stubble.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can work on hair in short bursts, as my pain tolerance varies.</li>
            <li> It sounded just as loud as the Philips Satinelle</li>
            <li> It just took a long time to get it all out the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they came back fast and stubbly.  </li>
            <li> just like you would if you went to wax professionally.</li>
            <li> also have skin that is prone to ingrown hairs and is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li> so I can use it for my upper lip ever since I started using my hair does not grow as fast.</li>
            <li> my 13 yr old started to use it and it died-</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS WAY TOO LOUD.  </li>
            <li> IF IN FACT THAT&#x27;S HOW LOUD</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t be smooth everyday if I tried.</li>
            <li> Like plucking eyebrows, you get used to the feeling and it stops hurting completely.</li>
            <li> It stings a lil when it&#x27;s in action</li>
            <li> So I returned it and bought emjoi soft caress.</li>
            <li> A bit loud and of course it hurts a bit, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to even with shorter hair than it says you need.</li>
            <li> I have never tried professional waxing and have horror stories from home waxing.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three only because it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find it didn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money .</li>
            <li> This thing is so loud</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin soft, even shiney.</li>
            <li> I think that these nearly microscopic hairs help keep a gal&#x27;s makeup in place, LOL.re epilating.  </li>
            <li> I finally fixed that problem by getting a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an investment of time and energy to do this (to do whole bikini area and legs after 4+ weeks, about an hour.</li>
            <li> nearly ALL OF THEM were ingrown...</li>
            <li> The smaller head for the face works really well because of the curves of the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t hurt as much the 2nd time.  </li>
            <li> Im not going to lie its loud and intimidating</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s old news</li>
            <li> So far I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I would spend nearly $75 just for the summer.</li>
            <li> So, my twelve year old daughter just started to shave</li>
            <li> Use the epilator directly head on towards the direction of the hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Every time I do epilate, though, the hair seems to grow in much thinner with smaller roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a long time to remove all of my hair the first time because it was painful with so much hair, but now it&#x27;s really not bad to do a weekly touch up and have pretty smooth legs, pits, bikini area all the time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money I spent on it</li>
            <li> The good thing is, it doesn&#x27;t get any worse for several days to one week.  </li>
            <li> The hair does grow more slowly.  </li>
            <li> Though the hair removal doesn&#x27;t last as long as they say, and doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the hair quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not nearly as painful and takes far less time.</li>
            <li> I wanted a rechargeable device that could do the face and the only products I saw that were available for the face-only were battery operated or if it did do face as well as other body areas</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to try this at first, because who wants a bunch of rotating metal and rubber pieces on their delicates, but my fear was for nothing.</li>
            <li> I expected the charge not last too long but thought maybe more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it all the way up my leg due to sensitivity, but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> and I will admit, the first time I used this on my legs, it was slightly uncomfortable, but not nearly as bad as waxing or an unsightly razor nick, however the first time I used it on my underarms, tears came to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> although I love this product, I am only giving it four stars because it does not pick up my hair when I hold it properly (the button side down)</li>
            <li> but this one is must better and hurts much less the first time after using it the pain in very little</li>
            <li> If you can get through the initial pain of the first 1-2 sessions, then I promise you&#x27;ll never go back to razors.  </li>
            <li> the plastic is worn and there is HAIR on both the main piece and the facial extension.  </li>
            <li> but after that first initial shock, you&#x27;ll never go back to your razor!</li>
            <li> I got this mainly for facial hair.</li>
            <li> She is older and do not  believe in waxing only twee zing .</li>
            <li> It was very hard to get that first epilation done, but I told myself it would be worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always prided myself on having a high tolerance for pain, and this device regularly tested my limits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it twice on my legs, and there is definitely less hair growing back in, and my legs are smooth for longer than between shaves.  </li>
            <li> I began by using the lower speed on my legs, found that I was perfectly okay with the sensation of ripping the hair out by the roots (kind of a tingling, burning sensation at times, and almost feels like tiny shocks, especially behind the knees.)</li>
            <li> The epilator worked great on my upper lip, however I am very used to waxing so not too painful.</li>
            <li> There was some bleeding in the bikini area which took me a long time to get the nerve to do, but not worse than waxing.</li>
            <li> It depends on how long the hair follicle is as to how much it hurts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting red bumps after use is normal afterall hairs were pulled off and at the root.</li>
            <li> I was tired of razor burns and needing to shave pretty much every day since the hair grows so fast!</li>
            <li> It also takes care of that embarrassing facial hair that I would normally pay a salon to wax.</li>
            <li> But I still expected that I would be cringing with pain the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> I spent $55 on it the first time.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt my legs and actually felt good, but on my face, that&#x27;s a different story altogether - it HURT my poor</li>
            <li> One must press the centermost button and THEN drag it up firmly to the first speed setting for fine hair pulling or the highest speed setting above that for coarser hair pulling.</li>
            <li> After, I might be a little spotty, but it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> Certain areas, like armpits and the back of my knees cause me enough pain to force me to stop.</li>
            <li> I think the only place on my legs that pinched was right around my ankles, but it&#x27;s such a tiny and fleeting pinch that I didn&#x27;t even mind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty convenient and quick... at least for the non-sensitive areas!  </li>
            <li> Unless this thing has a new feature I am unaware of, you can probably find it cheaper else</li>
            <li> Buy it in Target or a physical store where you could see for yourself if the product appears new.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy a new epilator</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY if you are new to epilating.</li>
            <li> Because of my bathroom setup and the fact that I&#x27;m not flexible enough to stand with one leg propped up on the counter, I need a new chargeable one.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I turn it back on, the light goes green but the motor hesitates a bit.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, you have to use the facial attachment for just about everything because the larger attachment doesn&#x27;t do contours very well.</li>
            <li> but with still a few hairs left on my upper lip removes it quick and fast with</li>
            <li> Did not do much on the area above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, 30 min max!), but I&#x27;ve found every two weeks is enough to keep hair totally removed (real smoothness lasts about a week).</li>
            <li> Well i don&#x27;t know if i didn&#x27;t research these kind of products properly, BUT, I as tired of the waxing</li>
            <li> The battery didn&#x27;t last long enough the first time I used it (TOO HAIRY!)</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a month now and that&#x27;s all I need to do to keep my legs soft!</li>
            <li> The hair that was pulled out was pretty painless compared to other models.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly</li>
            <li> The power seems to be reduced slightly when I&#x27;m not using it on the cord, but it&#x27;s still going fast enough to really get my hair out.</li>
            <li> it came to the more sensitive areas, there was some discomfort but not unbearable pain as with other epilators in the past.</li>
            <li> It hurts less and less the more you use it.</li>
            <li> Little less pain than the other brands, and that&#x27;s why I know isn&#x27;t do good job.</li>
            <li> but if you go over a certain area in small circles you can usually get MOST of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced more ingrown hairs on my legs, but always just under the surface, never the crazy, inflamed scary ones you hear about...</li>
            <li> I have experienced more ingrown hairs on my legs, but always just under the surface, never the crazy, inflamed scary ones you hear about...</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend epilators in general.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t especially loud and the battery lasts long enough to use on both legs without having to wait to recharge.</li>
            <li> I had a small cheap one (different brand to try it out)</li>
            <li> It barely hurt at all</li>
            <li> I saw that it barely took any of the hair out.  </li>
            <li> The mini-pinching is just the hair being pulled out from the root and the miniscule pain is very fleeting and is to be expected.</li>
            <li> already I&#x27;ve noticed some things have happened if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much \\&quot;loose\\&quot; skin you have, it&#x27;s gonna pinch the skin and the epilator head will stop spinning like its jammed.</li>
            <li> Basically, follow the same procedures if you were going to get a professional wax done.</li>
            <li> It comes partially charged, but you really should charge it up before using it.</li>
            <li> I was paying $60 for just my back, shoulders, and chest to be professionally waxed.</li>
            <li> Have not required using it frequently because it takes a while for the hair grow back.</li>
            <li> so these can&#x27;t be used internationally, just in case if you are a frequent traveler..</li>
            <li> I barely feel this on my legs.</li>
            <li> I use it on my arms and also barely feel anything.</li>
            <li> chose a different brand and ordered directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Initially I tried this torture device and it was completely unbearable.</li>
            <li> I tried recently the smaller head for smaller regions and it works very well</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough to fret about, and plenty to remind me that I&#x27;m getting old.  </li>
            <li> And the first time using it was.... not fun.</li>
            <li> My upper lip is so sensitive - I would rather rip a strip of wax off all at once.</li>
            <li> and the hair grows back soft instead of prickly.</li>
            <li> , I thought I did something wrong to have, honestly about 50 plus</li>
            <li> In terms of sensation, it felt like I was being mini-pinched multiple times simultaneously, which wasn&#x27;t really super unpleasant like most people make it out to be.</li>
            <li> Since it was no longer possible to find replacements for the 24K gold blades I decided to buy a new one - I will NEVER go back to shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is painful in certain places, but, to be honest with you, it doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than getting a tattoo, with the same most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of little white fine hairs that could get long at times</li>
            <li> but it certainly did not hurt the way other epilators or waxing processes have.</li>
            <li> I think in a few months, I will have to touch up even less and have better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am hair free for two weeks if not more!</li>
            <li> This makes most other hair removal methods difficult to use and limits their success.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the little plastic \\&quot;prong\\&quot; thing really does anything to reduce pain, but I guess I should also consider the fact that I don&#x27;t really feel any pain anymore when epilating, because I have been doing it for so long.    </li>
            <li> I normally shave my legs every single day and have stubble within 8 hours.</li>
            <li> But it seems to spin faster than other models I&#x27;ve used which could be why I don&#x27;t feel as much.</li>
            <li> But it seems to spin faster than other models I&#x27;ve used which could be why I don&#x27;t feel as much.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on that one I am glad I bought this one because this one is more efficient and less painful.</li>
            <li> I used the facial attachment to rid of my fuzzy upper lip, and although it got some adjusting to the slight pain, it was well worth it for I saved $5</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my upper lip so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does hurt a little at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> So of course, like other users, at first I noticed my hairs were not growing back well enough, they would be under the skin</li>
            <li> It stings a little bit when  you first use it.  </li>
            <li> At first I felt a little pain</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but nowhere near as loud as a hair dryer.    </li>
            <li> a lot cheaper in the long run compared to professional waxing assuming the product is durable and won&#x27;t break before the warranty date expiration.</li>
            <li> Just be careful of where you use this thing because I used it on my whole arm and ended up with a rash on my inner elbows and ingrown hairs, following.  </li>
            <li> the tingling soreness and red spots have the night to vanish before you bare your legs (or</li>
            <li> I expected a rash or something (which once again I was willing to deal with to not have to shave for such a long period of time).</li>
            <li> The first few times I turned it on it</li>
            <li> I certainly have one less thing to bother me.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry for a couple of minutes, put it back together and turn it on high to get it a bit dryer then leave it for about 30 minutes before you plug it back in.</li>
            <li> It really cuts down on the frequency of shaving (which I still need to do for knees and bikini line).</li>
            <li> After using this one time I didn&#x27;t really see regrowth for almost a week, and the regrowth that did appear was much thinner and less dark.  </li>
            <li> Paid twice as much for my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reason for the four stars is that the tweezer &amp;#34;passage&amp;#34; on the bigger head (meant for the body) is not wide enough.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a little topical steroid like hydrocortisone on your face or the first time on your legs since a lot of hair removed at once is likely to cause inflammation.</li>
            <li> I still use the razor in between but am using it far less frequently.</li>
            <li> My legs don&#x27;t grow in super thick but the hair is coarse.</li>
            <li> As far as pain goes, you will feel as though many pins and needles are pricking you but you become numb to it after the first few minutes.</li>
            <li> Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]] was much</li>
            <li> Shaving long hairs like on the arms for the first time can help too, so that the epilator is less likely to break the hair and instead rip it from the root like its supposed to.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know the battery is dying when the head rotates slowly and the sound isn&#x27;t as loud as previous times.</li>
            <li> You have to be sure and hold skin tight and go in slow circles.</li>
            <li> It will sting a little, However, the hair grows back MUCH slower than shaving, and I have noticed over time that it is growing back</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had shaved fairly recently so the hair was at the recommended length for epilation, and it did work well and with less pain than I had expected, but it took about an hour.  </li>
            <li> at the bottom of your leg, go in very small circles while slowly moving up your leg to ensure you are catching the hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time getting the other epilator that I own to go over my knees.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and the first time was a bit tough, but wow, how this has reduced the shaving hassle in my life.  </li>
            <li> The epilator hurts considerably the first time you use it - imagine getting waxed but with smaller sections and very slowly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for my face, but have also used it on my legs and a *little</li>
            <li> I am counting on this area to have less and less hair each time, so felt it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Legs work well too - all over with large head, but small head works well in areas as next to the bone where there are indentations.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine using this on a bikini line or other sensitive area of the body.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work effectively and it was expensive!</li>
            <li> As someone with fast-growing hair and sensitive skin, daily shaving in the summer is no fun.</li>
            <li> Loud - not sure if all epilators are loud but it suppress music on my phone&lt;</li>
            <li> The battery is pretty much a non issue now and a useless feature, since I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in to charge-</li>
            <li> The battery is pretty much a non issue now and a useless feature, since I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in to charge-</li>
            <li> but I usually use it plugged in the cords pretty long.</li>
            <li> I use it unplugged and don&#x27;t need it often enough to know how long it actually takes to charge.</li>
            <li> so it would be long enough for the tiny tweezers to pick up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the epilator for a few months, and now I mainly use it for my legs.</li>
            <li> I used both the small and large attachment, it took a lot of passes and did pinch the skin every so often.  </li>
            <li> I only knocked it down one star because its quite loud.</li>
            <li> I have a few chin hairs and was very self conscious about it and used a little razor to remove them</li>
            <li> I figure that&#x27;s long enough</li>
            <li> I used it on my armpits and the hair took a long time to grow back</li>
            <li> The chord was long enough, had no issues with charging or power.</li>
            <li> After using it awhile those hairs take about five days to come in before they are long enough to epilate.</li>
            <li> The results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t even stayed red for too long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the hairs that grow flat either, even when I hold the skin taut, and the bonus attachment does nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I know you can plug it in and charge the battery, but it won&#x27;t stay charged long enough to do my legs.  </li>
            <li> Works with long hair or short hair well.</li>
            <li> And no it does not work well with long facial hair even if it is course.</li>
            <li> and one is short, one is long.</li>
            <li> after long time of searching, finally I bought this product</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and they produced a long lasting one 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have small hair length you are better off purchasing something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on legs, under arms harder to do, some pain on face but not near as bad as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to other women who are noticing changes due to lower estrogen</li>
            <li> The Remington EP6025 doesn&#x27;t always get every single fine white hair, but I usually epilate again in a few days and its gone!</li>
            <li> but I ruined the packaging trying to open it and have now used it 5 times thinking I was just pressing it too hard, not charging long enough, charging it too long, or using too much soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you know, it was very painful the first few times I went over an area, but I&#x27;m actually removing hair and it stays away for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> When you pull hair out by the root you get skin with it, whether it&#x27;s microscopic dry skin or the root itself, it sticks to the tweezers which keeps them from closing properly and pulling the hairs out efficiently.</li>
            <li> But, like I said my hair grows back fast and thick when i shave...</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long enough to do both legs at a reasonable pace - at least an hour.</li>
            <li> I researched and read just about every review on this site for every epilator that got an average four stars, and then went to the store with the big red bull&#x27;s eye and bought this one (for about the same price listed here).    </li>
            <li> It also helps to use the smaller head for sensitive areas because it only pulls out a small number of hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently I need extreme exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> If you use it any other way you will feel that it takes forever and barely grabs any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the owner of numerous epilators over the past 2 decades or so, the discomfort of this hair removal method isn&#x27;t new to me.  </li>
            <li> This is also wayyy less messy than sugar waxing, although way less fun!   </li>
            <li> There is much less redness on the face when compared to waxing, plus there is no mess.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it wouldn&#x27;t pull out or even grab the fine leg hair that I have.  </li>
            <li> Not going to lie, this hurts BAD the first few times you use it, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I did have a little redness after use, but I have sensitive skin and am not surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have never done waxing or anything, I have always just shaved, but that really was hard on my skin</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the crappy drawstring bag that doesn&#x27;t hold everything and the lack of a straight head...</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the crappy drawstring bag that doesn&#x27;t hold everything and the lack of a straight head...</li>
            <li> Ok so Ive always been afraid of pain</li>
            <li> and I physically cannot handle the pain beyond the dark course hairs at the corner of my mouth on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I recommend trimming hairs that have gotten way too long to reduce pain, either with scissors or a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Now I feel I should have bought it long time ago.</li>
            <li> this is also a cheaper option in the long run.     </li>
            <li> I have been a long time epilator user and prefer it over shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was about 6 inches long and 3 inches</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and recharges well.  </li>
            <li> Since it takes so long to epilate</li>
            <li> I have used them as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> but I just learned about it not too long ago.  </li>
            <li> (i alternate with shaving), even bald in the center area.  </li>
            <li> Had this product for a long time and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet, that alone impessed me.</li>
            <li> The reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star review is because my lower legs are never completely smooth-always rough or feel hairs coming in that are too short to epilate.</li>
            <li> Its a bit like welding or getting a tatoo, start with a small area and slowly work your way on to fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I had trouble figuring out how to turn on the epilator at first and thought it was dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t pull thick hair all that well, and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I read all the tricks in the reviews for making it hurt less but all I did the first time was shave in the morning as usual</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have to epilate again for another week and this time there was less hair and not as coarse, it took only five minutes per leg.</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over the same spot 10-15 time to get it to work, which left my skin red and raw.</li>
            <li> But for a woman who&#x27;s had PCOS for such a long time and having to shave my face every day or every other day...this is a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> as long as I exfoliate daily, I haven&#x27;t seen any nightmarish ingrown hairs as described by some people reviewing other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little thing, it does exactly what I need it to do, remove hair, being a brunette, I hate being a hairy woman, I use this on my legs, arm pits,</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it was pretty painful, but after a few times it&#x27;s completely tolerable.</li>
            <li> Very precise and far less painful</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt, just a few little stings at times.  </li>
            <li> Definitely give it a try, beats shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> A little discomfort, but it&#x27;s worth it for the slow growth of the hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it is winter and my skin is too dry??</li>
            <li> My Braun may well clear more hair per swipe, but for me that doesn&#x27;t compare with how much less painful this one is.  </li>
            <li> Even with me barely touching the device to my skin (since it grabs onto the hairs before the device actually touches skin) is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is that there are no directions for using it wet, although I read somewhere you could use this wet...</li>
            <li> The most painful areas were my chest with its coarse thick hair and my back and shoulders near my neck</li>
            <li> it only makes sense to do this because feeling a few  hairs  pull out is very different from feeling 42 at once.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit loud.</li>
            <li> The first time using it, is a little uncomfortable, but nothing like the older ones.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never gotten a bikini wax before, I would recommend going that route first, as I think it would be tough to use this on hair that&#x27;s never been removed before.</li>
            <li> I did briefly try it on my chin because I had just noticed a very long course dark hair there</li>
            <li> The first use is a little painful but after that not bad.</li>
            <li> And yes, if you have pale, sensitive skin like me, you&#x27;ll get lots of little red dots all over your legs from where the device yanked out the hairs, so don&#x27;t plan a trip to the pool as soon as you finish.</li>
            <li> At the same time, it was satisfying knowing those stupid hairs would have a heck of a time growing back if I had anything to do with</li>
            <li> I have very coarse dark hair</li>
            <li> Back in the dark ages I owned an Epi-Lady.  </li>
            <li> Some background before I get too far into the review: I have never used an epilator, but I do shave and I have waxed in the past.</li>
            <li> i was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t really painful at all, at first it will be like a prick but after moving it along and getting used to it, u barely can&#x27;t feel the pain anymore..</li>
            <li> If you have more coarser hair, then I would assume that it would be more painful and hard to tolerate, but that&#x27;s why you take painkillers at least half an hour before using the epilator</li>
            <li> And plus, the fine hairs are so thin and small that I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> For me my bikini area especially was inflamed but the redness and swelling went down in hours.</li>
            <li> And.... if you use Olay Total Effects Age Defying Wet Cleansing Cloths after, within an hour the pain &amp; redness are gone!!</li>
            <li> least favorite thing is the pain while using the product and the wealts left behind (they go away after a few hours)</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it was terribly painful on my legs and took every bit of 20mins per leg to get most of the hair off, which began returning 3 days later.</li>
            <li> It does the job - just as painful as any other epilator I have used; takes a while to get all the hairs (probably more like two tries on subsequent days and regular use) - just as efficient as any other epilator I have used and as usual it helps to electric/razor shave a few days before and then use on shorter stubbly hair right after the shower; it also does not sound like my husbands drill (though it could be quieter).</li>
            <li> I did notice some days later that the leg I did was not growing hair back like usual.</li>
            <li> After a couple of times waxing, getting waxed hurts signifigantly less, and the same goes for epilators.  </li>
            <li> I started exfoliating, and the next time I used it I had a lot less irritation (although I did still have some).  </li>
            <li> But I did several times (with some painkillers half an hour before the procedure)</li>
            <li> I am half italian with well rooted hair, and lots of it.</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry.</li>
            <li> (Hurts less that way) because if you wait for it to grow back it will hurt again.</li>
            <li> I get red spots all over my legs for about half a day but they heal and go away.  </li>
            <li> And I refuse to use depilitory creams on my upper lip because last time I had horrible white bumps all on my upper lip wherever I applied the cream and those bumps lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> That I found strange and kind of annoying but itcleared the peach fuzz no prob when I did</li>
            <li> I read through everything again, went over when to use the 2 different speeds, hold skin tight, move it this way or that, etc.</li>
            <li> How could different epilators be any more or less painful?  </li>
            <li> (these obnoxious little hairs grow at different rates...)</li>
            <li> (these obnoxious little hairs grow at different rates...)</li>
            <li> On my skin personally it made me break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt almost at all -- just a little pinch now and then, but this epilator got done in about ten minutes what would&#x27;ve taken me an hour to do with tweezers.</li>
            <li> and although it works well I did break out in these tiny little pimples everywhere that I used it.</li>
            <li> So I decided waxing was a way better choice, yes painful, but epilators were way more painful according to my mom.  </li>
            <li> Most painful experience of my life.</li>
            <li> all the rest I really do not need</li>
            <li> finally after a few weeks (between 3 and 4)</li>
            <li> I expected something that felt like it wouldn&#x27;t fall apart on</li>
            <li> it hurt, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Also the rotating tweezers of the head may pinch a labia and get jammed.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks, so I will upgrade to 5</li>
            <li> Using it wet with soap is pain-free.</li>
            <li> My hair used to grow in stubbly within 24 hours so shaving felt like a total waste.</li>
            <li> I got a few ingrowns hair but with regular exfoliation it wasnt a problem.</li>
            <li> All I can say is the pain really is no biggy (</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO \\&quot;moisture technology\\&quot; in this product.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching brands, models, features, etc.  </li>
            <li> Now I can epilate with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> The pain factor is minimal.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t use it wet?</li>
            <li> I spent hours trying to get rid of them all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not precise enough for eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I do not see any blood on my lip and minimal redness compared to the redness that happens when I wax.</li>
            <li> ; epilator atachment is not much use it just gave me a friction burn</li>
            <li> 3days later Hair grew back thick like shaving.</li>
            <li> There are times when I just sit down and push through, and times when I work in small patches and come back later.</li>
            <li> I will say that the small black ones have to be grown out a little before the epilator will grab them, so I do still pluck a little but not near as much.  </li>
            <li> Well it does work, but I do find it more painful than any other method.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and tend to put it off as long as possible, now I am super pumped to have no prickly underarm stubble!</li>
            <li> but it will gradually loose steam which you won&#x27;t notice, and the whole process is SO MUCH faster and less painful when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would last a little bit longer before getting thick, which is why it&#x27;s not 5 stars, but people say the longer you epilate the less frequently</li>
            <li> The initial \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; of this gets less and less each time I use it.</li>
            <li> While less painful then other epilators I&#x27;ve owned, it is also way less effective.</li>
            <li> But it works extremely well on wet body parts.</li>
            <li> I was unable to have smooth armpits prior to buying this epilator because shaving led to horrible ingrown hairs, raw skin, and those dark roots right under the surface of my skin, even right after shaving.  </li>
            <li> This differs from a number of trimmers/shavers I have owned in the past that can only function when the battery is charged (and must be placed in a &amp;#34;charging station&amp;#34; to recharge,) leaving you a partially hairy monster if you don&#x27;t finish the job before the battery</li>
            <li> I let grow long and ugly until i can scratch them free.  </li>
            <li> It gives a slight stinging on the face when removing hairs and hurts a little when trying to remove the hairs on the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little too long.</li>
            <li> However, it gets less painful the more you use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the whole pain thing was not anywhere near as bad as I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a week, now, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt now like it did a week ago, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on underarms and chin, and using the small attachment for upper lip.</li>
            <li> Because of the contour of the head, this epilator is specifically designed for legs, even though it says it&#x27;s for other areas as well.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today on my belly and armpits and needless to say I&#x27;m amazed.  </li>
            <li> My charger went up, entirely due to my fault.</li>
            <li> I only bought Epilady&#x27;s for the past 30 or so years.  </li>
            <li> but I obviously expected a lot of pain!</li>
            <li> It works, but not as well as other epilators.  </li>
            <li> great!t only pulls out a small number of hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> any other method of hair removal from the root.</li>
            <li> I have been working on my legs section by section about every other day.</li>
            <li> Every other day if needed.</li>
            <li> No more slathering lotions and creams constantly or buying expesive razors and shaving creams.</li>
            <li> When they do come, not nearly as many as shaving, and they come before any hair grows back</li>
            <li> not sure I would use this product again unless I knew next time they wouldn&#x27;t be ingrown....</li>
            <li> something that never occurred with my other epilator.</li>
            <li> I have done the waxing, sugaring and had other epilators, so I have had experience with the pain you can experience from this way of hair removal.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was the storage bag is too small.</li>
            <li> (Shaving on the other hand does)</li>
            <li> i work my way up in the opposite direction the hair grows, in areas where the hair seems to grow in ALL directions i use small circular motions.</li>
            <li> (looks like a coil with two little handles), and that was more painful around the lips.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more painful but bearable and the hair growth stays away even longer.</li>
            <li> It can be used in the bikini area if you are very careful and have it on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Tweeze Tweezer by Emjoi which has far less tweezers and is used for very small areas.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I could hardly feel it!</li>
            <li> I have to go over an area several times, but to avoid just cutting the hair off ,i.e. shaving,I really like this as an alternative.</li>
            <li> I tried electric razors, I tried multi blade razors they all left stubble behind and the very next day it was as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all.</li>
            <li> I got very nauseated when I used it the first time, but that has gone away now.  </li>
            <li> Overall.. if you&#x27;re looking to try epilating without breaking the bank because you&#x27;re not sure if you&#x27;ll love it or hate it, like I was, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> courser hairs do not hurt nearly as bad as the fine ones.</li>
            <li> For sensitive areas I would prefer a slower, less scary, speed.&lt;br /&gt;The curve of the top makes it very difficult to get under your arms.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little noisier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> You have to press in on the little button in the center of the speed button to unlock the button so that it can be moved from the lock/off position.</li>
            <li> Instead of wires yanking on hair, it had a perforated rubber posts that were less painful against the skin and cleaning was easy with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s done charging.</li>
            <li> The first use was a little uncomfortable</li>
            <li> The hair has been growing back very slowly, but I still don&#x27;t think it is a time saver considering how long it takes to epilate.  </li>
            <li> I first tried an epilator several years ago, and it was so painful, I gave up.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have, is there are ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt much - don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought for my birthday if it would be to painful, but no more pain than plucking your eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> Going further up into the finer dark hairs on my upper lip is far too painful as of 4am today.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s cheaper than the better ones, it&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> It slides slides up and down</li>
            <li> I decided to take a break from using it down there so that my skin could recover from the  pinches and clogged pores that resulted from using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can now remove hair in bed laying down or have my husband epilate for me</li>
            <li> This product does not work properly and not satisfied with it at all!</li>
            <li> shave/electric shave every other day!  </li>
            <li> But each of the times I&#x27;ve used it after that first time has been less and less painful (hairs don&#x27;t grow at the same rate, plus the skin adapts).</li>
            <li> Well, take 2 Naproxen, pat your underarms dry, no deodorant, and no more than 2 days of growth, and then grit your teeth.   </li>
            <li> I actually was afraid to put it near my skin!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurts but it does feel a little unpleasant on the back of my legs and thighs but not so much as to make me stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I like having to go in circles a couple times so that I would feel less going on down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lower leg hair is dark and thick and it is more painful there.</li>
            <li> A few other comments I&#x27;d like to make:    </li>
            <li> For my friend, who has lost some weight in the past and had loose skin on her armpits, it pinched her pits every time.</li>
            <li> My previous epi I bought in Spain.</li>
            <li> so it takes less time to do the desired epilating.</li>
            <li> For me, those dots fade in less than 24 hours.    </li>
            <li> in turn, I experience less razor burn and smoother</li>
            <li> and I have noticed much less pain with this model.</li>
            <li> every time after is easier since there is less hair.  </li>
            <li> The underarm area hurts way less than the legs.</li>
            <li> so I spend less money on getting my face &amp; eyebrows threaded and my legs waxed.  </li>
            <li> but it is a lot less than the one I had before.</li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t do it with my previous one because it would hurt me a lot).</li>
            <li> supposedly being \\&quot;less painful\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Less pain, less time,</li>
            <li> and it hurts 70% less.  </li>
            <li> The hairs are about half the thickness they were after doing this for 6 months</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use deoderant for like half day until after you epilated your underarms or it will hurt like hell</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts a bit but each time i use it, it hurts less.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s not as noisy as the previous epilator I had.</li>
            <li> The hair is still growing but there&#x27;s noticeably less.</li>
            <li> I tend to get ingrown hairs, and from what I can tell, I&#x27;ve been getting less using the Remington than when I was using Nad&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The faster it spins the less</li>
            <li> It pinches slightly</li>
            <li> though I had trouble with my legs, I would still recommend getting an epilator, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the higher speed would have been less painful on my upper lip?</li>
            <li> And if you use it too slow and take too long to remove hair, you&#x27;re gonna drain the battery.</li>
            <li> and I was plagued with fear about using it the other way because of the review of this poor lady, who did it the same way and her skin got caught in it.</li>
            <li> The epilator removed all the hair including the stubble left behind by other products I consider to be inferior.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out, but if you don&#x27;t pull your skin tight, it might snap the hair at the shaft instead of pulling it out at the root...causing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of the expense of shaving, check out dollar shave club - because the blades are so  affordable and they ship straight to my house, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a blade until it&#x27;s completely dull and rubbing my skin raw -</li>
            <li> because you can do it at your convenience, there is little mess, and the hair does not have to be that</li>
            <li> The blonde hair is just hard to see but of course is still felt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried creams that smell and sting only to leave behind dark roots</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I knew I got all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust that it will get much easier to use, now that I&#x27;m through the first, and worst, session.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I knew I got all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust that it will get much easier to use, now that I&#x27;m through the first, and worst, session.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to select it because the price was less than a few others.  </li>
            <li> I was a little..</li>
            <li> I found it reassuring that the working end of the machine has little rubber (?</li>
            <li> bought this product to take away little hairs growing under my chin.  </li>
            <li> that being said, here are some observations after owning the device for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my husband (I made him try the other epilators in the past)</li>
            <li> I have a little redness afterwards but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I have a little redness afterwards but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little bit after using this.</li>
            <li> With the Braun, I would have to take little breaks throughout the session because of the pain; I don&#x27;t have to do that with this one.  </li>
            <li> I could probably use a little touch up on the mustache area and will do that today.  </li>
            <li> After a week my legs felt a little sticky</li>
            <li> I was a little peeved to find a cheaper epilator at my corner drugstore.</li>
            <li> and it didnt hurt at all just little stings</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get used to &amp;</li>
            <li> but it did make the task a little easier.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this little machine works</li>
            <li> Hair is easier to grab when it is a little longer</li>
            <li> The little massagers that it has probably helps..</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 out of 5 stars only because the battery life is kinda weak.</li>
            <li> Typically, I would have to shave at least every other day.</li>
            <li> It hurt like crazy and left my skin red and covered in bumps.  </li>
            <li> While initially painful, it&#x27;s definitely worth the week+ of not having to worry about stubble on your legs.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this epilator, and while it hurts like blazes, it keeps hair away for weeks (vs a few days with shaving), thins out hair over time, is faster than plucking and easier than self-wax kits.</li>
            <li> and I used it for few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before, but decided to try it because I was tired of shaving my bikini area and having my skin get irritated just to have the hair grow back in about a day.  </li>
            <li> Packaging, not going to waste time with that.</li>
            <li> did get quite a few ingrown hairs on my legs, even with brushing the bejeezus out of them with a shower brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li> did get quite a few ingrown hairs on my legs, even with brushing the bejeezus out of them with a shower brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and plus it&#x27;s a messy job.</li>
            <li> it did not stop running every few minutes</li>
            <li> It takes a few days.</li>
            <li> Takes a few hours to fully charge, but I&#x27;m not too worried about that.</li>
            <li> Its not extremely comfortable, but not overly so.</li>
            <li> I will admit that it hurts, but the degree of pain does begin to diminish after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> When you press this epilator too firmly against your skin, the tweezers stop rotating.</li>
            <li> Because of the way the curved head is designed, it is difficult to get some hairs and takes way longer than my old epilator did.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it took me at least 20 minutes of running the epilator over my lip area with no real results.</li>
            <li> Knees are particularly difficult with this type of tool, given the natural contours.</li>
            <li> I advise not to waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun SE 5180 Silk for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not brave enough to try underarms or bikini areas.</li>
            <li> I have used it once so far, but was unable to finish using it.</li>
            <li> Just every few days</li>
            <li> It took a few uses to get use to it</li>
            <li> I never thought that was possible since I have some thick thick hair</li>
            <li> It is not extremely powerful and the angle it&#x27;s used on the legs tends to engage it&#x27;s auto safety to slow it down.</li>
            <li> I was unable to do my second leg because of the extreme hurt.</li>
            <li> I still have to vigorously exfoliate lest I allow all the ingrown hairs to drive me itching mad, and my skin is still on the cusp of bruising and having tiny red dots at the follicles all over for one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hate how my armpits look, which is why I was excited for the Remington.</li>
            <li> It helps to have your skin pulled tight and do small sections at a time...</li>
            <li> I get a few dark thick ones on my chin as well.</li>
            <li> The directions that came with it said to move it in small circles, and if possible, it hurts worse then just using it upwards like you are shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> If you take it little by little, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Years of shaving has made my leg hair very dark, course and thick but it has become less so after I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> and I found this epilator to be MUCH cleaner, easier to use, and less painful.</li>
            <li> Painful at first.  </li>
            <li> It is at first a bit painful of course</li>
            <li> My first time was so painful, I was screaming.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on hair approximately 1/4 inch long and it still doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> so i was very skeptical about spending too much in case</li>
            <li> I have moderately dark, moderately thick body hair.</li>
            <li> The hair growth did slow down to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> But all in all it&#x27;s not very effective at pulling all the hairs out.</li>
            <li> I got my first-ever brazilian a month ago, and since then I&#x27;ve been driving myself crazy with tweezing and at-home waxing kits to keep up with new growth.</li>
            <li> I have always shaved before, I went and got waxed once, and that was painful, and it grew back two weeks later.  </li>
            <li> It does smart a bit using it on underarms, but not as bad as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It should take very little time to use, but not when you have to turn it on and off over and over again.</li>
            <li> She said it hurt very little</li>
            <li> it seems to be slightly louder than an electronic toothbrush), and comes with a silky silver bag and very small cleaning brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator is meant to slow down if pressed too hard against the skin and that&#x27;s what it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really efficient, almost painful for non-begginers and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I really can not understand how people say these things are not that painful.</li>
            <li> I use the small attachment for my mini-stache.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if there are ingrown hairs or what,</li>
            <li> remember growing up my mom always told me that epilators were small torture devices and to never use one,</li>
            <li> so I usually just leave it plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I will upgrade to a better/more expensive model later...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned epilators in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also waxed in the past, so my leg hairs are used to being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> When I bought it, it was no more than $70.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> So, I usually just charge mine overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT SURE</li>
            <li> I usually use this on my legs every couple of months, shaving in between if I must--</li>
            <li> I usually use this on my legs every couple of months, shaving in between if I must--</li>
            <li> I continued to use circular motions and did one small section at a time.</li>
            <li> On my bikini area, I take my time doing small sections...and even take breaks or switch sides if I need to.</li>
            <li> On my bikini area, I take my time doing small sections...and even take breaks or switch sides if I need to.</li>
            <li> After finally giving up on any chance to replace my Phillips Satinelle Ice with the same product, I purchased 2 or 3 epilators which I was extremely disappointed with.</li>
            <li> It was awful to look in the mirror and actually be able to see it, even though my eyesight is also going.  </li>
            <li> And my lady sideburns are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> Again, you should do a small area at a time, then move on to another area.  </li>
            <li> so if you are a small person</li>
            <li> no more ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was pretty wary of using it after that, but I tried it out anyways.</li>
            <li> So yeah I will need to trim those horrible hairs prior to epilating them the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will attempt to do my legs with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators combined with waxing for the past 15 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator is by far easier to use and less painful.  </li>
            <li> , if I use some baby powder, it makes the process far less painful.  </li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;ve heard of how painful and uncomfortable this little thing is, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t have the nerve to try this on my upper lip, I am afraid I might get ingrown hairs or red spots (your upper lip would be a *really* bad place to get an ingrown hair...).    </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hurt like crazy because only a small area is being worked on at a time.</li>
            <li> I still cannot use this in very sensitive places like my face and armpits as it is quite painful</li>
            <li> and what do you know, it hardly hurt at all!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And also, it feels dull already.</li>
            <li> and I even got rid of the seemingly hard to get hairs as the unit approached hole number 2.</li>
            <li> I know it has a safety feature that turns it off if you press too hard, but this almost seems positional.</li>
            <li> The rounded shape makes it hard to maneuver over the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how, couldn&#x27;t begin to explain it, can hardly believe it, but wanted to let others know my experience.  </li>
            <li> The head is curved and that&#x27;s why is hard to do in some of the body part.</li>
            <li> That was a mistake, this removes hardly any hair when doing one circle.</li>
            <li> stupid lights that do absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> It really sucks</li>
            <li> I tried an Epilady once back in the early 90s and determined it was an especially cruel form of torture invented by men who didn&#x27;t like women.</li>
            <li> i had to spend at least 45 mins doing my legs.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid of this thing it took me months to actually use it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair everywhere</li>
            <li> I thick the remington was breaking my hairs.</li>
            <li> but im slowly getting used to it.</li>
            <li> , I held my skin taught, and I used slow circular motions against the growth direction.</li>
            <li> She likes it for her underarms but too slow for the legs...</li>
            <li> A real piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, she&#x27;s used it several times or so and finds it very painful.</li>
            <li> I go over my legs ever two or three days and pick up random little hairs here and there, so very little pain.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I let the hair grow too long, I don&#x27;t know, but it was very very painful and left a huge rash of ingrown hairs which was absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to use this on my legs!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this but was equally disgusted when I saw the hairs stuck in the tweezer head.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing horrific and numerous ingrown hairs on my legs, which had never happened to me before - the finer hairs were apparently just breaking off under the skin rather than being removed at the root.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful, but that&#x27;s what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This might be why it was less painful than other</li>
            <li> I seriously wish I had this 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> But it seriously hurts to use.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful for this epilator and wanted to try it when my emjoi epilator quit since these are less expensive.</li>
            <li> (seriously, what the hell?</li>
            <li> Got it out and charged it for 16 hours, took a very hot bath and steeled myself for the worst....</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little uncomfortable as the hairs are remove.</li>
            <li> The button on the device is a little weird.</li>
            <li> There are always bumps and stubble&#x27;s now o_O :(  </li>
            <li> NOT a good look for a lady.</li>
            <li> My expectation was it will be really painful, so when I tried the facial attachment, it was tolerable.</li>
            <li> no GOOD</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think using the epilator is painful at all, especially if you have ever done waxing.  </li>
            <li> It also gets those stupid little hairs that appear under the chin after that\\&quot;certain birthday and are impossible to see to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll hardly see it!  </li>
            <li> there is hardly any pain anymore!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;There is excessive packaging, which doesn&#x27;t make the product bad, but I would hope Remington changes it to be a bit less wasteful.</li>
            <li> On the lower legs, it wasnt bad at all, as long as I kept the skin TAUGHT.</li>
            <li> As long as I pull the skin taught it&#x27;s not so painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definately not for the weak</li>
            <li> oh geez.. at LEAST an hour!</li>
            <li> If i charge it all night, I get one leg done and it starts to get weak.</li>
            <li> is kinda weak.</li>
            <li> If i charge it all night, I get one leg done and it starts to get weak.</li>
            <li> Having tried EVERYTHING else (Nair, laser hair removal, waxing both hot and cold, Nads, that sandpaper as seen on TV thing, that dumb worthless &amp;#34;radio signal&amp;#34; permanent remover, and shaving)</li>
            <li> (waxing is too messy and/or expensive, and shaving is too temporary), but hair removal is too complicated a beast to conquer with this</li>
            <li> Not Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I was tired of shaving every day, and still seeing stubble, and want smoother legs and underarms for summer dresses, shorts, and swimsuit.    </li>
            <li> After getting tired of the hassle of shaving I began researching the alternatives.  </li>
            <li> But alas, I did not use baby powder with the Remington</li>
            <li> the epilator really does is yank on your hair and then either break it off at the skin, or leave it there, ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful, awful product!  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all on my legs even behind my knees.     </li>
            <li> I get hair on my face, around my cheeks and stuff, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for hair removal since shaving would make it worse.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s still worse than you can imagine</li>
            <li> My husband says I am addicted to it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am addicted to being hair free!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I could no longer tuck that hair neatly behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I am tired of wasting money on razors.</li>
            <li> and once you start going inward it hurts worse and worse but</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned this being painful, so I purchased numbing cream.  </li>
            <li> Be warned, some areas don&#x27;t feel painful at all, but there were other areas where I needed to stop and rest for a bit because of the level of pain involved.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts to pull out hair, but it is not as painful as other methods and the pain lessens over time.</li>
            <li> The pain was ridiculous!</li>
            <li> pain was the worst the first time and has just been slightly uncomfortable since.</li>
            <li> Mainly I drop one star because of the horrible pain factor.</li>
            <li> Braun, Philips, panasonic, crazy pain in the back of my legs, impossible armpits, forbidden brazillians, ingrown hairs from hell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have ugly, dark hair that you want gone, give this a try</li>
            <li> If you have ugly, dark hair that you want gone, give this a try</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve done sugar waxing (like I have), epilating with this machine is less painful than that.</li>
            <li> And, worst of all, my lady sideburns which never caused me problems began to be very noticeable and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> It is a little painful</li>
            <li> and I am not dainty person, but</li>
            <li> It is hard to get all the hair on my arms and impossible to remove any from my shoulders.</li>
            <li> To me it is rather expensive also.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended you do this mid-cycle of your monthly visited friend for the least painful experience.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is just so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy an expensive waxing treatment again as this pays for itself in one use.</li>
            <li> It took a while to remove the hairs because I kept holding it wrong.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera tip is useless (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Fails 5 star because I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t work as well on my face; it grabs the hair ineffectively (although I could be doing it wrong).</li>
            <li> That is blatant false advertising!</li>
            <li> the curved head makes going in some places difficult.</li>
            <li> the curved head makes going in some places difficult.</li>
            <li> It also failed to pick up some finer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the epilator causes bumps on my face a day or two after use.</li>
            <li> Not great for bikini line or armpits in my experience- too painful and irritating.</li>
            <li> To help heal the skin afterwards, I don&#x27;t both with expensive products.  </li>
            <li> .. weird).</li>
            <li> so i didnt even start waxing until september of 2012 ,but its so expensive</li>
            <li> That said there is a bit of an art to using this scary thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-cordless mode is about useless</li>
            <li> but it hurts, its expensive and I needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical to use it on my face again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me or made me uncomfortable in any way.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m here to tell you that this epilator is SO MUCH less painful to use than my Braun ever was!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this painful, or just a little painful, but nothing unbearable.  </li>
            <li> The initial epilation was painful, armpits being the worst.  </li>
            <li> Was very painful and inconvenient to use this, just used it once, what a waste.</li>
            <li> and I was always afraid of pinching my skin.</li>
            <li> I was distraught, to put it mildly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> feels like it was cutting the hair instead of pulling from the root.</li>
            <li> After about two minutes my leg became numb to the pain</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> but if you give it a chance, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> The pain was not as bad as I remembered from when I had one of these almost 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 children, so how bad could it be?  </li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t even that bad because you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> Epilators get a bad rap I think.</li>
            <li> not so bad.</li>
            <li> Using it on my legs didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs and it hurt badly, but didn&#x27;t seem to remove any noticeable hair.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> I thought it would hurt too bad</li>
            <li> #34;the pain&amp;#34;, but after about the 3-4 time using it the pain wasn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> TOO BAD</li>
            <li> OTHERWISE, I WOULD NOT BE WRITING THIS BAD REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> but I was relieved that is wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> It was too painful for me to do underarms</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t painful (and I didn&#x27;t need the cream).  </li>
            <li> Yes, waxing can be painful...</li>
            <li> It was painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful on the underarms but nothing too unbearable (pain is beauty after all).  </li>
            <li> Painful as heck,</li>
            <li> Not as painful as I imagined</li>
            <li> I could feel the hair coming out, but would not describe it as at all discomforting or painful.  </li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t use it at all because it&#x27;s just too painful</li>
            <li> Painful</li>
            <li> Not too painful at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who does not like shaving, But its a bit painful.</li>
            <li> If you are sick of being chained to a razor, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this because I am totaly sick of shaving.</li>
            <li> you are sick of shaving-try an epilator.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was a little nervous but this works great. Removes the hair. It is easy to operate and I like the fact you can use it plugged in or cordless. I also like the attachment for facial hair. That works well too and is easy to change out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model epilator for over a year and overall I&#x27;m pleased with it. I use it for legs and face. It was too painful for me to do underarms but it did work well there the times I used it. I used it on my bikini area but wouldn&#x27;t dare delve any further. Thighs are not painful at all to me as the hair is fine. My lower leg hair is dark and thick and it is more painful there. It does get a lot of hair out-I&#x27;ve found if you go slowly in small circles it works best. I use the small attachment for my mini-stache. It works well and I&#x27;ve saved a fortune doing this myself rather than going to the salon. I don&#x27;t get bumps either. I do, however, have a good number of ingrown hairs on my legs. The reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star review is because my lower legs are never completely smooth-always rough or feel hairs coming in that are too short to epilate. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This epilator does what it is supposed to do, it pulls out the hair and leaves it smooth for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: more ingrown hairs, leaves red bumps afterwards, HURTS the first couple of times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everyone has different skin so it might work better for someone else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many epilady shavers, and so far, this one is my favorite. It works the best at removing hair with the least amount of times going over and over the same spot.  Also, it&#x27;s at a much better price than most. I&#x27;ve had it a few months now, and it works great. I got one for my daughter, and she agrees too that it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator at target about 6 years ago for $85 it still works fine but I&#x27;m looking for a new one so my Daughter can have the old one because every time I need to use it, it&#x27;s not in my bathroom;  but $300!!! Really!!!?&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars because it works great but I&#x27;ll give it 4 because the price is outrages!!</li>
            <li> I was unable to do my second leg because of the extreme hurt. I did notice some days later that the leg I did was not growing hair back like usual. It is a good product and does what it says IF you can tolerate the pain. Perhaps doing a patch at one time....Then go back the next day or so. To me it is rather expensive also.</li>
            <li> I was a little.. ok very keptical... but I love this product!! It really works!! I will not give it up!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, one of the best buys! It works just as advertised!! I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The pain was not as bad as I remembered from when I had one of these almost 20 years ago. However, it does not pull out all the hair. Like others already mentioned it seems to cut/rip a lot of the hairs off. If I remember correctly, my Braun® Silk Epile had removed all the hair back in the day :D. If you are blond, then your legs will look hair free, but when you touch them you feel all kinds of stubble&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems my hair is thinner now as it grows back, so I guess that is an improvement. Sometimes I shave with a razor and I am not sure if there are ingrown hairs or what, but even when I shave with a razor now, my legs don&#x27;t get smooth -- they used to be really smooth before I started using this thing. There are always bumps and stubble&#x27;s now o_O :(  --- Boooooooo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the hair that it does pull out takes quite some time to grow back so it works somewhat. My hair is very light so I can&#x27;t really tell how many ingrown hairs I get, I did find some on the back of my calf. -- I also tested it in my face and I am not going to do that again! It got rid of the hair really good --- BUT it broke me out after and I looked like a teenager in puberty. So I won&#x27;t do that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks really pretty though!!! :D If I would buy one again it wouldn&#x27;t be this model.</li>
            <li> As a caveat to this review, I should add that I have waxed my legs several times and that seems to make a huge difference in how people respond to epilators.  If you have never gotten your legs waxed, I would recommend going one or two times before you purchase an epilator.  After a couple of times waxing, getting waxed hurts signifigantly less, and the same goes for epilators.  I have used a home waxing kit for a while now and I found this epilator to be MUCH cleaner, easier to use, and less painful. I would totally recommend this purchase to anyone, just understand when you are purchasing it: This is not a razor, this machine is designed to remove the hair by pulling it out.  It will sting a little, However, the hair grows back MUCH slower than shaving, and I have noticed over time that it is growing back alot thinner too.  If you are sick of being chained to a razor, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> This has been working great especially under my arms. I have been using it on my legs and bikini line as well with good results. I did have some ingrown hairs on my legs after the first use but they seem to have diminished with each use (4 times in the past month). I have very coarse dark hair and I am very impressed with how little I have to shave now! In the summer months I normally have to shave morning and night! No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow! Definitely use a loofah to exfoliate to avoid ingrowns!</li>
            <li> I bought one in the 90s and after one try, tossed it. Hated it. We are camping in a motorhome this summer and I thought I would try it again. Oh. my.goodness. what a difference.  Does it pull? yes. I pulled the skin as the directions stated and then started thr process. took a while but worth it.</li>
            <li> I should probably put a disclaimer and say I have been using an epilator for over 10 years and only for my legs (nothing else). My previous epi I bought in Spain. Unfortunately, European products have a different voltage so I had to find an alternative quickly over here. Also, my other one had an &#x27;iced&#x27; attachment for cooling (which I have to admit was great for the sting but I never used - forgot it in the freezer all the time) and was much more pricey - a top range panasonic.     So this time I was looking for something urgently and didnt want to spend and arm and a leg. This actually turned out to be a great choice - it has all I need: A detachable top and little brush so you can clean the thing properly, a fast speed (I never use the slow), and easy charging with no need for batteries - all the rest I really do not need (I have never used the attachment for the face so cannot comment on that).     It does the job - just as painful as any other epilator I have used; takes a while to get all the hairs (probably more like two tries on subsequent days and regular use) - just as efficient as any other epilator I have used and as usual it helps to electric/razor shave a few days before and then use on shorter stubbly hair right after the shower; it also does not sound like my husbands drill (though it could be quieter). I have noticed that using it in circular movements as described in the booklet actually makes it more efficient - surprising since my other one has the same top/mechanism but didnt need all that. For $200 less though - a good buy and am happy. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Not Happy with product.This product does not work properly and not satisfied with it at all! Wouldnt recommend if you are actually looking for something that works..</li>
            <li> Was very painful and inconvenient to use this, just used it once, what a waste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for my face, but have also used it on my legs and a *little* under my arms. It&#x27;s a GREAT little gadget. Yes, it hurts. I read a review saying it feels like getting a tattoo, and I&#x27;d have to agree that it does feel that way IN THE BEGINNING. However, I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for a week, now, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt now like it did a week ago, so I would definitely advise that if you can stick with it, it will definitely be worth it. It hurts less and less the more you use it. I used to wax, and hated how time consuming it was. I started just shaving because it was quicker, but had to deal with looking like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow under my chin. NOT a good look for a lady. This epilator is great, because I can use it while I&#x27;m watching TV, so I never feel like it&#x27;s taking up a bunch of time. The best advice I can give is to be patient at first and keep at it. If you haven&#x27;t waxed or epilated recently, it will hurt, and it may not get all the hairs at first... But keep on using it, and you will see how fabulous it is!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you&#x27;re using this on your face, buy some after epilating cream to soothe your skin. It will be red for about an hour and should subside, but cream helps a lot. GREAT purchase and so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I used to wax but recently moved to Korea and for some reason the waxing available here burns my skin for days. A friend recommended this epilator, and while it hurts like blazes, it keeps hair away for weeks (vs a few days with shaving), thins out hair over time, is faster than plucking and easier than self-wax kits. Works for all body parts I&#x27;ve tried. I like the fairly large surface area so it takes less time to do the desired epilating.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned this being painful, so I purchased numbing cream.  I do remember having one a couple of decades ago --and it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try to remove hair that was shorter, so this may not be fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t painful (and I didn&#x27;t need the cream).  Maybe this is why it didn&#x27;t work well?  It is summer and I couldn&#x27;t stand growing it out until the machine might work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it did remove hair, I ended up with lots of ingrown hairs (I tend toward skin that does that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, it was a good experiment.  Not my cup o&#x27; tea I guess.  I gave it 3 stars as it might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I hate having to deal with body this product has solved the biggest issues for me! I take the epilator everywhere I go, it&#x27;s a necessity. My hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for weeks and when it does its thinner than before. There is no mess and the pain is bare able. I bought three of these for back up!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have been using the Remington EP6025 for a few months now, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing the EP6025, I did a lot of research, read online reviews, watched youtube reviews, compared brands, prices, etc. I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $50 on something that wasn&#x27;t worth the pain or the price. This one seemed to be a favorite and got good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember growing up my mom always told me that epilators were small torture devices and to never use one, so they were always taboo.  So I decided waxing was a way better choice, yes painful, but epilators were way more painful according to my mom.  WRONG! Just get through that first session with your epilator...by the second session you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used shave or wax my legs and underarms, but thought I would give this a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did. Yes, waxing can be painful...and I will admit, the first time I used this on my legs, it was slightly uncomfortable, but not nearly as bad as waxing or an unsightly razor nick, however the first time I used it on my underarms, tears came to my eyes.  The directions said the pain would lessen after each use....so I waited....and waited....and waited....finally after a few weeks (between 3 and 4) I used the epilator again...and what do you know, it hardly hurt at all!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree nothing gets legs as smooth as shaving....but you also have to shave constantly...The Remington EP6025 doesn&#x27;t always get every single fine white hair, but I usually epilate again in a few days and its gone! and my legs are smooth (no stubble-ever!) for weeks. it&#x27;s actually kind of addicting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this product and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> I had this the first time and i am satisfied with the performance. I initially charged it for 16 hours and I used it for few weeks. Then I&#x27;m about to charge it the second time and now the indicator light for charging is not working anymore. I don&#x27;t know if it is still charging or not.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an epilator.  Got it 2 weeks ago, after reading numerous reviews on amazon.com. I was tired of shaving every day, and still seeing stubble, and want smoother legs and underarms for summer dresses, shorts, and swimsuit.    This works great!  I&#x27;ve tried it twice on my legs, and there is definitely less hair growing back in, and my legs are smooth for longer than between shaves.  I used to have to shave every day or look at lots of stubble.    I just tried it for the first time on my underarms - youch!  Hurts like you wouldn&#x27;t believe! But ~ I powered through it knowing that it would help me have clean, stubble-free underarms if I could just bear the pain.    I&#x27;ve had 3 children, so how bad could it be?  Well, take 2 Naproxen, pat your underarms dry, no deodorant, and no more than 2 days of growth, and then grit your teeth.   I am counting on this area to have less and less hair each time, so felt it was worth it.  I switched to the smaller head for the underarms after the first pass, and that worked better for the curves under there.      I tried it on my sideburns and mustache area, where I have lots of tiny, blond hairs.  Again ~ youch! But ~ so much better than Nair for face, which burns my skin unbelievably.      It&#x27;s a good thing to read other reviews so that you know what to expect, or the pain would make you give up without finishing the job.  I can&#x27;t believe what we women do to be beautiful to our men, who probably don&#x27;t have any idea what it takes to have beautiful, hair-free skin!  Just wish I&#x27;d known these things existed sooner.  [[ASIN:B003H6FPVI Remington EP6025 Womens  Recharegeable Epilator with Bonus Facial Epilator Attachment]]</li>
            <li> I like the epilator. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and so far it has held up after two years. The battery life is beginning to not be the best, but other than that, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> The epilator hurts considerably the first time you use it - imagine getting waxed but with smaller sections and very slowly. Once you are adjusted to the pain and suck it up, it works very well, although it doesn&#x27;t get every hair after repeated passes.   It really does work best when you use the circular motion, and only when you do circular motion is when you feel the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; part of it. If you&#x27;ve done sugar waxing (like I have), epilating with this machine is less painful than that. This is also wayyy less messy than sugar waxing, although way less fun!   Hairs don&#x27;t get caught into a storage bin, it just falls out onto whatever you&#x27;re standing on or are near of so you may have to have something to prevent it from getting everywhere, or just sweep/vacuum/etc. afterward. I love how smooth my legs looked after the first time using it, and expect much, much better results in the upcoming uses. I used the facial attachment to rid of my fuzzy upper lip, and although it got some adjusting to the slight pain, it was well worth it for I saved $5+ gas$ on getting my lip waxed, and looks better than the wax.  The only thing I dislike is that there are no directions for using it wet, although I read somewhere you could use this wet... And also, it feels dull already. I hope it&#x27;s just my fuzz being rebellious. I recommend trimming hairs that have gotten way too long to reduce pain, either with scissors or a trimmer.  I recommend this if you are willing to take the initial pain because like my mother always says, \\&quot;Beauty ain&#x27;t painless!\\&quot;. I agree with that statement.   By the way, make sure to clean it out with the brush it comes with. And charge it for 16 hrs before using it the first time! Suck up the beginner&#x27;s pain, and remember the goal is to be able to go 4 weeks without shaving and getting cuts all over you!  Hope this helped.  -Missmex</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I&#x27;m new to epilation and that might be why I&#x27;m not giving a super review. This product works to an extent. I keep finding that some of the hairs on my leg aren&#x27;t being tweezed out like the product is supposed to, rather, it is breaking them off. However, this is getting the vast majority of the hairs out. I will continue to use this product since I have read that it takes some time to see complete results.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I chose to try a cheaper model first, to see how I like epilation.  I have waxed before, so was prepared for the pain.  It works well for the price.  I have successfully done my legs, lip, armpits, &amp; Brazilian area.  It leaves stubble on my legs, but nothing notably visible.  The initial epilation was painful, armpits being the worst.  I maintain 2 or so times a week and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt, just a few little stings at times.  Battery life is probably an hr or so, but the cord is pretty long...so I usually just leave it plugged in.  I will upgrade to a better/more expensive model later...that will more than likely give smoother results.  I haven&#x27;t picked up a razor in about 2 months, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Back in the dark ages I owned an Epi-Lady.  Ouch.  Somehow, I found a Lady Remington Smooth and Silky.  Instead of wires yanking on hair, it had a perforated rubber posts that were less painful against the skin and cleaning was easy with soap and water.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more years than I can remember.  However, when I removed the post this time, the post and the plastic piece that holds it in place separated.  The electrical cord is crimped and must be in just the right position to complete the electrical connection.  I checked online but was not hopeful that such devices still exist.  I thought that waxing, electrolysis and lasers would have put an end to them  I did not know that there is such a large variety available and that there is now a specific name for them--epilators.  I was pleased that Remington still makes a product similar to mine.  I trust the name and decided to try the new version.  I like it a lot.  I found it reassuring that the working end of the machine has little rubber (?) tips.  I like that there are 2 heads, one for face and one for heavier duty.  This motor is much stronger than my old model and works much more quickly.  Being rechargable is a plus because it eliminates the cord that limits movement.  I&#x27;m a fan.  I recommend this product to any woman who prefers to handle unwanted hair in the privacy of her own home.</li>
            <li> The packaging and everything was there, However, product-wise it&#x27;s not as good as I heard. Planned to completely switch over to just this instead of razors but no.</li>
            <li> After getting tired of the hassle of shaving I began researching the alternatives.  I have tried both waxing and the Remington EP6025.  The epilator is by far easier to use and less painful.  I followed the directions and only experienced mild discomfort.  I have average to fine leg hair.   I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is fed up with shaving.  Only 2 issues.  Doing my legs took much longer than the unit can hold a charge (about 20ish minutes) and it&#x27;s a little noisier than I expected.  I expected the charge not last too long but thought maybe more than 20 minutes.  Since it takes a while I hoped to be able to watch TV while using it but it was a bit too noisy for that.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before, but decided to try it because I was tired of shaving my bikini area and having my skin get irritated just to have the hair grow back in about a day.  The first time I used it, I had shaved fairly recently so the hair was at the recommended length for epilation, and it did work well and with less pain than I had expected, but it took about an hour.  At first my skin seemed fine, but the next day I had a ton of white heads.  I started exfoliating, and the next time I used it I had a lot less irritation (although I did still have some).  The hair has been growing back very slowly, but I still don&#x27;t think it is a time saver considering how long it takes to epilate.  Hopefully the more I do it though, the less time it will take.  This product is also insanely noisy.</li>
            <li> the epilator just trims the hair instead of removing it fully. for those who have waxed all their life will find it very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to epilation and am trying to get the hang of using this. While it does, indeed, feel like a torture device (I highly recommend the numbing cream!), it also eliminates my need to shave daily to avoid stubble. My legs are still smooth 4 days later. Make sure you have a razor or tweezers on hand for missed hairs, though. There always seems to be one or two that just won&#x27;t cooperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred method is to epilate post-shower in the evening. I always lotion afterwards, and take an anti-inflammatory to help with the swelling and redness. Be warned, some areas don&#x27;t feel painful at all, but there were other areas where I needed to stop and rest for a bit because of the level of pain involved.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, but it works pretty well. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied overall. It it nice that it has a different sized head as an extra.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, this hurts BAD the first few times you use it, but it is worth it!! My legs were soft for almost 2 weeks and even after the first time, the hair grew back thinner and lighter! I only use it twice a month now and that&#x27;s all I need to do to keep my legs soft! As a person who absolutely HATED shaving, this was life-changing. If you&#x27;re willing to put up with the pain for the first few times you use it, this product is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this because I am totaly sick of shaving. I have to shave every day and even then I am stubbly between shaves. First, shipping, was told it would take 5 days to get it and my order was processed faster so I got it in only 3 days. Packaging, not going to waste time with that. Got it out and charged it for 16 hours, took a very hot bath and steeled myself for the worst.... I&#x27;ve always prided myself on having a high tolerance for pain, and this device regularly tested my limits. On the lower legs, it wasnt bad at all, as long as I kept the skin TAUGHT. Certain areas, like armpits and the back of my knees cause me enough pain to force me to stop. Those are the negatives, which I suspect will decrease with continued usage. On the positive, this is a very easy to use device, especially if you remember to keep the skin taught, and the results LAST... I did one leg as a test when I first got this, 4 days later I was still smoother than 8 hours after shaving. all i can say is that if you have patience, and are willing to go slow, this is a great product. Its a bit like welding or getting a tatoo, start with a small area and slowly work your way on to fantastic results.</li>
            <li> It hurts, but it gets the job done. The 2 speed are awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it on underarms and chin, and using the small attachment for upper lip. It isn&#x27;t as good on the upper lip, has some trouble with the cruviness in that area, does snag on skin a bit, but otherwise I am fully satisfied. I hate shaving and tend to put it off as long as possible, now I am super pumped to have no prickly underarm stubble! I really like that I can work on hair in short bursts, as my pain tolerance varies. There are times when I just sit down and push through, and times when I work in small patches and come back later. Very easy to set up and use. I am getting more ingrown hairs than I did from shaving, but they aren&#x27;t too bad or too many, and I expect that will fade somewhat as I get more skilled at using the thing.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. You do have to let the hairs grow out some so it will grab them. A little discomfort, but it&#x27;s worth it for the slow growth of the hair afterwards. Some way of grabbing shorter hairs would be better for me, but  until that comes along, I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been considering laser hair removal because frankly, there are parts of my body that will never need to have hair.  But it freaks me out a bit &amp; a friend raved about her epilator, so I decided to give it a try. I narrowed it down to a couple based on my price range and chose this one because it had high reviews, a smaller attachment and more tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, I was pleased to find out it was already charged.  Fully charged, I think it goes for about an hour.  You can also use it while it&#x27;s plugged in &amp; charging, but it won&#x27;t work if the cord is plugged into the epilator, but not a power source, even if it is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first go-round on my legs took a combined total of about 4 hours (I was watching TV/movies so it probably could have been done faster).  It was painful.  It felt like scratching a sunburn.  At the same time, it was satisfying knowing those stupid hairs would have a heck of a time growing back if I had anything to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Tweeze Tweezer by Emjoi which has far less tweezers and is used for very small areas.  I&#x27;ve found with that, if I use some baby powder, it makes the process far less painful.  But alas, I did not use baby powder with the Remington so I can&#x27;t say whether that would ease the pain, but thought it might be worth suggesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain was the worst the first time and has just been slightly uncomfortable since. If you can survive the initial epilation, you should be fine moving forward.  My best advice would be to stick to small areas, moving in a circular direction to slowly clear out small areas and gradually increase the tweeze area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate how my armpits look, which is why I was excited for the Remington. My underarms seem to always have a shadow, even if I just shaved. Gross. But with the epilator, they stay decently hair free and with touch-ups maybe 1-2 times a week at this point, the hairs grow back very sparse and mostly unnoticeable. I think in a few months, I will have to touch up even less and have better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the best results on the bikini line. I did it once and it&#x27;s been in great shape ever since.  It&#x27;s been another trouble spot, so it&#x27;s nice to get such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get quite a few ingrown hairs on my legs, even with brushing the bejeezus out of them with a shower brush in the shower.  I&#x27;m convinced I exfoliated to the best of my ability and still had issues, so I have decided to shave maybe once a week, but continue to touch-up with the epilator, because overall, I&#x27;ve gotten great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works amazingly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are thinking about getting an epilator, I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I would recommend this one, unless you want to spend a lot more money on a more expensive one.  But I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one would offer much better results than this.  If you have ugly, dark hair that you want gone, give this a try, I think it&#x27;s worth it.in a few months, I will have to touch up even less and have better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the best results on the bikini line. I did it once and it&#x27;s been in great shape ever since.  It&#x27;s been another trouble spot, so it&#x27;s nice to get such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get quite a few ingrown hairs on my legs, even with brushing the bejeezus out of them with a shower brush in the shower.  I&#x27;m convinced I exfoliated to the best of my ability and still had issues, so I have decided to shave maybe once a week, but continue to touch-up with the epilator, because overall, I&#x27;ve gotten great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works amazingly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are thinking about getting an epilator, I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I would recommend this one, unless you want to spend a lot more money on a more expensive one.  But I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one would offer much better results than this.  If you have ugly, dark hair that you want gone, give this a try, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this fast and sweet....  If you can get through the initial pain of the first 1-2 sessions, then I promise you&#x27;ll never go back to razors.  Yes, you may experience \\&quot;some\\&quot; ingrown hairs - but if you exfoliate and moisturizer your skin regularly, this will happen only occasionally.  After repeated sessions, your hair grows back so fine..you&#x27;ll hardly see it!  I won&#x27;t lie - no matter what, the bikini area and underarms will prove to be a pain challenge for sure.  But, I was able to work through it and I&#x27;m SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li> This epilator broke after a month. It really sucks and I don&#x27;t advise anyone buying it.  It is a disposable item.</li>
            <li> This is an easy review for me to write. I&#x27;m in love with this thing. After a while you honestly get used to the small amount of pain it delivers. It&#x27;s so so worth the results. It removes all the hair in the area you&#x27;re focusing on in a quick, effective manner. It&#x27;s a little noisy but who cares with such great results.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Phillips epilator for 2 years now and liked it, although it hurt a bit, especially when doing the bikini area. Hoping that technology had evolved and eased my pain, now that my epilator died I searched for a new brand. Opted for the Braun SE3170 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil SoftPerfection Epilator which is no perfection at all!!! It hurts even more and left the skin of my legs bruised! Tried again and decided to give this Remington epilator a try because it had these massagers around the tweezers that would supposedly ease the pain. And they do!! Really efficient, almost painful for non-begginers and rechargeable. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I always used to wax for years, and I had to wait for the hair to grow upto 1 cm to wax it and plus it&#x27;s a messy job.I bought this epilator and its awesome. Its painless and so convenient to use. I dont have to wait for the hair to grow anymore. Also the skin remains hair free for more than 3 weeks. Now I feel I should have bought it long time ago. I also got one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Received this product in a white box, not the original packaging.  I read someone else who had this experience, and figured it was a fluke... well all be dipped... the plastic is worn and there is HAIR on both the main piece and the facial extension.  Luckily I am able to return this with no fees, but it bums me out that I will now think twice buying items on amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to do a smooth, close shave, that I was hoping it will do. It is just OK</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.  It does not get every single hair, but it does a pretty good job.  It is definitely worth the money.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I live in France and have a Calor Epillator. I bought this for when I am in the US and am disappointed. It misses a lot of hair and needs to be used often in order to be semi-effective. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is an OK product, perhaps after more use I&#x27;ll get the hang of it better as I haven&#x27;t used it much yet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot because I never used an epilator before so I don&#x27;t know if more expensive ones are better but this one is decent.  I used to shave every day.  I use this about once per week which is great but even that first day my skin isn&#x27;t as smooth as it is with a razor.  The good thing is, it doesn&#x27;t get any worse for several days to one week.  I read all the tricks in the reviews for making it hurt less but all I did the first time was shave in the morning as usual and then I used the epilator every day for about a week.  It barely hurt at all and I think its because the hair came in at different rates so I wasn&#x27;t pulling it all out at once.  I like that it is chargeable so I can use it without the cord.  Bottom line: for the price, I think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> [ASIN:B003H6FPVI Remington EP6025 Womens  Recharegeable Epilator with Bonus Facial Epilator Attachment]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one I have purchased I had an emoi one previously but this one is must better and hurts much less the first time after using it the pain in very little</li>
            <li> For medical reasons I don&#x27;t shave anymore, plus I nick myself all the time. I wanted an epilator that would pull out the fine leg hairs that I have.  I&#x27;ve owned epilators in the past and I know how to use them. I&#x27;ve also waxed in the past, so my leg hairs are used to being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. The hair that was pulled out was pretty painless compared to other models.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rechargeable and can be used with or without the cord.&lt;br /&gt;3. The power button has 2 different settings.  It slides slides up and down so you don&#x27;t just press it to turn it on and switch settings.&lt;br /&gt;4. The epilator head has metal tweezers combined with rubberized plastic that feels like it would help stretch the skin out to grab hairs better.  This might be why it was less painful than other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. It managed to grab thicker and coarse hair. Unfortunately for me, it wouldn&#x27;t pull out or even grab the fine leg hair that I have.  I went over spots several times and the hairs were still there. I read the instructions as well, incase there was something I was missing.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is very loud when in use.  It sounded just as loud as the Philips Satinelle [[ASIN:B00742JW8S Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator, White/Gray]]. The Braun epilator that I tried [[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]] was much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;3. Feels cheap and flimsy. I expected something that felt like it wouldn&#x27;t fall apart on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this model has quite a following and some found that it worked great, but this one wasn&#x27;t for me. You really don&#x27;t know how a product will perform unless you test it out. I took off 2 stars because it didn&#x27;t perform as well as I had hoped, and another star for the loudness and flimsiness of the unit. I hope this was helpful for someone out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that I would be able to do my bikini line for longer results than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;But I find it difficult to hold the skin taunt enough to the point that it would be most effective. I decided to take a break from using it down there so that my skin could recover from the  pinches and clogged pores that resulted from using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it on my legs was super simple. It just took a long time to get it all out the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it hurt, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> Does a flawless job even to the more sentitive areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it works cordlessly is very practical; if you are traveling to a place with a different voltage, you can take it along fully charged and you are good to go for one total body epilation.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Only thing I don&#x27;t like, is that the battery dies pretty quick. Which isn&#x27;t even that bad because you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. So zero regrets on this buy:)</li>
            <li> I bought this product especially to use on facial hair (chin and upper lip area). I love it! It is easy to use and hair does not come back as quickly - as after using chemical hair removal products, which always used to make me break out. It is not painful to use on light facial hair (fuzz), but I haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs yet. I think this is a great value for the price, and I wish that I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well. I have to go over an area several times, but to avoid just cutting the hair off ,i.e. shaving,I really like this as an alternative. Works pretty well on my face and legs.</li>
            <li> bought this product to take away little hairs growing under my chin.  It seems to work well, but sometimes misses finer hairs.  It is easier than tweeting and last longer.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty high threshold for pain, and I can&#x27;t even stand to use this product.  I tried it first on my arms since I knew that the skin there wasn&#x27;t very sensitive.  It hurt like crazy and left my skin red and covered in bumps.  And after half an hour trying to get one arm smooth and hair-free I saw that it barely took any of the hair out.  Several days later I tried my lower legs and the same thing happened.  Pain, redness, bumps (which turn into ingrown hairs) and the hair is still there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the epilator really does is yank on your hair and then either break it off at the skin, or leave it there, ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful, awful product!  I&#x27;ll stick to waxing or shaving, thank you very much.  And I want my 50 bucks back.</li>
            <li> Works great but it does hurt at first until your skin gets more de-sensitized to it.  The hair does grow more slowly.  I have a few chin hairs and was very self conscious about it and used a little razor to remove them but they came back fast and stubbly.  This is perfect and I highly recommend it to any woman who is at that point where they get unwanted facial hair.  It says some people use it on their legs but I&#x27;m not that brave!</li>
            <li> Bought this product and model from walmart.com and it&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, but I gotta say I&#x27;m impressed. I have very fine hair from waxing and I&#x27;ve always hated the texture of the hair after shaving, so I never did that, but the epilator removed most of the hair either by pulling it out from the root or breaking some off. From what I can tell from cleaning it, the epilator mostly pulls hair out from the root and it doesn&#x27;t really irritate the skin while doing it. If you have more coarser hair, then I would assume that it would be more painful and hard to tolerate, but that&#x27;s why you take painkillers at least half an hour before using the epilator just like you would if you went to wax professionally. There was some bleeding when it pulled out some of my fine hair from the root and that&#x27;s to be expected. It&#x27;s really quick with it&#x27;s pulling and a heck of a lot cheaper in the long run compared to professional waxing assuming the product is durable and won&#x27;t break before the warranty date expiration. In terms of sensation, it felt like I was being mini-pinched multiple times simultaneously, which wasn&#x27;t really super unpleasant like most people make it out to be. The mini-pinching is just the hair being pulled out from the root and the miniscule pain is very fleeting and is to be expected. I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was being pinched or anything. The epilator is meant to slow down if pressed too hard against the skin and that&#x27;s what it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some issues that I had with the product was that it instructed you to charge the epilator for 16 hours before using it cordless and I charged for well over 16 hours yet the indicator light is still red. I ended up using the epilator while it was still plugged into the wall. I had trouble figuring out how to turn on the epilator at first and thought it was dead on arrival. One must press the centermost button and THEN drag it up firmly to the first speed setting for fine hair pulling or the highest speed setting above that for coarser hair pulling. It&#x27;s also kind of loud, but is tolerable and you&#x27;ll get used to it over time. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s hair dryer loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think waxing is more effective in terms of cleaner hair removal than using an epilator; however, waxing is more costly in the long run and if you&#x27;re on a budget then an epilator is the way to go if you really hate shaving, so the epilator is what I will stick with. It&#x27;s also pretty quick too than tweezing individual hairs in which you have a huge patch of. Epilate first and if there&#x27;s any left over hair that wasn&#x27;t pulled out, then the good ol&#x27; tweezerman tweezers will finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Having used it for a while. I&#x27;m gonna update my review from 3 stars out of 5 to 4 stars! I use this for the axillary regions and even the bikini line several times (like Brazilian) and upper lip. It&#x27;s great! My only concern is that eventually the unit won&#x27;t be able to hold a charge and may ALWAYS need to be plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having possessed this for months, maybe even a year already I&#x27;ve noticed some things have happened if you&#x27;re not careful. Depending on how much \\&quot;loose\\&quot; skin you have, it&#x27;s gonna pinch the skin and the epilator head will stop spinning like its jammed. Only happened to me 2-3 times out of the MANY times I&#x27;ve used it, I find the best way to avoid this is hold up my arms as high as I can, keeping the skin taut and swiftly move in circular motions as it plucks away the hairs. For my friend, who has lost some weight in the past and had loose skin on her armpits, it pinched her pits every time. Interestingly enough, she&#x27;s used it several times or so and finds it very painful. And she used to wax like I did before the epilator came along, so you&#x27;d think she&#x27;d be used it. Pain for this device varies for people. I guess I have a high pain tolerance. And if you use it too slow and take too long to remove hair, you&#x27;re gonna drain the battery. My friend did that justdoing her own pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice thing about this device is I charge it once between every 3-4 times I do my pits. You&#x27;ll know the battery is dying when the head rotates slowly and the sound isn&#x27;t as loud as previous times. Obviously, I would charge it more often if I was doing my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the bikini area, it&#x27;s good to be sitting up while you&#x27;re doing this and having a mirror facing you while you lay on a towel. Using a comforter and a pillow to prop you up helps. I&#x27;d NEVER thought I&#x27;d ever be able to do my bikini area by myself. But I did several times (with some painkillers half an hour before the procedure) and I even got rid of the seemingly hard to get hairs as the unit approached hole number 2. The head of the unit is nicely contoured for that. Doing my bikini area was strange and the head rotated against the direction in which the hair grew, yet most of the hairs it pulled out came out with its roots. Some did break off though. It&#x27;s recommended you do this mid-cycle of your monthly visited friend for the least painful experience. Basically, follow the same procedures if you were going to get a professional wax done. Any touch-ups can be reached with a tweezer and viewing in the mirror. Also the rotating tweezers of the head may pinch a labia and get jammed. THAT REALLY HURTS, but if you hold your skin down taut you should be fine. You can experiment with it, but I&#x27;m guessing most of you won&#x27;t. With fairly good reason. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second smaller bonus head, I&#x27;d like to use for my upper lip. DO NOT USE IT FOR YOUR BROWS (it&#x27;s just too risky, unless you are ok with drawing in your own eyebrows for a while). The thing that bothered me about the bonus head was that it would not pick up any hairs unless I used the unit with its back facing towards me and the HEAD ROTATING AND PULLING OFF HAIRS IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE PEACH FUZZ GROWTH. OPPOSITE WITH HOW I DID MY BIKINI REGION. That I found strange and kind of annoying but itcleared the peach fuzz no prob when I did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that the regions you epilate will become inflamed. For me my bikini area especially was inflamed but the redness and swelling went down in hours. Upper lip was also inflamed but redness disappeared too eventually. Armpits were not inflamed for some reason in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it, I feel pretty satisfied with the product and I think it was worth the price. I bought one for a friend and she also loved it. Now another friend of mine borrowed mine (after it was cleaned and wiped with hydrogen peroxide) and likes it and wants one. :D</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I used four stars because I have not used it in the shower. It also doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge. But it works extremely well on wet body parts. Very precise and far less painful that my older model of the Epilady. Also love that it has a smaller head for hard-to-reach places.    It has only been a few weeks, so I will upgrade to 5 should it pass the shower/bathtub test!</li>
            <li> This review is for the 7030 model:&lt;br /&gt;I like the wet/dry feature. Using it wet with soap is pain-free. However, after working great for 5 minutes or so it quits and the red light comes on, even after a full charge. I know it has a safety feature that turns it off if you press too hard, but this almost seems positional. Sometimes I can just hold it in my hand and turn my wrist over and it will stop. Taking the head off and cleaning the foam out seems to help, but my thumb hurts from turning it on and off so much. (When the red light comes on you have to turn it off until the light goes then turn it on again.) I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective or if they all act up. Oddly enough it seems to work the best right before the battery dies. Sometimes when I turn it back on, the light goes green but the motor hesitates a bit. I would return it but I ruined the packaging trying to open it and have now used it 5 times thinking I was just pressing it too hard, not charging long enough, charging it too long, or using too much soap.&lt;br /&gt;If it did not stop running every few minutes I would rate it a 5. It is painless and more efficient per stroke than other epilators I&#x27;ve used. It isn&#x27;t especially loud and the battery lasts long enough to use on both legs without having to wait to recharge. It should take very little time to use, but not when you have to turn it on and off over and over again.</li>
            <li> Pros: Battery life last my entire epilation process.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; to me is honestly more like a tickle, but I have an incredibly high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;Grabs every course hair without breaking them.&lt;br /&gt;Works amazingly well for underarm hair, which was my main intended use when I purchased it (never have to shave under there anymore - which for some reason always gave me razor burn).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I grow hair like a zebra on my legs. Very fine hair and very course hair. The epilator doesn&#x27;t catch the very light and fine hairs, which means I still need to shave my legs for a completely smooth feeling (but shaving is 100x easier after epilation. And plus, the fine hairs are so thin and small that I don&#x27;t mind them).&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I still rave about how amazing this epilator is and have probably gotten around 10 people to buy one of their own. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Remington epilator for years w/great success. Since it was no longer possible to find replacements for the 24K gold blades I decided to buy a new one - I will NEVER go back to shaving.  This model has some type of silver blades.  They tend to catch and don&#x27;t leave the totally smooth surface the older model did.&lt;br /&gt;And btw the \\&quot;bonus facial epilator\\&quot; is not recommended for use on your face!</li>
            <li> So, I bought this especially for my armpits. As long as I pull the skin taught it&#x27;s not so painful. But no matter which direction I go in, I can never seem to get ALL of the hairs. I end up having to tweeze the rest. So, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:(4/2012) Will no longer be using an epilator for underarms. No matter what I do, it seems I can&#x27;t avoid getting ingrown hairs. Ugh!! Guess I&#x27;ll give regular tweezing a try.  :/</li>
            <li> This product only removes really light hairs. It gives a slight stinging on the face when removing hairs and hurts a little when trying to remove the hairs on the upper lip.  I don&#x27;t know if I can get used to this.  I still have to tweeze the thicker hairs on my chin and under my neck.  I would think twice about buying this product again.  .</li>
            <li> My first epilator so I can&#x27;t compare the pain but it still hurts for me every time I use it. I love this epilator and I&#x27;ve had it for a while now. Years of shaving has made my leg hair very dark, course and thick but it has become less so after I&#x27;ve used this. Decent price for an epilator as well.</li>
            <li> Epilators get a bad rap I think. However, after using this epilator for the first time I have to admit it is well worth it for such a break in the shaving cycle. The battery seems to hold up really well and it&#x27;s a great design...fits well in your hand and it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the whole pain thing was not anywhere near as bad as I expected. As a matter of fact, I felt next to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have skin that is prone to ingrown hairs and is fairly sensitive. I expected a rash or something (which once again I was willing to deal with to not have to shave for such a long period of time). No rash, no ingrowns so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this product to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> I first tried an epilator several years ago, and it was so painful, I gave up. After looking at reviews for this remington, I thought I would give it a shot. I am very glad I did. The first time using it, is a little uncomfortable, but nothing like the older ones. You are pulling hair out, it doesn&#x27;t feel good!I have only used it on my legs and they stayed relatively hair-free for a week or so. After using several more times, the degree of pain was reduced more so. You have to be sure and hold skin tight and go in slow circles. The only complaint I have, is there are ingrown hairs. I am doing more to exfoliate and hope this helps. Definitely give it a try, beats shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> To the uninitiated in epilator use, it does what it says it does. And yes, it hurts, but like another reviewer said, it can be addicting when you see the results. As someone with fast-growing hair and sensitive skin, daily shaving in the summer is no fun. The initial \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; of this gets less and less each time I use it. (It hurts most around the ankles and the fleshy part of your calves. Underarms hurt too, but if you have ever given birth ... even with an epidural, you can definitely do this.)    Because individual hairs grow at different rates, don&#x27;t expect to use this and get silky smooth skin the very first time. It takes a few days. And yes, if you have pale, sensitive skin like me, you&#x27;ll get lots of little red dots all over your legs from where the device yanked out the hairs, so don&#x27;t plan a trip to the pool as soon as you finish. For me, those dots fade in less than 24 hours.    I tried an Epilady once back in the early 90s and determined it was an especially cruel form of torture invented by men who didn&#x27;t like women. But, this is much better. It&#x27;s different technology from the epilators of 20 years ago. I researched and read just about every review on this site for every epilator that got an average four stars, and then went to the store with the big red bull&#x27;s eye and bought this one (for about the same price listed here).    Pros: As for this particular epilator, I love that it can be cordless. It comes partially charged, but you really should charge it up before using it. It works better/faster if you use it while plugged in. The two different removable head sizes are also convenient.    Cons: Because of the contour of the head, this epilator is specifically designed for legs, even though it says it&#x27;s for other areas as well. It is a little loud, but nowhere near as loud as a hair dryer.    Overall, I would buy this product again and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Considering the amount of money I&#x27;ll save to not buy razors, shaving cream,not to mention the time I&#x27;ll save every day, this is definitely a great investment.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is rechargeable and it has the facial epilator so I can use it for my upper lip ever since I started using my hair does not grow as fast.</li>
            <li> I am guy who was cursed to have a large amount of body hair, so much that if I don&#x27;t manscape I almost start to look like an animal. I have tried almost every body hair removal method known to man and always thought waxing was the best. The problem is that it is just so expensive. I was paying $60 for just my back, shoulders, and chest to be professionally waxed. I tried shaving but I didn&#x27;t like the only short term results nor the stubble that came along with it. The depilatory creams were smelly, didn&#x27;t work well, and I was very concerned about the health of my skin so I searched on the internet until I discovered an epilator. I researched which ones to buy and the only &#x27;men&#x27;s epilator&#x27; I found was over $130; double the price of this one!     I&#x27;m not going to lie the first time I used it it hurt like a MOTHA-F*&amp;$#R! I read some people take tylonal prior to using it but I only take medication when absolutely necessary. So what I did instead was went to the gym and just pumped myself up to get the adrenalin going so I could take anything. I got home and just attacked it. The most painful areas were my chest with its coarse thick hair and my back and shoulders near my neck but after awhile it just didn&#x27;t hurt so much anymore and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all on my legs even behind my knees.     It got all the hair off my legs and most of it off my chest &amp; back. If I had let my chest and back hair grow a little more from shaving I probably could&#x27;ve gotten it all. I wasn&#x27;t too concerned though because I don&#x27;t need a completely smooth chest I just don&#x27;t want a large quantity of hair there.  I&#x27;ll never buy an expensive waxing treatment again as this pays for itself in one use. Also guys you may think shaving is cheaper but if you add up the cost of the shaving creams and blades this is also a cheaper option in the long run.     IMPORTANT TIP FOR NEW MANSCAPERS: Always make sure to rub the area you just manscaped with rubbing alcohol or an alcohol based aftershave! Our body hairis thicker than women&#x27;s thus our follicles are more likely to become infected without proper care. Also make sure to moisturize your skin afterwards as well to prevent chaffing and dry skin</li>
            <li> It took me a while to choose which one to get, I choose this because of the facial hair attachment. My expectation was it will be really painful, so when I tried the facial attachment, it was tolerable. Have not required using it frequently because it takes a while for the hair grow back. Have not  even charge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it christmas time and it arrive earlier than scheduled date.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t pull thick hair all that well, and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> works fast- had an older model(won&#x27;t mention brand) for almost 9 years now- my 13 yr old started to use it and it died- bought this one-- it is soooo much faster and gets all the hair, we love it-I always use it in the arm pit area and legs-I even started to use it in the bikini area- not so bad. I would purchase another when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and i bought this to remove hair from my arms and shoulders. It is not as good as i hoped so. It is hard to get all the hair on my arms and impossible to remove any from my shoulders. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This works really well. I definitely had to get a good exfoliating sponge to scrub my legs to ward off the ingrowns. This works just about everywhere. I still use the razor in between but am using it far less frequently. I only knocked it down one star because its quite loud. I know someone who uses the emjoi epilator and it&#x27;s a lot quieter, same effectiveness. Otherwise, I&#x27;m super happy with this product for turning my beastly legs into short worthy gams.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today on my belly and armpits and needless to say I&#x27;m amazed.  It&#x27;s painful on the underarms but nothing too unbearable (pain is beauty after all).  It left my skin feeling silky smooth.  I did have a little redness after use, but I have sensitive skin and am not surprised.  I&#x27;m anxious to use this on my legs!  If you&#x27;re having doubts- buy it!</li>
            <li> My charger went up, entirely due to my fault. The epilator was still working off of the battery. I have searched for another cord to purchase and was told by a Remington rep on their 800 number that the cord is only available to be purchased with the epilator! Well, now the battery charge is gone and I have no means to recharge the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, Remington, do you actually believe I am going to purchase another epilator just to obtain a charge cord? Guess who will never have any more of my business.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t pluck all even if I roll it over several times.  It doesn&#x27;t work that well, and the noise is really loud!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.I wish i would have known about it sooner. This is my 1st epilator.Im very content with it.&lt;br /&gt; I got it for my face because i have a disease that causes alot of facial hair around my chin,lower chin,side burns ect.&lt;br /&gt;Before, this epilator i used to use tweezers. And i never could get every hair.But no, I CAN!</li>
            <li> Well i don&#x27;t know if i didn&#x27;t research these kind of products properly, BUT, I as tired of the waxing and I know the directions say use a few times to get used to it, but I totally cannot do my top lip, super sore. Will update more after have used a few more times! It does help with the facial hair for sure.</li>
            <li> After all these years, I still have this product, and I use it every week!  Painful as heck, but it gets the job done.  When I bought it, it was no more than $70. Now it it $299.95?!?!   Unless this thing has a new feature I am unaware of, you can probably find it cheaper else where.</li>
            <li> I can use this charged or connected to the wall, it works great and is priced reasonably! The carrying pouch is nice to keep everything together, and overall, it&#x27;s a great and easy to use product.</li>
            <li> My sister suggested this product to me and I love it!  I use it mainly on my legs.  I have coarse hair and the first time was a bit tough, but wow, how this has reduced the shaving hassle in my life.  I used to shave almost every day.  Now, I use the epilator maybe 1-2x a week. No scratchy stubble!  At this rate, it will pay for itself since I don&#x27;t have to buy as many disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I really suggest you to by these this will help you with your side burns and all that hair that you have around your face I really liked this product</li>
            <li> I guess we all have different pain tolerances - I don&#x27;t find this painful, or just a little painful, but nothing unbearable.  I was using a coil threading tool (looks like a coil with two little handles), and that was more painful around the lips.  This unit works but you have to go over each area repeatedly to get rid of all the hairs.  Takes quite a while on the legs, so I do while watching TV.  I&#x27;ve not used it on underarms.  Overall, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got this; it works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t grab at my skin like other epilators seem to do</li>
            <li> I love it, the first time I used it; I though &amp;#34;F THIS&amp;#34; because of the pain. However, it gets less painful the more you use it. The fact that you don&#x27;t have to shave as often is a huge plus. It is a bit time-consuming, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Okay so I know I&#x27;ve heard of how painful and uncomfortable this little thing is, especially if you have sensitive skin. But for a woman who&#x27;s had PCOS for such a long time and having to shave my face every day or every other day...this is a confidence booster. Right now I&#x27;m doing everything in sessions and for the parts that I&#x27;ve already done, I can already feel the smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the package was suppose to arrive around Dec 30th and I didn&#x27;t receive it  til Jan 10th, I&#x27;ll just give the benefit of a doubt because it was during the holidays...that or USPS hated the box and they wanted to teach it a lesson before it got here cause the packaging of the box and the product itself were all messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that good product. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on the rest of my body :)</li>
            <li> It is a lovely product. With a mini part you can clean a bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;The size of this whole product is convenient  to put into your pocket.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time user of an epilater. I used it on my legs first. The hairs were pretty long, so it was a good start to see if this worked. It took some getting use to because you have to hold the epilater at the right angle so that the tweezers are working in full effect. I tried holding it in many different angles. When you know you&#x27;re holding it right, that&#x27;s when you FEEL it and see hairs disappearing. Using it on my legs didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought. The reviews made it sound like it was excruciating pain....but it&#x27;s not, not the legs anyway. It took a while to remove the hairs because I kept holding it wrong. Again, takes some practice. It works when you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, I used it on my arms. Compared to my legs where I just shrugged it off, doing it on my arms made me really cry out. Probably because I had more hair on my arms? Or because my arms are more sensitive? I&#x27;m not sure. Very painful, but I got over it and finished the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I used it on my armpits. I&#x27;m use to waxing at this area, so I was okay about hair being pulled off. I found it so much better than waxing or hand tweezing on the arm pits. It was faster and cleaner. I didn&#x27;t have to deal with wiping off wax residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I used the face head of the epilater. I get hair on my face, around my cheeks and stuff, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for hair removal since shaving would make it worse. I loved this because not only does it pull the hair, but I think it pulls off dead skin too. Because after I was done and feeling my face, it felt really really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks since I used the epilater on my legs, I&#x27;m only now just feeling stubs. Which is awesome for me because my hair tends to grow really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting red bumps after use is normal afterall hairs were pulled off and at the root. It&#x27;s a normal reaction. So it&#x27;s better to epilate at night, so when you wake up, the redness is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will keep using this. Shaving is no longer an option.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to get used to it. Very worth the money! I mainly use it for my underarms...works wonders! My hairs take forever to grow out and they&#x27;re so fine.</li>
            <li> This epilator works as advertised. The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s done charging. The indicator light is red and never changes. So, I usually just charge mine overnight. I figure that&#x27;s long enough</li>
            <li> I only bought Epilady&#x27;s for the past 30 or so years.  Read the reviews on this and used to buy Remington shavers.  The price was better, so I thought I&#x27;d try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The rechargeable feature is great and does it hold a charge!  I haven&#x27;t had it die on me yet and I only recharge it every three or so uses.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My epilator works perfectly !</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. The dual heads are useful to switch out for delicate parts of the body, like the face, and it comes with a pouch, cord, cleaning brush... Everything you need! I got this because I wanted an epilator that I could use off-cord if necessary, over the weekend or holidays, etc. The power seems to be reduced slightly when I&#x27;m not using it on the cord, but it&#x27;s still going fast enough to really get my hair out. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years and everything&#x27;s working as well as the day I got it. Takes a few hours to fully charge, but I&#x27;m not too worried about that. I don&#x27;t think this is waterproof, which is perhaps the only improvement I would want, but since I didn&#x27;t pay for or expect that, I&#x27;m not too hung up about it.&lt;br /&gt;There is excessive packaging, which doesn&#x27;t make the product bad, but I would hope Remington changes it to be a bit less wasteful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving a fortune on razors and waxing strips.  This product is so wonderful!  There is much less redness on the face when compared to waxing, plus there is no mess.  You just plug it in and go.  I&#x27;m buying more of these for all my daughters.</li>
            <li> Works as should and love it. Got it to use on face primarily - found the small head works best for that with minimum discomfort. Legs work well too - all over with large head, but small head works well in areas as next to the bone where there are indentations. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have hair on my chin, neck and sideburns. The additional head piece included with this epilator is great on the face. I have tried wax strips, and nair, but this is quick and relatively painless. (if you can do wax or wax strips, this is essentially the same).</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain. The first use was a little uncomfortable but I took another reviewers advice and went in circle as fast as I could and made sure to stretch my skin. It felt fine after a few minutes. I have thick hair everywhere and now it comes back way thinner and lasts 1-2 weeks depending on the area. I use on underarms, bakini etc. and I love the results. I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS WAY TOO LOUD.  I USED IT ONCE AND HAD TO RETURN IT.. WHEN USING ON SIDE BURNS IT IS SO LOUD THAT HONESTLY I HAD TO COVER MY EAR.  I FOUND THE NOISE INTENSE.. I&#x27;M NOT SURE IF PERHAPS MY PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF IN FACT THAT&#x27;S HOW LOUD IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO BE.&lt;br /&gt;THE EPILATOR WORKED BUT MISSED A LOT OF AREAS AND I HAD TO GO OVER THE SAME AREA NUMEROUS TIMES.  THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR... DIDN&#x27;T DO AS PROMISED..</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It took a long time to remove all of my hair the first time because it was painful with so much hair, but now it&#x27;s really not bad to do a weekly touch up and have pretty smooth legs, pits, bikini area all the time. My hair used to grow in stubbly within 24 hours so shaving felt like a total waste. Then I couldn&#x27;t shave on top of the stubble so I couldn&#x27;t be smooth everyday if I tried. Now if I shave on top on epilating my legs are silky smooth for days and it&#x27;s wonderful. I am also pregnant now so my hair grows faster and shaving has gotten even harder. I can now remove hair in bed laying down or have my husband epilate for me and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it every day. Having tried EVERYTHING else (Nair, laser hair removal, waxing both hot and cold, Nads, that sandpaper as seen on TV thing, that dumb worthless &amp;#34;radio signal&amp;#34; permanent remover, and shaving) this is by far my favorite hair removal method.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I don&#x27;t have a readily available benchmark. But still I think this product is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does the work&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t hurt much - don&#x27;t get me wrong it does prick but doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;3. No problem of in growth - didn&#x27;t see any in growth on first or on subsequent use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Fine hair needs a lot of time to get rid off. Seriously, if you have small hair length you are better off purchasing something else.&lt;br /&gt;2. Loud - not sure if all epilators are loud but it suppress music on my phone&lt;br /&gt;3. Aloe vera tip is useless (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;4. Didn&#x27;t reduce my hair growth - Company suggested in the product details that overtime hair growth will reduce. I have been using it for 6 months but didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> While less painful then other epilators I&#x27;ve owned, it is also way less effective. The rounded shape makes it hard to maneuver over the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would recommend to others to get an epilator with a backlight.</li>
            <li> So, this was my first epilator, and I read almost all of the reviews trying to decide if it was for me or not. I have never done waxing or anything, I have always just shaved, but that really was hard on my skin so I decided to look for another option. I got this thing in the mail and I was super excited, until I started using it. It was very hard to get that first epilation done, but I told myself it would be worth it! I had a bit of raised red skin after the fact, but it cleared up in &amp;#60;24hrs like someone else had said. Also, like someone else said the process does start to become addictive lol. I have found that the pain for me has gotten better on both my second and third epilation. I have however only tried my legs and am thinking about possibly doing my armpits.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in getting an epilator. Read the reviews and decided to try it. It works pretty well. It can take a while but for me its worth it. Its not extremely comfortable, but not overly so. It can be used in the bikini area if you are very careful and have it on the lowest setting. A good buy.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews I decided to purchase, glad I did, would recommend this product, easy to use no problems</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on the reviews and it was worth it. My only regret is that i didnt buy it sooner my skin stays smoother longer. I got a few ingrowns hair but with regular exfoliation it wasnt a problem. Wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this! After using an epilator, I will never go back to shaving again! I will admit that it hurts, but the degree of pain does begin to diminish after a few months of use. I have noticed a distinct difference in the thickness and coarseness in the individual hairs and I only need to use it about every 5 days or so. I still cannot use this in very sensitive places like my face and armpits as it is quite painful (I even tried to use a numbing cream first). I do use the facial attachment while trimming my eyebrows. The battery is not as strong as using the epilator while plugged in, but is usable in a few instances. I will strongly consider purchasing this brand again if this one ever dies (and it&#x27;s not showing any signs of giving up!)&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this epilator</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out, but if you don&#x27;t pull your skin tight, it might snap the hair at the shaft instead of pulling it out at the root...causing ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve been reading about some techniques to combat this though, and plan to try them out.</li>
            <li> I did so many review on the Remington EP6025 Womans Recharegeable Epilator  with Bonus Facial Epilator .......................... it&#x27;sb no GOOD u guys please get some thing better</li>
            <li> Well this is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t know if they as a product whole are just kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; or if it&#x27;s this particular brand. All I can say is the pain really is no biggy (but I wax) however it doesn&#x27;t seem to ever REALLY give me the smoothness I seek. Still always feels stubbly. I was hoping to do this instead of waxing but it just takes forever for results that are just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; so I dunno, take that for what you will.</li>
            <li> It hurt the first time I used it and caused ingrown hairs. After doing a little research online, I have a good routine down. It&#x27;s really important to exfoliate before using it, and continue to exfoliate when the hair starts growing back. Like plucking eyebrows, you get used to the feeling and it stops hurting completely.</li>
            <li> Love it absolutely! It stings a lil when it&#x27;s in action but I obviously expected a lot of pain! Luckily it was &#x27;almost&#x27; painless! :-) ever since I epilate once a month. If you are used to waxing, trust me this is definitely better!!! It stings when the hair is pulled out but that&#x27;s it! No pain or irritation after that. In a matter of seconds you will be hair and pain-free ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the facial epilator, I&#x27;ve used it only once and honestly didn&#x27;t like it. I felt the hair grew back thicker. I went back to threading and tweezing!</li>
            <li> While initially painful, it&#x27;s definitely worth the week+ of not having to worry about stubble on your legs. Fails 5 star because I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t work as well on my face; it grabs the hair ineffectively (although I could be doing it wrong). I can&#x27;t use it all the way up my leg due to sensitivity, but it&#x27;s still worth it. I have had no problems with ingrown hairs or anything like that. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone considering an alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> These are nice when compared to others like Philips &amp; Braun which cost nearly $90-$100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that these do not work on 220-240V so these can&#x27;t be used internationally, just in case if you are a frequent traveler.. They work only on 110-120V.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, The input voltage is not mentioned on the Amazon page for product details.</li>
            <li> So my mom had an old school epilator that was pretty much a torture device for punishment so I was apprehensive to buy one myself.  Let me say this epilator is NOTHING like my mom&#x27;s.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurts but it does feel a little unpleasant on the back of my legs and thighs but not so much as to make me stop using it.  I had really coarse hair on my lower legs and it would grow back by that night when I shaved.  After using this one time I didn&#x27;t really see regrowth for almost a week, and the regrowth that did appear was much thinner and less dark.  I love this and would definitely recommend others to buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought the epilator mainly for my face. I am please with the performance. I used to have a lot of little white fine hairs that could get long at times and I was constantly plucking. I get a few dark thick ones on my chin as well. The epilator removed 90% of the hair the first use. I will say that the small black ones have to be grown out a little before the epilator will grab them, so I do still pluck a little but not near as much.  My overall appearance has definitely improved.</li>
            <li> I used it on my underarms. It did remove the hairs. Didn&#x27;t hurt. 3days later Hair grew back thick like shaving. So I returned it and bought emjoi soft caress. Definitely much better. I thick the remington was breaking my hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now it works great, seems like the battery life is slightly diminished now but I usually use it plugged in the cords pretty long.</li>
            <li> Edit! 04/17/2017&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this epilator for about 6 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I no longer use it on my legs, though, so I wanted to address the reasons why in this review. This thing works really well on coarser hair (for me, that means under arms and bikini line). It does not do so well with fine hair. I was experiencing horrific and numerous ingrown hairs on my legs, which had never happened to me before - the finer hairs were apparently just breaking off under the skin rather than being removed at the root. I finally gave up and went back to shaving my legs but I&#x27;m still using the epilator for my underarms and bikini line. These areas have become almost completely desensitized to the initial pain I experienced when I first started using the epilator, and the hair growth itself is much sparser and seems to grow more slowly. Overall, I still rate it 4 stars but I wasn&#x27;t able to chuck the razers completely. If you&#x27;re tired of the expense of shaving, check out dollar shave club - because the blades are so  affordable and they ship straight to my house, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a blade until it&#x27;s completely dull and rubbing my skin raw - in turn, I experience less razor burn and smoother skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this epilator from Target after reading some of the reviews about various brands and types of epilators here on Amazon.com (I didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping, and this one wasn&#x27;t available through Prime.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there weren&#x27;t many reviews at the time I purchased the Remington EP6025, I was sold on the cordless function of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my FIRST epilator, so I am not able to provide any side-by-side comparisons. (I&#x27;ve used home-wax strips on a couple of occasions, but was relatively new to ripping hair out of my body.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, here are some observations after owning the device for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This can be used with/without the cord, (which I didn&#x27;t know when I bought it and turned out to be a plus.) When the battery starts to lose its charge, you can just find an outlet and keep on going. This differs from a number of trimmers/shavers I have owned in the past that can only function when the battery is charged (and must be placed in a &amp;#34;charging station&amp;#34; to recharge,) leaving you a partially hairy monster if you don&#x27;t finish the job before the battery dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It is comfortable to hold. Not too heavy, and not so light that it feels cheap and flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is NO way you can pinch your skin. When you press this epilator too firmly against your skin, the tweezers stop rotating. This is something I really appreciate because I&#x27;m prone to nicking myself with electric shavers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) There are two speeds. I began by using the lower speed on my legs, found that I was perfectly okay with the sensation of ripping the hair out by the roots (kind of a tingling, burning sensation at times, and almost feels like tiny shocks, especially behind the knees.) I was quickly able to speed it up, but noticed that if my hair was longer than a 1/4 inch, it either hurt a little more, or simply broke at the surface of the skin.) The breakage didn&#x27;t seem to happen at the lower speed. The lower speed is also better for courser hair (under-arms, bikini area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The battery didn&#x27;t last long enough the first time I used it (TOO HAIRY!) but, as I mentioned above, I simply plugged it in and kept at it. Now that I&#x27;m in &amp;#34;touch-up mode&amp;#34; the battery life is fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Exfoliation is KEY. I have noticed a couple ingrown hairs (just below the surface, and easily removed) but as long as I exfoliate daily, I haven&#x27;t seen any nightmarish ingrown hairs as described by some people reviewing other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) My armpits have never looked better. YES, it HURTS! But it&#x27;s a productive pain, and totally worth it. I was unable to have smooth armpits prior to buying this epilator because shaving led to horrible ingrown hairs, raw skin, and those dark roots right under the surface of my skin, even right after shaving.  Now, my underarm skin is smooth, comfortable, and I have way more confidence wearing tank tops and sleeveless shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I will provide updates if for some reason the thing just falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 02/10/2012&lt;br /&gt;This product has significanly slowed the hair growth on my legs and underarms- I have experienced more ingrown hairs on my legs, but always just under the surface, never the crazy, inflamed scary ones you hear about... I usually use this on my legs every couple of months, shaving in between if I must-- I have found that you get more bang for your buck if you wait through several hair growth cycles (these obnoxious little hairs grow at different rates...) then the re-growth is slowed to the 2 weeks the product description boasts...  The battery is pretty much a non issue now and a useless feature, since I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in to charge- I grab it out of the drawer without planning ahead, so I have to leave it plugged in while I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!hose dark roots right under the surface of my skin, even right after shaving.  Now, my underarm skin is smooth, comfortable, and I have way more confidence wearing tank tops and sleeveless shirts.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and I will provide updates if for some reason the thing just falls apart.  **UPDATE 02/10/2012 This product has significanly slowed the hair growth on my legs and underarms- I have experienced more ingrown hairs on my legs, but always just under the surface, never the crazy, inflamed scary ones you hear about... I usually use this on my legs every couple of months, shaving in between if I must-- I have found that you get more bang for your buck if you wait through several hair growth cycles (these obnoxious little hairs grow at different rates...) then the re-growth is slowed to the 2 weeks the product description boasts...  The battery is pretty much a non issue now and a useless feature, since I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in to charge- I grab it out of the drawer without planning ahead, so I have to leave it plugged in while I use it.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get a new epilator. I have been a long time epilator user and prefer it over shaving or waxing. The epilator itself looks like a high quality item, comes with protective caps, a brush, and everything. Once I used it though, I found that it does not work very well on the underarms. Because of the way the curved head is designed, it is difficult to get some hairs and takes way longer than my old epilator did. It works, but not as well as other epilators.  A few other comments I&#x27;d like to make:    It says on the box it has \\&quot;moisture comfort technology\\&quot; that&#x27;s supposed to reduce pain. What exactly is this? There is absolutely NO \\&quot;moisture technology\\&quot; in this product. It seems like they just put it on the box for show, but it means nothing. The manual doesn&#x27;t even say what it means. At some sites this was even being sold as a wet/dry epilator, but the manual says it is not to be used with water (like I said, the \\&quot;moisture comfort technology\\&quot; means nothing and only confuses things).    It specifically says on the box \\&quot;FACE AND BODY EPILATOR KIT\\&quot; and \\&quot;PRECISION HEAD FOR FACE AND DETAIL AREAS.\\&quot;  Then you look at the manual for information on using it on the face, and it says \\&quot;USE ON FACE IS NOT RECOMMENDED.\\&quot;  What?? That is blatant false advertising! I still don&#x27;t have the nerve to try this on my upper lip, I am afraid I might get ingrown hairs or red spots (your upper lip would be a *really* bad place to get an ingrown hair...).    I don&#x27;t think the little plastic \\&quot;prong\\&quot; thing really does anything to reduce pain, but I guess I should also consider the fact that I don&#x27;t really feel any pain anymore when epilating, because I have been doing it for so long.    **UPDATE** I did send a message to the company asking them about the moisture comfort technology and the face thing, to which they did not answer any of my questions at all and just said I could send it back for a refund.   In general, this is the best epilator I have used for the leg area, but could definitely be better for underarms.   I would also like to mention that you may want to make sure you really need the rechargable model. I bought it, thinking it would be better, but in reality it works slower when it is not plugged in. The rechargable probably isn&#x27;t really necessary if you always have access to an outlet.</li>
            <li> Oh my, where to start?&lt;br /&gt;So toys is my first ever epilator and I wanted to live this product. I did a little research and read reviews and went with this one to see how I liked it. And it was great, of course it hurt a bit because it is plucking hairs, but if it saves me so much on razors and shaving cream I&#x27;m up for it.&lt;br /&gt;I started with my legs... And about 2 hours, yes literally TWO full hours, later it seemed like I&#x27;d gotten all those hairs. But I was wrong, still more to be plucked on day 2...And 3... Ok, I can deal with that for it being the first time using it. However a week later I notice ingrown hairs on my legs! Gross... never before in my life (28 years) have I ever had ingrown hairs on my calves or shins! So much for smooth beautiful legs for &amp;#34;up to 6 weeks&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I thought I did something wrong to have, honestly about 50 plus ingrown hairs on my lower legs. I read through everything again, went over when to use the 2 different speeds, hold skin tight, move it this way or that, etc. Tried it again. And a week later, same results. I exfoliated twice a week, tried again, same results.&lt;br /&gt;With the amount of time it takes to use this product, and the awful results, I think I save more just shaving 2 or 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 - 10 minutes to shave legs compared to 2 plus hours to make sure you get all the hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really tried to like this product, because who wouldn&#x27;t want to be able to go weeks without having to worry about shaving? But in the end, after 3 months, I&#x27;ve gone back to shaving.</li>
            <li> Not as painful as I imagined it would be. This is effortless to use and is effective for me already.</li>
            <li> Having had this for a year, I can confidently say - this thing is just alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in thinking it would be the end to all my hair removal woes (waxing is too messy and/or expensive, and shaving is too temporary), but hair removal is too complicated a beast to conquer with this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe you need a certain thickness of hair for the product to be able to effectively grasp the hair and rip it out by the follicle.  In my case, my copious but wispy hairs just broke off at the surface and grew back feeling prickly again within a day or two.  It might work better for thicker hairs in your underarms and...other parts, but I can only imagine the agony of having a dozen hairs ripped out per second in those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is no different from waxing for me.  I still have to vigorously exfoliate lest I allow all the ingrown hairs to drive me itching mad, and my skin is still on the cusp of bruising and having tiny red dots at the follicles all over for one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until there&#x27;s a better and more affordable option - good luck, ladies.</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator, worth the money.  I had issues with a cheaper Remington epilator breaking after a few uses, this one is more durable.  While it still hurts, it does hurt less than the other and it has a curve which makes it more effective for more places.  I even used this on my chin and face and neck and got great results, no numbs or redness.  I used it on my armpits and the hair took a long time to grow back AND it grew back more fine than it was.  Using it on my legs is the place that hurts the most but I am trying to make myself get used to it.  Overall this is a great product and I do recommended it.</li>
            <li> A bit loud and of course it hurts a bit, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to even with shorter hair than it says you need.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I can&#x27;t believe how awesome it is! I normally have the type of hair that is a pain to shave because after a clean shave, all it takes is one little goose bump and all the hair magically reappears. Now that I have this, my legs and underarms stay hair-free and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Just one word to anyone looking to buy their first epilator: it hurts like heck the first time you use it but after that first initial shock, you&#x27;ll never go back to your razor! Also it takes some time to get rid of all the hair so you wont be silky smooth at first so dont worry if dont have that instant silky shave feel. I seriously wish I had this 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually tried epilators before in a similar price range (ie Braun) and the pain was so unbearable that it brought me to tears. I was so scared of these things that I absolutely stayed away from them for a few years. I have never tried professional waxing and have horror stories from home waxing. I&#x27;ve tried creams that smell and sting only to leave behind dark roots so visible that it was embarrassing. Shaving works well except the smoothness never lasted for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Epilator works wonders for me. Both my husband (I made him try the other epilators in the past) and I have noticed much less pain with this model. I barely feel this on my legs. I use it on my arms and also barely feel anything. I have used it on hair approximately 1/4 inch long and it still doesn&#x27;t hurt. Of course the optimal length is about 1mm. After one use on my legs it felt as if I had just shaved and moisturized as well. No irritation or redness. True, this doesn&#x27;t get all of your hairs in one pass which is actually good for me because it would hurt too much if it did! I like having to go in circles a couple times so that I would feel less going on down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to the more sensitive areas, there was some discomfort but not unbearable pain as with other epilators in the past. I continued to use circular motions and did one small section at a time. Where there was more or courser hair I had to take my time and do smaller sections....it only makes sense to do this because feeling a few  hairs  pull out is very different from feeling 42 at once. Over time I am sure this will get better (again I&#x27;ve never waxed before just shaved). I have however tried threading for a while and I would probably compare this to the same feeling and discomfort of threading. You feel the thicker hairs being pulled out but it doesn&#x27;t hurt like crazy because only a small area is being worked on at a time. It also helps to use the smaller head for sensitive areas because it only pulls out a small number of hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the two speeds on this unit, I absolutely prefer the high speed for all areas of my body, it just seems to minimize discomfort and making the process quicker. I also want to note that yes, this unit is loud! But it seems to spin faster than other models I&#x27;ve used which could be why I don&#x27;t feel as much. On my bikini area, I take my time doing small sections...and even take breaks or switch sides if I need to. It is very important to hold skin taut! I have a little redness afterwards but that&#x27;s it. I have not tried on my underarms yet so that will be next. ( I have since tried and it&#x27;s a breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this even when my legs and arms are smooth and it still continues to pick up microscopic hairs I didn&#x27;t even feel! It&#x27;s addicting in a way and I use it sometimes when I&#x27;m watching tv (also helps to keep your mind occupied from any discomfort). My biggest complaint is the crappy drawstring bag that doesn&#x27;t hold everything and the lack of a straight head...the curved head makes going in some places difficult. Otherwise the battery life is awesome and cleaning the unit is a easy. It&#x27;s been over a week and my legs look and feel great!t only pulls out a small number of hairs at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the two speeds on this unit, I absolutely prefer the high speed for all areas of my body, it just seems to minimize discomfort and making the process quicker.

            <li> If you turn this so that it&#x27;s going the opposite direction of the hair growth, it does it&#x27;s job perfectly. I think the problem others might have had with it not doing it&#x27;s job might have been that they were not going opposite the direction of the hair growth. As others have noted, you have to use the facial attachment for just about everything because the larger attachment doesn&#x27;t do contours very well. It works everywhere and I agree that it feels a bit like a tattoo gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con is that it leaves the area more raw looking, more bumpy, and more prone to blemishes than regular shaving (and that&#x27;s every area where you&#x27;d like to use this). I have tried exfoliating before, washing afterward, using soothing cream... really, the only thing you can do is use this before you head to bed on a day where you aren&#x27;t going to see many people the next day or have the areas exposed where you used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro is that you don&#x27;t have to pay for waxing or shaving equipment ever again and it does a better job than waxing (mainly because it grabs more than wax)</li>
            <li> I love this worked great the first time. I didn&#x27;t think it hurt at all. Great product! I would recommend this. If I got a nice discount I would buy one for my moms birthday. Its higher on price but great product!!!!</li>
            <li> compre este producto para mi comodidad, y fue dinero perdido, es super doloroso, y no funciona como dicen... no se recomiendo a nadie.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does the job on both legs &amp; face.  Not painful, more like small pricks on the skin.  Handy to pack in the nice drawstring bag that is included.  Recommended to a friend &amp; she likes it, too.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Easy to use and much better than the old puller I was using. I certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As the owner of numerous epilators over the past 2 decades or so, the discomfort of this hair removal method isn&#x27;t new to me.  I have accepted this as part of the trade-off for results that don&#x27;t involve lots of cuts and unsightly band-aids on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last epilator was a Panasonic ES2067W EpliglideULTRA (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DQB2NY/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1), purchased in January of 2009.  Though it never quite thrilled me, I stuck with it due to the sunk cost of $130.  When the battery finally quit, I was thrilled to feel good about splurging on a replacement.  I spent a lot of time researching brands, models, features, etc.  In the end I didn&#x27;t really want any special attachments or a wet/dry capability.  I use my epilator sitting on the sofa reading a book; using it in the shower would use up all 80 gallons of hot water, plus I like being able to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in, if the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this Remington almost 6 months, and it&#x27;s the only hair removal method I use for legs, underarms, and bikini line.  Compared to the Panasonic, it is definitely noisier (but no epilator is whisper-quiet!)  However, it&#x27;s much more effective - a lot fewer passes are needed to remove the hair to my satisfaction.  I don&#x27;t even use it on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting!  Considering the price I paid this time ($49), this product has exceeded my expectations and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who feels committed to using an epilator.  No idea if it would be a good choice for a first-timer since that experience is so far removed in my memory.</li>
            <li> Paid twice as much for my previous epilator. This one works so much better than the Braun I have. Also nice to be chargeable which the Braun isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The device was the color as shown in description.&lt;br /&gt;It was about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;It DID operate while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;I received a used device and chose to return rather than try a the device.&lt;br /&gt;All my money was promptly refunded.&lt;br /&gt;I chose a different brand and ordered directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Initially I tried this torture device and it was completely unbearable. I am half italian with well rooted hair, and lots of it. I could not do this. So I put it in the cabinet and it sat for months. While trying every razor imaginable and having sensitive skin, I did more research and discovered \\&quot;Dr Numb\\&quot;. This stuff works and numbs the skin. Now I can epilate with minimal pain. Though the hair removal doesn&#x27;t last as long as they say, and doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the hair quickly. But once removed it is great to not have to worry about hair for a couple weeks. If you are of a nationality that has hair and it hurts to get ripped out. Buy \\&quot;Dr Numb\\&quot; then give it a try. I really can not understand how people say these things are not that painful. I think it must be my nationality and having very well rooted hair.</li>
            <li> Works great but the hair DOES keep coming back!!!</li>
            <li> enjoy this product cause it removes my upper lip hair but with still a few hairs left on my upper lip removes it quick and fast with a slight pinch or pain enjoy it thank you amazon</li>
            <li> The Remington I had been using for probably more than 20 years finally died.  Looked for a replacement &amp; this fit the bill!  Not very painful the 1st time though it had been months since I&#x27;d been able to use the former one.  Smooth legs at last!</li>
            <li> Great product !  Painful at first.  Spray area with Bactine 10 minutes before using. Works wet or dry. Easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have always shaved before, I went and got waxed once, and that was painful, and it grew back two weeks later.  I bought this and yes it hurts the first time, but every time after is easier since there is less hair.  I go over my legs ever two or three days and pick up random little hairs here and there, so very little pain.  It seems to not be growing back as fast, so I love that.  Two speeds is great, you can choose the speed that works best for you.  Without two speeds you wouldn&#x27;t have options. I love the cordless rechargeable. You could do this while watching tv or wherever.  So flexible,</li>
            <li> This was a product described as new but it came used. It had hairs in the tweezer head, that&#x27;s how I knew. Conveniently, there is no way to contact the seller, only an option to return the product which I did. I was charged for return shipping and no apology from the seller or any contact from them. Not only did I go thru the hassle of picking up the product from a locker but I also had the hassle of returning the product and was charged for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line, don&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon. Buy it in Target or a physical store where you could see for yourself if the product appears new. I was so excited to try this but was equally disgusted when I saw the hairs stuck in the tweezer head. I guess I should be glad the hair was there because who knows if the seller sometimes cleans the returned ones and sell them as &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34; Where do I report something like this?</li>
            <li> has to return it cause it did not work at all for me i got a diff one and that one works great but this did not</li>
            <li> After researching all the epilators, this seemed to be best for my needs and budget. There are enough tweezers to do a good job without several passes. I took ibuprofen to be safe the first time I used it, but the discomfort was minimal. I don&#x27;t take anything now. I have no hair bumps but I exfoliate afterwards.  It feels good in the hand and contours great to my skin. I like the facial attachment and cleanup is simple. I personally like that it is lavendar and silver and feminine looking. I used it on my arms too, and I am very pleased. I never did that with a shaver for fear that the hair would grow back thicker. The only thing that would make it perfect is a light to see all the hairs, but I am very pleased with the purchase and it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I had to keep going over the same spot 10-15 time to get it to work, which left my skin red and raw.</li>
            <li> This epilator might be ideal for you if it&#x27;s your first time epilating or you have had no prior experience with waxing, sugaring, and/or any other method of hair removal from the root. This is one of the most gentle epilators I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s pain free (no epilator is), but it&#x27;s relatively harmless. You can tell that they put emphasis on designing it with comfort what with the aloe vera massaging strip and contoured detachable head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, however you&#x27;re looking for a powerful, thorough epilator, skip the Remington EP6025 because it doesn&#x27;t deliver the most efficient hair removal, even on the second faster speed setting. It&#x27;s slower and took me several rounds to remove all the hair from my calves. It also failed to pick up some finer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator comes with a smaller facial head, charger, cleaning brush, and drawstring bag. The chord was long enough, had no issues with charging or power. I would recommend this epilator if you&#x27;re just getting started out. Epilating is my preferred method of hair removal, the results are really worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel or tea tree oil afterwards help prevent irritation, red bumps and ingrown hairs. Not to mention these are more natural and cheaper alternatives to GiGi no bump and tend skin. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been working on my legs section by section about every other day. The first time you do a section it hurts, but after that you honestly can&#x27;t feel it. Luckily for me I was able to use it one my underarms and it works great. The underarm area hurts way less than the legs. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all when I do my underarms now. They look smooth and stay that way for days and days. Way better than shaving. I wish I had this years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this epilator for almost a year and I love it!  I have not used a razor since I got this system. I have used several systems for hair removal over the years, both chemical and mechanical.  This is the best one I have used.  No, it does not get all the hair in the first pass, but it does get the hair when used according to the directions.  Yes, it hurts to pull out hair, but it is not as painful as other methods and the pain lessens over time. The battery lasts a long time and recharges well.  I use mine once a week and it only take s a couple of minutes.  I use it on my legs, face ( love the little facial attachment), and underarms.  I am very fair and my hair is fair and soft.  This makes most other hair removal methods difficult to use and limits their success.  This product does get the fine hairs.  It also gets those stupid little hairs that appear under the chin after that\\&quot;certain birthday and are impossible to see to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, it&#x27;s easy and fast to use. It&#x27;s neat and compact. The pain factor is minimal.  It is reliable and not expensive.  The benefits certainly out way any discomfort.  I would not hesitate recommending this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Attractive and it works.  I gave it a three only because it is very noisy.  I am not too happy that my neighbors are able to &#x27;hear&#x27; whatever it is I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work effectively and it was expensive! I tried it on my legs and it hurt badly, but didn&#x27;t seem to remove any noticeable hair. I followed the instructions by motioning in circles, etc. but I am thoroughly disappointed.  :(</li>
            <li> It worked well,  but broke within 3 months.</li>
            <li> This was the first epilator I have used.  Of course it hurts any epilator would (it gets better).  I like that I don&#x27;t have to shave and it takes longer for the hair to grow back.  The facial attachment it brings is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it did work and was better than having to go somewhere to have hair removed. Well it does work, but I do find it more painful than any other method. I have done threading and waxing and still find the epilator to be very painful.</li>
            <li> After finally giving up on any chance to replace my Phillips Satinelle Ice with the same product, I purchased 2 or 3 epilators which I was extremely disappointed with. I searched through tons of reviews of various products on Amazon and finally decided on the Remington. I was pleasantly surprised to find it didn&#x27;t hurt at all and initially I suspected this might be because it wasn&#x27;t very effective. I was wrong - it works beautifully and I had both legs done in no time. It does hurt around the bikini area, but short of being anesthetized, there&#x27;s no avoiding that, whatever you use!</li>
            <li> eeeek this thing hurts but it works!</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to figuring out how to use this to achieve the best results, and it does hurt quite a bit at first, but once you get over that it&#x27;s great. It works well, and the pain becomes negligible very quickly. The battery lasts long enough to do both legs at a reasonable pace - at least an hour. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit loud. Since it takes so long to epilate it&#x27;s nice when the epilator is quiet enough to have the TV or radio on, but this product is simply too loud to do anything else while epilating.</li>
            <li> I am loving this.  I used it plugged in, as the first charge is 16 hours and my legs were totally smooth and only three weeks later am I starting to feel some stubble.  I could feel the hair coming out, but would not describe it as at all discomforting or painful.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> If this one ever breaks I would buy it again. I would recommend it to someone looking for something in the 60 dollar price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews here and some on other sites and will confirm from my experiences in owning the product about a month or more the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is loudish but I can listen to my mp3 player via headphones at about 60% volume and hear my books just fine.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not extremely powerful and the angle it&#x27;s used on the legs tends to engage it&#x27;s auto safety to slow it down. So barely touching the skin works better than applying any pressure.&lt;br /&gt;3. Curvy places are harder to effectively do. I found I had to use the facial attachment to do finer details in the armpit area. And that the edge of the chin is difficult.\&lt;br /&gt;4. When cleaning, rinsing the head is nice but sometimes hair gets stuck in the roller thing in the actual unit which can take a while to get out.&lt;br /&gt;5. Deep rooted hair is not picked up but I am comfortable tweezing the one or two it misses.&lt;br /&gt;6. The longer the hair is the more it hurts; however, once used to the pain no hair is safe.&lt;br /&gt;7. Hair regrowth in the beginning was about two to three days later which for me is better than shaving. After using it awhile those hairs take about five days to come in before they are long enough to epilate. When the hairs come back they are lighter in color, thinner/tapered and easier to epilate. There is no bristle pad feeling in the underarms when the hair regrows.&lt;br /&gt;8. I broke out the first time I used it. But now I splash witch hazel on afterwards as my only after care. The redness does last about two hours but I am very fair.&lt;br /&gt;9. It took me about an hour the first time I used it on my face. But now I can routinely get my facial grooming (including eyebrow maintenance with tweezers and trimmer) done in ten minutes. The legs are about fifteen minutes, underarms five.&lt;br /&gt;10. The hair trap catches all hairs about a cm in lengthbut longer than that ends up getting stuck in the tweezers or falling to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;11. DO NOT USE IT BACKWARDS (button side out). It can rip off your skin and break the hair instead of epilating it. I thought I could cheat to get the coarser hairs and it did but it also took some skin when I wasn&#x27;t being careful.&lt;br /&gt;12. I use it unplugged and don&#x27;t need it often enough to know how long it actually takes to charge. The charge only lasts about an hour on the lower setting which for me is plenty of time. I love the travel bag and have re-purposed it for my iphone as I can see and use the phone through the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;13. I have no idea where to get replacement parts if either of the heads break but I can say I have dropped them several times onto linoleum and nothing has happened.&lt;br /&gt;14. I bought mine at Target and it didn&#x27;t have the scroll work on the sides of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a really great product.</li>
            <li> it works good but you do have to go over the area a few times to get most of the hair. i wont lie it really hurt the first time but im slowly getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I had been looking for an epilator with changeable heads, as I wanted neither the clutter nor the investment of having a separate epilator for my face AND body. This product provides the convenience of both at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair on my face, and my main concern was that the Remington will not epilate them at all. When it arrived, it took me at least 20 minutes of running the epilator over my lip area with no real results. I was really upset. Then I used it with the button side facing up (which someone had really warned against doing), but this method worked REALLY well for me. In fact, it worked well in this fashion for my underarm area as well (with the different, bigger head), making both my under arms smooth within a span of 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although I love this product, I am only giving it four stars because it does not pick up my hair when I hold it properly (the button side down) and I was plagued with fear about using it the other way because of the review of this poor lady, who did it the same way and her skin got caught in it. YIKES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason for the four stars is that the tweezer &amp;#34;passage&amp;#34; on the bigger head (meant for the body) is not wide enough. I wish it was wider so that it would epilate more hair in one go, making the process faster. However, this is a good product, and sure beats the mess and time consumption of waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> I love this thing because the results last so long, but you *will* end up with ingrown hairs if you don&#x27;t do something to prevent them.. and btw it really really hurts!!(did I mention that?) But!! If you take it little by little, it really isn&#x27;t that bad. Just be careful of where you use this thing because I used it on my whole arm and ended up with a rash on my inner elbows and ingrown hairs, following.  I don&#x27;t really blame the product/manufacturer since I really probably shouldn&#x27;t have used it on such fine, sensitive hairs, but it is what it is, so be careful where you use this thing!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! THE BEST MACHINE EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERY WOMEN SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IS EASY TO USE, DON´T HURT (IF YOU ARE USE TO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IS JUST GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I RECOMMEND THE SELLER, THE PRODUCT ARRIVED FAST AND SAFE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not one of the highest quality epilators out there. So I can&#x27;t give it 5/5 stars. It is perfect for it&#x27;s price range and quality. Everything was brand new in the package. Works fine. On my skin personally it made me break out a little bit. But I should get use to it with more uses I think. So far, great purchase.</li>
            <li> The epilator worked great on my upper lip, however I am very used to waxing so not too painful. On the other hand, it was terribly painful on my legs and took every bit of 20mins per leg to get most of the hair off, which began returning 3 days later. My biggest issue was how it worked on my bikini area. Maybe I let the hair grow too long, I don&#x27;t know, but it was very very painful and left a huge rash of ingrown hairs which was absolutely disgusting. It left my tissue sore and swollen for several days! I will keep it for use on my lip since its super easy to grab and use (way easier than warming up wax,) but will not use on my legs or bikini area ever ever ever again!!</li>
            <li> I got this mainly for facial hair. I have moderately dark, moderately thick body hair. Unfortunately, the epilator causes bumps on my face a day or two after use. This is improved with post-epilating topical steroid application. I&#x27;ve had the epilator for a few months, and now I mainly use it for my legs. Knees are particularly difficult with this type of tool, given the natural contours. However, it&#x27;s great for lower legs and thighs! It really cuts down on the frequency of shaving (which I still need to do for knees and bikini line). I recommend using a little topical steroid like hydrocortisone on your face or the first time on your legs since a lot of hair removed at once is likely to cause inflammation. It hurts quite a bit with the first use, but after the first time it&#x27;s just like a little sting. Not great for bikini line or armpits in my experience- too painful and irritating. Stick to smooth, more taut areas like legs and it&#x27;s worth it to not have to shave so much.</li>
            <li> After waxing for years, I bought this epilator as a quick fix when I don&#x27;t have time to wax. Used this right out of the box and managed to do one leg before the battery died. But it can be used while plugged in which is a huge plus. I am happy with the results. As far as pain goes, you will feel as though many pins and needles are pricking you but you become numb to it after the first few minutes. I was scared too but not any more. It&#x27;s very much like waxing. The pain is only when the hairs get pulled. I think the results were the same as waxing. The bonus facial epilator that came with this really wasn&#x27;t that much of a help. Did not do much on the area above my upper lip. I will continue to use wax on my face and will not recommend buying the facial epilator if it is sold separately.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. It is a little painful so you have to have a good tolerance for pain. I really like it to epilate my armpits way better than shaving. They feel baby smooth and their getting lighter. Exfoliate and scrub always in the shower than make sure your dry before epilating.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought for my birthday if it would be to painful, but no more pain than plucking your eyebrow.  works great and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator..It&#x27;s a little painful, but that&#x27;s what I expected.  It plucks the hair out &amp; it doesn&#x27;t grow back for quite a while.  The battery lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s really cute!  It seems to get hairs that are pretty short too.. I can&#x27;t get the same results with waxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington 1000 Hair Removal System about five years ago and have literally not shaved since.  I use the epilator for my legs, bikini area, and armpits.  I was devastated when my machine died last month, but must admit I think I love this model even more!  The chargeable feature of this unit is wonderful.  I can epilate on the go without being attached to my outlet.  An absolute must have product!</li>
            <li> So I got this about 2 months ago. My hair grows fast. .. If your looking to purchase this be prepared for the pain. I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat it.. It hurts. Really bad. I can take pain I have the back of my neck pierced.. And this is almost unbearable. But please stick with it, it is worth it. Maybe have a drink or two before. But, like I said my hair grows back fast and thick when i shave...And using this i didn&#x27;t see it for many weeks later. It&#x27;s worth it.. But keep up with it. After your first use you will have the second stage of hair come though.. Keep on it. Every other day if needed. (Hurts less that way) because if you wait for it to grow back it will hurt again. But it seriously hurts to use. If you can&#x27;t take pain.. I advise not to waste your money. If you can then .. Well, it&#x27;s still worse than you can imagine lol but it&#x27;s still worth it. Drink up. Hold skin taught. And sing to whatever music you have playing when you do it.  :)</li>
            <li> like it, just wish it could hold a charge longer</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 years old and I have always been interested in using an epilator to rid myself of all this unwanted hair. I was scared of them. I thought it would hurt too bad and I was always afraid of pinching my skin. I have been shaving, waxing, and tweezing for years!&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE!!!! I love this thing. It is the best hair removal device I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts less and less every time I use it. I have even done my underarms. It is so nice to be able to not have to shave my legs every single day. The results are long lasting. I am thrilled. I will never ever go back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt a little at first, but you get used to it. My husband says I am addicted to it!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he is right. I am addicted to being hair free!&lt;br /&gt;I do suffer from hormone related excess hair growth. I even epilate my arms.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid anymore girls! This is the one to get!</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this for cpl weeks now. She is older and do not  believe in waxing only twee zing . Its great she loves it. Only if u have short hair will not work so Ladies u have to grow that hair out.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little bit after using this. I would do this at night because want ever part of your body you use it on it will have redness for 30 - 60 minutes after. Doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore then waxing. It&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper too! Very Happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33  and I epilate since I&#x27;m 14. For sure I can tell I&#x27;ve tried every method.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today and I already used it, it&#x27;s perfect for every place of your body, it doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done my underarms, my bikini, my legs and even my face and it works perfect, it didn&#x27;t even stayed red for too long. It&#x27;s simply the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;As a proof I used it today for the first time and I phoned a friend to recommend it so I&#x27;m buying another for her.&lt;br /&gt;Great Deal!&lt;br /&gt;And to make the package even more attractive you can wash the heads under the running water as it brings 2, one for the body and the other for the face. It&#x27;s great and worthy.</li>
            <li> Most painful experience of my life. There are people that actually use these? Nothing against the merchant or the brand but I would not recommend epilators in general.</li>
            <li> it definitely hurts. but less the more you do it. did get two pretty gnarly in grown hairs. the thicker the hair the more you have to go over a spot. i had to spend at least 45 mins doing my legs. one swipe probably gets rid of like a sixth of the hair and it hurts so much that you really dont wanna go in for a second swipe</li>
            <li> So I gave it a 3.  I got this last Summer but only after I had shaved, waxed, buffed, tweezed, and creamed the hairs on and under my chin and they had now really thickened up.  But that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem right?  Afterall, this epilator does boast that it can eliminate every hair texture.  It does remove hairs from the root BUT NOT ALL, and I have stuble immediately after use.  It doesn&#x27;t get the hairs that grow flat either, even when I hold the skin taut, and the bonus attachment does nothing for me.  I got very nauseated when I used it the first time, but that has gone away now.  But that&#x27;s just my experience, and I&#x27;m left to wonder if it would&#x27;ve worked better had I used it from the onset.</li>
            <li> Works great on legs, under arms harder to do, some pain on face but not near as bad as I expected.  Will never go back to a razor.  I have been using it about a month.  Should only have to do legs once every 2 weeks.  Hair on face that had been shaved or plucked is coming back lighter and softer.</li>
            <li> This is my first epliator to try.  The guidelines are correct in that the pain gets easier to deal with, but I&#x27;m still working on trying to get that smooth finish.  I keep ending up with tiny bumps.  Maybe because it is winter and my skin is too dry??</li>
            <li> First time using this kind of product. Yes, it is a little uncomfortable as the hairs are remove. But it is much better than the shaving - no cuts! But best of all is no more dry, itchy legs. especially in the winter, I am much more comfortable and best of all saving money! No more slathering lotions and creams constantly or buying expesive razors and shaving creams.</li>
            <li> This epilator works on my legs as well as my face.  It makes it so I spend less money on getting my face &amp; eyebrows threaded and my legs waxed.  It does take a little more time, but I can have smoother legs &amp; face every week instead of once a month.  I like the free facial epilator - I am able to use it rather close to my eyebrows.  Being cordless is a real benefit too.  I have found that using Witch Hazel then some Aloe when I&#x27;m finished helps to calm my skin and reduce redness that naturally occurs when hair is removed at the root.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money . I got 2 of them from 2 different stores and had to return both. It works  good to begin with after few use it just doesnt recharge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with epilators. I have used them as long as I can remember. Unwanted disgusting hair gone in minutes and u won&#x27;t regret buying this product. So forget about shaving and waxing and get urself an epilator. Enjoy ur hair free body.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t use it at all because it&#x27;s just too painful it&#x27;s almost like a torture machine!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this. I chose it based on the reviews of others. Works better than I expected. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve done laser treatment or even gotten a tattoo, this is just fine.  It does pull and hurts in the moment but the pain immediately goes away.  I use it once a week and rarely shave the days in between.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the facial tool.</li>
            <li> I e-mailed the manufacturer for directions since they didn&#x27;t come with my order.  That was three weeks ago and I still haven&#x27;t heard back from them.  Guess I&#x27;ll try a phone call now.</li>
            <li> This thing is so loud I actually was afraid to put it near my skin! But all in all it&#x27;s not very effective at pulling all the hairs out. I had to wait for 6 hours to use it again because of all the bumps from the hair being pulled. But! Even after doing it a second time I had to use Veet to get the rest.</li>
            <li> I actually love it more than I was expecting. It is at first a bit painful of course but it is a lot less than the one I had before. I decided to buy this one because mine wasn&#x27;t working any more. So of course, like other users, at first I noticed my hairs were not growing back well enough, they would be under the skin and I could not use the epilator on those. But I get used to alternate between one session with this and using a blade. For some reason, after several months of use, I don&#x27;t need to do that any more. I tried recently the smaller head for smaller regions and it works very well (I couldn&#x27;t do it with my previous one because it would hurt me a lot). So, I would definitively recommend anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend the money and the time to go on an institute to buy this. Also, speaking of time, it is very quick. The fact that you can use it while it is plugged is definitively an addition.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing, it does exactly what I need it to do, remove hair, being a brunette, I hate being a hairy woman, I use this on my legs, arm pits, face attachment is marvelous. The first time I used it, it was a little rough, not knowing what to expect, it feels a little like waxing, but after the first initial treatment is over and done, each time I use it, it is faster, easier, and what an awesome result you get, I have found I use mine, then shower and use my lotions and it leaves my skin soft, even shiney. I never plan on being without this, I have never tried using it while in the shower so I cannot say how that works, but if your looking for a inexpensive way to remove hair and keep your skin looking great and hairless, Buy this product, my husband bought me this as my request for valentines day, it is the best gift ever. Thanks Remington for making a womans product that does a mans job.lol.</li>
            <li> This is such a terrific machine!  As others have said, I wish I had this 10 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 66 years old and way past menopause, the &#x27;cute&#x27; ever-so-tiny peach fuzz on my face that had never bothered me before began to proliferate and lengthen.  It was awful to look in the mirror and actually be able to see it, even though my eyesight is also going.  I dreaded what other people with better vision may have thought.  And, worst of all, my lady sideburns which never caused me problems began to be very noticeable and difficult to manage.  I could no longer tuck that hair neatly behind my ears.  It looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing did not help.  It just wouldn&#x27;t grab those super-fine blonde hairs.  Shaving was definitely not an option.  I even tried using a regular tweezers, but it wouldn&#x27;t catch the peach fuzz.  I was distraught, to put it mildly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Remington Epilator today and my life is changed - for the better and permanently!  Wish I had known about it 10 years ago.  The peach fuzz is GONE!!  And my lady sideburns are a thing of the past.  I am so grateful.  This fabulous little machine may not be able to give me a facelift, but it sure as tootin&#x27; lifted my spirits.  For the first time in years, I actually feel &#x27;clean&#x27;.  I cannot stress enough how important something like this is to a woman in her later years.  There&#x27;s enough to fret about, and plenty to remind me that I&#x27;m getting old.  I certainly have one less thing to bother me.  I&#x27;m so happy I honestly feel rejuvenated to some extent.  I highly recommend this product to other women who are noticing changes due to lower estrogen levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I would like to reiterate what so many other reviewers have said: The first time you use it, it HURTS!  It did not hurt my legs and actually felt good, but on my face, that&#x27;s a different story altogether - it HURT my poor face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a suggestion based on my personal experience: Ever so lightly touch the machine to the area you&#x27;re epilating.  You&#x27;ll feel like tiny needles are piercing your skin.  That will go away as you remove the hairs.  The most sensitive area was my upper lip.  I just would briefly and lightly touch the machine to my lip and pull it away when it hurt.  I was able to get through it.  Once the hairs are gone, the machine head glides smoothly over the skin.  That&#x27;s when I knew I got all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust that it will get much easier to use, now that I&#x27;m through the first, and worst, session.  And, I feel that the results are well worth the trouble of that first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I noticed is that the extremely super fine peach fuzz that should be on the face is still there, but is normal and not noticeable at all.  I think that these nearly microscopic hairs help keep a gal&#x27;s makeup in place, LOL.re epilating.  You&#x27;ll feel like tiny needles are piercing your skin.

            <li> Ouch, no product that rips out your hair by the root will ever be painless, but it does get better after you get used to it.  I did get ingrown hairs under the top layer of skin even though I exfoliated.  I finally fixed that problem by getting a pumice stone.  Apparently I need extreme exfoliation.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because of it&#x27;s advertising of moisturizing.  It does not moisturize and I wonder why it even claims to do so.  It has no liquid coming out of it and you can&#x27;t use it wet?</li>
            <li> Painful but it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun SE 5180 Silk for a few years now.  It was my first epilator so I&#x27;ve had nothing to compare it to until I recently bought this Remington.  It hurt, but my reasoning was that no matter how you rip hairs out from the root it&#x27;s going to hurt, right?  How could different epilators be any more or less painful?  But I kind of wanted a new one, this one was on sale and I read something about it supposedly being \\&quot;less painful\\&quot;.  That would be great, I thought, but mostly I was sold on the generally great reviews and really great price (less than half the price of the Braun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that this epilator is SO MUCH less painful to use than my Braun ever was!  I don&#x27;t understand how, couldn&#x27;t begin to explain it, can hardly believe it, but wanted to let others know my experience.  I remove hair from all over my body (yes, all of it, even there) with my epilator.  My Braun may well clear more hair per swipe, but for me that doesn&#x27;t compare with how much less painful this one is.  With the Braun, I would have to take little breaks throughout the session because of the pain; I don&#x27;t have to do that with this one.  Less pain, less time, less money &#x3D; great purchase!</li>
            <li> really hurts like  I don&#x27;t know what. I had to go over a spot 6 times and still missed hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommed this product. It works for the spots it will pull out but leaves a whole lot more. Plus legs get really red and sore. Waxing works better then this if you choose to pull out hairs. It would take me hours and hours to do my legs with this. I returned it wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I am new to epilators.  I know so many of my friends that are using it, but I just learned about it not too long ago.  I was tired of razor burns and needing to shave pretty much every day since the hair grows so fast! I decided to try this epilator out since the price was reasonable and you get 2 heads (large one for the body and a mini one for the face).  Also it came with a brush to clean and a bag ^_^ I use this for my underarms only since it doesn&#x27;t really do a great job on my legs, I find.  The first time I used this, man did it HURT! I won&#x27;t lie ladies...when you first start using epilators, it hurts!!! After a while, your skin gets used to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I epilate about 1-1.5x a week. I have been using epilators for a couple years now and i don&#x27;t find it hurts anymore.  I also have the emjoi emagine(red one) and while it does have more tweezers, I think the remington S&amp;S does a better job at pulling the hairs from the roots.  I don&#x27;t find my hairs grow back as quickly as they do with the Emojoi one.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that good. I had before many epilator and so far is the Braun brand is the best. The head is curved and that&#x27;s why is hard to do in some of the body part. You have to do over and over in the same sports. Little less pain than the other brands, and that&#x27;s why I know isn&#x27;t do good job. If You are looking something for something painless buy it or just shave. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Love the Remington Epilator! My old Emjoi Spilator had less tweezers and went through many batteries. The Remington EP6025 has double time tweezers and a charger which saves me so much money instead of batteries! It also comes with a smaller interchangeable head for smaller areas and more accuracy. The brush it comes with makes cleaning easy and I throw everything in the strong little sack it comes with for easy travel. I Love it!</li>
            <li> This kicks waxing&#x27;s because you can do it at your convenience, there is little mess, and the hair does not have to be that long.&lt;br /&gt;Every woman in Canada has one of these.  Why don&#x27;t we use them in the USA?  My first time was so painful, I was screaming.  Especially when I did my underarms, I was sweating and dieing.  But now I have fantastic results with my underarms and it hurts 70% less.  The hairs are about half the thickness they were after doing this for 6 months (i alternate with shaving), even bald in the center area.  I never thought that was possible since I have some thick thick hair there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for my arms.  The first time I did it, it hurt like hell and I had a lot of big bumps on my arms. The bumps were itchy so i scrathed them and made about 5 scars.  But now I don&#x27;t get the bumps or pain on my arms.  On my legs it works great. I can go a solid week without seeing hair come back. I get red spots all over my legs for about half a day but they heal and go away.  Certain areas on my body are naturally very prone to ingrown hairs, even if I waxed or shaved (back of thieghs, outside of calfs, and bikini area).  My bikini area ingrown hairs turn to scars for some reason so i stopped epilating there.  The ingrown hairs on my legs I let grow long and ugly until i can scratch them free.  I am considering  using glycolic acid to help with this in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help the pain, go running before to get some endorphines, then take a warm shower and epilate.  Shaving long hairs like on the arms for the first time can help too, so that the epilator is less likely to break the hair and instead rip it from the root like its supposed to.  To help heal the skin afterwards, I don&#x27;t both with expensive products.  I just use olive oil.  Don&#x27;t use deoderant for like half day until after you epilated your underarms or it will hurt like hell and you&#x27;ll get more of those harmful deoderant chemicals in your body.</li>
            <li> Had this product for a long time and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet, that alone impessed me. Love that it doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in to work because I highly dislike when cords get in the way. The only con would be that I had to go over the fine hairs more than once or just had to pluck them myself, which is fine since I did that before I got it, so it does make the work easier. For the price I got it, I really don&#x27;t have anything to complain about. It lasts and it works great, and that&#x27;s all I want in a product so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts a bit but each time i use it, it hurts less.  The remingtion is very good and the service was great--as was the price. I was hesitant to select it because the price was less than a few others.  I works better that one I paid more for prior to this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my smooth skin after using this. I am not going to lie, it hurts at the beginning but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is such an upgrade from the original epilators from years ago. I was pleasantly surprised and love it! Even my young daughters are using it! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> i was surprised, considering the low cost of this item, was sure it probably wouldnt work (and have never used one before), but just the opposite! I LOVE it &amp; it works great!!  And.... if you use Olay Total Effects Age Defying Wet Cleansing Cloths after, within an hour the pain &amp; redness are gone!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years to find something I could do at home to get rid of facial hair and this has solved the problem.  It is ouchy at first but my skin has become used to it.  Be sure and read the directions and don&#x27;t press it into your skin but glide it on top; even so, my upper lip is very tender.  Since I only need to use every week or so and the sting lasts for seconds, it is very worth it.  No rashes or breakouts, no stubble, and smooth facial skin!  I also use it on my legs but I&#x27;m not brave enough to try underarms or bikini areas.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me for over a year and I still use it. I have not had any reaction or skin break out. I use this and only follow with an actual shave if I am going to be wearing a dress or shorts so I am extra smooth.</li>
            <li> First of all, legitimate product that comes as described, well made and durable. This product is definitely 5 stars, but what I wanted to learn about most when I looked into this was epilating in general, so that&#x27;s mainly what I&#x27;ll write about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped shaving (save touch-ups or emergency situations lol) for a lot of reasons. Save resources, save money, and I have sensitive skin that got really irritated so aesthetically it was never a big step up in the underarm or bikini areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving money and resources:&lt;br /&gt;definitely 5 stars. This is a great medium priced epilator, especially with the included facial attachment. For a down payment of about $50, it&#x27;s a great investment because I RARELY buy razors or shaving cream anymore. I&#x27;ve had it for about 9 months and whatever shaving stuff I had then has lasted me til now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my skin:&lt;br /&gt;4 stars. Things are very smooth and no in-grown hairs develop for about a week wherever I use it, though I don&#x27;t use it on my underarms so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Right after use your pores are very red (but don&#x27;t hurt), but that disappears in hours/overnight to become very smooth. When they do come, not nearly as many as shaving, and they come before any hair grows back which means if you exfoliate and stuff your skin has time to recover before you have to epilate again. Much better than shaving, which was a bi-daily thing to stay on top of hair removal and shaving irritated skin is the worst. Works GREAT for facial stuff! I can use it on my face/whole upper lip and go out immediately after, no irritation. But definitely moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain...&lt;br /&gt;yea it hurts when you start out each time. Trimming long hair is definitely a good idea, as is doing this right after washing with hot water. I usually do it right when I get out of the shower and keep a towel hot to use after some time has passed, it really relaxes/loosens your skin. There was some bleeding in the bikini area which took me a long time to get the nerve to do, but not worse than waxing. Always keep it charged! The battery is great and lasts a while but it will gradually loose steam which you won&#x27;t notice, and the whole process is SO MUCH faster and less painful when it&#x27;s fully charged. I have a decent tolerance for pain, and I&#x27;ve found that if you do the whole area in one shot, you get used to it once you get going and it&#x27;s not a big deal, especially if you distract yourself with music/tv/alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair removal results:&lt;br /&gt;4.7 stars. It&#x27;s definitely an investment of time and energy to do this (to do whole bikini area and legs after 4+ weeks, about an hour. After 2 weeks, 30 min max!), but I&#x27;ve found every two weeks is enough to keep hair totally removed (real smoothness lasts about a week). The hair grows back thin and fine at first, so if you stay on top of it it&#x27;s not nearly as painful and takes far less time. I&#x27;m a brunette and while my arm hair etc is pretty light and fine, years of shaving has made my leg hair very dark and course and thick comparatively. After 3-4 weeks my leg hair looks like my arm hair, after that it starts to come in heavier. I was hoping it would last a little bit longer before getting thick, which is why it&#x27;s not 5 stars, but people say the longer you epilate the less frequently you have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5 stars, mainly because it met my expectations, I feel like my money is well spent, and I much prefer it to shaving and waxing, so it&#x27;s the best option. Epilating in general kind of sucks, but if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t want to shave every day, and don&#x27;t want to continuously throw money and resources down the drain with disposable products, it&#x27;s worth it, and this is a great choice for it.</li>
            <li> The first time you use this, it&#x27;s a bit mean to you, but for maintenance, it&#x27;s perfect. Not too painful at all. I haven&#x27;t shaved since I bought it during the summer and purposefully waited to post my review until I&#x27;d used it several times. Works great. When this one dies, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> I knew it would hurt, and yes it did, a lot! but what I didn&#x27;t expect what the aftermath. Yes my legs were smooth for 2 weeks, but once the hairs grew back... nearly ALL OF THEM were ingrown... I spent hours trying to get rid of them all. not sure I would use this product again unless I knew next time they wouldn&#x27;t be ingrown.... Very annoying.</li>
            <li> I used a phillips satinelle for years before i got this last month. I hesitated whether i should again get a phillips or a braun, as we think more expensive is better. But it doesn&#x27;t always work that way. I love this product. Fast, easy to clean, practical with cordless property. I use it for my facial hair, too. It gives me more than i was looking for. I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this this epilator.  It&#x27;s actually the first one I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it has truly lived up to the ratings.  I haven&#x27;t had much luck with use on the underarms, but I get great results on the legs, bikini area, and forearms.  It is painful in certain places, but, to be honest with you, it doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than getting a tattoo, with the same most sensitive areas.  I love that the epilator is both corded and cordless.  The first use took much longer than I expected, so I had to plug in the device to finish the job - great that I didn&#x27;t have to wait hours for it to recharge!  And, it&#x27;s one of the more affordable epilators with good ratings on Amazon.  I read in a fashion magazine&#x27;s blog (can&#x27;t remember which one) that this particular one was given very high ratings, especially for use on the bikini area!  I definitely recommend giving this epilator a try, and, if you happen to not like it, you really aren&#x27;t out as much as you would be by purchasing a Braun or Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love that it can be used with the cord and also with rechargable battery.  Comfortable to hold, as with any epilator it will hurt when you use it....but results are worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an epilator.  I chose this one based on the positive reviews and because it comes with two heads, one for the face and one for the legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on my face first, mustache area and chin as well as cheeks and jawline, which took about 30 minutes. I have &amp;#34;peachfuzz&amp;#34; on my face that&#x27;s been driving me nuts for years.  I used a face cleanser with an expholiator, and then a toner before I used the epilator.  After I used the epilator, I sprayed my face with toner again and moisturized my face.  It hurts, but not as much as I thought it would.  In fact, you really get used to it after a few minutes.  It works best if you do a small area at a time and just keep going over that area until it is smooth, then move on to the next area.  I only used it once on my face, it&#x27;s been 3 weeks and my face is still pretty much hair free.  I could probably use a little touch up on the mustache area and will do that today.  The smaller head for the face works really well because of the curves of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about an hour to do my legs.  I let the hair grow out for several days so it would be long enough for the tiny tweezers to pick up. I scrubbed my legs with a loofa pad before I used the epilator.  Again, you should do a small area at a time, then move on to another area.  It hurt more on my legs than my face, don&#x27;t know why.  It left my legs incredibly smooth.  I have skinny legs and knick myself a lot with razors, so the epilator is a great option for me.  After a week my legs felt a little sticky so I used the epilator again, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much the 2nd time.  My legs are still very smooth a week after the 2nd use.  I&#x27;m thinking this is awesome.  I used to shave my legs daily because I can&#x27;t stand hair on my legs.  I also sprayed my legs with a toner immediately after I used the epilator, then put lotion on them.  There was a very mild burning sensation after I used the epilator, but the toner and lotion took care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love my new Epilator and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  I won&#x27;t be using razors anymore.  It takes more time to use the epilator, but you don&#x27;t have to use it very often and it leaves your skin much smoother than a razor for a much longer time.  It also takes care of that embarrassing facial hair that I would normally pay a salon to wax. I just plug this one in and use it.  I know you can plug it in and charge the battery, but it won&#x27;t stay charged long enough to do my legs.  Using it while it&#x27;s still plugged in ensures full power the entire time I use it.</li>
            <li> I researched epilators for hours before I decided on this one, and I am SO glad that I did! It&#x27;s smooth, very easy to hold, has two removable and washable heads (long for legs, short for sensitive areas such as armpits and face), can be used with or without the cord, has two speeds, is not super loud (to me it seems to be slightly louder than an electronic toothbrush), and comes with a silky silver bag and very small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about the pain factor because everyone says that it hurts the first time you use it, but as soon as I started using it I was pleasantly surprised that I could hardly feel it! I think the only place on my legs that pinched was right around my ankles, but it&#x27;s such a tiny and fleeting pinch that I didn&#x27;t even mind. Seriously, it&#x27;s not bad at ALL (unless you have the pain tolerance of a flea, I suppose)!&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my armpits, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck, to be honest. I even waited three days for the hairs to get longer and the small epilator head still didn&#x27;t pick them up, for the most part. I ended up tweezing instead (which, by the way, is a HUGE pain in the neck--literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I LOVE the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day anymore and that my skin is so smooth to the touch! I wholeheartedly recommend buying this epilator! It&#x27;s a great investment for a fantastic price (with free Super Saver shipping, no less)!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful for this epilator and wanted to try it when my emjoi epilator quit since these are less expensive. That was a mistake, this removes hardly any hair when doing one circle. You can spend 5 minutes on one circle area and all the hair still won&#x27;t be removed. It&#x27;s pretty weak strength wise, sounds like it&#x27;s dying compared to other epilators. While it&#x27;s cheaper than the better ones, it&#x27;s a piece of crap. I would much rather spend 30 dollars more to get an emjoi (the best if you have coarse, hard to remove hair), go for the 72 tweezer one and you&#x27;ll be happy. Mine lasted 2 years before I needed to replace it. This one is best for people with fine hair probably. Really disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am tired of wasting money on razors. It hurt the first time I used it because I let my leg hair grow out while waiting for this to arrive and it was a little too long. After the initial hair removal, I have gone about 3 weeks between epilating and it is painless. I was a little peeved to find a cheaper epilator at my corner drugstore. After reading reviews on that one I am glad I bought this one because this one is more efficient and less painful.</li>
            <li> this does not work. I get a closer shave when I use my razor. After using this, your legs feel stubbly all over. It does not give a close shave and does not remove hair from the roots. It just removes the top layer like a regular razor. My purpose in buying an epilator was so I would not have hair stubble. I still have hair stubble, even more than I did when using regular razor. I would not recommend this product to anyone. There is no pain when using it but that is because it does not pull the hair out. It only shaves the top layer of hair and the next day, you have to use it again. the legs do not feel smooth after using this product. They feel like you used a razor that does not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Love it. This is the 4th epilator I&#x27;ve owned and the second on of this brand. This is the Best!!</li>
            <li> What I like:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cordless!  You can use it with the cord or without. The power is sufficient either way.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment is pretty nice.  It&#x27;s a good for your upper lip but it&#x27;s not precise enough for eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;It has two speeds.&lt;br /&gt;The head is detachable and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike:&lt;br /&gt;It has two speeds but they are pretty much fast and super fast.  For sensitive areas I would prefer a slower, less scary, speed.&lt;br /&gt;The curve of the top makes it very difficult to get under your arms.  It&#x27;s also very large...so if you are a small person good luck maneuvering it on parts that aren&#x27;t flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because I have the worst time getting all the hair out from under my arms.  That&#x27;s mostly what I use it for so I would never buy this again.  Also, I am pretty sure the fast speeds cause more hairs to break than are removed from the root.  Since I got this I have been getting ingrown hairs on my legs...something that never occurred with my other epilator.</li>
            <li> I love it. Highly recommend to everyone. This was my first buy after lot of search and i am glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product and how effective it would be at hair removal, but I found that it does a great job even on the tiniest hairs on my face.  It also cuts my time significantly because I used to pluck things by hand.  Now I can quickly pluck my arms, legs, bikini line, and face. I also use it on my underarms to reduce the &#x27;shadow&#x27; look that comes from overshaving.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used these type of shavers for years and i love how smooth my legs are. i saw this one with the wet/dry feature and wanted to give it a try and i love it</li>
            <li> This product has worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the last 10 years. Razors stopped giving me a smooth shave when I was 15 I just put up with it for a year. I tried Nair and found that I have a nasty allergy to it. I tried electric razors, I tried multi blade razors they all left stubble behind and the very next day it was as if I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all. The epilator removed all the hair including the stubble left behind by other products I consider to be inferior. I must warn you though the process does hurt quite a bit but to me it&#x27;s worth it to have a smooth shave with no prickly feeling when my legs are touched.&lt;br /&gt; My favorite thing about the epilator is it leaves smooth skin behind and no more ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite thing is the pain while using the product and the wealts left behind (they go away after a few hours)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I was expecting, but I found this product to be just ok. I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, so it may an amazing product and I just don&#x27;t know... The product came with no packing slip or receipt of any kind, it was open when I received it, and some gross looking couple in a personal van dropped it off at my house (he was wearing no shoes and had on a dirty cutoff shirt.. weird). Needless to say, I was pretty wary of using it after that, but I tried it out anyways. Some background before I get too far into the review: I have never used an epilator, but I do shave and I have waxed in the past. I got this product for mainly my legs and underarms, but hoped it would be good enough for other areas. I have coarse hair all over. When I shave, the hair grows back within hours so I hoped this product would be the solution to my stubbly problems. I have used it once so far, but was unable to finish using it. I followed the instructions for how to prepare to use the product; I exfoliated, let my hair grow out just a bit, I tested my tolerance by using tweezers to pluck test hairs (I didn&#x27;t feel anything when plucking), I held my skin taught, and I used slow circular motions against the growth direction. In spite of this, it felt like it was pinching my skin and it took several passes to get the hairs. I tried different speeds and motions and angles, but it still felt like it was just pinching my skin in the tweezers instead of actually pulling the hairs out. I hope that it&#x27;s just because it is my first time using it.. I will use it a couple more times and post an update, but I may end up returning it for a refund.. If anyone has tips for me, I would appreciate it&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> She likes it for her underarms but too slow for the legs...feels like it was cutting the hair instead of pulling from the root.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I love it.  Easy to use and clean.  Not to mention it&#x27;s not as noisy as the previous epilator I had.</li>
            <li> The first use is a little painful but after that not bad. After five uses my skin is softer &amp; hair is not as course. I am very pleased &amp; happy I got it.</li>
            <li> This device totally exceeded my expectations. I got my first-ever brazilian a month ago, and since then I&#x27;ve been driving myself crazy with tweezing and at-home waxing kits to keep up with new growth. I was a little scared to try this at first, because who wants a bunch of rotating metal and rubber pieces on their delicates, but my fear was for nothing. It didn&#x27;t hurt almost at all -- just a little pinch now and then, but this epilator got done in about ten minutes what would&#x27;ve taken me an hour to do with tweezers. If you&#x27;ve never gotten a bikini wax before, I would recommend going that route first, as I think it would be tough to use this on hair that&#x27;s never been removed before. But once it&#x27;s gone the first time, this thing makes maintenance a dream.  I did try it out on my legs and it was about ten times more painful than in the bikini area, which was surprising. I&#x27;ll probably stick to shaving there. But as for everything else: I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to go back to the salon. Yay!</li>
            <li> Ok so Ive always been afraid of pain so i didnt even start waxing until september of 2012 ,but its so expensive so i looked into epilators and saw this one and saw all the good reviews and noticed walgreens has it for 29.99 so i bought there and i just used it .. Im not going to lie its loud and intimidating so i started with the bikini area and it didnt hurt at all just little stings and once you start going inward it hurts worse and worse but it gets every single hair and its so worth it . It leaves you extra smooth even better than a wax.. With waxing i could still see the hair underneath the skin but with this no hair is visible definetly worth it and im sure with time ill get used to the pain!!!!! Absolutely love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the epilator that I had years ago. I like that it came with two heads. It does smart a bit using it on underarms, but not as bad as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  I have done the waxing, sugaring and had other epilators, so I have had experience with the pain you can experience from this way of hair removal. Before I purchased this epilator I did my homework and read the reviews. But I still expected that I would be cringing with pain the first time I used this. I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m not saying that is was painless but it certainly did not hurt the way other epilators or waxing processes have. And that says a lot!!! And it is a nice solid feeling device. Good quality for your money.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get used to &amp;#34;the pain&amp;#34;, but after about the 3-4 time using it the pain wasn&#x27;t so bad.  I have had the Epilator now for about 6 weeks and only have to use it about once a week, if that.  Much better than having to razor shave/electric shave every other day!  I think my favorite thing besides having such smooth legs is that there are no &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about knicking myself and bleeding anymore.  I highly recommend the Remington Epilator!</li>
            <li> I was so afraid of this thing it took me months to actually use it. Now it&#x27;s old news and I celebrate mustache Monday. As a woman in menopause I don&#x27;t relish the idea of having a mustache as noticeable as my husband&#x27;s. That said there is a bit of an art to using this scary thing. First and foremost this machine is actually multiple TWEEZERS! Don&#x27;t smash it against your skin. When you press it against your skin it flattens the hair and it can&#x27;t grab it. Make sure that it is fully charged. Start with the lower speed until you get the hang of it. Yeah yeah it hurts, it makes your eyes water but the more you do it the easier it gets. I can now go high speed and have mustache and those lovely chin hairs done in less than 2 minutes. Make sure that you keep the tweezers clean. When you pull hair out by the root you get skin with it, whether it&#x27;s microscopic dry skin or the root itself, it sticks to the tweezers which keeps them from closing properly and pulling the hairs out efficiently. My fabulous husband bought me this wonderful magnifying glass with a light in it from Ultra Optix, it shows up a lot of ugly including fabric fibers, skin, hair. It shows up what you don&#x27;t want to know but really need to know. So clean it. Make sure that the epilator is NOT on the charger. Remove the tweezer head from the body of the epilator. I use an old soft toothbrush and warm water to scrub mine then inspect it with the magnifier until it&#x27;s clean. Pat it dry with a clean towel, don&#x27;t rub it, you just got the fibers out. Let it dry for a couple of minutes, put it back together and turn it on high to get it a bit dryer then leave it for about 30 minutes before you plug it back in.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor.  It stings a little bit when  you first use it.  It depends on how long the hair follicle is as to how much it hurts.  Better than a regular razor though.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  Quick, clean and painless.  I have  been using similar products since my teen years, this is the best one yet.  Works with long hair or short hair well.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THE MAKER BECAUSE IT HAD A WARNING ON THE BOX SAYING DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE A HEART PROBLEM.  TOO BAD THEY DIDN&#x27;T MENTION THIS BEFORE I ORDERED IT,  OTHERWISE, I WOULD NOT BE WRITING THIS BAD REVIEW.</li>
            <li> A real piece of crap. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I had always used shavers before and so it was quite a different experience trying this out. I must admit, I was more than a bit intimidated when I first turned it on. lol. And the first time using it was.... not fun. But each of the times I&#x27;ve used it after that first time has been less and less painful (hairs don&#x27;t grow at the same rate, plus the skin adapts). Every now and then I still use my shaver, but I mostly use this now. It&#x27;s very handy when I don&#x27;t feel like shaving every single day, my legs are already smooth from using it the day prior!</li>
            <li> This product is good to use. Good value for money. I would recommend it to women who are looking to have great skin, free of all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I had a small cheap one (different brand to try it out) and i hated it, then i got this one and i love it, it leaves the skin super smooth and he hair grows back thinner</li>
            <li> This item works like wounder. I dont have to shave for almost a month. I would recommend it to anyone who does not like shaving, But its a bit painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty convenient and quick... at least for the non-sensitive areas!  I haven&#x27;t tried my bikini line yet, but I&#x27;m also very sensitive to pain.  It&#x27;s a nice way to stay neat between waxing appts!</li>
            <li> Imagine ripping out an entire eyebrow all at once and you have some idea of what this might feel like on on a leg or underarm...all I can think of is a searing OUCH and that is exactly what this Epilator does...It hurts like the devil!  I used it once and didn&#x27;t get to a second pass on my right leg when I almost passed out from the pain!  I cannot imagine using this on a bikini line or other sensitive area of the body. I&#x27;ll stick to my tried and true razor.  No...I cannot recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It hurts like nothing else though. I have only used it on my upper lip so far and I physically cannot handle the pain beyond the dark course hairs at the corner of my mouth on my upper lip. Going further up into the finer dark hairs on my upper lip is far too painful as of 4am today. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to do it. Even with me barely touching the device to my skin (since it grabs onto the hairs before the device actually touches skin) is extremely painful. And no it does not work well with long facial hair even if it is course. I did briefly try it on my chin because I had just noticed a very long course dark hair there and it wouldn&#x27;t pick it up. It does whip it around and catches then releases it before it pulls it out.  So yeah I will need to trim those horrible hairs prior to epilating them the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The courser hairs do not hurt nearly as bad as the fine ones. I only attempted using the slower speed (which is still pretty darn fast)... I&#x27;m not sure if the higher speed would have been less painful on my upper lip? But this was just my VERY FIRST time ever using an epilator anywhere on my body. I&#x27;m pretty scared to attempt it after I sleep for the night. Maybe later tomorrow I&#x27;ll have more guts or pain threshold or something but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is easy to use. When charging it the red light will never go out signaling it&#x27;s fully charged, which I think is really a con of this device. The user guide says to charge it a minimum of 16 hours prior to first cordless use. I charged it for a day and a half (mainly because I was scared to use it). I do wish that red light would go off or change to green or something to signal a full charge. But oh well. I guess it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator head is very easy to change to the precision head (for face/bikini area). Just press the big white button near the top of the device and the head pops off. You do have to kind of look at the bottom ofthe epilator head to see which way the head snaps on. But that&#x27;s easy, there are two plastic hook/catch thing and one is short, one is long. Just line them up. It snaps on easily and securely.  The button on the device is a little weird. You have to press in on the little button in the center of the speed button to unlock the button so that it can be moved from the lock/off position. It takes just the right amount of pressure to move it to the first/slowest speed. The first few times I turned it on it went straight up to the faster speed since the button slide mechanism is too lax. Personally I&#x27;d rather have a button to press to switch between speeds not a slider mechanism. But that would cost more money to implement I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems like a quality machine. Only time will tell though. I&#x27;m not sure if I will attempt to do my legs with it. I mainly got it for my face and chin. I wanted a rechargeable device that could do the face and the only products I saw that were available for the face-only were battery operated or if it did do face as well as other body areas the reviews were not as good as this product (such as a Braun epilator caused people to bleed.) So that was why I chose this product over the others. If I really decide I love this device and I get used to the pain I will change my review to reflect that. So far I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Mainly I drop one star because of the horrible pain factor. Though I do not see any blood on my lip and minimal redness compared to the redness that happens when I wax. And I refuse to use depilitory creams on my upper lip because last time I had horrible white bumps all on my upper lip wherever I applied the cream and those bumps lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> After a heap of research I decided on this which was $40 cheaper than my last epilator that broke when I used it overseas,yes with the correct adapter.I like this one much better faster speeds,less pain! Did I mention it took me a month to purchase a replacement.Put it this way if you don&#x27;t believe we are related to apes,you would if you&#x27;d seen my legs! This does the job great plus the facial head is a bonus I didn&#x27;t know I needed! They all say hair supposed to stay away for up to 4 weeks of course this isn&#x27;t true.But maintaining is so much easier.Just every few days and I&#x27;m good.Well worth the money I spent on it Ive always hated shaving!</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of razors, an electric razor and self-waxing using Nad&#x27;s.  I have coarse, dark hair that grows quickly and my skin is fair. Nad&#x27;s gave me the best, longest lasting results but it was such a mess, took about around an hour every time and my legs would be bumpy and red for a day or so after.  I wanted to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at reviews for several of the top epilators on Amazon, I decided to give this Remington a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I&#x27;ve been using the epilator for about a month and have already noticed a difference.  The hair is still growing but there&#x27;s noticeably less. I don&#x27;t think using the epilator is painful at all, especially if you have ever done waxing.  After, I might be a little spotty, but it clears up quickly. I tend to get ingrown hairs, and from what I can tell, I&#x27;ve been getting less using the Remington than when I was using Nad&#x27;s.  Also, you can go over a spot more than once to get missed hairs, unlike waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;~I use an electric razor and then wait two days before using the epilator - this seems to leave me with the perfect length of hair.  If the hair is longer, I definitely feel a tug/pinch.&lt;br /&gt;~Starting at the bottom of your leg, go in very small circles while slowly moving up your leg to ensure you are catching the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;~Taking a warm shower does seem to help the hair come out a little easier, but it works even if your legs are &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;~I&#x27;ve been using this anywhere from 1-3 times a week.  I have a feeling if I were more consistent that the results would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective under my arms. I used both the small and large attachment, it took a lot of passes and did pinch the skin every so often.  I ended up using tweezers to clean up at the end but it did make the task a little easier.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this sooner!  Love the way it works. It took a few uses to get use to it but I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with it.  It&#x27;s definately not for the weak but if you give it a chance, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Works good, not quite as efficient as some higher end models I&#x27;d imagine. Doesnt work well around knee cap or shin bone with regular attachment, would recommend using the smaller attachment on those areas to get all the hair. Wish it was easier to clean. Definitely don&#x27;t do it after recently lotioning up. Epilate before you go to bed, so the tingling soreness and red spots have the night to vanish before you bare your legs (or whatever else you plan on using this on). Works good on underarms. Haven&#x27;t dared to try it anywhere else. Stays charged good. Charging cord is nice and long if you need to use it corded. Overall.. if you&#x27;re looking to try epilating without breaking the bank because you&#x27;re not sure if you&#x27;ll love it or hate it, like I was, I recommend this one. I have it, like it, but I have a fancier, more expensive one on my wish list now. :)</li>
            <li> Being a first timer in the world of epilating, i have the fear of the pain, because of some reviews that i have read..but just so i really want to have an easy way to remove unwanted hairs as fast and effective so I went for it. This is my first epilator..after long time of searching, finally I bought this product and I don&#x27;t regret it. i was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t really painful at all, at first it will be like a prick but after moving it along and getting used to it, u barely can&#x27;t feel the pain anymore..and i love it. And it leaves my skin smooth like i want it to be.. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as i did not want to spend a great deal of money on my first epilator in case i could not handle it. well i can, this thing rips hair out like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons,&lt;br /&gt;-cordless mode is about useless it works slower and the batteries don&#x27;t last&lt;br /&gt;-Its loud.&lt;br /&gt;-the &amp;#34;Facial&amp;#34; epilator atachment is not much use it just gave me a friction burn so i stick to the normal one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Works well and fast in corded mode&lt;br /&gt;-seems well built i dropped it and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i recemend this as a good starting point for those just getting into an epilator for the first time. but if you already know what your doing look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I still have my old Remington from 10 years ago! I finally decided to buy a new epilator so I found another Remington and it&#x27;s great! It will be interesting to see how long it lasts. You get what you pay for and they produced a long lasting one 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe this really worked. I am new to epilating, I heard about it through friends at work. I have always struggled with keeping my legs hair free. I tried shaving and waxing. I even tried Nair but it didn&#x27;t work. My hair is too coarse. I would shave in the morning and by the night I would have stubble. My hair growth is super fast compared to my sisters. So, I started to wax at home. I would spend nearly $75 just for the summer. This would hurt so much and I would need my sister to help me. The hair growth did slow down to 2 weeks. I did like the results but it hurts, its expensive and I needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A friend at work recommended to epilate. She has tried many different epilators but her favorite with less pain was the Remington EP6025. She had purchased it about two years ago from Target and even had her teenage daughter use it. So, I decided to give it a try. I have tweezed my armpits before and was able to handle the pain so I thought it would be similar. I purchased this epilator from amazon for $49. I read the directions and started on my legs. At first I felt a little pain but it was bearable. After about two minutes my leg became numb to the pain and I felt nothing for the majority of the time. It did take a while to do both legs but I didn&#x27;t have to epilate again for another week and this time there was less hair and not as coarse, it took only five minutes per leg. Now I am hair free for 2 days over a week. I hope this continues to progress even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I even did my armpits with the smaller attachment. It was a little more painful but bearable and the hair growth stays away even longer. The only thing I did not like was the storage bag is too small. Everything else is great. I like that I can used it cordless and it has an extra attachment. If I would have used the larger piece on my armpits it would have hurt much more. When I looked online most epilators in this price range did not have the extra attachment unlessyou wanted to pay twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, my twelve year old daughter just started to shave and I don&#x27;t want her to start on this path. She watched me epilate and saw the results so she wanted to try it. Her hair is very fine and when she shaves she is hair free for three days. I wasn&#x27;t sure if the epilator would work on her. To my surprise it worked great.She said it hurt very little and she was able to finish her legs in about 15 minutes. Her hair grew back in about two weeks and two days. I have ordered her, her own and hope this is better for her than shaving. But, if she is able to do it almost anyone can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Good luck on epilating, this has saved me money and time.</li>
            <li> works great. very satified. i had another one for years but it stopped working so i looked up epilators on amason and thought this was the best one for the price and i was right.</li>
            <li> OK Ladies! First thing first...this is an Epilator, it pulls your hair out one by one!&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it definitely hurts like hell and nothing that you read is going to be able to prepare you for what it feels like. I have light skin and dark hair. My legs don&#x27;t grow in super thick but the hair is coarse. I shower and exfoliate before I use the epilator. I have read reviews that showering will make the hair removal process easier but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I did it one night before my shower. It helps to have your skin pulled tight and do small sections at a time...ESPECIALLY if you are new to epilating. The directions that came with it said to move it in small circles, and if possible, it hurts worse then just using it upwards like you are shaving with a razor. It has two speeds, one for thinner hair and one for thicker. It does a great job on my legs. I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try my armpits or bikini line yet but I&#x27;m working up to it. Epilating doesn&#x27;t cause any ingrown hairs with me and for that I am so grateful! (Shaving on the other hand does) I use a mild unscented lotion after I use it and I am hair free for two weeks if not more! Hopefully the more I use it the less it comes in! I have used it on my face where I have peach fuzz and although it works well I did break out in these tiny little pimples everywhere that I used it. I&#x27;m skeptical to use it on my face again. Love the fact that it has a rechargable battery and I can use it anywhere. I recommend having something to distract you (like the T.V.) I will come back and update once I do my bikini line!</li>
            <li> So I just used this last night and tonight on my face and my underarms and I have to say this little machine works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are several tips for first timers that would make using this a lot easier and prevent some mishaps along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you use any sort of acne medication that forbids you from waxing your brows or upper lip (such as retin-a) DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE OFF THE TOP LAYER OF YOUR SKIN!!! See my horrible picture.  At first I thought it hurt because I usually bleach my mustache, not rip the hair out.  But the pain was actually just my skin being shaved off.  The instructions say do not use on face but the precision head states its perfect for the face!  Anyways, do not use on your face if you use any acne medication that causes thinning to your skin because it will take your skin off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  In order to get maximum hair removal out of this machine always face the front of the machine (the face where the on/off switch is located)upwards so you can see the pretty flowers.  It seems that the direction the head spins is most effective when used the machine face up instead of face down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use the epilator directly head on towards the direction of the hair growth.  If your hair is growing downward then use this machine face up heading upwards.  If hair is growing upward, then use this machine face up heading downward.  This is the most effective way for the tweezers to grasp the hairs. If you use it any other way you will feel that it takes forever and barely grabs any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Hair is easier to grab when it is a little longer, maybe 3-4 days growth after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps for first timers or for those who feel that this machine does not work as well as it should.</li>
            <li> It is a great way to do without a razor.I love it &amp; keep it plugged in the bathroom-it is always. ready for use.So glad it is electric &amp; doesn&#x27;t require batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator 3 years ago and have been really happy with it until recently. It still works plugged in, but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. Because of my bathroom setup and the fact that I&#x27;m not flexible enough to stand with one leg propped up on the counter, I need a new chargeable one. Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying this one again. I spent $55 on it the first time. I have no idea why they are charging $300 now. Too bad. It did the job - quickly, thoroughly and with minimal ingrown hairs (provided I kept up with ex-foliating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you new to epilators... Yes, it hurts. You do get desensitized if you persist. Yes, the hair grows in slower and after MANY years of doing this, thinner.</li>
            <li> It works best using the smaller attachment. I tried using it for my underarms and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use it..and its exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Pain: Was pretty tolerable for me. It didn&#x27;t bother me or made me uncomfortable in any way. This was one fear I had but I was relieved that is wasn&#x27;t as bad. The little massagers that it has probably helps..&lt;br /&gt;Efficiency: It&#x27;s true that you have to go through the same area several times to get all the hairs out and for a smooth finish. Its totally worth it. It definitively gets the job done with patience.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my legs, underarms, and around the bikini line(used smaller attachment in bikini area)&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;BTW exfoliation is a must to avoid ingrown hair and any irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on clearance at a discount retailer. I bought it because it had an attachment for bikini areas, etc. I had a difficult time getting the other epilator that I own to go over my knees. I guess they are too knobby? I like this one because of the curve of the unit naturally goes over curved areas smoothly and more effortlessly. However, this unit does not have a light. The light on the other epilator I own has a light. That light is most helpful in locating hair that you can&#x27;t see. (I  have a lot of blond, fine hair.) The smaller attachment is great for what it&#x27;s intended to be for. It can be cordless and it is rechargeable. so it does have some benefits. I think that it works slightly better than the other brand I purchased.  It seems to spin faster and have a bit more power to it. It doesn&#x27;t have more tweezers, but because it spins faster, I think it works just a bit better. It think now from having two of these nifty devises I have concluded that speed is paramount in the usefulness, followed by the number of tweezers. The faster it spins the less it hurts, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it. It&#x27;s cheep enough. I wonder how these high dollar ones will preform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It if had a light I&#x27;d give it a five start.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it was pretty painful, but after a few times it&#x27;s completely tolerable. I love that my legs stay smooth for so long. Typically, I would have to shave at least every other day. It seems that I can go for about 2 weeks with this epilator. The only problem is ingrown hairs. Even with exfoliating, I get ingrown hairs. Every once in a while when I get a lot of ingrown hairs, I will stop using this and shave for a couple of times. It helps, and then I can go back to the epilator. This is really easy to clean. I have never used the facial attachment. My upper lip is so sensitive - I would rather rip a strip of wax off all at once. This product is very easy to clean. I&#x27;m so glad I found this. I&#x27;m hooked. Well worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this especially for the facial attachment and just love it.  I love that it can be used cordless.  I keep it in my vanity and it is ready to use at any time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the epilator for awhile now. It has worked perfectly until the&lt;br /&gt;past few months. It no longer holds a charge so when I use it, it has&lt;br /&gt;to be plugged in. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to epilators--I just discovered them about 2 months ago when I bought the Emjoi Dolphin Wet/Dry Epilator Model-AP 17DB.  THe Emjoi works great for my underarms and bikini but was small so it didn&#x27;t work well on my legs...plus since it was cordless it ate through batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I decided on this Remington model for it&#x27;s size, reasonable price and the fact that it was corded (but could also be used cordless). I did a lot of research to find the perfect one for my legs.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t get 100% of the hairs (I don&#x27;t think any of them do) but if you go over a certain area in small circles you can usually get MOST of the hairs.  Also it&#x27;s fairly painles--(I&#x27;m amazed at how many people say they couldn&#x27;t tolerate the pain involved).  Really?  I Don&#x27;t get it?  It pinches slightly but that&#x27;s about it.  Anyway it works well and even has a smaller attachment head that says its for the face but I don&#x27;t need it for that.  You could easily use it for underarms and bikini instead.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sick of shaving-try an epilator.  Once you get the hang of it you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t try them sooner!  Once you do an area--then if you keep up with it--you only need to do \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot; every couple of days since hair grows in cycles.  I haven&#x27;t had to shave for 2 months now and I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators combined with waxing for the past 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always tried to get the most expensive ones on the market thinking that they would be the least painful and that they would provide the best results. Braun, Philips, panasonic, crazy pain in the back of my legs, impossible armpits, forbidden brazillians, ingrown hairs from hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, I tried this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stupid lights that do absolutely nothing (seriously, what the hell? it is not useful, why do I need to pay more for it? No water function-usually it just missed tones of hairs, breaks them and causes yet more ingrown hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the skinny silky smooth (as long as you exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate) can be used everywhere (I mean everywhere!), completely pain free after the first time and very practical (the cordless feature is amazing for the hard to reach spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the headphones on, your favorite show, sit on a towel or edge of bathtub and smooth away :)</li>
            <li> I shaved and let the hair grow a couple of days then tried using this and it worked great! My legs are smooth all the time! I used it on my vagina too for a brazillian effect and it also works really well. My armpits...........worst pain EVER and I am not dainty person, but aside from the damaged skin it worked alright. Worked best on legs and vag though. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. I use it a lot. It hurts at first, but once you get through the initial session, maintenance is no problem.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and very fine hair on my legs that I can&#x27;t seem to pull out with the epilator. I have tried several techniques and angles, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work with my leg hair. In addition to it not pulling most of the hair, I was getting ingrown hairs everywhere and my legs were speckled for weeks before I finally gave up and bought a razor again. I was told that witch hazel would help, but it seemed only to irritate my skin more (but I do have very sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my underarms and well, you know, it was very painful the first few times I went over an area, but I&#x27;m actually removing hair and it stays away for a good amount of time. When it does come back, I can remove it fairly quickly and much more comfortably. Every time I do epilate, though, the hair seems to grow in much thinner with smaller roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had trouble with my legs, I would still recommend getting an epilator, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with epilating so i was very skeptical about spending too much in case i hated it. Remington has always been a trusted brand for me and this one was mid price range so i went for it. I normally shave my legs every single day and have stubble within 8 hours. Waxing was okay except i had to wait for the hair to be fully grown out! that doesnt work during summer months! So epilating seemed to be a medium-ground solution. Very disapointed at first. The pain was ridiculous! And the results, not what i was thinking! Not at all like a nice smooth shave! And the time? oh geez.. at LEAST an hour! I tried epilating every day with zero improvment. It was almost like the hair was just breaking off just above the skin and then too short for the machine to grab ahold again. After several hours of reading reviews, changing my technique, and downing many glasses of wine to endure the pain, here is the routine i follow now: Exfoliate with shower mittens (and i mean a good good scrubbing), well dried off and NO lotion (not even numbing cream, tried it, no bueno), starting at my ankles i work my way up in the opposite direction the hair grows, in areas where the hair seems to grow in ALL directions i use small circular motions. I do not move on from one particular area until i can no longer feel any pulling. Full legs took me about 45 mins and sometimes would shave in the morning to get those tiny ones i missed. Fast forward 3 months... there is hardly any pain anymore! yay! Except the back of my knees is a teeny bit sensitve, but NOTHING like at first! I now only do this once a week, takes about 20-30 mins. I no longer shave in between sessions now that ive caught the hair cycle just right and the hair grows back soft instead of prickly. I have course hair on my lower legs and fine blonde hair on my thighs and this works great for both areas. The blonde hair is just hard to see but of course is still felt! I give this product 4 out of 5 stars only because the battery life is kinda weak. If i charge it all night, I get one leg done and it starts to get weak. I no longer charge it. I just plug it in and never use it as \\&quot;cordless\\&quot;. Legs are the only area i have used the Remington, but with the variety of hair its proven to master, i am confident it would work great anywhere else. Patience is key! Im very happy with this purchase!the battery life is kinda weak. If i charge it all night, I get one leg done and it starts to get weak. I no longer charge it. I just plug it in and never use it as \\&quot;cordless\\&quot;. Legs are the only area i have used the Remington, but with the variety of hair its proven to master, i am confident it would work great anywhere else. Patience is key! Im very happy with this purchase!</li>
