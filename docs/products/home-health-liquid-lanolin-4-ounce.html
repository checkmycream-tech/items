            <li>It is so good</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use it for its intended purpose so I cannot vouch for how good it is for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will get everything greasy so choose a good time to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seems like a good quality lanolin.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I use this to make case lube for reloading with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I liked this</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>So glad this is available.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It dissolves in the alcohol and you can spray a fine film onto your brass.  </li>
            <li>It works fine and does what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>best case lube on the market, just mix it with a little 99 percent alcohol and shake.</li>
            <li>so this was fantastic value.</li>
            <li>Hi there, I make my own cream for winter and it is as follows in case one wants to try it.</li>
            <li>ENJOY</li>
            <li>I used it in combination with alcohol for a cheap case lube on bullet casings..</li>
            <li>super stuff and wells</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>it keeps my hair nice and shiny, frizz free, and totally locks in the moisture!</li>
            <li>and it is so good for dry skin</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It takes a while to soak in but worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>top - just a basic cap you have to unscrew all the way.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>It  &amp;#34; turbocharges&amp;#34;  them so that they have the emollient qualities of  more costly creams at a lesser cost.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, thanks!</li>
            <li>Mixed 1 part lanolin to 12 parts HEET fuel antifreeze, it works great and goes a very long ways.</li>
            <li>Pure Lanolin Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fairly fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Used a drop or two in home made lip balm, worked very well with no noticeable smell</li>
            <li>ships ultra fast too</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying from the likes of Dillon Precision or Hornady.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve ended up using it around the house for many other purposes.</li>
            <li>Unlike other lanolin products I have tried, this product has an extremely potent smell of diesel fuel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and styling at the same time, like a rich pomade/styling cream.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is moderately priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 ounce bottle will last a LONG time (think 100,000 cases or more)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but given its utility, I&#x27;m going to order a few more bottles to keep in each of the medicine cabinets in the house.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my dogs rough skin areas</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and sticky, but if you add a couple drops of silicone based de-frizzing syrum, it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>exactly as described would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>Soft feeling lasts.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and whenever I run out of it, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this liquid lanolin in my palm mixed with a bit of water makes it easy to put on my face and anywhere else I need it.</li>
            <li>I bought this liquid because it was listed in a recipe for a general metal lubricant.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is they do not have an easy use</li>
            <li>Even without alcohol if you put a small amount on a rag and rub the brass it lubes it up as well or better than the other case lubes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>After a week of massaging this in at the end of each day, my hands look much less wrinkled (younger!), and are so much softer.</li>
            <li>Add a little Purple Power, as the lanolin is very water resistant and will not come off with Dawn and Lemmishine alone.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I use it in combination with other hair products to make hair grease.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in homemade soap and other DIY products.</li>
            <li> Bottle is small but goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> The only negatives are that this is the biggest size I can find and it is thick and messy, but that is why the product works.</li>
            <li> I put it on after mosturing my face and let it sit for a few minutes before topping it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It works but it is messy.</li>
            <li> She told me her secret recipe for long hair and this was one of the ingredients!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work for someone who wears make-up.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t usually have a problem with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;However.</li>
            <li> particular brand doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the others.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and hard to tame, this is it.</li>
            <li> Two days late</li>
            <li> It has slowly helped to reduce the dryness in his skin.  </li>
            <li> I mix this product in less expensive moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> The lanolin in a tube is very hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> The smell is virtually impossible to mask and difficult to get out.</li>

            <li> This is what we needed for my daughter&#x27;s school project.  It came on time, and was what we wanted.</li>
            <li> works for what I needed,</li>
            <li> So glad this is available.  Reasonable price, good size bottle, good quality and has many uses.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, I know the benifits of lanolin for the hair. I use it in combination with other hair products to make hair grease.</li>
            <li> I mix it with 91% alcohol and use it as rifle case lube.  Wish I discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> I use this to lubricate brass cases for reloading.  Mix 1:12 with 99+% isopropyl alchohol - get ISO Heet from Walmart or online.&lt;br /&gt;It dissolves in the alcohol and you can spray a fine film onto your brass.  Allow a few minutes for the alcohol to flash off and you are ready.&lt;br /&gt;After sizing, either tumble in dry media, or run it through the stainless media wash again.  Add a little Purple Power, as the lanolin is very water resistant and will not come off with Dawn and Lemmishine alone.&lt;br /&gt;4 ounce bottle will last a LONG time (think 100,000 cases or more) so this was fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I bought this liquid because it was listed in a recipe for a general metal lubricant. The recipe only used a smidge of the stuff and I&#x27;ve ended up using it around the house for many other purposes. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but given its utility, I&#x27;m going to order a few more bottles to keep in each of the medicine cabinets in the house.</li>
            <li> I use this as a lube for sizing bottleneck rifle brass. 10:1 ratio of isopropyl alcohol to lanolin is the perfect ratio and the lanolin stays in suspension, though I did have to heat it a touch to get it in suspension. A little goes a long way and whenever I run out of it, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> just a drop dose the trick. I liked this</li>
            <li> Works great for homemade case lube.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to put on my ball glove.</li>
            <li> super stuff and wells well!</li>
            <li> Hi there, I make my own cream for winter and it is as follows in case one wants to try it. I heard about this formula on the internet about three years ago, and I have been using it since. One third aloe-vera and one third olive oil, and one fourth water, and one ounce of this lanolin, which in a bottle of lotion works out to be about two Tablespoons. It is so good I make it for friends. Oh yea, you must shake up the mix quite well!! ENJOY</li>
            <li> Unlike other lanolin products I have tried, this product has an extremely potent smell of diesel fuel. The smell is virtually impossible to mask and difficult to get out. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone unless it&#x27;s for use on their feet, and even then only if they apply it with gloves.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very good people to deal with.</li>
            <li> Works great but I didn&#x27;t use it for its intended purpose so I cannot vouch for how good it is for that. I used it in combination with alcohol for a cheap case lube on bullet casings.. Works amazingly well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my face.  Actually closes the pores on my nose.  It takes a while to soak in but worth it for me.  Not sure how it would work for someone who wears make-up.  I originally purchased this for my dogs rough skin areas and now we both use it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped quickly. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this to make case lube for reloading with amazing results.  Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> this and 90-99% rubbing alcohol make great case lube!</li>
            <li> I got the idea to use this for my hair from my grandmother who use to make my hair oil when I was a kid. She told me her secret recipe for long hair and this was one of the ingredients! Let me tell you! This stuff is awesome it keeps my hair nice and shiny, frizz free, and totally locks in the moisture! I looooove it!!</li>
            <li> Top quality product. Fast shipping. Best price at time of purchase. Recommend others to purchase. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I mix this with 10 parts Heet and lube brass before reloading - Great!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s nice on the skin, too.</li>
            <li> I used this to make some case lubrication for reloading.  It works fine and does what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in part for lubricating once fired range brass during the reloading process. It works great for that. It also does moisturize my fingers as an added benefit. HA! No complaints on the product. It works as described and for my purposes.</li>
            <li> GREAT,  BUY FROM THIS OUTFIT.</li>
            <li> great for pre-shave beard softener.  I put it on after mosturing my face and let it sit for a few minutes before topping it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works great with alcohol to make case lube.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is the only solution that works on my dry hands.  I use it with Alba lotion so it spreads easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will get everything greasy so choose a good time to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the others.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons why I like it the best.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was going to give this product a real low grade because of Amazon listing and then shipping issues. I couldn&#x27;t find anyone to talk to about it. Then I sent an e-mail to the supposed shipper that I bought it from and they didn&#x27;t know anything about it. Said they couldn&#x27;t help.  It&#x27;s an Amazon problem. Well I finally did receive this item. Two days late and I am happy now.  I don&#x27;t know if Amazon has resolved just who the seller of this item is and may never know. But I don&#x27;t usually have a problem with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;However. This has nothing to do with the actual product. Which will work great for what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy and it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I use this as a substitute for commercially purchased case lube and it works well. Even without alcohol if you put a small amount on a rag and rub the brass it lubes it up as well or better than the other case lubes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> seems like a good quality lanolin. Only complaint is they do not have an easy use top - just a basic cap you have to unscrew all the way.</li>
            <li> I use this to make case lube for reloading. Mixed 1 part lanolin to 12 parts HEET fuel antifreeze, it works great and goes a very long ways.</li>
            <li> Lanolin works great.  Soft feeling lasts.</li>
            <li> I use it for a lot of things including making my own case lube for reloading.  Works like a charm</li>
            <li> Makes a great Case Lube - I have processed 1000&#x27;s of rounds with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix 12-16Oz of  96% isopropyl alcohol  (or ISO HEAT) to 4OZ Pure Lanolin Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a Charm and for about 1/10th the cost of Name Brand Case Lubes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! And a great price!</li>
            <li> Great product for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product. After a week of massaging this in at the end of each day, my hands look much less wrinkled (younger!), and are so much softer. Be prepared for the product to feel sticky, but that feeling goes away if you take a minute to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have probably ordered 3 bottles already.  I can mix this with coconut oil or argan oil or both and my skin feels hydrated. I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I try not to use animal products but nothing moisturizes like liquid lanolin.  I like the screw top better than one that dispenses because it does not leak. I mix a few drops with my regular moisturizer for arms and legs.</li>
            <li> works wonders on cracked chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Great material to substitute toxic chemical to prep casings for reloading</li>
            <li> Item was as described.  Fairly fast shipping.  Satisfied buyer.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff to condition my ox horn comb.  It works but it is messy.</li>
            <li> exactly as described would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> just what was needed for my rough hands</li>
            <li> Used a drop or two in home made lip balm, worked very well with no noticeable smell</li>
            <li> great product, we use it for case lube.  ships ultra fast too</li>
            <li> I used this as a &amp;#34;bootleg case lube&amp;#34; for reloading. Mixed with 99% Isopropyl alcohol at anywhere between 8:1 to 12:1. Never pay for overpriced reloading lube again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very reasonable price.  I use it in all my homemade lip balms and will buy again at this price.</li>
            <li> This lanolin oil is great. I am happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Just add 99% IsoProAlco and you have the best case lube you can make. Ratio 1:8 or 1:10 works well, lube:IsoProAlco. Shake before use.</li>
            <li> Mix 1 part lanolin to 12 parts 100% ISO alcohol and you get a great case lube for reloading.  Not one stuck case since the change from Lee Case Lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Mixed with 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol it makes a wonderful case lube for reloading. Much cheaper than buying from the likes of Dillon Precision or Hornady.</li>
            <li> A wonderful addition to my creations!</li>
            <li> As you can tell this Lanolin is very popular with bullet reloaders.  I mix it up with some IsoHeet, which is 99% isopropyl alcohol.  1 oz lanolin to 8 oz isoheet mixed up in a spray bottle works great for lubing bullet cases on my Dillon 650 press.  Loading cases becomes almost effortless.  And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I mix this product in less expensive moisturizing creams. It  &amp;#34; turbocharges&amp;#34;  them so that they have the emollient qualities of  more costly creams at a lesser cost.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and have very dry skin. A little bit of this liquid lanolin in my palm mixed with a bit of water makes it easy to put on my face and anywhere else I need it. It stays moist all day. The lanolin in a tube is very hard to squeeze. This product could be improved if it had a little spot you could open in the lid so you aren&#x27;t always having to unscrew and screw the lid back on.</li>
            <li> best case lube on the market, just mix it with a little 99 percent alcohol and shake. Never had a stuck case using this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product has been a lifesavor on my baby.  He has eczema and I \\&quot;oil\\&quot; him up with the lanolin liquid.  It has slowly helped to reduce the dryness in his skin.  The only negatives are that this is the biggest size I can find and it is thick and messy, but that is why the product works.</li>
            <li> Great for case lube.  Bottle is small but goes a LONG way.  Delivery was speedy!</li>
            <li> Love this. I ad it to my hand and body lotions and it is so good for dry skin</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in homemade soap and other DIY products. It&#x27;s smooth and has a nice light scent. It arrived quickly and is moderately priced.</li>
            <li> This is the only fat I know of that was literally designed by nature to groom hair (sheep wool). It&#x27;s thick and sticky, but if you add a couple drops of silicone based de-frizzing syrum, it is very easy to apply. Miles better than Moroccan oil or argan oil, or any vegetable oil marketed for hair. Much cheaper too. It&#x27;s moisturizing and styling at the same time, like a rich pomade/styling cream. If your hair is thick and hard to tame, this is it.</li>
