            <li>Heard about Sensational and tried it.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this kit after my first try.</li>
            <li>Works nice.  </li>
            <li>Stays shinny for longer than two weeks, easy to apply and easy to remove!!</li>
            <li>I really love all of these products, It is so nice to pamper myself .  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly a year, and I am still impressed with it!  </li>
            <li>Love this kit, great price nice size bottles and fast delivery time.</li>
            <li>I love these products from Sensationail.</li>
            <li>My nails do so much better under gel polish and saving the expense of going to the salon is a blessing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love SensationNail.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d have been better off.</li>
            <li>and I love sensationail.</li>
            <li>love how strong it makes my nails though</li>
            <li>This kit is amazing and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The product was advertised as including a LED light as well as many additional items.  </li>
            <li>Cool set, everything you need to continue making  the manicures at affordable price!</li>
            <li>I have also heard about they&#x27;re kits and how the polish peels off easily.</li>
            <li>They were very apologetic about it &amp; couldn&#x27;t have been more helpful!</li>
            <li>I use it with a UV nail light rather than an LED light and just increase the curing time.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I didn&#x27;t like the kit with the LED light in it.</li>
            <li>The light was NOT in the kit and when the seller was questioned, the seller said they had written an note stating the light was not included.  </li>
            <li>I now have to go to the added expense of buying a light and having it shipped to California.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but this same kit can be bought at walmart for under $20.</li>
            <li>The directions are simple, easy to follow, and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>This kit is very worth it if you are looking to do at home gel nail manicures.</li>
            <li>Just buff them good especially around the edges and it will keep your nails harder.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Like the kit very much and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have read that you can even use regular polish if you let it dry very good before adding the top coat it works but haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Sensational Gel Nail products for several years.</li>
            <li>Sensationail is easy to use and very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite at home gel nail polish brand, and I have tried all that the drugstores have to offer.</li>
            <li>reapply a new coat every week to keep them salon looking, but could probably wait 2 weeks if I&#x27;m easy on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on like polish and drys with a uv light, it comes out with a highly glossy finish and with 3 coats</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s true, that opens up a whole world of color</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s dry right away, so no smudges!</li>
            <li>To seal it use a regular polish clear top coat, 1 or 2 layers and they stay fine like that.</li>
            <li>The kit comes without the box as stated so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>but if I remember to buff the surface first it helps.</li>
            <li>I reviewed them before using Sensationails the first time, you might consider viewing them as well.</li>
            <li>but unless you look closely they just look pretty.</li>
            <li>I love sensationail, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use with a little practice.</li>
            <li>This kit was better and it even has the little lint free cloths to wipe the nails.</li>
            <li>First, this review is my own experience only, with no other motive.  </li>
            <li>Had to stop using much of anything on my nails but missed pretty nails.</li>
            <li>only con so far is it does not do well as a top coat over water decals, they tend to come off like a sticker in hot water.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit in any color that suits you!</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with this service.</li>
            <li>But the primer and gel base/top coat is vital to the success of the at home system.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The seller got back to me right away &amp; quickly shipped out a replacement bottle of primer, a new nail file, &amp; a new instruction sheet!</li>
            <li>I thought the light was too small to fit all my fingers</li>
            <li>I used the color once, but am more of a clear polish kinda gal, so I only use the clear coat now.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel BUT for some reason, sometimes the gel turns black.</li>
            <li>main objection is removing them</li>
            <li>It came WITH a light, cleaning fluid, primer, clear gel bottom/top coat and a color.</li>
            <li>i think if i had to do it over again I&#x27;d have used chiffon pink for the first manicure till my nails grew out, but I love french nails</li>
            <li>After a few tries you can get a very nice look that does stay about 2 weeks with no chipping.</li>
            <li>My toes still look fabulous and I&#x27;ve had the same hot pink polish on for over a month</li>
            <li>The products all appear to be new &amp; unused.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about two weeks and the polish I bought to go with it (a Sally Hansen product) looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I had been going to a salon for manicures and became very sensitive to some of the products.</li>
            <li>A friend (to whom I introduced this product) said she applies and cures the clear bottom coat, adds a regular colored nail enamel and lets it dry COMPLETELY, and then a gel top coat, cured.  </li>
            <li>Despite my awkwardness, i have pretty,( albeit crooked) tips</li>
            <li>The cleaner is kind of pointless, you can just use regular rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Although I think you should only purchase this kit if you have a steady hand and can give yourself a decent mani.</li>
            <li>You can still use the gel with the water decals by doing the gel process, completely drying it and then apply the water decal.</li>
            <li>Had I have just done straight color or had help with the nail tips for french</li>
            <li>I received:&lt;br /&gt;Led lamp (which I ordered separately), gel base and top coat &amp; color gel polish (in raspberry wine rose framboise color which I did not want).</li>
            <li>natural nails grow very quickly but are very thin, I have never been able to grow them long until</li>
            <li>As i am older I didn&#x27;t care for some of the &amp;#34;new colors&amp;#34; that the younger women wear</li>
            <li>first the colors were very limited.</li>
            <li>Touch up the regular polish clear top coat at least once a week since it will not hold up like the gel.</li>
            <li>Less is more when applying the coats, do thin coats and they dry faster and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Once I have removed the previous polish and do a quick trim, file and cuticle cleanup, it only takes about 10 minutes to do a gel manicure.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t last nearly as well as this one - I&#x27;m sticking to this brand from now on.</li>
            <li>Using the clear coat and not the colors will make it so you don&#x27;t have to touch them up as much, since any clips or nail regrowth is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it was a little difficult to do it myself, but the Sensationail website has a lot of videos that that you can watch to get the most out of their gel polish.</li>
            <li>They go on in half the time of Shellac and for me anyway seem to last much longer.</li>

            <li> They go on in half the time of Shellac and for me anyway seem to last much longer.</li>
            <li> Really strange</li>
            <li> The second you&#x27;re done, your nails are dry but they look shiny and wet.</li>
            <li> If you are a color gel nails fan, the selection is limited.  </li>
            <li> I also painted my 6 year old&#x27;s nails with it, it is holding up well on her too, however she does have some small chips (but she likes to dig in the dirt and climb trees).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that they were in a mailing envelope; bubble wrapped but still felt lucky that nothing was broken.  </li>
            <li> They work well for creating gel nails, personally they last at least 2-3 days</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this kit with the pink chiffon polish, and Santa just happened to bring it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My only advice is that you try to make your coats as thin as possible so that they dry under the lamp thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Also you have to be very careful about the edges and cuticle area as the polish tends to lift.</li>
            <li> This is what appears in the description of what you should have sent me: Contents: 1 gel cleanser (0.92 fl oz (27.20 ml)); 1 gel primer (0.12 fl oz (3.54 ml)); 1 gel base &amp; top coat (0.25 fl oz (7.39 ml)); 1 manicure stick; 1 buffer; 1 pack (12) wipes; 1 instruction</li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s a little tip.  </li>
            <li> &gt; Just a few tips</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great product, &amp; good value</li>
            <li> I love these gels and this is the perfect starter kit. Just add a color to the mix. They go on in half the time of Shellac and for me anyway seem to last much longer.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottles that came in the kit were bigger. But for the price it&#x27;s hard to complain. They work well for creating gel nails, personally they last at least 2-3 days and then I have to fix one nail.</li>
            <li> not what I thought at all</li>
            <li> I love sensationail, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use with a little practice. Goes on like polish and drys with a uv light, it comes out with a highly glossy finish and with 3 coats it&#x27;s protective with a hard finish.&lt;br /&gt;I reapply a new coat every week to keep them salon looking, but could probably wait 2 weeks if I&#x27;m easy on them.&lt;br /&gt;My natural nails grow very quickly but are very thin, I have never been able to grow them long until now.&lt;br /&gt; Just a few tips&lt;br /&gt;1. Buff the edges of your nails or it will peal on the edges&lt;br /&gt;2. When redoing your nails with the same color, don&#x27;t remove the the gel from the nails. Just buff them good especially around the edges and it will keep your nails harder.&lt;br /&gt;3. Less is more when applying the coats, do thin coats and they dry faster and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;4. Using the clear coat and not the colors will make it so you don&#x27;t have to touch them up as much, since any clips or nail regrowth is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con so far is it does not do well as a top coat over water decals, they tend to come off like a sticker in hot water.You can still use the gel with the water decals by doing the gel process, completely drying it and then apply the water decal. To seal it use a regular polish clear top coat, 1 or 2 layers and they stay fine like that. Touch up the regular polish clear top coat at least once a week since it will not hold up like the gel.</li>
            <li> Cool set, everything you need to continue making  the manicures at affordable price!</li>
            <li> Makes the nail hard but it keeps peeling around the edges on me. Haven&#x27;t quite figured it out yet. Make sure to buy acetone to remove it because it is difficult to get off. . . love how strong it makes my nails though</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery,satisfied</li>
            <li> The kit comes without the box as stated so be aware of that.  The products all appear to be new &amp; unused.  My only complaint was that they were in a mailing envelope; bubble wrapped but still felt lucky that nothing was broken.  Still very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Described perfectly and came very quickly! Comes with everything shown!</li>
            <li> good price for refill kit</li>
            <li> I love these products from Sensationail. At first it was a little difficult to do it myself, but the Sensationail website has a lot of videos that that you can watch to get the most out of their gel polish. Capping the nail with the base coat and gel polish is key to making it last a long time. Also don&#x27;t let a lot of the polish gather around the cuticle area. I like the essentials kit because it comes with the cleanser and the wipes which are hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my hands.  This polish has held up amazingly!  No chips almost 2 weeks later.  I also painted my 6 year old&#x27;s nails with it, it is holding up well on her too, however she does have some small chips (but she likes to dig in the dirt and climb trees).  All in all, a great product!</li>
            <li> My nails are looking great!!! Stays shinny for longer than two weeks, easy to apply and easy to remove!! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great do it yourself at home kit.</li>
            <li> Sensationail is easy to use and very long-lasting. I use it with a UV nail light rather than an LED light and just increase the curing time. Great results! You can buy the kit for $20 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this kit with the pink chiffon polish, and Santa just happened to bring it for Christmas. The directions are simple, easy to follow, and the results are amazing! The second you&#x27;re done, your nails are dry but they look shiny and wet. I highly recommend this kit in any color that suits you!</li>
            <li> Like the kit very much and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> My nails do so much better under gel polish and saving the expense of going to the salon is a blessing. My toes still look fabulous and I&#x27;ve had the same hot pink polish on for over a month and it still looks like I just did it!</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I didn&#x27;t like the kit with the LED light in it. I thought the light was too small to fit all my fingers and also I use it for my feet. This kit was better and it even has the little lint free cloths to wipe the nails. It&#x27;s great I love it.</li>
            <li> Wish that I could get all the colors that are offered</li>
            <li> This is what appears in the description of what you should have sent me: Contents: 1 gel cleanser (0.92 fl oz (27.20 ml)); 1 gel primer (0.12 fl oz (3.54 ml)); 1 gel base &amp; top coat (0.25 fl oz (7.39 ml)); 1 manicure stick; 1 buffer; 1 pack (12) wipes; 1 instruction sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received:&lt;br /&gt;Led lamp (which I ordered separately), gel base and top coat &amp; color gel polish (in raspberry wine rose framboise color which I did not want). There is no gel cleanser, no 1 manicure stick; no 1 buffer; and no 1 pack (12) wipes;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m stuck with this now since there&#x27;s a no return policy!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Love this kit &amp; this is a good price! When the kit arrived, the bottle of primer had leaked all over the inside. I was really bummed because there was only a few drop of primer left &amp; the spilled contents had ruined the nail file &amp; instructions. I contacted the seller &amp; let them know what was going on. The seller got back to me right away &amp; quickly shipped out a replacement bottle of primer, a new nail file, &amp; a new instruction sheet! They were very apologetic about it &amp; couldn&#x27;t have been more helpful! I would definitely recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this kit after my first try. It&#x27;s been about two weeks and the polish I bought to go with it (a Sally Hansen product) looks brand new.</li>
            <li> Works nice.  Of course I can&#x27;t get my manicure to last two weeks but it lasts a lot longer than regular polish and I love that it&#x27;s dry right away, so no smudges!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to use it.  I still am unable to keep the manicure for two weeks, not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong!</li>
            <li> I chose this product as a gift for my daughter. I have the same brand and product myself.  The product was advertised as including a LED light as well as many additional items.  The light was NOT in the kit and when the seller was questioned, the seller said they had written an note stating the light was not included.  I received no notification or clarification of that.  I now have to go to the added expense of buying a light and having it shipped to California.  I will NEVER recommend or use this seller again.  I am very dissatisfied with this service.</li>
            <li> I really love all of these products, It is so nice to pamper myself .  This is a great product</li>
            <li> Great product, but this same kit can be bought at walmart for under $20. Why this retailer is selling it for this price is beyond me. Get the product, but save some money.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I was not able to afford going to the salon anymore. I was amazed at the results of this product. Love SensationNail.I will continue to use this product and it was very easy to use! I give this product a five ★★★★★ rating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand of base/top coat for gel nails and it didn&#x27;t last nearly as well as this one - I&#x27;m sticking to this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this gel BUT for some reason, sometimes the gel turns black. Really strange and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> Love this kit, great price nice size bottles and fast delivery time. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using Sensational Gel Nail products for several years. I had been going to a salon for manicures and became very sensitive to some of the products. Had to stop using much of anything on my nails but missed pretty nails. Heard about Sensational and tried it. Never stopped !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the colors were very limited. As i am older I didn&#x27;t care for some of the &amp;#34;new colors&amp;#34; that the younger women wear but they have now expanded the selection and I have even tried mixing them. I have read that you can even use regular polish if you let it dry very good before adding the top coat it works but haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main objection is removing them but if I remember to buff the surface first it helps. Also you have to be very careful about the edges and cuticle area as the polish tends to lift. After a few tries you can get a very nice look that does stay about 2 weeks with no chipping.</li>
            <li> First, this review is my own experience only, with no other motive.  I have been using this product for nearly a year, and I am still impressed with it!  It came WITH a light, cleaning fluid, primer, clear gel bottom/top coat and a color. Also included were some thin pads and a little double-sided emory board.  I used the color once, but am more of a clear polish kinda gal, so I only use the clear coat now.  Once I have removed the previous polish and do a quick trim, file and cuticle cleanup, it only takes about 10 minutes to do a gel manicure.  Now, some may call this kit expensive, but here in my little town a gel manicure will run $30-plus EACH TIME.  This starter kit contains enough material for several manicures.  I did the math and it&#x27;s worth it.  If you are a color gel nails fan, the selection is limited.  But here&#x27;s a little tip.  A friend (to whom I introduced this product) said she applies and cures the clear bottom coat, adds a regular colored nail enamel and lets it dry COMPLETELY, and then a gel top coat, cured.  She said it holds up JUST AS WELL as the colored gel.  If that&#x27;s true, that opens up a whole world of color variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, there are a couple of good Youtube videos on using this product.  I reviewed them before using Sensationails the first time, you might consider viewing them as well.</li>
            <li> Best price for this kit!! &amp; the dealer even threw in an extra cleanser!! I love it, I received it in no time!</li>
            <li> I tried sensationail on my really short nails. Had I have just done straight color or had help with the nail tips for french i&#x27;d have been better off. With really short nails you can&#x27;t just file the tip off you have to cut it. If your nails go past your finger then you can just file downwards. Despite my awkwardness, i have pretty,( albeit crooked) tips but unless you look closely they just look pretty. i think if i had to do it over again I&#x27;d have used chiffon pink for the first manicure till my nails grew out, but I love french nails and I love sensationail. It worked! Despite me. lol</li>
            <li> Amazing kit love it !! Def recommend !</li>
            <li> By far my favorite at home gel nail polish brand, and I have tried all that the drugstores have to offer. I bought this kit because I just needed the refill, and I am very happy with my purchase.  This kit is very worth it if you are looking to do at home gel nail manicures. The cleaner is kind of pointless, you can just use regular rubbing alcohol. But the primer and gel base/top coat is vital to the success of the at home system. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing and is worth every penny. Now I don&#x27;t have to get my nails done every 2-3 weeks and pay around 100 a month. Although I think you should only purchase this kit if you have a steady hand and can give yourself a decent mani. Some of my girlfriends have bought gel kits and they&#x27;re nails look pretty bad still. I have also heard about they&#x27;re kits and how the polish peels off easily. I definitely don&#x27;t have that problem with this kit. My only advice is that you try to make your coats as thin as possible so that they dry under the lamp thoroughly. If you find yourself putting on a ticker coat then leave your hand under the lamp longer, if not the Polish will smudge.</li>
