            <li>I think this product is great from a curl and volume standpoint.  </li>
            <li>We have all experienced bottles that quit functioning before the product runs out.  </li>

            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Best styling product I&#x27;ve used for adding body and definition to my very fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the frizz control on most days.</li>
            <li>my curls have never been more awesome!  </li>
            <li>(although we all know that curly hair has a mind of its own!)  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair and this mousse is perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>This is one of Deva Curl&#x27;s gluten free hair products and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Good deal all around.</li>
            <li>I need a lot of moisture, but I also want good hold and definition.</li>
            <li>This product is good at holding the hair and reducing frizz, however I have to use A LOT of it in order for that to happen.</li>
            <li>Both products together gives me really good results.</li>
            <li>A good portion of the foam had been dispensed though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>I find that this provides nice hold and is pleasant to put in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is great for fine hair!</li>
            <li>Great product - love it.</li>
            <li>I am, however, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much and it makes perfect ringlets!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Love my foam!</li>
            <li>Glad I found this!</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted more than one day!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>My curls look so shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>product - way more than course hair!)</li>
            <li>I love these products!</li>
            <li>prices here are better than in store or at the salon, too!</li>
            <li>i love this foam!</li>
            <li>Great volume for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Since it provides a nice amount of hold, I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to use a gel over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never knew my hair could look this good :)</li>
            <li>Best of all, I save time getting ready.</li>
            <li>The foam smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li>Nice results.  </li>
            <li>so this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and scrunches out to leave nice, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li>I use the gel because it is part of the whole process but honestly, the foam is my favorite product and what gives me the best bouncy waves and polishes my look.</li>
            <li>Light but effective, a good go to for curly hair.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the best product for my curls, thus far.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell too - it&#x27;s a nice lemony/vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Completely non-sticky and creates beautiful bouncy curls for me!</li>
            <li>nice and light, very clean feel but good volume</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my curly hair - honestly, most of the Deva products I&#x27;ve tried are good but this is the one I live by....</li>
            <li>This works great on the first day.</li>
            <li>Use very lightly.</li>
            <li>For someone who is not worried about chemicals, it is a top knotch product</li>
            <li>Have occassionally strayed trying to find something better, and have not found it.</li>
            <li>I use this and gel, and do much scrunching, and it looks great.</li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t using sulfate shampoos, it is challenging to find a product that will work, and will also not build up, because most silicones are not water soluble, and they require a detergent to get them out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I love how it holds my curls</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this foam and the bottle lasted quite a bit longer than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I like using the volumizing gel for the top of my head and the foam for the sides.</li>
            <li>I love this product when used in conjunction with the One Condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Love it recommend this to a lot of friends</li>
            <li>If you use more, you are wasting product and it will create sticky hair.</li>
            <li>Let hair air-dry without touching or use diffuser with hair dryer.</li>
            <li>In fact, my curls (type 3B) did better with Aussie brand mousse.</li>
            <li>My favorite mousse is suave but discovered it had sulfate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while now and just love it.</li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>So maybe get 2 bottles at once :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>then I scrunch some more.  </li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is a lot of volume, but some is OK.</li>
            <li>It is much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so amazed with the results :)</li>
            <li>if I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the foam.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I&#x27;ve used form before and didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>You can comb it if you want to relax it more without it getting frizzy again.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Makes your curly hair even more curly.  </li>
            <li>However, this is much better compared to any of the gel products by Deva.  </li>
            <li>I really love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>(run hands along top of hair instead of putting your fingers through your hair).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Deva Products ....</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Ok, let me just say this product has literally changed my life.</li>
            <li>It helped my fall in love with my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this foam, it works for my hair a lot nicer than the &amp;#34;AnGel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>That one works, but this one just seems to finish off better for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and my curls more free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)</li>
            <li>I love the Deva no-poo shampoo and one condition curly hair conditioner</li>
            <li>I will not be spending more money on this product until Deva can improve the bottle.</li>
            <li>It gives me volume on top and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>I love scrunching two squirts in after my DevaCurl ArcAngel and B&#x27;Leave in.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise.. I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>Recommended by my stylist to add fullness to my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair always looks great and really brings out the curl.  </li>
            <li>I love this volumizing foam for my curls.  </li>
            <li>I do think the gel is better for humid, summer days though.</li>
            <li>Tip: when you use this product, make sure to keep it away from the scalp.</li>
            <li>I used to use the moisture lock spray, now I use this, or sometimes both, on top of the Angel curl enhancer.  </li>
            <li>Wherever the foam landed was where it stayed, so I&#x27;d have to pump out more to cover all of my hair.</li>
            <li>If anything, it creates more frizz.</li>
            <li>Perfect, shiny, healthy curls all day long!</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to save the merchandise that it saturated (being a plastic item in it&#x27;s own box).  </li>
            <li>This foam, leaves my hair feeling soft, FRIZZ FREE, incredibly shiny even in this humidity.</li>
            <li>I use all the products but my favorite is the foam it works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I think this mousse is great if you are going the no/low poo route, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair, and it seems to wash out completely.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would call it frizz free for me, but I think that is more about my curls, not the product.  </li>
            <li>I am still struggling with shine, haven&#x27;t found the right product for that yet, but if I use the NoPoo, the Conditioner, the Angel and this, I get really nicely defined curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not big on hair product, but I&#x27;ve absolutely loved this foam!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes in a space saving bottle.</li>
            <li>Very quick response from them.</li>
            <li>The only thing nice about this product is that it does smell good .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, yet puts perfect volume into my hair &amp; keeps the style fresh til the next washing.</li>
            <li>This product did not weigh my hair down... absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair, that with ArcAngel Gel and B’leave looked full and healthy, with well defined curls.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that can get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I have fine</li>
            <li>no help for fine wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and was having difficulty iwth dispersing the DivaCurl Angel (gel) throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is designed for fine hair, maybe for coarser one.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and this gives it volume and has great holding power even on a very humid day in Florida.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap &amp; it works.</li>
            <li>foam definitely works and also has given my hair great volume.  </li>
            <li>Use lightly.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous, lightweight foam for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of weeks, and tossed the rest which is a bummer because this isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>It Free Moisture Lock.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it over the Deva B&#x27;Leave In, and it works great to further define my waves.  </li>
            <li>It also gives me great second-day hair, and I haven&#x27;t had to re-apply it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rub hands lightly together and scrunch through hair.</li>
            <li>Foamy and light and smell is kinda citrusy.  </li>
            <li>I use this in combination with a curly hair routine that looks something like this:  I wash with a sulfate free shampoo like</li>
            <li>I put one pump in my palm along with one pump of DevaCurl Styling cream and nickle sized amount of DevaCurl Light Defining gel and mix the three together and scrunch at the roots and at the ends.</li>
            <li>WHY have I waited until now to try this fabulous foam??</li>
            <li>The addition of the Volumizing Foam helps my curls not to droop so much throughout the day, and also makes it a lot easier to get nice curls in &amp;#34;day 2&amp;#34; if I just spray them with water and re-scrunch.</li>
            <li>Important fact:</li>
            <li>You may as well go to Target and buy a cheap mousse because that&#x27;s what this product feels like.  </li>
            <li>light hold styling gel that I also have.</li>
            <li>I use this combined with Deva Curl Set it free every morning and</li>
            <li>In, Set it Free and this Volumizing Foam.  </li>
            <li>it gives such great volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>(Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam,</li>
            <li>my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free</li>
            <li>This was a great product...until the pump stopped working after the 3rd or 4th use.</li>
            <li>This product is light and makes my curls tighter without any sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for thinner wavy hair.</li>
            <li>importantly, this product doesn&#x27;t reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>the smell is fabulous, I couldn&#x27;t be happier :) and the next day hair doesn&#x27;t need more than a couple scrunches!</li>
            <li>My new favorite Deva product!  </li>
            <li>I live in the South and can&#x27;t avoid frizz on those humid summer days, but DevaCurl foam helps keep the frizz to the greatest minimum possible.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too excited about this</li>
            <li>it works ok when I first bought it..</li>
            <li>As with most Deva products, you&#x27;ll want to watch the videos online/ read instructions prior to using, just so you get the best possible effect to start out with.  </li>
            <li>With this foam my hair gets more height in addition to more volume in general.</li>
            <li>Really helps to add volume to the crown (top) area of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure this is the real product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the father of a bi-racial child and until I found out the Deva Curl products, I had used everything under the sun but wasn&#x27;t really ever satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit tricky to learn how to use this product, but I really like it now and have had a number a people comment that my hair is much prettier and more healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is a great volumizer, but very light, so I can use as much as I like without the curls being weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I have all the other products from diva curl and they smell great.  </li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>but it left my hair nice and frizz free for 2 days.</li>
            <li>Lucky me</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>WILL WORK BEAUTIFULLY even though your hair is really a touch too dry by Deva standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and so far have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for slightly more hold than the gel alone can provide, plus some frizz-fighting action, buy this!</li>
            <li>need to get the whole line ladies!!</li>
            <li>TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and definitely makes my curly hair behave better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before purchasing this, I had been worried that it would be too heavy for my fine waves, but it&#x27;s not at all; it feels nice and light, and there&#x27;s no need to \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot; when you use it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite, but after application, the smell is completely gone, so no worries.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work the same way, because it can&#x27;t, but it does a great job, and it appears to completely wash out with the Devacurl nopoo.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>I use more than 10 pumps at a time, which is too much considering how much this product cost.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and love Deva products.  </li>
            <li>My curls refresh nicely the next day with a water spritz.</li>
            <li>Keeps her curls fresh looking and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>You have to play around with the right amount to put in wet hair before you scrunch, but then you are good to go.</li>
            <li>Goes on right after conditioner before gel.  </li>
            <li>This foam has just the right amount of hold that my hair needs.</li>
            <li>Mister right, and soommmmee times  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weight my curls down, defines them well, holds up to humidity, and allows for perfect second day hair.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this new Deva product, which just came out about two weeks ago, and love it so far.  </li>
            <li>like Deva products a lot and regularly use Low Poo Shampoo,  B&#x27;leavin&#x27; Volumnizer and Deva&#x27;s hairspray (which also works GREAT to keep eyebrows in place).</li>
            <li>I know they are damaging and hard to wash out, so the Devacurl mousse is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>I try to buy all of them there first.</li>
            <li>My opinion only, but I&#x27;ve found better products for my curly hair at Ross&#x27;, TJ Max and Marshalls.</li>
            <li>this is my second order I love this product</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and its the first product that allows my curls to be defined and light and bouncy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really keeps my curly hair from getting frizzy!</li>
            <li>this puts  me at the bottom of the Deva Curl Food Chain ;) and LOVE this Foam for the extra volume and curl I need.  </li>
            <li>I use this after the gel and my first micro-towel scrunch.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!  </li>
            <li>fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m still really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>If you do not wash your hair every day, resist adding more foam when you style your hair the next time.</li>
            <li>It would be better for those with coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li>This bottle will probably last me more than 4 months.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly the way they describe it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better on someone who actually has curly hair???</li>
            <li>the first time was a fluke.</li>
            <li>This product really &amp;#34;pumps up the volume&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My most recent bottle quit pumping foam</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes or so, I dry my hair with a diffuser and presto - frizz free, smooth, curly hair with volume.</li>
            <li>You can easily spend over $100-$150 to get the various products to use for your hair easily,  and for a 10 year old</li>
            <li>I now have nice soft curls, that hold throughout the day and into the next.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this product, based on the positive reviews here, and on the naturallycurly.com website.  </li>
            <li>I really did throw out all of the other bottles of product that I own.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really come out foamy at first.  </li>
            <li>My hair then is soft, bouncy and full of wave and body.  </li>
            <li>Once you get their method down, though, you can start customizing it to suit your own preferences.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren&#x27;t any better than their cheaper counterparts.</li>
            <li>The website gives you a good recommendation on which products to get for  various  hair types; however, it still is necessary to consider your  particular  hair (thickness/thinness;</li>
            <li>Can not live without it :)</li>
            <li>Then I apply this product (in a large quantity - several pumps - fine hair needs LOTS of</li>
            <li>Deva is expensive but worth the cost for the great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the devacurl products and use them regularly.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It is the Real product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;can&#x27;t beat the price and the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I used a clarifying shampoo that I realized how much product was in my hair.</li>
            <li>It often comes out of the container as liquid rather than foam, and when it DOES come out as foam, it leaves my hair very sticky-feeling.  </li>
            <li>If I use a gel it has to be very lightweight.</li>
            <li>my hair just looks so alive when I put this in my hair so worth the cost .....</li>
            <li>Use a water bottle filled with water, spray your hair, scrunch and follow drying procedure, as stated above.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>It does go fast, though...</li>
            <li>and then I remove excess water by gentle squeezing out with my hand and then wrapping it in a microfiber towel.  </li>
            <li>Be stingy with how much you use.</li>
            <li>You hair will get crunchy fast.</li>
            <li>I use Devacurl NoPoo, One Condition, and Devacurl Light Defining Gel, and wanted to try this mousse for extra volume.</li>
            <li>However, I really like the gel and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It can get crunchy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>If you put too much on, it will be sticky and heavier.</li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was ordering, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>fine/course; and how much encouragement it needs to  curl).</li>
            <li>Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product line, but it leaves residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of the devachan products for my VERY curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This actually really helps define my curls.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t so much foam</li>
            <li>But the real problem is that it made my hair feel sticky and then it went straight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, but it really helps define my curls nicely.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair look good, but if you touch your hair near the scalp it was thick and almost sticky but more dry than sticky.</li>
            <li>Adding a bit more on following days brings body right back.</li>
            <li>(comb only in shower, only with conditioner in), squeeze out water, dry with an old tee, then , scrunch in 2 pumps for bottom half of hair, 2 for the top, 1 more all over for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It works much better than other curl/scrunch products on the market.</li>
            <li>This like every other cheap mousse sold at drugstores -- except 5x the price!</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine and thin-ish hair that is fairly straight with just slight waves at the ends.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed to complete my devalcurl routine.</li>
            <li>curly wavy hair prob like a 2b and many products tend to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have tried lots and lots of products that were always too heavy.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Less is more with this product.  </li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is alright, not my personal taste, but it fades fairly quickly, so I don&#x27;t notice it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, curly hair, too much product makes the hair stiff and curls funny looking.  </li>
            <li>(for post workout days where I&#x27;m not yet ready to wash fully) Rinse hair in cool water; gently massage scalp, wide tooth comb</li>
            <li>/&gt;**Air dry or gentle, cool diffuse.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product after I was referred to the Devacurl line.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this product again and I highly doubt I will even use it again.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Does feel a little more drying than the curl cream I was using before.  </li>
            <li>I like a little more controll and some curl.  </li>
            <li>I have always used mousse and preferred it over very heavy gels which can really weigh fine hair down and not allow the bounce/volume you want, but this one is much better for my hair than others I have used (although I really like the pantene curl line mousse too).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>Right before I am ready to head out for the day, I diffuse it for about 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li>Then I apply some Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner (I am not mixed racially, but rather I am a blonde haired, blue eyed caucasian gal- but still love this stuff!) and flip my hair upside down and comb my fingers through it, making sure I condition all the way to the ends.  </li>
            <li>I am new to this product.  </li>
            <li>With it, I truly do not need gel, mousse, or hair spray, and I live in humid San Antonio, TX.</li>
            <li>I have contacted the company and they are sending me a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>one of my favorite things about not washing daily is not having wet hair or heat styling as often.</li>
            <li>, I only wish that the price of the products were a little more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all types of mousse in the past and many make my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately I also ordered a small size of the spray gel and that seems to be working better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using them exclusively for the past year and my curls have never looked better...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the first products that actually keeps the frizz halo at bay.  </li>
            <li>Product delivered as advertised and on early!</li>
            <li>With a little water to refresh, easily lasts two days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length very soft fluffy curls which tend to droop into waves throughout the day and are easily squashed when I sleep.</li>
            <li>I flip my hair upside down and do a few more scrunches to &#x27;break the crunch cap&amp;#34; and quickly finger comb my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of all of the Devacurl line, and hope that they help me to FINALLY grow my hair long :)</li>
            <li>and I really love it (AND still have half the bottle left!).</li>
            <li>This foam works well for frizz, but it&#x27;s too heavy for fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this product everyday on my 3B fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>But I do find a little bit of it mixed with my gel helps to hold the curl even better than the gel alone.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this works on my hair, and only a little bit is needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls, the Deva Curl Styling Cream, the Arc AnGel, and other products too, but I find this one with the One Condition used as a leave in works wonders.</li>
            <li>I love Deva foam, it keeps my curls in place without making it hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li>I prefer the foam on extra high humidity days here in Miami because I end up with long lasting frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>keeps them soft.</li>
            <li>, they always feel soft and springy.&lt;br /&gt;-Seems</li>
            <li>Your curls should be soft now.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m liking this mousse</li>
            <li>No-Poo or Jessicurl Gentle Lather, condition/detangle/comb thru with Biolage Conditioning Balm (I usu buy the generic version here</li>
            <li>I have soft, touchable, springy coils.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and curly.</li>
            <li>I thought this would leave my hair soft &amp; take away some frizz.</li>
            <li>This so far is my fave.</li>
            <li>I have semi naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, soft curly waves.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get the maximum amount of curl out of my naturally curly hair, and the Ouidad products/cut, were just not achieving that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at defining slight waves and giving thin hair a bit of lift--and it&#x27;s lightweight enough to not feel as though it&#x27;s sticking in your hair like many other hair products!</li>
            <li>My only concern (as with all conventional hair products) is that it contains more potentially harmful chemicals than I would like.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a long time and really gives body to my curly hair, I do clip it up while hair is air drying.</li>
            <li>And I love that you can pour the last few drops into your next bottle so you are not wasting any!</li>
            <li>I have to be careful to apply the foam sparingly; it seems pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li>After hair is dry, &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; the stiff curls by gathering your hair together and scrunching it once more.</li>
            <li>With other styling products my short hair flattens on the top when wet.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that I will use to give my hair some body - not too heavy; not to light.</li>
            <li>was way too much for my hair which goes to my mid back.  </li>
            <li>I thought I could just get away with using the gel, but with my fine and fluffy hair texture, it really started to get frizzy with the wind or laying down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this is an expensive product, I&#x27;m glad I picked it up!</li>
            <li>i have right below the shoulder length, really curly thick hair.</li>
            <li>especially I can only imagine what it will cost as she gets older and her hair gets longer...</li>
            <li>I have swavy hair type (Natural curl when the right products are used, and slightly wavy when left alone.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and Deva products are the only ones I use.  </li>
            <li>So far, no frizz after being on the water and after being outside on a drizzly day.</li>
            <li>have only tried this volumizing foam once so far</li>
            <li>I try really hard to not touch it until its dry because it&#x27;s so much better that way.</li>
            <li>I usually love Deva products and have been using them for years (No poo, angel, and mister right are my favorites) but this one was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li>And if they do get a little wind blown I just add a little more water and it immediately resets.  </li>
            <li>It arrived with 3 or 4 other products (all in their own boxes/packages) in a big box, loosely floating around the bottom with  the cap missing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially if you have long curly hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t personally had any major issues with the pump, but I can see how the design could cause issues if dropped, or you get a fluke.</li>
            <li>I spray my hair with a little water spritzer, but I find that my hair has to be pretty damp for this to work..</li>
            <li>I do a pump of the gel mixed with 2 pumps of the foam, applying both to sopping wet hair right out of the shower, scrunch, and DO NOT TOUCH until dry.</li>
            <li>However, your hair will be very crunchy and you  have to wait a long while until it is totally dry to break up the curls (without risk of creating frizz) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lightly Scrunch it in when hair is still pretty wet, and do no touch until your curls are completely dry.</li>
            <li>Granted, I am reaching the end of it, but I&#x27;m surprised how long it has lasted.</li>
            <li>It give my hair volume, holds the curl, and leaves my hair soft all day long.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products.</li>
            <li>Thi makes my hair stiff and sticky unless i use it as the only product right after washing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, though it doesn&#x27;t have quite as much hold as a gel.</li>
            <li>I have medium length curls, and a lot of different curl patterns, so certain ares tend to be weighed down and/or not as curly.</li>
            <li>I live on the wetcoast and find I use this on wet rainy days.</li>
            <li>It lasts much longer, you use less.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know too much about hair products and don&#x27;t really use anything, but my stylist prompted me to try out this product (which I wasn&#x27;t too unhappy to do as it&#x27;s not incredibly expensive).</li>
            <li>I guess my hair is just a fuzzy mess since nothing really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>I usually end up layering some store bought mousse on top to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li>I wish I could use this as a volume boosting dry shampoo type of product on no-wash days, but it only really works on wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine curls.  </li>
            <li>I have 2C/3A curls medium length thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>I was not excited about spending $20 for mousse, when the cheaper silicone products cost about 1/4 as much.  </li>
            <li>A little too much volume.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned at that point, thinking that I may have used too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and usually struggle to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down or make them too crunchy.</li>

            <li> This product is meant to be Deva&#x27;s version of a mousse, and it gives great volume and</li>
            <li> Great product-</li>
            <li> Great product you need to try.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Curls/waves are great.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  </li>
            <li> I use DevaCare conditioners and thought this product would be great.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> I think this product is great from a curl and volume standpoint.  </li>
            <li> We have all experienced bottles that quit functioning before the product runs out.  </li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> The company I bought it from has a great price also.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mousse ever!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product, work well on my curls</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Best styling product I&#x27;ve used for adding body and definition to my very fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the frizz control on most days.</li>
            <li> my curls have never been more awesome!  </li>
            <li> (although we all know that curly hair has a mind of its own!)  </li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and this mousse is perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> This is one of Deva Curl&#x27;s gluten free hair products and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Good deal all around.</li>
            <li> I need a lot of moisture, but I also want good hold and definition.</li>
            <li> This product is good at holding the hair and reducing frizz, however I have to use A LOT of it in order for that to happen.</li>
            <li> Both products together gives me really good results.</li>
            <li> A good portion of the foam had been dispensed though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> I find that this provides nice hold and is pleasant to put in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is great for fine hair!</li>
            <li> Great product - love it.</li>
            <li> I am, however, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much and it makes perfect ringlets!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Love my foam!</li>
            <li> Glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted more than one day!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> My curls look so shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> product - way more than course hair!)</li>
            <li> I love these products!</li>
            <li> prices here are better than in store or at the salon, too!</li>
            <li> i love this foam!</li>
            <li> Great volume for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> and I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Since it provides a nice amount of hold, I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to use a gel over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never knew my hair could look this good :)</li>
            <li> Best of all, I save time getting ready.</li>
            <li> The foam smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li> Nice results.  </li>
            <li> so this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and scrunches out to leave nice, shiny curls.  </li>
            <li> I use the gel because it is part of the whole process but honestly, the foam is my favorite product and what gives me the best bouncy waves and polishes my look.</li>
            <li> Light but effective, a good go to for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the best product for my curls, thus far.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell too - it&#x27;s a nice lemony/vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Completely non-sticky and creates beautiful bouncy curls for me!</li>
            <li> nice and light, very clean feel but good volume</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my curly hair - honestly, most of the Deva products I&#x27;ve tried are good but this is the one I live by....</li>
            <li> This works great on the first day.</li>
            <li> Use very lightly.</li>
            <li> For someone who is not worried about chemicals, it is a top knotch product</li>
            <li> Have occassionally strayed trying to find something better, and have not found it.</li>
            <li> I use this and gel, and do much scrunching, and it looks great.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t using sulfate shampoos, it is challenging to find a product that will work, and will also not build up, because most silicones are not water soluble, and they require a detergent to get them out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> I love how it holds my curls</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this foam and the bottle lasted quite a bit longer than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I like using the volumizing gel for the top of my head and the foam for the sides.</li>
            <li> I love this product when used in conjunction with the One Condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Love it recommend this to a lot of friends</li>
            <li> If you use more, you are wasting product and it will create sticky hair.</li>
            <li> Let hair air-dry without touching or use diffuser with hair dryer.</li>
            <li> In fact, my curls (type 3B) did better with Aussie brand mousse.</li>
            <li> My favorite mousse is suave but discovered it had sulfate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while now and just love it.</li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> So maybe get 2 bottles at once :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> then I scrunch some more.  </li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it is a lot of volume, but some is OK.</li>
            <li> It is much better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so amazed with the results :)</li>
            <li> if I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the foam.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I&#x27;ve used form before and didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> You can comb it if you want to relax it more without it getting frizzy again.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Makes your curly hair even more curly.  </li>
            <li> However, this is much better compared to any of the gel products by Deva.  </li>
            <li> I really love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> (run hands along top of hair instead of putting your fingers through your hair).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Deva Products ....</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Ok, let me just say this product has literally changed my life.</li>
            <li> It helped my fall in love with my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this foam, it works for my hair a lot nicer than the &amp;#34;AnGel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> That one works, but this one just seems to finish off better for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and my curls more free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)</li>
            <li> I love the Deva no-poo shampoo and one condition curly hair conditioner</li>
            <li> I will not be spending more money on this product until Deva can improve the bottle.</li>
            <li> It gives me volume on top and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> I love scrunching two squirts in after my DevaCurl ArcAngel and B&#x27;Leave in.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise.. I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist to add fullness to my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair always looks great and really brings out the curl.  </li>
            <li> I love this volumizing foam for my curls.  </li>
            <li> I do think the gel is better for humid, summer days though.</li>
            <li> Tip: when you use this product, make sure to keep it away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> I used to use the moisture lock spray, now I use this, or sometimes both, on top of the Angel curl enhancer.  </li>
            <li> Wherever the foam landed was where it stayed, so I&#x27;d have to pump out more to cover all of my hair.</li>
            <li> If anything, it creates more frizz.</li>
            <li> Perfect, shiny, healthy curls all day long!</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to save the merchandise that it saturated (being a plastic item in it&#x27;s own box).  </li>
            <li> This foam, leaves my hair feeling soft, FRIZZ FREE, incredibly shiny even in this humidity.</li>
            <li> I use all the products but my favorite is the foam it works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I think this mousse is great if you are going the no/low poo route, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair, and it seems to wash out completely.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would call it frizz free for me, but I think that is more about my curls, not the product.  </li>
            <li> I am still struggling with shine, haven&#x27;t found the right product for that yet, but if I use the NoPoo, the Conditioner, the Angel and this, I get really nicely defined curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not big on hair product, but I&#x27;ve absolutely loved this foam!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comes in a space saving bottle.</li>
            <li> Very quick response from them.</li>
            <li> The only thing nice about this product is that it does smell good .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, yet puts perfect volume into my hair &amp; keeps the style fresh til the next washing.</li>
            <li> This product did not weigh my hair down... absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, that with ArcAngel Gel and B’leave looked full and healthy, with well defined curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair that can get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have fine</li>
            <li> no help for fine wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and was having difficulty iwth dispersing the DivaCurl Angel (gel) throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is designed for fine hair, maybe for coarser one.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and this gives it volume and has great holding power even on a very humid day in Florida.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap &amp; it works.</li>
            <li> foam definitely works and also has given my hair great volume.  </li>
            <li> Use lightly.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous, lightweight foam for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks, and tossed the rest which is a bummer because this isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> It Free Moisture Lock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over the Deva B&#x27;Leave In, and it works great to further define my waves.  </li>
            <li> It also gives me great second-day hair, and I haven&#x27;t had to re-apply it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rub hands lightly together and scrunch through hair.</li>
            <li> Foamy and light and smell is kinda citrusy.  </li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a curly hair routine that looks something like this:  I wash with a sulfate free shampoo like</li>
            <li> I put one pump in my palm along with one pump of DevaCurl Styling cream and nickle sized amount of DevaCurl Light Defining gel and mix the three together and scrunch at the roots and at the ends.</li>
            <li> WHY have I waited until now to try this fabulous foam??</li>
            <li> The addition of the Volumizing Foam helps my curls not to droop so much throughout the day, and also makes it a lot easier to get nice curls in &amp;#34;day 2&amp;#34; if I just spray them with water and re-scrunch.</li>
            <li> Important fact:</li>
            <li> You may as well go to Target and buy a cheap mousse because that&#x27;s what this product feels like.  </li>
            <li> light hold styling gel that I also have.</li>
            <li> I use this combined with Deva Curl Set it free every morning and</li>
            <li> In, Set it Free and this Volumizing Foam.  </li>
            <li> it gives such great volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam,</li>
            <li> my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free</li>
            <li> This was a great product...until the pump stopped working after the 3rd or 4th use.</li>
            <li> This product is light and makes my curls tighter without any sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for thinner wavy hair.</li>
            <li> importantly, this product doesn&#x27;t reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> the smell is fabulous, I couldn&#x27;t be happier :) and the next day hair doesn&#x27;t need more than a couple scrunches!</li>
            <li> My new favorite Deva product!  </li>
            <li> I live in the South and can&#x27;t avoid frizz on those humid summer days, but DevaCurl foam helps keep the frizz to the greatest minimum possible.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too excited about this</li>
            <li> it works ok when I first bought it..</li>
            <li> As with most Deva products, you&#x27;ll want to watch the videos online/ read instructions prior to using, just so you get the best possible effect to start out with.  </li>
            <li> With this foam my hair gets more height in addition to more volume in general.</li>
            <li> Really helps to add volume to the crown (top) area of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure this is the real product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the father of a bi-racial child and until I found out the Deva Curl products, I had used everything under the sun but wasn&#x27;t really ever satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit tricky to learn how to use this product, but I really like it now and have had a number a people comment that my hair is much prettier and more healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is a great volumizer, but very light, so I can use as much as I like without the curls being weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I have all the other products from diva curl and they smell great.  </li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> but it left my hair nice and frizz free for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Lucky me</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> WILL WORK BEAUTIFULLY even though your hair is really a touch too dry by Deva standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and so far have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for slightly more hold than the gel alone can provide, plus some frizz-fighting action, buy this!</li>
            <li> need to get the whole line ladies!!</li>
            <li> TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and definitely makes my curly hair behave better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before purchasing this, I had been worried that it would be too heavy for my fine waves, but it&#x27;s not at all; it feels nice and light, and there&#x27;s no need to \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot; when you use it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite, but after application, the smell is completely gone, so no worries.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work the same way, because it can&#x27;t, but it does a great job, and it appears to completely wash out with the Devacurl nopoo.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I use more than 10 pumps at a time, which is too much considering how much this product cost.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and love Deva products.  </li>
            <li> My curls refresh nicely the next day with a water spritz.</li>
            <li> Keeps her curls fresh looking and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> You have to play around with the right amount to put in wet hair before you scrunch, but then you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Goes on right after conditioner before gel.  </li>
            <li> This foam has just the right amount of hold that my hair needs.</li>
            <li> Mister right, and soommmmee times  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight my curls down, defines them well, holds up to humidity, and allows for perfect second day hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this new Deva product, which just came out about two weeks ago, and love it so far.  </li>
            <li> like Deva products a lot and regularly use Low Poo Shampoo,  B&#x27;leavin&#x27; Volumnizer and Deva&#x27;s hairspray (which also works GREAT to keep eyebrows in place).</li>
            <li> I know they are damaging and hard to wash out, so the Devacurl mousse is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> I try to buy all of them there first.</li>
            <li> My opinion only, but I&#x27;ve found better products for my curly hair at Ross&#x27;, TJ Max and Marshalls.</li>
            <li> this is my second order I love this product</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and its the first product that allows my curls to be defined and light and bouncy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really keeps my curly hair from getting frizzy!</li>
            <li> this puts  me at the bottom of the Deva Curl Food Chain ;) and LOVE this Foam for the extra volume and curl I need.  </li>
            <li> I use this after the gel and my first micro-towel scrunch.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!  </li>
            <li> fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m still really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> If you do not wash your hair every day, resist adding more foam when you style your hair the next time.</li>
            <li> It would be better for those with coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This bottle will probably last me more than 4 months.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly the way they describe it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better on someone who actually has curly hair???</li>
            <li> the first time was a fluke.</li>
            <li> This product really &amp;#34;pumps up the volume&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My most recent bottle quit pumping foam</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After 15 minutes or so, I dry my hair with a diffuser and presto - frizz free, smooth, curly hair with volume.</li>
            <li> You can easily spend over $100-$150 to get the various products to use for your hair easily,  and for a 10 year old</li>
            <li> I now have nice soft curls, that hold throughout the day and into the next.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product, based on the positive reviews here, and on the naturallycurly.com website.  </li>
            <li> I really did throw out all of the other bottles of product that I own.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really come out foamy at first.  </li>
            <li> My hair then is soft, bouncy and full of wave and body.  </li>
            <li> Once you get their method down, though, you can start customizing it to suit your own preferences.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren&#x27;t any better than their cheaper counterparts.</li>
            <li> The website gives you a good recommendation on which products to get for  various  hair types; however, it still is necessary to consider your  particular  hair (thickness/thinness;</li>
            <li> Can not live without it :)</li>
            <li> Then I apply this product (in a large quantity - several pumps - fine hair needs LOTS of</li>
            <li> Deva is expensive but worth the cost for the great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the devacurl products and use them regularly.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It is the Real product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;can&#x27;t beat the price and the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I used a clarifying shampoo that I realized how much product was in my hair.</li>
            <li> It often comes out of the container as liquid rather than foam, and when it DOES come out as foam, it leaves my hair very sticky-feeling.  </li>
            <li> If I use a gel it has to be very lightweight.</li>
            <li> my hair just looks so alive when I put this in my hair so worth the cost .....</li>
            <li> Use a water bottle filled with water, spray your hair, scrunch and follow drying procedure, as stated above.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> It does go fast, though...</li>
            <li> and then I remove excess water by gentle squeezing out with my hand and then wrapping it in a microfiber towel.  </li>
            <li> Be stingy with how much you use.</li>
            <li> You hair will get crunchy fast.</li>
            <li> I use Devacurl NoPoo, One Condition, and Devacurl Light Defining Gel, and wanted to try this mousse for extra volume.</li>
            <li> However, I really like the gel and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It can get crunchy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> If you put too much on, it will be sticky and heavier.</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was ordering, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> fine/course; and how much encouragement it needs to  curl).</li>
            <li> Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product line, but it leaves residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the devachan products for my VERY curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This actually really helps define my curls.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so much foam</li>
            <li> But the real problem is that it made my hair feel sticky and then it went straight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, but it really helps define my curls nicely.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair look good, but if you touch your hair near the scalp it was thick and almost sticky but more dry than sticky.</li>
            <li> Adding a bit more on following days brings body right back.</li>
            <li> (comb only in shower, only with conditioner in), squeeze out water, dry with an old tee, then , scrunch in 2 pumps for bottom half of hair, 2 for the top, 1 more all over for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It works much better than other curl/scrunch products on the market.</li>
            <li> This like every other cheap mousse sold at drugstores -- except 5x the price!</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine and thin-ish hair that is fairly straight with just slight waves at the ends.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed to complete my devalcurl routine.</li>
            <li> curly wavy hair prob like a 2b and many products tend to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have tried lots and lots of products that were always too heavy.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Less is more with this product.  </li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is alright, not my personal taste, but it fades fairly quickly, so I don&#x27;t notice it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, curly hair, too much product makes the hair stiff and curls funny looking.  </li>
            <li> (for post workout days where I&#x27;m not yet ready to wash fully) Rinse hair in cool water; gently massage scalp, wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Air dry or gentle, cool diffuse.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after I was referred to the Devacurl line.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again and I highly doubt I will even use it again.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does feel a little more drying than the curl cream I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I like a little more controll and some curl.  </li>
            <li> I have always used mousse and preferred it over very heavy gels which can really weigh fine hair down and not allow the bounce/volume you want, but this one is much better for my hair than others I have used (although I really like the pantene curl line mousse too).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> Right before I am ready to head out for the day, I diffuse it for about 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> Then I apply some Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner (I am not mixed racially, but rather I am a blonde haired, blue eyed caucasian gal- but still love this stuff!) and flip my hair upside down and comb my fingers through it, making sure I condition all the way to the ends.  </li>
            <li> I am new to this product.  </li>
            <li> With it, I truly do not need gel, mousse, or hair spray, and I live in humid San Antonio, TX.</li>
            <li> I have contacted the company and they are sending me a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> one of my favorite things about not washing daily is not having wet hair or heat styling as often.</li>
            <li> , I only wish that the price of the products were a little more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all types of mousse in the past and many make my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately I also ordered a small size of the spray gel and that seems to be working better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using them exclusively for the past year and my curls have never looked better...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the first products that actually keeps the frizz halo at bay.  </li>
            <li> Product delivered as advertised and on early!</li>
            <li> With a little water to refresh, easily lasts two days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length very soft fluffy curls which tend to droop into waves throughout the day and are easily squashed when I sleep.</li>
            <li> I flip my hair upside down and do a few more scrunches to &#x27;break the crunch cap&amp;#34; and quickly finger comb my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of all of the Devacurl line, and hope that they help me to FINALLY grow my hair long :)</li>
            <li> and I really love it (AND still have half the bottle left!).</li>
            <li> This foam works well for frizz, but it&#x27;s too heavy for fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday on my 3B fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> But I do find a little bit of it mixed with my gel helps to hold the curl even better than the gel alone.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this works on my hair, and only a little bit is needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls, the Deva Curl Styling Cream, the Arc AnGel, and other products too, but I find this one with the One Condition used as a leave in works wonders.</li>
            <li> I love Deva foam, it keeps my curls in place without making it hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> I prefer the foam on extra high humidity days here in Miami because I end up with long lasting frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> keeps them soft.</li>
            <li> , they always feel soft and springy.&lt;br /&gt;-Seems</li>
            <li> Your curls should be soft now.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m liking this mousse</li>
            <li> No-Poo or Jessicurl Gentle Lather, condition/detangle/comb thru with Biolage Conditioning Balm (I usu buy the generic version here</li>
            <li> I have soft, touchable, springy coils.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and curly.</li>
            <li> I thought this would leave my hair soft &amp; take away some frizz.</li>
            <li> This so far is my fave.</li>
            <li> I have semi naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, soft curly waves.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get the maximum amount of curl out of my naturally curly hair, and the Ouidad products/cut, were just not achieving that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at defining slight waves and giving thin hair a bit of lift--and it&#x27;s lightweight enough to not feel as though it&#x27;s sticking in your hair like many other hair products!</li>
            <li> My only concern (as with all conventional hair products) is that it contains more potentially harmful chemicals than I would like.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time and really gives body to my curly hair, I do clip it up while hair is air drying.</li>
            <li> And I love that you can pour the last few drops into your next bottle so you are not wasting any!</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to apply the foam sparingly; it seems pretty concentrated.</li>
            <li> After hair is dry, &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; the stiff curls by gathering your hair together and scrunching it once more.</li>
            <li> With other styling products my short hair flattens on the top when wet.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that I will use to give my hair some body - not too heavy; not to light.</li>
            <li> was way too much for my hair which goes to my mid back.  </li>
            <li> I thought I could just get away with using the gel, but with my fine and fluffy hair texture, it really started to get frizzy with the wind or laying down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this is an expensive product, I&#x27;m glad I picked it up!</li>
            <li> i have right below the shoulder length, really curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> especially I can only imagine what it will cost as she gets older and her hair gets longer...</li>
            <li> I have swavy hair type (Natural curl when the right products are used, and slightly wavy when left alone.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and Deva products are the only ones I use.  </li>
            <li> So far, no frizz after being on the water and after being outside on a drizzly day.</li>
            <li> have only tried this volumizing foam once so far</li>
            <li> I try really hard to not touch it until its dry because it&#x27;s so much better that way.</li>
            <li> I usually love Deva products and have been using them for years (No poo, angel, and mister right are my favorites) but this one was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> And if they do get a little wind blown I just add a little more water and it immediately resets.  </li>
            <li> It arrived with 3 or 4 other products (all in their own boxes/packages) in a big box, loosely floating around the bottom with  the cap missing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially if you have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally had any major issues with the pump, but I can see how the design could cause issues if dropped, or you get a fluke.</li>
            <li> I spray my hair with a little water spritzer, but I find that my hair has to be pretty damp for this to work..</li>
            <li> I do a pump of the gel mixed with 2 pumps of the foam, applying both to sopping wet hair right out of the shower, scrunch, and DO NOT TOUCH until dry.</li>
            <li> However, your hair will be very crunchy and you  have to wait a long while until it is totally dry to break up the curls (without risk of creating frizz) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lightly Scrunch it in when hair is still pretty wet, and do no touch until your curls are completely dry.</li>
            <li> Granted, I am reaching the end of it, but I&#x27;m surprised how long it has lasted.</li>
            <li> It give my hair volume, holds the curl, and leaves my hair soft all day long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products.</li>
            <li> Thi makes my hair stiff and sticky unless i use it as the only product right after washing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, though it doesn&#x27;t have quite as much hold as a gel.</li>
            <li> I have medium length curls, and a lot of different curl patterns, so certain ares tend to be weighed down and/or not as curly.</li>
            <li> I live on the wetcoast and find I use this on wet rainy days.</li>
            <li> It lasts much longer, you use less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know too much about hair products and don&#x27;t really use anything, but my stylist prompted me to try out this product (which I wasn&#x27;t too unhappy to do as it&#x27;s not incredibly expensive).</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is just a fuzzy mess since nothing really seems to work.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up layering some store bought mousse on top to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use this as a volume boosting dry shampoo type of product on no-wash days, but it only really works on wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine curls.  </li>
            <li> I have 2C/3A curls medium length thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> I was not excited about spending $20 for mousse, when the cheaper silicone products cost about 1/4 as much.  </li>
            <li> A little too much volume.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned at that point, thinking that I may have used too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and usually struggle to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down or make them too crunchy.</li>
            <li> It manages to tame my curly/frizzy hair very well along with the DivaCurl Gel.</li>
            <li> Like I said, My hair is about shoulder length, a little shorter, but this foam has really gone a long way.</li>
            <li> Naturally it leaked all over the bottom of the box &amp; onto one of the other packages.  </li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way, and I only need to use one pump every other day, as I have a short bob right now.  </li>
            <li> The only product that gives me long lasting volume</li>
            <li> I usually use about 4 pumps of this after a medium amount of DevaCurl Utra Defining Gel on super wet hair and then scrunch out the extra moisture with a microfiber towel, let it air dry, and scrunch out the gel crunch.</li>
            <li> Hair is sticky (even with a very small amount applied) and always looks super dry.</li>
            <li> It does, however, last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> no frizz and my hair isn&#x27;t flat.</li>
            <li> I want to pare it with the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to see what happens, even though I am not a gel person at all (my hair is thin and gels usually weigh my hair down), but I am willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the people who have curls and want MORE volume - not the stereotypical curly girl problem, which makes it hard to find products for us, but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, curly hair like me, I know you own at least a dozen.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling super stiff, the same feeling you would have after using a common mousse.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair then (check youtube if you don&#x27;t know what this is), into a long sleeve tshirt and let it sit while I get dressed, apply makeup,</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it too long now.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using a devacurl product that my hair came out limp, greasy, and heavy with product.</li>
            <li> My stylist recently recommended this new foam, and I wouldn&#x27;t think I needed it given that my hair is already quite thick.  </li>
            <li> After I wash and condition my hair, while still in the shower with dripping wet hair, I apply this to my hair in sections (two side sections and a back section), scrunch, and then put my hair in a tshirt or microfiber towel to dry a bit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> take too long to dry, doesn&#x27;t add dry time by staying wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a little extra at the crown of my head where my hair is extra dry and is softens it up.</li>
            <li> my hair is almost dry.  </li>
            <li> After I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> then I use about 4 pumps of the foam and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> and I scrunch out the excess water with a micro fiber towel and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t ruin the feel of my hair if I put it on as directed, when my hair is still damp, but I have forgotten to put it on and tried some on my hair after it is dry.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS use clips at roots until nearly dry.  </li>
            <li> I put this product in my hair after a shower and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> (shoulder length 3C medium density) and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> The next day my hair felt thin and dry (and straight).  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick with the gel and flip my head upside down while diffusing for extra volume.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way I&#x27;m now only using three pumps and it gives me softness hold and a tad bit of volume.  </li>
            <li> while soaking wet in shower; dry with tee; scrunch in</li>
            <li> This little bottle has lasted 3 and a half months so far</li>
            <li> I use just a little on the bottom third of my hair</li>
            <li> Then I scrunch this in my hair when it&#x27;s still wet - and walk out the door.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> B&#x27;Leave In to my wet hair, I then rake in about 2 1/2 pumps of the FFVF, then use a spray bottle to re-wet my hair and get the clumps to re-form.  </li>
            <li> my hair is sopping wet in the shower I put in about a quarter-size dollop of One Condition and scrunch that through, then I use about 4-5 pumps of this foam and scrunch that in.</li>
            <li> I was told it can be refilled with this companies Angel (gel) product and water, once empty.</li>
            <li> I scrunch in the foam when my hair is dripping soaking wet</li>
            <li> Careful not to over apply it, it can weigh hair</li>
            <li> shake the curls and fluff it up.</li>
            <li> This product came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I have botticelli curls that are thick, but very fine which makes it difficult to find a gel/mousse that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it a few different ways, generally 5 pumps does the job (I have THICK, shoulder length waves with some curl):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry I can fluff it up and mess with it</li>
            <li> The Devacurl foam washes out with my nopoo, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was looking about two shades darker for a week or so, and I thought it was due to something in the Devacurl nopoo (it has oils)</li>
            <li> but it was actually the tre semme heat mousse that I had been using for the past weeks.  </li>
            <li> mix it up with other Deva products too.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s no lingering fragrance unlike with some of the other DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> It works like any other de frizzer.</li>
            <li> Still like my other non-name brand products from Walmart (Tresemme).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s an oversight on the merchant, or whom ever packaged the product to be delivered - possibly a combo of both!!</li>
            <li> hair is a few inches past my shoulders, and I&#x27;ve found that about 2 1/2 pumps is enough to thoroughly coat my hair.  </li>
            <li> but the residue is not worth the cash.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I use Alterna&#x27;s Caviar CC creme as a base and layer this mousse on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do all this bending upside down in the shower.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep curly hair neat and keeps down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Then I apply curl keeper, comb through (still flipped upside down) then scrunch.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down on the frizz and defines curls.</li>
            <li> This product weighs them down and makes my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the arc anGEL, which has never let me down.</li>
            <li> My first disappointing experience with a Deva product.  </li>
            <li> Creams are too heavy for my hair, it weighs it down and makes it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have to keep playing with my hair while it dries, otherwise it gets quite hard once your hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I called Amazon and they sent a return label (very accomodating as usual), but for a mere $18.00, I decided to just take the hit and keep it myself.  </li>
            <li> Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> I applied this after doing the no-poo, then one-condition, scrunched in a little gel, towel scrunched, then scrunched in a couple pumps of this-</li>
            <li> I like how little you use and</li>
            <li> Once your hair is dried, you will not have that &amp;#34;crunchy look&amp;#34; and your hair will not have the look of too little product.</li>
            <li> She has trouble finding products that work with her curly cut</li>
            <li> I now use this everyday to scrunch my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thrown out all of my heavy hold gels and mousses.  </li>
            <li> These tend to leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> these products are too heavy and do not allow my hair to breathe.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use the pump for a few days, it jams on me every time.</li>
            <li> Once my hair dried, it looked like a bunch of crunchy ringlets.  </li>
            <li> Waste of product.  </li>
            <li> , you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> After conditioning in the shower, flip your hair upside down and put about 3-4 pumps of the product (my length is just past my shoulders) through your hair-</li>
            <li> typically wash and set my hair at night, and then sleep on it! -</li>
            <li> Too stiff for curly hair and kinda oily looking</li>
            <li> It helps tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it sounded like it would tame my curls without the crunchy untouchable feel.  </li>
            <li> On second day, it&#x27;s almost like it gets worse, the hair gets soooo thick and sticky</li>
            <li> this product is too expensive for it to be leaking out of the side of the bottle due to a jammed pump.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will repurchase when this bottle is gone...</li>
            <li> and I usually have to put it up or wash it again.</li>
            <li> I have curls just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t destroy the curls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past six months or so</li>
            <li> No more frizzy days</li>
            <li> My hair is about 3\\&quot; past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Even with just a small amount it made my hair so stiff!</li>
            <li> It calms my thin curly frizzy flyaway hair without being stiff or heavy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dull and unmanageable with this mousse.</li>
            <li> So it was hard to spread it throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> , I can wear my curls for at least two days without frizz, often times</li>
            <li> I am afraid to add some other product for volume because I do not want to ruin the Deva system by putting something else in my hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It had a weak sudsy consistency and no lather at all.</li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair is gunky and feels awful.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the seal seems to leak between the base of the lid and the pump.  </li>
            <li> and it seems as my curls get worse and worse with each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that this has made my hair look worse than any other hair product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed to write that this product makes my hair extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this mousse sadly.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> but, there&#x27;s a terrible white residue.</li>
            <li> Well I thought wrong...</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this brand.</li>
            <li> that is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Hate the smell and it makes your hair very stiff.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a hairstylist who specializes in cutting curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> disappointed after spending this money, I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to waste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very expensive!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> nasty stuff - will not order again</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel awful.  </li>
            <li> Terrible smell.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed to write that this product makes my hair extremely frizzy. I&#x27;ve used all types of mousse in the past and many make my hair crunchy. I had high hopes for this product after I was referred to the Devacurl line. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that this has made my hair look worse than any other hair product. I really wanted it to work!!</li>
            <li> They used it on me on my salon and I liked it.  I mix it with the gel.  I&#x27;m thankful that I can get a bit of a price break on Amazon for the Deva products.  I try to buy all of them there first.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly thick hair, not wavy, but actual springy curls. I had such high hopes for the Deva products, but in the end they weren&#x27;t any better than their cheaper counterparts. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying these higher end curly hair products. Head to Target for the same type of shampoo, Frizz-Free stuff, gel &amp; condition without bruising your credit card. My opinion only, but I&#x27;ve found better products for my curly hair at Ross&#x27;, TJ Max and Marshalls. Plus using a little virgin olive oil added to my conditioner has tamed the frizz. It&#x27;s cheap &amp; it works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s light, yet puts perfect volume into my hair &amp; keeps the style fresh til the next washing. For me it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;have to have&amp;#34; item!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your hair.  Works great, even on rainy days</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair that can get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foam definitely works and also has given my hair great volume.  However, your hair will be very crunchy and you  have to wait a long while until it is totally dry to break up the curls (without risk of creating frizz) and fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are problems with the pump where it just stops working after a while. I purchased a travel pump that works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Deva products a lot and regularly use Low Poo Shampoo,  B&#x27;leavin&#x27; Volumnizer and Deva&#x27;s hairspray (which also works GREAT to keep eyebrows in place).</li>
            <li> This is one of Deva Curl&#x27;s gluten free hair products and it works wonderfully. It works much better than other curl/scrunch products on the market. My only concern (as with all conventional hair products) is that it contains more potentially harmful chemicals than I would like. I will be exploring organic options in the future. For someone who is not worried about chemicals, it is a top knotch product and I recommend it highly! You have to play around with the right amount to put in wet hair before you scrunch, but then you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Use very lightly. I have baby fine, curly hair, too much product makes the hair stiff and curls funny looking.  Use lightly. Smells great. It is the Real product.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell and it makes your hair very stiff.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous, lightweight foam for curly/wavy hair. Have occassionally strayed trying to find something better, and have not found it. I&#x27;ve purchased this product probably 25 times. It&#x27;s amazing. The smell is not my favorite, but after application, the smell is completely gone, so no worries.</li>
            <li> Spolier alert: I bought this for my wife. SHe adores it, the local CVS was out of it, and Amazon Prime had it at a lower price. Good deal all around.</li>
            <li> this is my second order I love this product it&#x27;s a must for frizzy curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t beat the price and the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and its the first product that allows my curls to be defined and light and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;It does not weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  It manages to tame my curly/frizzy hair very well along with the DivaCurl Gel.</li>
            <li> I use this and gel, and do much scrunching, and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Great Curly Hair Girl product in winter.  In Maryland I need stronger product in summer because it is so humid here!  I use it as well as the Deva Gel.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this mousse sadly. I&#x27;m trying to stick w the product line though.</li>
            <li> Great item!! Works just as described!</li>
            <li> really keeps my curly hair from getting frizzy!</li>
            <li> Love my foam! Volume and bouncy curls for me!</li>
            <li> I think this mousse is great if you are going the no/low poo route, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair, and it seems to wash out completely.  I was using a silicone based mousse for awhile, and it was really starting to build up on my hair.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used a clarifying shampoo that I realized how much product was in my hair. My hair was looking about two shades darker for a week or so, and I thought it was due to something in the Devacurl nopoo (it has oils) but it was actually the tre semme heat mousse that I had been using for the past weeks.  It all came out when I used the Devacurl lowpoo, and my hair went back to it&#x27;s normal color.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the way that silicones make my hair look, but I know they are damaging and hard to wash out, so the Devacurl mousse is a great alternative.  It doesn&#x27;t work the same way, because it can&#x27;t, but it does a great job, and it appears to completely wash out with the Devacurl nopoo.&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t using sulfate shampoos, it is challenging to find a product that will work, and will also not build up, because most silicones are not water soluble, and they require a detergent to get them out of your hair.  The Devacurl foam washes out with my nopoo, and a little goes a long way.  I was not excited about spending $20 for mousse, when the cheaper silicone products cost about 1/4 as much.  A little of this product goes a long way, and I only need to use one pump every other day, as I have a short bob right now.  I rub the product between my hands and then apply from tips to roots, then scrunch.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and it smells great.  It keeps my curls together while drying and it helps avoid the dreaded frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of all of the Devacurl line, and hope that they help me to FINALLY grow my hair long :)</li>
            <li> My first disappointing experience with a Deva product.  This stuff is awful. It often comes out of the container as liquid rather than foam, and when it DOES come out as foam, it leaves my hair very sticky-feeling.  On the upside, I can now serve as human flypaper! I used it for a couple of weeks, and tossed the rest which is a bummer because this isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> I did not see this product helping de-frizz or hold  shape.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length s-wavy hair (yes... this puts  me at the bottom of the Deva Curl Food Chain ;) and LOVE this Foam for the extra volume and curl I need.  I use this after the gel and my first micro-towel scrunch.  Then I scrunch this in my hair when it&#x27;s still wet - and walk out the door.  When I get to work (I have a 45 minute commute) my hair is almost dry.  I flip my hair upside down and do a few more scrunches to &#x27;break the crunch cap&amp;#34; and quickly finger comb my hair.  My hair then is soft, bouncy and full of wave and body.  I use the gel because it is part of the whole process but honestly, the foam is my favorite product and what gives me the best bouncy waves and polishes my look.</li>
            <li> nasty stuff - will not order again</li>
            <li> Expensive but if you like mouse over gel this is great!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.  Thi makes my hair stiff and sticky unless i use it as the only product right after washing.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!  I have thin fine curls.  This product is a great volumizer, but very light, so I can use as much as I like without the curls being weighed down.  Glad I found this!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that I will use to give my hair some body - not too heavy; not to light.</li>
            <li> Since I started using DevaCare products, the look and feel of my hair are awesome!! I get compliments about the shine and my perfectly shaped non-frizz curls, all the time. I have recommended this products to all my curly-haired friend. So if youre looking for a great product for your curly hair...DevaCurl or DevaCare is it!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too excited about this once I saw the ingredients. But I have fine, 3b curls and often a curly mousse is the only thing that works for me. If I use a gel it has to be very lightweight. Creams are too heavy for my hair, it weighs it down and makes it greasy. So I was hopeful, but then I saw the ingredients. The first time I used it my hair look good, but if you touch your hair near the scalp it was thick and almost sticky but more dry than sticky. On second day, it&#x27;s almost like it gets worse, the hair gets soooo thick and sticky I swear you could start dreads with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed after spending this money, I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to waste.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I also ordered a small size of the spray gel and that seems to be working better for my hair. I can&#x27;t see how anyone could like this unless they do their hair in a beehive, or something really big. I need volume and frizz control, not glue in my hair. Flakey too.</li>
            <li> I use this with Deva Curl Set It Free Moisture Lock.  I prefer the foam on extra high humidity days here in Miami because I end up with long lasting frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, work well on my curls</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for her curly blonde hair forever and it does the job.  She has trouble finding products that work with her curly cut but this is engineered perfectly for it.  Easy to use and comes in a space saving bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product - love it. I use it with a bit of defining curl gel to make my hair fuller.</li>
            <li> Not the best thing ever. Very expensive! If you use too much your hair is gunky and feels awful. The keys is to use a very tiny amount. Not sure if I will repurchase when this bottle is gone... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Makes my hair looks gorgeous! Just have to keep scrunching it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I now use this everyday to scrunch my hair. I love the product but I do feel that by the end of the day my hair is too greasy.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this new Deva product, which just came out about two weeks ago, and love it so far.  Although it looks like a liquid in the bottle, it pumps out like one of those hand soaps where the liquid turns into a foam. This product is meant to be Deva&#x27;s version of a mousse, and it gives great volume and definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use Deva&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners -- just their styling products -- and find that the FFVF plays well with the Curl Junkie products that I use to cleanse and condition.  I&#x27;ve been using it over the Deva B&#x27;Leave In, and it works great to further define my waves.  Since it provides a nice amount of hold, I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to use a gel over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a few inches past my shoulders, and I&#x27;ve found that about 2 1/2 pumps is enough to thoroughly coat my hair.  After raking in about four pumps of B&#x27;Leave In to my wet hair, I then rake in about 2 1/2 pumps of the FFVF, then use a spray bottle to re-wet my hair and get the clumps to re-form.  Then I scrunch my hair to re-activate the curl.  I do all this bending upside down in the shower.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing this, I had been worried that it would be too heavy for my fine waves, but it&#x27;s not at all; it feels nice and light, and there&#x27;s no need to \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot; when you use it.  It also gives me great second-day hair, and I haven&#x27;t had to re-apply it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Deva products, it&#x27;s also silicone-, paraben-, and sulfate-free, so it works well with the Curly Girl method, which is explained in Lorraine Massey&#x27;s (the founder of Deva) book [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is an expensive product, I&#x27;m glad I picked it up!</li>
            <li> no help for fine wavy hair</li>
            <li> Light but effective, a good go to for curly hair. Mine is permed and it works for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li> Great product-I love how it holds my curls&lt;br /&gt;And keeps them soft. Delivery time was as promised.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have used it for a long time and really gives body to my curly hair, I do clip it up while hair is air drying.</li>
            <li> It had my hair bouncy but, there&#x27;s a terrible white residue. Especially on the days you want to touch up, refresh your fro. It was bouncy it moved with the wind but the residue is not worth the cash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this foam and the bottle lasted quite a bit longer than I anticipated. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, though it doesn&#x27;t have quite as much hold as a gel. I was very happy with the frizz control on most days.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried all the Deva Curl products.  I do  mix it up with other Deva products too. I like using the volumizing gel for the top of my head and the foam for the sides. I use all the products but my favorite is the foam it works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I tried to stop using this but couldn&#x27;t.  Goes on right after conditioner before gel.  Great product you need to try.</li>
            <li> On the Curl scale I&#x27;m about 3A/3B and my hair is almost shoulder length. I need a lot of moisture, but I also want good hold and definition. I love this product when used in conjunction with the One Condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is sopping wet in the shower I put in about a quarter-size dollop of One Condition and scrunch that through, then I use about 4-5 pumps of this foam and scrunch that in. Then I diffuse with my blow drier on a low heat (otherwise my hair would take HOURS to dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about this foam:&lt;br /&gt;-Great hold, I can wear my curls for at least two days without frizz, often times three days!&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, doesn&#x27;t add dry time by staying wet.&lt;br /&gt;-No crunchy curls, they always feel soft and springy.&lt;br /&gt;-Seems like the bottle will last me longer than the styling cream I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is alright, not my personal taste, but it fades fairly quickly, so I don&#x27;t notice it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightning fast shipping too! It arrived at my house even before I got the email saying the item was shipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, its been FIVE months, and I&#x27;m still on the same bottle! Granted, I am reaching the end of it, but I&#x27;m surprised how long it has lasted. Like I said, My hair is about shoulder length, a little shorter, but this foam has really gone a long way. I haven&#x27;t personally had any major issues with the pump, but I can see how the design could cause issues if dropped, or you get a fluke. Overall I&#x27;m still really satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ve used Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls, the Deva Curl Styling Cream, the Arc AnGel, and other products too, but I find this one with the One Condition used as a leave in works wonders. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair. Cheaper here at Amazon than any place else. Keep curly hair neat and keeps down the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and Deva products are the only ones I use.  The volumizing foam keeps my hair from frizzing even in rainy or humid weather.</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair just looks so alive when I put this in my hair so worth the cost ..... I recommend this to all curly haired girls (:</li>
            <li> This works great on the first day. Curls/waves are great. But on the second day my hair is brittle and tangled at the end and I usually have to put it up or wash it again. I wish it lasted more than one day!</li>
            <li> Love it recommend this to a lot of friends</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!!😄 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS PRODUCT! Blessings to you Cheryl Van Gorder</li>
            <li> The best mousse I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and lasts a long time. Some people complain about the stickiness and the flaking. Here are some tricks that I use: Wash your hair, squeeze water out of hair. Dispense 2-3 pumps of product (that&#x27;s all you need) into hands. If you use more, you are wasting product and it will create sticky hair. Rub hands lightly together and scrunch through hair. Let hair air-dry without touching or use diffuser with hair dryer. After hair is dry, &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; the stiff curls by gathering your hair together and scrunching it once more. Your curls should be soft now. If you do not wash your hair every day, resist adding more foam when you style your hair the next time. This is overkill. Use a water bottle filled with water, spray your hair, scrunch and follow drying procedure, as stated above. This refreshes your curls.</li>
            <li> Not the best. In fact, my curls (type 3B) did better with Aussie brand mousse. My hair was dull and unmanageable with this mousse. It does, however, last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl products are the best thing ever.  I have been using them exclusively for the past year and my curls have never looked better... they are frizz-free and bouncy.  I never knew my hair could look this good :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my curly hair - honestly, most of the Deva products I&#x27;ve tried are good but this is the one I live by....however, it is on the pricey side so I definitely like to take advantage of it whenever the price falls below $20!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair care items I have ever owned.  It give my hair volume, holds the curl, and leaves my hair soft all day long. I highly recommend it, especially if you have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> The only product that gives me long lasting volume</li>
            <li> I loved it! Makes my hair feel wonderful! Saves me loads of time. Looks great and makes me feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and was having difficulty iwth dispersing the DivaCurl Angel (gel) throughout my hair. My hair dresser suggested using this product because the gel comes out in a foam. I love this! I was told it can be refilled with this companies Angel (gel) product and water, once empty. I highly recommend this product!  My curls look so shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> After only three uses the pump on the bottle stopped working! Will not order again and do not recommend this for others.</li>
            <li> it works ok when I first bought it..but now it makes my hair feel sticky. I have to keep playing with my hair while it dries, otherwise it gets quite hard once your hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> This foam works well for frizz, but it&#x27;s too heavy for fine, curly hair.  It would be better for those with coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Too stiff for curly hair and kinda oily looking</li>
            <li> I like it.  Foamy and light and smell is kinda citrusy.  I have curly wavy hair prob like a 2b and many products tend to weigh my hair down.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the amount of pumps 7 was way too much for my hair which goes to my mid back.  So a little goes a long way I&#x27;m now only using three pumps and it gives me softness hold and a tad bit of volume.  Love that it is sulfate free.  My favorite mousse is suave but discovered it had sulfate and so far I&#x27;m liking this mousse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a while now and just love it. I definitely notice a difference in hair volume when I don&#x27;t use it. The bigger the hair the better I say. It does go fast, though...I have curls just past my shoulders and I use about 6-7 pumps every morning. So maybe get 2 bottles at once :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m in love.  Great product!  And I love that you can pour the last few drops into your next bottle so you are not wasting any!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and usually struggle to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down or make them too crunchy. This foam has just the right amount of hold that my hair needs. After I towel dry my hair I use a little bit of leave in conditioner then I use about 4 pumps of the foam and let it air dry. I try really hard to not touch it until its dry because it&#x27;s so much better that way. Once it&#x27;s dry I can fluff it up and mess with it but it doesn&#x27;t destroy the curls! I would recommend to all curly girls!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know too much about hair products and don&#x27;t really use anything, but my stylist prompted me to try out this product (which I wasn&#x27;t too unhappy to do as it&#x27;s not incredibly expensive). I have pretty fine and thin-ish hair that is fairly straight with just slight waves at the ends. I&#x27;m really not big on hair product, but I&#x27;ve absolutely loved this foam! It&#x27;s great at defining slight waves and giving thin hair a bit of lift--and it&#x27;s lightweight enough to not feel as though it&#x27;s sticking in your hair like many other hair products! Though it&#x27;s marketed as a product for curly hair, I&#x27;d definitely say it does a fantastic job of defining thin, wavy hair, so if you do have a similar hair type, I&#x27;d encourage you to try it out! I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my hair ever since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This product is good at holding the hair and reducing frizz, however I have to use A LOT of it in order for that to happen. I use more than 10 pumps at a time, which is too much considering how much this product cost. I want to pare it with the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to see what happens, even though I am not a gel person at all (my hair is thin and gels usually weigh my hair down), but I am willing to give it a try. I have 3A-3B curly hair that is a couple of inches passed my armpit.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and love Deva products.  My stylist recently recommended this new foam, and I wouldn&#x27;t think I needed it given that my hair is already quite thick.  But I do find a little bit of it mixed with my gel helps to hold the curl even better than the gel alone.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a curly hair routine that looks something like this:  I wash with a sulfate free shampoo like No-Poo or Jessicurl Gentle Lather, condition/detangle/comb thru with Biolage Conditioning Balm (I usu buy the generic version here http://www.amazon.com/GVP-Conditioning-Balm-Compare-Biolage/dp/B004FK5XTY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1389974148&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;generic+value+product+conditioning+balm ) and then I remove excess water by gentle squeezing out with my hand and then wrapping it in a microfiber towel.  Then I apply some Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner (I am not mixed racially, but rather I am a blonde haired, blue eyed caucasian gal- but still love this stuff!) and flip my hair upside down and comb my fingers through it, making sure I condition all the way to the ends.  Then I apply curl keeper, comb through (still flipped upside down) then scrunch.  Then I apply this product (in a large quantity - several pumps - fine hair needs LOTS of product - way more than course hair!) then I scrunch some more.  I &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair then (check youtube if you don&#x27;t know what this is), into a long sleeve tshirt and let it sit while I get dressed, apply makeup, chase my toddlers around to get them dressed, make their breakfast, etc.  Right before I am ready to head out for the day, I diffuse it for about 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  Even using a TON of product, my hair is not crunchy.  I have soft, touchable, springy coils.  I have always used mousse and preferred it over very heavy gels which can really weigh fine hair down and not allow the bounce/volume you want, but this one is much better for my hair than others I have used (although I really like the pantene curl line mousse too). I get compliments all the time and also a lot of requests from people asking what I do to get my hair to look so good/behave so well.  I always tell them it is the products and routine because before I figured it all out my hair was anuntamed beast!!!</li>
            <li> This like every other cheap mousse sold at drugstores -- except 5x the price! Hair is sticky (even with a very small amount applied) and always looks super dry. My blonde hair looks like curly hay. Awful.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday on my 3B fine naturally curly hair. I put one pump in my palm along with one pump of DevaCurl Styling cream and nickle sized amount of DevaCurl Light Defining gel and mix the three together and scrunch at the roots and at the ends. Cuts down on the frizz and defines curls.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this product. With other styling products my short hair flattens on the top when wet. With this foam my hair gets more height in addition to more volume in general. My curls refresh nicely the next day with a water spritz. I have to be careful to apply the foam sparingly; it seems pretty concentrated. So far, no frizz after being on the water and after being outside on a drizzly day. Also, there&#x27;s no lingering fragrance unlike with some of the other DevaCurl products. I&#x27;m going to give away my styling gels. This foam is the best!</li>
            <li> I have 2C/3A curls medium length thin, fine hair and I have moved to a tropical humid climate.  Frizz and dullness has always been a problem.  This foam, leaves my hair feeling soft, FRIZZ FREE, incredibly shiny even in this humidity. And it does add volume! :)  I can have day 3 hair with this product without adding anymore product to my hair. I just spritz my hair with water, to re-shape my curls and I am done.  I scrunch in the foam when my hair is dripping soaking wet and I scrunch out the excess water with a micro fiber towel and let it air dry.  I am definitely going to re-purchase this.  I have thrown out all of my heavy hold gels and mousses.  Yes, it is pricey at over $21 a bottle but I only use 5 pumps of this in my hair every time I wash it and that&#x27;s all I need.  Less is more with this product.  This bottle will probably last me more than 4 months.  The inside is liquid and the product dispenses as a foam.  If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this...do it.  Your curls will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I have Curlygirl / Naturallycurly Type 2C hair and this is one of the tools in my kit. Very nice. Works exactly the way they describe it. Not too sticky and just enough definition. I live on the wetcoast and find I use this on wet rainy days.</li>
            <li> I like this product for adding some volume. I don&#x27;t know that it is a lot of volume, but some is OK. I am afraid to add some other product for volume because I do not want to ruin the Deva system by putting something else in my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t ruin the feel of my hair if I put it on as directed, when my hair is still damp, but I have forgotten to put it on and tried some on my hair after it is dry. N/G. It makes your hair feel awful.  It&#x27;s now several months later and I&#x27;m updating this review. I bought some B&#x27;Leave-In for the same purpose as this product(control and volume). It is much better. My hair is soft and curly. I put a little extra at the crown of my head where my hair is extra dry and is softens it up. I use it after gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Deva Curl.  I love these products!</li>
            <li> WHY have I waited until now to try this fabulous foam?? If you&#x27;re looking for slightly more hold than the gel alone can provide, plus some frizz-fighting action, buy this! I have wavy hair, and the gel itself wasn&#x27;t providing the best hold. I applied this after doing the no-poo, then one-condition, scrunched in a little gel, towel scrunched, then scrunched in a couple pumps of this- and I&#x27;m so amazed with the results :) the smell is fabulous, I couldn&#x27;t be happier :) and the next day hair doesn&#x27;t need more than a couple scrunches!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past six months or so and I really love it (AND still have half the bottle left!). I usually use about 4 pumps of this after a medium amount of DevaCurl Utra Defining Gel on super wet hair and then scrunch out the extra moisture with a microfiber towel, let it air dry, and scrunch out the gel crunch. Both products together gives me really good results. This stuff alone is too sticky, and the gel alone doesn&#x27;t give any volume. I have shoulder-length very soft fluffy curls which tend to droop into waves throughout the day and are easily squashed when I sleep. The addition of the Volumizing Foam helps my curls not to droop so much throughout the day, and also makes it a lot easier to get nice curls in &amp;#34;day 2&amp;#34; if I just spray them with water and re-scrunch. Highly recommended for the people who have curls and want MORE volume - not the stereotypical curly girl problem, which makes it hard to find products for us, but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product.  I like how little you use and how well it separates my curls.  Does feel a little more drying than the curl cream I was using before.  Don&#x27;t know yet if I love it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed to complete my devalcurl routine. It helps tame the frizz. I thought I could just get away with using the gel, but with my fine and fluffy hair texture, it really started to get frizzy with the wind or laying down. This helps my perfect curls stay perfect longer. Careful not to over apply it, it can weigh hair down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices here are better than in store or at the salon, too!</li>
            <li> Love the foam. It definitely keeps my hair from frizzing... I will buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> As with most Deva products, you&#x27;ll want to watch the videos online/ read instructions prior to using, just so you get the best possible effect to start out with.  Once you get their method down, though, you can start customizing it to suit your own preferences.  I&#x27;ve found that the foam is sooo versatile.  I use it a few different ways, generally 5 pumps does the job (I have THICK, shoulder length waves with some curl):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The Standard.  Wash + condition (comb only in shower, only with conditioner in), squeeze out water, dry with an old tee, then , scrunch in 2 pumps for bottom half of hair, 2 for the top, 1 more all over for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;2. The Day 2 rinse.  (for post workout days where I&#x27;m not yet ready to wash fully) Rinse hair in cool water; gently massage scalp, wide tooth comb while soaking wet in shower; dry with tee; scrunch in the foam.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Timelapse (for when I have to check on dinner between getting out of the shower and putting in hair product.  Look, you know this happens.)  Wash or rinse; squeeze and blot with tee shirt; wrap hair in tee shirt so water doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere while you check the oven, switch the laundry, set DVR, whatever; come back to bathroom and scrunch foam.  WILL WORK BEAUTIFULLY even though your hair is really a touch too dry by Deva standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Air dry or gentle, cool diffuse.  ALWAYS use clips at roots until nearly dry.  Scrunch and shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically wash and set my hair at night, and then sleep on it! - The foam holds my curls and despite rolling around on my pillow, my hair still has volume and no frizz in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using for about a year now - very happy.  Still use the gel too sometimes, but the foam is my preferred Deva product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Really helps to add volume to the crown (top) area of my hair. I have medium length curls, and a lot of different curl patterns, so certain ares tend to be weighed down and/or not as curly. Because of this foam my curls look great all day! Important fact: Mix with Ultra-Defining Gel! I do a pump of the gel mixed with 2 pumps of the foam, applying both to sopping wet hair right out of the shower, scrunch, and DO NOT TOUCH until dry. It will feel crunchy, but all you have to do is flip your hair over, scrunch to break the casting of the gel, and viola! Perfect, shiny, healthy curls all day long!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, not curly. I thought this would leave my hair soft &amp; take away some frizz. It&#x27;s the exact opposite. Maybe it would work better on someone who actually has curly hair???</li>
            <li> It works like any other de frizzer.</li>
            <li> The pump get clogged and sticks a lot. Be stingy with how much you use. You hair will get crunchy fast.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling super stiff, the same feeling you would have after using a common mousse. Not what is advertised</li>
            <li> Best styling product I&#x27;ve used for adding body and definition to my very fine, curly hair. Adding a bit more on following days brings body right back.</li>
            <li> Ive been using deva products for about 3.5 years now. This so far is my fave. I use One Condition daily as my CO wash and just to moisturize. I used to follow it up once i got out of the shower with the ArcAngel.. but then my stylist recommended this and I fell in love. It lasts much longer, you use less. This little bottle has lasted 3 and a half months so far and I probably have another week left in the bottle. I used 4 pumps a day and that it... i have right below the shoulder length, really curly thick hair. My hair dries quicker with than over the arc angel too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightly Scrunch it in when hair is still pretty wet, and do no touch until your curls are completely dry. shake the curls and fluff it up. Perfect hair every time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I&#x27;ve used form before and didn&#x27;t like it.  I am, however, very satisfied.  It calms my thin curly frizzy flyaway hair without being stiff or heavy.  You can comb it if you want to relax it more without it getting frizzy again.  It also adds shine.  Glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the best product for my curls, thus far.  I&#x27;ll keep buying &amp; using it.  I recommend all the DevaCurl Products.</li>
            <li> Still like my other non-name brand products from Walmart (Tresemme). These tend to leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  Not for me. I have semi naturally curly hair and these products are too heavy and do not allow my hair to breathe.</li>
            <li> Makes your curly hair even more curly.  I looked like I had an afro after using it.  A little too much volume.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipped quickly! I ordered the shampoo and conditioner too so they all work well together.  I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> Only product that works on my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weight my curls down, defines them well, holds up to humidity, and allows for perfect second day hair.  I have extremely curly hair and so far have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have naturally curly hair and this is one of the first products that actually keeps the frizz halo at bay.  I use the Deva Curl gel followed by 2 to 3 pumps of this. . .USE sparingly!  I&#x27;m still playing with my hair &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; in the a.m.; however, this is definitely one of the products that I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> I use Devacurl NoPoo, One Condition, and Devacurl Light Defining Gel, and wanted to try this mousse for extra volume. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m really disappointed. Even with just a small amount it made my hair so stiff! I&#x27;ll just stick with the gel and flip my head upside down while diffusing for extra volume.</li>
            <li> I use DevaCare conditioners and thought this product would be great. Well I thought wrong...my hair looked nappy and ended up with massive tangles instead of defined curls. Then when I went to wash my hair it was like I couldn&#x27;t wash it out !  I tried it twice in case the first time was a fluke. The only thing nice about this product is that it does smell good . I have already thrown it away so I won&#x27;t be tempted to give it another try !</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is just a fuzzy mess since nothing really seems to work.  However, this is much better compared to any of the gel products by Deva.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the gel/wet look all day!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, soft curly waves.  This product weighs them down and makes my hair sticky.  I would never buy again.  However, I really like the gel and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products on my curly hair, and this is one of my two favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great control.&lt;br /&gt;- Super light.&lt;br /&gt;- With a little water to refresh, easily lasts two days.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It can get crunchy if you use too much. just don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;- If I don&#x27;t use the pump for a few days, it jams on me every time. this product is too expensive for it to be leaking out of the side of the bottle due to a jammed pump.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to work like a frizz reducing mousse but it doesn&#x27;t even feel or look like anything is on my hair.  Not impressed with this brand.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s not worth it.  This product leaves my hair crunchy!  I haven&#x27;t used mousse for years and I&#x27;m remembering why.  Don&#x27;t let the name, \\&quot;volumizing foam\\&quot; fool you.  I bought this product because it sounded like it would tame my curls without the crunchy untouchable feel.  You may as well go to Target and buy a cheap mousse because that&#x27;s what this product feels like.  I would not buy this product again and I highly doubt I will even use it again.  It may be related to my hair type but I imagine that this would be the case regardless of hair type.</li>
            <li> I could not wear my hair curly and go out in public if it were not for this product. After I wash and condition my hair, while still in the shower with dripping wet hair, I apply this to my hair in sections (two side sections and a back section), scrunch, and then put my hair in a tshirt or microfiber towel to dry a bit. After 15 minutes or so, I dry my hair with a diffuser and presto - frizz free, smooth, curly hair with volume.</li>
            <li> This product really &amp;#34;pumps up the volume&amp;#34;!  I really love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a hairstylist who specializes in cutting curly hair. With it, I truly do not need gel, mousse, or hair spray, and I live in humid San Antonio, TX. After conditioning in the shower, flip your hair upside down and put about 3-4 pumps of the product (my length is just past my shoulders) through your hair- (run hands along top of hair instead of putting your fingers through your hair). Once your hair is dried, you will not have that &amp;#34;crunchy look&amp;#34; and your hair will not have the look of too little product. I really did throw out all of the other bottles of product that I own. If you have thin, curly hair like me, I know you own at least a dozen. This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Deva Products .... they remind me of a refreshing springtime!!!! This mousse is my all time favorite, and does wonders for my curls!!!! Great investment for curly people!!!</li>
            <li> Product delivered as advertised and on early! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I put this product in my hair after a shower and let it air dry.  It leaves mg hair with volume and curls!  Best of all, I save time getting ready.</li>
            <li> I love the product. However, it was supposed to arrive on a Tuesday and did not arrive until Thursday.</li>
            <li> I have 3b curly hair, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that will keep the frizz under control. I live in the South and can&#x27;t avoid frizz on those humid summer days, but DevaCurl foam helps keep the frizz to the greatest minimum possible. The foam smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy. I&#x27;ve tried loads of drugstore-brand curly hair products. Deva is expensive but worth the cost for the great results.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell.  I have all the other products from diva curl and they smell great.  I&#x27;m not so sure this is the real product.</li>
            <li> Ok, let me just say this product has literally changed my life. It helped my fall in love with my curly hair. Say goodbye to frizz and hello to beautiful shiny curls. I have very fine hair and have tried lots and lots of products that were always too heavy.This product did not weigh my hair down... absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> Did ALL my Christmas shopping on Amazon with all but 1, mishap....the DevaCurl Foam.  It arrived with 3 or 4 other products (all in their own boxes/packages) in a big box, loosely floating around the bottom with  the cap missing.  Naturally it leaked all over the bottom of the box &amp; onto one of the other packages.  Luckily I was able to save the merchandise that it saturated (being a plastic item in it&#x27;s own box).  A good portion of the foam had been dispensed though.  I called Amazon and they sent a return label (very accomodating as usual), but for a mere $18.00, I decided to just take the hit and keep it myself.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s an oversight on the merchant, or whom ever packaged the product to be delivered - possibly a combo of both!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and this mousse is perfect. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but it really helps define my curls nicely. If you put too much on, it will be sticky and heavier. I found that 3 pumps is perfect for my shoulder length hair. I love the smell too - it&#x27;s a nice lemony/vanilla scent. I use Alterna&#x27;s Caviar CC creme as a base and layer this mousse on top. The two together are a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was ordering, but it works really well. no frizz and my hair isn&#x27;t flat.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use with BeLeave in after shampooing and conditioning.  Nice results.  I have swavy hair type (Natural curl when the right products are used, and slightly wavy when left alone.  I like a little more controll and some curl.  The Deva Curl products seem to deliver those results - after some trial and error on my part.  The website gives you a good recommendation on which products to get for  various  hair types; however, it still is necessary to consider your  particular  hair (thickness/thinness; fine/course; and how much encouragement it needs to  curl).</li>
            <li> nice and light, very clean feel but good volume</li>
            <li> I think this product is great from a curl and volume standpoint.  My stylist turned me on to this after I had just been using the Arc AnGEL.  Completely non-sticky and creates beautiful bouncy curls for me! I don&#x27;t know that I would call it frizz free for me, but I think that is more about my curls, not the product.  My only gripe is that the seal seems to leak between the base of the lid and the pump.  I have contacted the company and they are sending me a new bottle.  Very quick response from them.</li>
            <li> I love this foam, it works for my hair a lot nicer than the &amp;#34;AnGel&amp;#34; light hold styling gel that I also have. That one works, but this one just seems to finish off better for me. Leaves my hair shiny and my curls more free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it smells like Pez candy! Very nice.</li>
            <li> Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has curly hair also and when I asked what she uses this is what she recommended.  I use this combined with Deva Curl Set it free every morning and my curls have never been more awesome!  And if they do get a little wind blown I just add a little more water and it immediately resets.  No more frizzy days</li>
            <li> have only tried this volumizing foam once so far but it left my hair nice and frizz free for 2 days. I love the Deva no-poo shampoo and one condition curly hair conditioner so this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the devacurl products and use them regularly. But I have to give this one a pass. This is the first time using a devacurl product that my hair came out limp, greasy, and heavy with product. So disappointing! I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out. I&#x27;ll stick with the arc anGEL, which has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I quite like the product and have bought it numerous times.  I have a friend and a son who have used it.  We have all experienced bottles that quit functioning before the product runs out.  My most recent bottle quit pumping foam (just leaks the liquid product around the neck) with only 1/3 of the product used.  I will not be spending more money on this product until Deva can improve the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is great for fine hair! Works great on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mousse ever!! It gives me volume on top and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky. Great product</li>
            <li> I use this for my baby girls hair in the summer.  Keeps her curls fresh looking and bouncy.  I&#x27;m the father of a bi-racial child and until I found out the Deva Curl products, I had used everything under the sun but wasn&#x27;t really ever satisfied.  Definitely worth it, I only wish that the price of the products were a little more reasonable.  You can easily spend over $100-$150 to get the various products to use for your hair easily,  and for a 10 year old that is a bit expensive especially I can only imagine what it will cost as she gets older and her hair gets longer...</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked so well on my hair.  I have fine straight hair and this gives it volume and has great holding power even on a very humid day in Florida.  And you would never know it was in your hair, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> This product came faster than expected. I love Deva foam, it keeps my curls in place without making it hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, yes.  Another winner from DevaCurl.  It looks like a liquid but when you shake it, it becomes a foam.  Easy to apply and definitely makes my curly hair behave better (although we all know that curly hair has a mind of its own!)  This is part of my regular routine:  No-Poo, Conditioner, B&#x27;Leave In, Set it Free and this Volumizing Foam.  Then you arrange it, diffuse it, shake it out and go...</li>
            <li> i love this foam! it gives such great volume to my hair. I love scrunching two squirts in after my DevaCurl ArcAngel and B&#x27;Leave in.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this works on my hair, and only a little bit is needed. The company I bought it from has a great price also.</li>
            <li> need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use this with Deva Styling Cream and I LOVE it.  I don&#x27;t get crunchy hair but I also don&#x27;t get frizzy hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My new favorite Deva product!  I use just a little on the bottom third of my hair (shoulder length 3C medium density) and let it air dry.  It&#x27;s lightweight and scrunches out to leave nice, shiny curls.  My hair&#x27;s moisture and curls are prone to changing with the seasons, but this winter - along with a weekly deep conditioning with mayonnaise - co-washing and this foam are all I need.</li>
            <li> This was a great product...until the pump stopped working after the 3rd or 4th use.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, that with ArcAngel Gel and B’leave looked full and healthy, with well defined curls. I’ve been using this foam for a week now and it seems as my curls get worse and worse with each use. My hair looks like a hay that’s been through unsuccessful curl ironing, it feels greasy (and I only put 2 pumps, 1 pump doesn’t eliminate freeze) and I wonder if it’s water soluble as the product states it is. I don&#x27;t think this product is designed for fine hair, maybe for coarser one.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use this as a volume boosting dry shampoo type of product on no-wash days, but it only really works on wet or damp hair. I spray my hair with a little water spritzer, but I find that my hair has to be pretty damp for this to work.. one of my favorite things about not washing daily is not having wet hair or heat styling as often. Otherwise.. I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful foam for styling wavy hair!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist to add fullness to my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  I can&#x27;t see that it helps.</li>
            <li> I like it but it is a bit too sticky. It leaves my hands REALLY sticky and my hair gets much harder than expected. On the plus side, I no longer use hair spray!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> LOve this stuff!!!  My hair always looks great and really brings out the curl.  Can not live without it :)</li>
            <li> Great volume for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product line, but it leaves residue in my hair. I am going to use it spearingly next time. But overall it works !</li>
            <li> I love this volumizing foam for my curls.  I use a lot of the devachan products for my VERY curly hair.  I find that this provides nice hold and is pleasant to put in my hair.  I do think the gel is better for humid, summer days though.</li>
            <li> I have botticelli curls that are thick, but very fine which makes it difficult to find a gel/mousse that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. It was a bit tricky to learn how to use this product, but I really like it now and have had a number a people comment that my hair is much prettier and more healthy. Tip: when you use this product, make sure to keep it away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Came quickly. Very happy with this product. It is wonderful for curly hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is light and makes my curls tighter without any sticky residue. I use this with the no poo and conditioner.  Recommend this product to anyone with curly hair</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for curly frizzy hair!! You don&#x27;t need very much and it makes perfect ringlets!!</li>
            <li> This actually really helps define my curls.  I used to use the moisture lock spray, now I use this, or sometimes both, on top of the Angel curl enhancer.  I would definitely recommend this product. I am still struggling with shine, haven&#x27;t found the right product for that yet, but if I use the NoPoo, the Conditioner, the Angel and this, I get really nicely defined curls.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for thinner wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product, based on the positive reviews here, and on the naturallycurly.com website.  I wanted to get the maximum amount of curl out of my naturally curly hair, and the Ouidad products/cut, were just not achieving that.  My hair is about 3\\&quot; past my shoulders.  I applied 4 to 5 pumps of this foam on damp hair, and scrunched (in accordance with the Deva technique).  Once my hair dried, it looked like a bunch of crunchy ringlets.  I was a little concerned at that point, thinking that I may have used too much of the product.  No worries though.  Once I re-scrunched my curls, they lost that crunchy look.  I now have nice soft curls, that hold throughout the day and into the next.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this foam. It wasn&#x27;t so much foam as it was \\&quot;suds.\\&quot; It had a weak sudsy consistency and no lather at all. So it was hard to spread it throughout my hair. Wherever the foam landed was where it stayed, so I&#x27;d have to pump out more to cover all of my hair. It also smelled like furniture polish, not something I like in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this product doesn&#x27;t reduce frizz. If anything, it creates more frizz. I usually end up layering some store bought mousse on top to tame the frizz. I do like some DevaCurl products, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I usually love Deva products and have been using them for years (No poo, angel, and mister right are my favorites) but this one was a big disappointment.  It doesn&#x27;t really come out foamy at first.  It comes out runny...even when you shake it a lot and then eventually starts to foam.  Waste of product.  But the real problem is that it made my hair feel sticky and then it went straight.  The next day my hair felt thin and dry (and straight).  I&#x27;ve tried it about 10 times now and have had the same result each time.  Wish I could return it but I&#x27;ve had it too long now.</li>
