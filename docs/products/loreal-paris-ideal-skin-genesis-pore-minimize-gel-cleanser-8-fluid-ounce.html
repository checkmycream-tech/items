            <li>smells good strong but good</li>
            <li>it has its effect from the first use !!!!</li>
            <li>BUT, the way it made my face feel was amazing.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this face wash is amazing for it.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i have huge pores but do not wear alot of makeup, so this was a great option.</li>
            <li>This is a great light weight face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing cleanser</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with the outcome of this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried every department store cleanser, and while some of them were pretty good, this one is exceptional for the price!</li>
            <li>It removes my eye makeup very easily</li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The most amazing product for my skin</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to know where to get it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Then it would be easier to prove to myself that I&#x27;m not just engaging in wishful thinking!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with both of these affordable products.  </li>
            <li>I love how calming it is.</li>
            <li>My skin felt better in just one wash.</li>
            <li>And after some days of using I feel radiant and much more confident.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I figured if I am going to use this product, I might as well try everything this line has to offer to get the best results possible.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention it has a great soft rose scent.</li>
            <li>Will surely continue to use/purchase it.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s why I love it:  </li>
            <li>my skin looks better</li>
            <li>one does the magic</li>
            <li>but it sure wasn&#x27;t $30+ and anybody who does is nuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>and I love the touch my face at all time now.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice and really makes my face feel good after washing with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problematic oily skin for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten where I purchased this, and now that I know where I will probably buy some more.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets very oily and this cleanser was great for that.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;i love</li>
            <li>so was very excited to find it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean, and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>- Creates a nice mild foam and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>lets face very clean, while easily removes all makeup and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your skin so soft and refreshed, it&#x27;s also great fro make up removal, and it smells</li>
            <li>Probably not the best face wash if you really need something strong to prevent breakouts, but if you have minor acne it might be good to switch between your harsher wash and something light like this one.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice cleanser and has a natural touch to it.</li>
            <li>It dispenses easily and is sudsy.  </li>
            <li>I did not see in any review where it was mentioned how strong the fragrance was with this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past two years and love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>then a wash with mild soap does more for my skin than this stuff ever will.  </li>
            <li>We used it in a dry climate Colorado and are now using it in a humid climate Georgia and it works great both places : )</li>
            <li>I really would say this is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have been using for a few months with awesome results.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and Loreal is choosing to replace it with YOUTH CODE which already appears to be sub par (amazon reviews) in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, I use it day and night.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has done a great job providing products that actually work and do what they say they will do!</li>
            <li>And Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial creams are a great follow up.</li>
            <li>Somehow it works..leaves skin smooth tho</li>
            <li>We really hope L&#x27;Oreal does not decide to discontinue or replace this amazing product.</li>
            <li>so I still enjoy using</li>
            <li>But the results really are impressive, so if you&#x27;re looking for a pore minimizing facial soap this stuff can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>This has a very light scent, cleans well, can remove eye makeup, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy but rather fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It was EXACTLY what I ordered !!</li>
            <li>This is NOT the original product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the original product anymore.  </li>
            <li>It definately leaves my skin feeling clean with minimized pores.</li>
            <li>This cleanser smells good , but not as magical as other customs said.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;ll be a good way to try to begin a transition out of the Proactive cycle I&#x27;ve been part of for the last 7 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>at this price, for the amount of product you get, and the quality - there&#x27;s really nothing more I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal truely stops making it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a make-up removing cleanser, however it&#x27;s very drying as an overall face wash and isn&#x27;t great at removing eye make up.</li>
            <li>It quickly cleans and removes oil and foundation.  </li>
            <li>the best part was that the product actually did minimize pores that tend to get larger with age.</li>
            <li>It is so mild that it does not cause your eyes to burn while applying around your eyes.</li>
            <li>Smooth, very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>This product is great as it removes eye makeup as well as leaves my face feeling clean without a heavy lotion feel.</li>
            <li>My very sensitive skin looks and feels so much better</li>
            <li>The original, Skin Genesis, worked very well to clean my skin of both makeup and dirt.  </li>
            <li>I had pretty skin!</li>
            <li>Many times they just dry out you&#x27;re skin and make you break out more.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face very smooth but not tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>Only used it for two weeks and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>May be worth a shot though..</li>
            <li>Most sensitive skin cleansers create no lather at all.  </li>
            <li>I have never had oily skin, and I rarely get acne (touchwood).</li>
            <li>The product is worth trying, I tell you that.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin look fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>What made it even better, it was marked 50% off because Loreal discontinued this item...</li>
            <li>That was not was it intended for, but still on the search to find the right cleanser.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my skin and does do cleaning right.</li>
            <li>This smells great, and in just a few days, I really saw a difference!  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and I have had no drying, burning, rashes or itching, which is what I experienced with all the other OTC cleansers, not to mention it actually lathers.</li>
            <li>I started with the wipes (LOVE them for travel, there is nothing more refreshing then wiping down after a long flight for work) and got these when I wanted a more affordable daily use product.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of tightening pores and makes your skin feel a little lifted.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I can tell a difference with my pores yet, but I received my first compliment this weekend.  </li>
            <li>I was getting pretty self-concious so, after reading the reviews of the Skin Genesis line I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It seems safe for twice daily use.</li>
            <li>Pore Minimizing Skin Re-smoother\\&quot; for even more pore-minimizing and overall smoothness!</li>
            <li>It also has the added bonus of removing ALL makeup in one gentle wash!</li>
            <li>Delivered on first use.</li>
            <li>Also the product takes off make up pretty well</li>
            <li>Makes the pores much smaller, skin looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t notice any pore minimizing but it cleans my face well, and the scent is wonderful</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say its as effective as the Genesis Pore Minimizing Cleanser but the label for the new Youth code cleanser has all the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and very large pores.</li>
            <li>When used with a complexion brush, skin is clean and soft, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and soft for even my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle, smells clean (without being too strong), and does minimize pores for a little while.</li>
            <li>It has a VERY mild white musk scent.    </li>
            <li>IMO it&#x27;s just run of the mill and actually too strong for my sensitive-ish skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone who has large pores.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd cleanser I have tried and I can see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Smell is gentle.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Being here in the desert, I assume the heat is playing a real number on my skin.</li>
            <li>my skin always looks tired but ever since I got this its been looking great.</li>
            <li>Very soapy.</li>
            <li>It also had a very drying effect on my face.</li>
            <li>- I love the fragrance, but I&#x27;m partial to musk.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s incredibly gentle but still suds</li>
            <li>Paid twice as much for this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one as what I pay for the &amp;#34;youth code&amp;#34; product that L&#x27;Oreal substituted for the one that really worked.</li>
            <li>Removes all eye makeup gently...</li>
            <li>This products is very gentle on my skin, as I use Obagi and my skin tends to get very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and for lack of other guy postings on this product, I&#x27;d love to share my story.</li>
            <li>Safe for around eye use and breaks down makeup well.</li>
            <li>but the key is that hot or warm water prepping of skin before you use the soaps or brushes or cloths and a nice cold water rinse.  </li>
            <li>Your face feels fresh and clean without feeling too tight or like there is a film on it.  </li>
            <li>But make sure you apply moisturizer afterward, it is a little drying..</li>
            <li>But this just didn&#x27;t get my skin clean or clear enough.</li>
            <li>I just dab on heavy mosturizer and it&#x27;s done. :)</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>I have found that HOT water on a washcloth applied for more that two minutes to open pores and loosen dead skin (I know, ick)</li>
            <li>Ingredients for their new \\&quot;Youth code\\&quot; version....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used their new youth code product</li>
            <li>I order the Youth Code from L&#x27;real and its about the same thing for a lot much cheaper</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and new products often irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I added this cleanser to my night time routine and it made such a difference in the look and feel of my skin from the first use.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>But I have found that the products that do appear to work at pore minimizing in the beginning, aren&#x27;t worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that even though it says for every skin type, it dries my t-zone too much.</li>
            <li>I developed \\&quot;bad\\&quot; skin in my thirties.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to spend additional money on eye makeup remover, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>I am also a very reluctant user of cosmetic items, especially for the face.</li>
            <li>Takes off all makeup and leaves skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Has not dried out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>but it also cleared up my adult acne ( I&#x27;m 52 yrs.</li>
            <li>They appeared more closed then earlier which, of course, gives them that smaller look.</li>
            <li>and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li>i searched for years and finally found something that really works.</li>
            <li>My skin was instantly cleaner, softer, pores were visably smaller and my skin looked so fresh in the morning.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t burn to bad if it gets in the eyes, gets all my makeup off in 1 washing, and it leaves my skin feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it last long, it did make my pores smaller and make my skin feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel and really after a long day.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to people with oily to normal skin for daily use</li>
            <li>Maybe the poorer reviews are because people are angry that their long loved product is gone and are leaving poorer reviews for the new one..?</li>
            <li>however i am using several products at the same time to target large pores.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not powerful enough to get all my waterproof mascara off, it&#x27;s comfortable to use around my eye area as the &#x27;final cleanse&#x27; after I&#x27;ve used the oily mascara remover.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shrink; they simply reflect light differently, I think....which makes them less visible.</li>
            <li>I use this once daily to help keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>It does make it a little dry, so I would advise using a light face cream, like Olay age-defying lotion or something.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh, vibrant and subtle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for dark spots so don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will help with that.</li>
            <li>I will warn you that this soap is prone to producing a LOT of bubbles, and if you&#x27;re not careful they&#x27;ll go up your nose and in your mouth whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>skin feels so much softer , cleaner ,and less pores or pimples&lt;</li>
            <li>I very carefully tried this product and found that my skin tolerated it without the dryness, rash and irritation that accompany new products.</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am 100% in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This product i can no longer find in stores, but I adore the fragrance and the way my skin reacts to the product, lovely and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> smells good strong but good</li>
            <li> it has its effect from the first use !!!!</li>
            <li> BUT, the way it made my face feel was amazing.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this face wash is amazing for it.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i have huge pores but do not wear alot of makeup, so this was a great option.</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight face wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with the outcome of this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried every department store cleanser, and while some of them were pretty good, this one is exceptional for the price!</li>
            <li> It removes my eye makeup very easily</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product for my skin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy to know where to get it at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> Then it would be easier to prove to myself that I&#x27;m not just engaging in wishful thinking!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with both of these affordable products.  </li>
            <li> I love how calming it is.</li>
            <li> My skin felt better in just one wash.</li>
            <li> And after some days of using I feel radiant and much more confident.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I figured if I am going to use this product, I might as well try everything this line has to offer to get the best results possible.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it has a great soft rose scent.</li>
            <li> Will surely continue to use/purchase it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why I love it:  </li>
            <li> my skin looks better</li>
            <li> one does the magic</li>
            <li> but it sure wasn&#x27;t $30+ and anybody who does is nuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> and I love the touch my face at all time now.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and really makes my face feel good after washing with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problematic oily skin for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten where I purchased this, and now that I know where I will probably buy some more.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets very oily and this cleanser was great for that.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i love</li>
            <li> so was very excited to find it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean, and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> - Creates a nice mild foam and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> lets face very clean, while easily removes all makeup and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your skin so soft and refreshed, it&#x27;s also great fro make up removal, and it smells</li>
            <li> Probably not the best face wash if you really need something strong to prevent breakouts, but if you have minor acne it might be good to switch between your harsher wash and something light like this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cleanser and has a natural touch to it.</li>
            <li> It dispenses easily and is sudsy.  </li>
            <li> I did not see in any review where it was mentioned how strong the fragrance was with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past two years and love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> then a wash with mild soap does more for my skin than this stuff ever will.  </li>
            <li> We used it in a dry climate Colorado and are now using it in a humid climate Georgia and it works great both places : )</li>
            <li> I really would say this is very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have been using for a few months with awesome results.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and Loreal is choosing to replace it with YOUTH CODE which already appears to be sub par (amazon reviews) in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has done a great job providing products that actually work and do what they say they will do!</li>
            <li> And Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial creams are a great follow up.</li>
            <li> Somehow it works..leaves skin smooth tho</li>
            <li> We really hope L&#x27;Oreal does not decide to discontinue or replace this amazing product.</li>
            <li> so I still enjoy using</li>
            <li> But the results really are impressive, so if you&#x27;re looking for a pore minimizing facial soap this stuff can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This has a very light scent, cleans well, can remove eye makeup, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy but rather fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It was EXACTLY what I ordered !!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the original product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the original product anymore.  </li>
            <li> It definately leaves my skin feeling clean with minimized pores.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells good , but not as magical as other customs said.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll be a good way to try to begin a transition out of the Proactive cycle I&#x27;ve been part of for the last 7 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> at this price, for the amount of product you get, and the quality - there&#x27;s really nothing more I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal truely stops making it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a make-up removing cleanser, however it&#x27;s very drying as an overall face wash and isn&#x27;t great at removing eye make up.</li>
            <li> It quickly cleans and removes oil and foundation.  </li>
            <li> the best part was that the product actually did minimize pores that tend to get larger with age.</li>
            <li> It is so mild that it does not cause your eyes to burn while applying around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Smooth, very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great as it removes eye makeup as well as leaves my face feeling clean without a heavy lotion feel.</li>
            <li> My very sensitive skin looks and feels so much better</li>
            <li> The original, Skin Genesis, worked very well to clean my skin of both makeup and dirt.  </li>
            <li> I had pretty skin!</li>
            <li> Many times they just dry out you&#x27;re skin and make you break out more.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face very smooth but not tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> Only used it for two weeks and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> May be worth a shot though..</li>
            <li> Most sensitive skin cleansers create no lather at all.  </li>
            <li> I have never had oily skin, and I rarely get acne (touchwood).</li>
            <li> The product is worth trying, I tell you that.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin look fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> What made it even better, it was marked 50% off because Loreal discontinued this item...</li>
            <li> That was not was it intended for, but still on the search to find the right cleanser.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin and does do cleaning right.</li>
            <li> This smells great, and in just a few days, I really saw a difference!  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and I have had no drying, burning, rashes or itching, which is what I experienced with all the other OTC cleansers, not to mention it actually lathers.</li>
            <li> I started with the wipes (LOVE them for travel, there is nothing more refreshing then wiping down after a long flight for work) and got these when I wanted a more affordable daily use product.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of tightening pores and makes your skin feel a little lifted.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I can tell a difference with my pores yet, but I received my first compliment this weekend.  </li>
            <li> I was getting pretty self-concious so, after reading the reviews of the Skin Genesis line I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It seems safe for twice daily use.</li>
            <li> Pore Minimizing Skin Re-smoother\\&quot; for even more pore-minimizing and overall smoothness!</li>
            <li> It also has the added bonus of removing ALL makeup in one gentle wash!</li>
            <li> Delivered on first use.</li>
            <li> Also the product takes off make up pretty well</li>
            <li> Makes the pores much smaller, skin looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t notice any pore minimizing but it cleans my face well, and the scent is wonderful</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say its as effective as the Genesis Pore Minimizing Cleanser but the label for the new Youth code cleanser has all the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and very large pores.</li>
            <li> When used with a complexion brush, skin is clean and soft, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and soft for even my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle, smells clean (without being too strong), and does minimize pores for a little while.</li>
            <li> It has a VERY mild white musk scent.    </li>
            <li> IMO it&#x27;s just run of the mill and actually too strong for my sensitive-ish skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who has large pores.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd cleanser I have tried and I can see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Smell is gentle.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Being here in the desert, I assume the heat is playing a real number on my skin.</li>
            <li> my skin always looks tired but ever since I got this its been looking great.</li>
            <li> Very soapy.</li>
            <li> It also had a very drying effect on my face.</li>
            <li> - I love the fragrance, but I&#x27;m partial to musk.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s incredibly gentle but still suds</li>
            <li> Paid twice as much for this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one as what I pay for the &amp;#34;youth code&amp;#34; product that L&#x27;Oreal substituted for the one that really worked.</li>
            <li> Removes all eye makeup gently...</li>
            <li> This products is very gentle on my skin, as I use Obagi and my skin tends to get very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and for lack of other guy postings on this product, I&#x27;d love to share my story.</li>
            <li> Safe for around eye use and breaks down makeup well.</li>
            <li> but the key is that hot or warm water prepping of skin before you use the soaps or brushes or cloths and a nice cold water rinse.  </li>
            <li> Your face feels fresh and clean without feeling too tight or like there is a film on it.  </li>
            <li> But make sure you apply moisturizer afterward, it is a little drying..</li>
            <li> But this just didn&#x27;t get my skin clean or clear enough.</li>
            <li> I just dab on heavy mosturizer and it&#x27;s done. :)</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> I have found that HOT water on a washcloth applied for more that two minutes to open pores and loosen dead skin (I know, ick)</li>
            <li> Ingredients for their new \\&quot;Youth code\\&quot; version....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used their new youth code product</li>
            <li> I order the Youth Code from L&#x27;real and its about the same thing for a lot much cheaper</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and new products often irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I added this cleanser to my night time routine and it made such a difference in the look and feel of my skin from the first use.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> But I have found that the products that do appear to work at pore minimizing in the beginning, aren&#x27;t worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that even though it says for every skin type, it dries my t-zone too much.</li>
            <li> I developed \\&quot;bad\\&quot; skin in my thirties.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to spend additional money on eye makeup remover, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I am also a very reluctant user of cosmetic items, especially for the face.</li>
            <li> Takes off all makeup and leaves skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Has not dried out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> but it also cleared up my adult acne ( I&#x27;m 52 yrs.</li>
            <li> They appeared more closed then earlier which, of course, gives them that smaller look.</li>
            <li> and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> i searched for years and finally found something that really works.</li>
            <li> My skin was instantly cleaner, softer, pores were visably smaller and my skin looked so fresh in the morning.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t burn to bad if it gets in the eyes, gets all my makeup off in 1 washing, and it leaves my skin feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it last long, it did make my pores smaller and make my skin feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes you feel and really after a long day.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people with oily to normal skin for daily use</li>
            <li> Maybe the poorer reviews are because people are angry that their long loved product is gone and are leaving poorer reviews for the new one..?</li>
            <li> however i am using several products at the same time to target large pores.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not powerful enough to get all my waterproof mascara off, it&#x27;s comfortable to use around my eye area as the &#x27;final cleanse&#x27; after I&#x27;ve used the oily mascara remover.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shrink; they simply reflect light differently, I think....which makes them less visible.</li>
            <li> I use this once daily to help keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> It does make it a little dry, so I would advise using a light face cream, like Olay age-defying lotion or something.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh, vibrant and subtle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for dark spots so don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will help with that.</li>
            <li> I will warn you that this soap is prone to producing a LOT of bubbles, and if you&#x27;re not careful they&#x27;ll go up your nose and in your mouth whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> skin feels so much softer , cleaner ,and less pores or pimples&lt;</li>
            <li> I very carefully tried this product and found that my skin tolerated it without the dryness, rash and irritation that accompany new products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if it minimizes pores because I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> The new product you replaced it with is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day and so far I noticed that I have less pimples than before.</li>
            <li> I was more than a little skeptical that this soap would have any affect on my pores, but after using it for a few weeks I have to admit that it really worked.  </li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like in some other cleansers is too little foam or too much.</li>
            <li> My pores had gotten stretched out and much larger after a few months of using a too-hard facial scrub (the exfoliating beads can actually get into your pores and open them up to infection - who knew?!)</li>
            <li> far as pore minimizing goes, it does help a little.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING and we should let Loreal know we don&#x27;t want it replaced with a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the product, I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time,</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I know will be a staple in my beauty regimen as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am trying to stretch my bottle as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pore minimizing gel for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It only appears as though the ingredients are in a slightly different order indicating that the amount of said ingredients used in the serum differ slightly between the two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive now, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> While it does make my skin dry, it has a regenerating feel to it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and this one doesn&#x27;t make me feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t use to non shower washes, so it does feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li> some oily patches, some dry areas...</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong enough to be labeled \\&quot;envigorating\\&quot; but it is definitely uplifting--a bit of a mood enhancer.  </li>
            <li> They do look less open.</li>
            <li> Luckily it only takes a little bit to wash with.</li>
            <li> spent)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to subject my skin to that because my skin is already dry.</li>
            <li> Now I only have a little bit of pimples on my forehead!</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after washing it, and it didn&#x27;t leave a film like some cleansers.</li>
            <li> , I took a look at the ingredients for the Genesis pore minimizing vs Youth code, both from Loreal, one discontinued and one meant to replace the other..</li>
            <li> All of the other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; cleansers I tried, lathered up, but they compromised my medicated moisturizers, AND then I still had to spend money for eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I didnt see any difference, on the other hand my face did feel alittle softer after a couple of weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cleansing gel for the past 3 days ( as well as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> this stuff does extremely well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Same cleanser I have used for the past 3 years...</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed this product drying out my skin like acouple of other face products.</li>
            <li> I used to just wipe off my make up with a cleansing cloth and rinse with water, towel dry and add a little moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this cleanser and we have been having difficult time trying to find this in department stores.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and sad that it is a discontinued product by L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> it pumps out thick enough so it doesn&#x27;t spill out of your hand before it goes onto your face.  </li>
            <li> old)!!! Needless to say, I went around to all of the Walgreens in my neighborhood and cleared the shelves of this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s never happened even when I used proactive, clinique, or any other scrub/wash/astringent!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, feels softer, and my pores are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have the typical 40&#x27;s skin...</li>
            <li> This stuff somehow makes them less visible.</li>
            <li> I had terrible breakouts spent money on a dermatologist the prescriptions were not as effective as this cleanser.</li>
            <li> The tightness isn&#x27;t bad or uncomfortable though I am not a big make-up wearer, so I don&#x27;t have that scrub-my-face-everyday regimin most people have.</li>
            <li> I have cut back on the other products and have not noticed a change for the worse</li>
            <li> If your skin is use to being scrubbed down everyday, I doubt you&#x27;ll notice a thing.</li>
            <li> But I have been troubled by open pores around my nose and cheeks for the past several years now.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s all subjective, but too little makes me think it&#x27;s not cleaning and</li>
            <li> but i am using other things too so not sure</li>
            <li> Alas, I got suckered into buying the new uber expensive StriVectin line, only to return it after breaking out a day after using it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t contain acne meds or benzoyl peroxide - which are harsh and drying.</li>
            <li> the way, you can get this cleanser on ulta.com for about $6, in case you want to save a few bucks.)</li>
            <li> There are a few things I can put on it that won&#x27;t result in me breaking out or developing an itchy rash.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjuction with my other facial cleansers and I the pores on my face where nonexistent until I had to use an inferior product since I was unable to find it on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin and have for years overscrubbed and medicated to get my skin clean but hate the drying harsh effects of all that.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it minimizes my poors but does burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This works well for me and have been unable to find it in local stores so perhaps it is discontinued...</li>
            <li> not sure what I&#x27;ll do without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a year.</li>
            <li> too much is just annoying-</li>
            <li> Does this mean there aren&#x27;t any problems with it?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> What is wrong with you Loreal?</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but I swear I am already seeing a differance in my pores on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> was afraid to review...</li>
            <li> so mad that they decided to discontinue it, and</li>
            <li> I have, over a life time, tried all kinds of expensive products (like proactive which is horrible) to no avail.</li>
            <li> now all these re-seller&#x27;s are asking for $10-$30, which is crazy!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This products is very gentle on my skin, as I use Obagi and my skin tends to get very sensitive. I used this on the days when I am off Obagi regimen. It is also very effective to remove eye make up.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time, maybe only a couple of weeks. It leaves my skin feeling clean, and the smell is nice. The only thing is that even though it says for every skin type, it dries my t-zone too much. I just dab on heavy mosturizer and it&#x27;s done. :)</li>
            <li> I started with the wipes (LOVE them for travel, there is nothing more refreshing then wiping down after a long flight for work) and got these when I wanted a more affordable daily use product. have been using for a few months with awesome results.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a make-up removing cleanser, however it&#x27;s very drying as an overall face wash and isn&#x27;t great at removing eye make up.</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Suds. Smell is gentle. Doesn&#x27;t contain acne meds or benzoyl peroxide - which are harsh and drying. Safe for around eye use and breaks down makeup well.</li>
            <li> This product is great as it removes eye makeup as well as leaves my face feeling clean without a heavy lotion feel. I  heard that this product is being discontinued so decided to order multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and Loreal is choosing to replace it with YOUTH CODE which already appears to be sub par (amazon reviews) in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with a Clarisonic and my pores were literally invisible afterwards. I was thrilled. This product is AMAZING and we should let Loreal know we don&#x27;t want it replaced with a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff if you can find it.....that&#x27;s what I plan on doing. Lets let them know they&#x27;re making a mistake and send them our thoughts on this discontinuation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/28/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took a look at the ingredients for the Genesis pore minimizing vs Youth code, both from Loreal, one discontinued and one meant to replace the other..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ingredients for their new \\&quot;Youth code\\&quot; version.... Aqua/water, Peg-8, Lauryl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate,P-Anisic acid, Caprylolyl Salicylic Acid,Citric acid, Decyl Glucoside, Hexylene Glycol, Menthol, Peg-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Benzonate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Edta, Parfum/Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Skin Genesis ingredients......Aqua/water, Peg-8, Lauryl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Cholride, Peg-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, p-Anicic acid, Citric Acid, Decyl Glucoside&#x27; Tetrasodium Edta, Sodium Benzonate, Menthol, Carpyloyl Salicytic Acid, Parfum/Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall it looks like the same ingredients were used in the Youth code foaming gel cleanser as well as the Skin genesis pore minimizing cleanser. It only appears as though the ingredients are in a slightly different order indicating that the amount of said ingredients used in the serum differ slightly between the two. Hope this helps out. I haven&#x27;t used their new youth code product so I can&#x27;t say its as effective as the Genesis Pore Minimizing Cleanser but the label for the new Youth code cleanser has all the same ingredients. Maybe the poorer reviews are because people are angry that their long loved product is gone and are leaving poorer reviews for the new one..? May be worth a shot though..</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture.  Then it would be easier to prove to myself that I&#x27;m not just engaging in wishful thinking!  My skin is smoother, feels softer, and my pores are much less noticeable. The scent is not strong enough to be labeled \\&quot;envigorating\\&quot; but it is definitely uplifting--a bit of a mood enhancer.  About six weeks ago I began using the L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizer Gel Cleanser and Olay Regenerist UV Defense SPF 15.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with both of these affordable products.  [[ASIN:B000092OX4 Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion with UV protection. Packaging May Vary,  -2.5 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I use. It works well in removing my make-up, especially my eye make-up. It&#x27;s the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. I hope they never discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am gonna stick to this product as my facial wash every night and every morning. Also, my mom loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;Helps smooth skin, lessen pores, and smells great!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, I use it day and night. While it does make my skin dry, it has a regenerating feel to it. I would recommend this to people with oily to normal skin for daily use</li>
            <li> I was more than a little skeptical that this soap would have any affect on my pores, but after using it for a few weeks I have to admit that it really worked.  My pores had gotten stretched out and much larger after a few months of using a too-hard facial scrub (the exfoliating beads can actually get into your pores and open them up to infection - who knew?!), so I was looking for a product to help me deal with those issues without allowing my face to run amuck.  This stuff did the trick, and my pores are noticibly smaller.  I will warn you that this soap is prone to producing a LOT of bubbles, and if you&#x27;re not careful they&#x27;ll go up your nose and in your mouth whenever possible.  But the results really are impressive, so if you&#x27;re looking for a pore minimizing facial soap this stuff can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I only washed my face once with this stuff, so I don&#x27;t know if it works or not yet. BUT, the way it made my face feel was amazing. I love how calming it is.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells good , but not as magical as other customs said. My pore hasn&#x27;t minimize , maybe I should use it for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I just received this cleanser and I love it!! I have very oily skin and very large pores. I have tried every department store cleanser, and while some of them were pretty good, this one is exceptional for the price! L&#x27;Oreal has done a great job providing products that actually work and do what they say they will do! This is what I will be using from now on!</li>
            <li> I developed \\&quot;bad\\&quot; skin in my thirties.  I have been using this (in conjunction with medicated moisturizer) for about 4 months.  This is the 3rd cleanser I have tried and I can see a huge difference.  My eye makeup just slides off.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  My face feels clean and I have had no drying, burning, rashes or itching, which is what I experienced with all the other OTC cleansers, not to mention it actually lathers. Most sensitive skin cleansers create no lather at all.  There&#x27;s something about good suds.  All of the other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; cleansers I tried, lathered up, but they compromised my medicated moisturizers, AND then I still had to spend money for eye makeup remover.  I can&#x27;t say that I can tell a difference with my pores yet, but I received my first compliment this weekend.  I haven&#x27;t been complimented on my skin in YEARS.  If you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to spend additional money on eye makeup remover, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent! lets face very clean, while easily removes all makeup and does not irritate the skin. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I am thirty plus. I am also a very reluctant user of cosmetic items, especially for the face. I have never had oily skin, and I rarely get acne (touchwood). But I have been troubled by open pores around my nose and cheeks for the past several years now. Facials have not helped, scrubs have left me wanting, cleansers have been of no avail. I saw this product, and thought, \\&quot;Whatever... its only a couple bucks, lemme give it a try\\&quot;. And aha! Found the perfect one! My skin felt better in just one wash. It was smoother and the pores were visibly reduced. And after some days of using I feel radiant and much more confident. It does make it a little dry, so I would advise using a light face cream, like Olay age-defying lotion or something. The product is worth trying, I tell you that. And I am not a L&#x27;Oreal sales rep!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the Proactive system, so I haven&#x27;t used a cleanser in years. This stuff is great though - it&#x27;s very gentle, smells clean (without being too strong), and does minimize pores for a little while. I think it&#x27;ll be a good way to try to begin a transition out of the Proactive cycle I&#x27;ve been part of for the last 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at this price, for the amount of product you get, and the quality - there&#x27;s really nothing more I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By the way, you can get this cleanser on ulta.com for about $6, in case you want to save a few bucks.)</li>
            <li> Loved it. It does a good job of tightening pores and makes your skin feel a little lifted. But make sure you apply moisturizer afterward, it is a little drying..</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this face wash is amazing for it. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after washing it, and it didn&#x27;t leave a film like some cleansers.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It dispenses easily and is sudsy.  It quickly cleans and removes oil and foundation.  L&#x27;Oreal has a winner in this product.  The price is great too so I buy one for the shower and one for the sink.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i have huge pores but do not wear alot of makeup, so this was a great option. I didnt see any difference, on the other hand my face did feel alittle softer after a couple of weeks of using it. That was not was it intended for, but still on the search to find the right cleanser.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  I use it on my combination skin and my husband uses it on his acne prone oily skin.  It works great for both of us!  We used it in a dry climate Colorado and are now using it in a humid climate Georgia and it works great both places : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cleansing gel for the past 3 days ( as well as [[ASIN:B001TKE47A Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizng 1 Oz]].)  Call me crazy, but I swear I am already seeing a differance in my pores on my cheeks. They do look less open. I never had any problems with the size of my pores until recently. Being here in the desert, I assume the heat is playing a real number on my skin. I was getting pretty self-concious so, after reading the reviews of the Skin Genesis line I had to give it a try. I also plan on purchasing the eye cream, sun screen, and night cream. I figured if I am going to use this product, I might as well try everything this line has to offer to get the best results possible.</li>
            <li> This smells great, and in just a few days, I really saw a difference!  I will be buying this again....was afraid to review...just incase they want to raise the price on it...LOL.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about pore minimizing or not but it makes my skin look fresh and glowing. my skin always looks tired but ever since I got this its been looking great. love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.  Stores stopped carrying it but I&#x27;m happy to know where to get it at such a great price.  Takes off all makeup and leaves skin feeling so soft.  Perfect cleanser.</li>
            <li> I loved this product....i wish L&#x27;Oreal had not discontinued it....it worked wonders on the skin....yhe product was gentle yet thorough at removing eye makeup and without harsh scrubbing.....the best part was that the product actually did minimize pores that tend to get larger with age.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it minimizes my poors but does burn my eyes.  Very soapy. I&#x27;ve added water to it to reduce suds.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth every cent. I added this cleanser to my night time routine and it made such a difference in the look and feel of my skin from the first use. I used to just wipe off my make up with a cleansing cloth and rinse with water, towel dry and add a little moisturizer. But this just didn&#x27;t get my skin clean or clear enough. So I added this gel cleanser as an extra step and wow! My skin was instantly cleaner, softer, pores were visably smaller and my skin looked so fresh in the morning. Not to mention it has a great soft rose scent. Hoping to continue to find this product through Amazon in the future. Will surely continue to use/purchase it.</li>
            <li> I did not see in any review where it was mentioned how strong the fragrance was with this product. It also had a very drying effect on my face. I can&#x27;t tell you if it minimizes pores because I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell. If you are sensitive to fragrance, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I know will be a staple in my beauty regimen as long as they keep making it. I&#x27;ve been using it for at least a year. Here&#x27;s why I love it:  - The best feature is that it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes! Although it&#x27;s not powerful enough to get all my waterproof mascara off, it&#x27;s comfortable to use around my eye area as the &#x27;final cleanse&#x27; after I&#x27;ve used the oily mascara remover.  - Creates a nice mild foam and washes off easily. One thing I don&#x27;t like in some other cleansers is too little foam or too much. I know it&#x27;s all subjective, but too little makes me think it&#x27;s not cleaning and too much is just annoying- gets in your hairline, your eyes, nose, etc.  - The gel consistency is perfect- it pumps out thick enough so it doesn&#x27;t spill out of your hand before it goes onto your face.  - Leaves your face with slightly smaller pores without the delayed oil explosion. Your face feels fresh and clean without feeling too tight or like there is a film on it.  - I love the fragrance, but I&#x27;m partial to musk. It has a VERY mild white musk scent.    BTW, here&#x27;s background on my skin: I have combination skin(t-zone pattern of oiliness) and it&#x27;s not sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am 100% in love with this product! I have normal to oily skin and I get blackheads around my nose and (on occasion) bigger blemishes on cheeks, forehead, chin, etc...HOWEVER, after using this product in the shower in the mornings and before I go to bed I didn&#x27;t need to cover up anything with makeup! I had pretty skin! That&#x27;s never happened even when I used proactive, clinique, or any other scrub/wash/astringent! My advise is if you have oily-normal skin get this product! It&#x27;s smells great and works wonders!</li>
            <li> smells good strong but good my skin looks better but i am using other things too so not sure witch one does the magic</li>
            <li> I love this product but its too expensive.. I order the Youth Code from L&#x27;real and its about the same thing for a lot much cheaper</li>
            <li> This works well for me and have been unable to find it in local stores so perhaps it is discontinued...I do not know.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and new products often irritate my skin. I very carefully tried this product and found that my skin tolerated it without the dryness, rash and irritation that accompany new products. It seems safe for twice daily use. It does seem to reduce the look of enlarged pores, but it does not make them invisible. I will continue to use this and if my pores disappear, I will let you know!</li>
            <li> Great product and it is inexpensive.  Does not irritate my skin and does do cleaning right. Will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin and have for years overscrubbed and medicated to get my skin clean but hate the drying harsh effects of all that.  Been using this for about a week and it&#x27;s incredibly gentle but still suds so I feel it&#x27;s cleaning.  Doesn&#x27;t strip my skin.  Minimizes pores (not a miracle but definite difference).  Leaves my face very smooth but not tight feeling.  Looking forward to trying \\&quot;Skin Genesis: Pore Minimizing Skin Re-smoother\\&quot; for even more pore-minimizing and overall smoothness!</li>
            <li> I can only find this product online. It&#x27;s so good. It removes my eye makeup very easily and I have been using it for 4 years. I have dry skin and this one doesn&#x27;t make me feel dry after using it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight face wash. It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t burn to bad if it gets in the eyes, gets all my makeup off in 1 washing, and it leaves my skin feeling very clean and soft!</li>
            <li> The best clenser ever!</li>
            <li> I bought it here because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the regular department stores anymore.  It works to make my pores smaller and skin healthier all around. It doesn&#x27;t do much for dark spots so don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will help with that. It&#x27;s safe and soft for even my sensitive skin.  It also has the added bonus of removing ALL makeup in one gentle wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1-1/2 yrs. now and am very happy with the results. It suds up well so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. It definately leaves my skin feeling clean with minimized pores. Has not dried out my skin at all. I use it instead of soap in conjunction with a daily moisturizer. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I noticed that my pores were enlarging. I used this product and within four weeks not only my pores seemed to shrink but it also cleared up my adult acne ( I&#x27;m 52 yrs. old)!!! Needless to say, I went around to all of the Walgreens in my neighborhood and cleared the shelves of this product. What made it even better, it was marked 50% off because Loreal discontinued this item...What a shame!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember what I paid for this but it sure wasn&#x27;t $30+ and anybody who does is nuts. IMO it&#x27;s just run of the mill and actually too strong for my sensitive-ish skin HOWEVER....I have found that HOT water on a washcloth applied for more that two minutes to open pores and loosen dead skin (I know, ick) then a wash with mild soap does more for my skin than this stuff ever will.  I have the Clairisonic Facial brush (and THAT is money well spent).....now I use a bit of vegetable glycerin mixed with the same amount of DR. BRONNER&#x27;S PEPPERMINT liquid soap and I&#x27;m telling you THAT will snap your pores shut....but the key is that hot or warm water prepping of skin before you use the soaps or brushes or cloths and a nice cold water rinse.  And Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial creams are a great follow up.</li>
            <li> Somehow it works..leaves skin smooth tho</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they all made a believer out of me. Today, I received my bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Ideal Skin Genesis Pore Minimiize Gel Cleanser and here&#x27;s what you should know. It&#x27;s amazing. After one, yes I said ONE, wash my face seemed to glow. The smell is fresh, vibrant and subtle. It could just be my imaginiation, but after two hours I took a peek at my nose pores and was astonished. They appeared more closed then earlier which, of course, gives them that smaller look. I&#x27;m in love. Does this mean there aren&#x27;t any problems with it? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve only used it once; however, I do know that my face feels tighter and smoother. The tightness isn&#x27;t bad or uncomfortable though I am not a big make-up wearer, so I don&#x27;t have that scrub-my-face-everyday regimin most people have. My face isn&#x27;t use to non shower washes, so it does feel a bit dry. Again, that could just be me. If your skin is use to being scrubbed down everyday, I doubt you&#x27;ll notice a thing. Great product. Affordable price. Delivered on first use. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I really would say this is very good for sensitive skin. It is so mild that it does not cause your eyes to burn while applying around your eyes.This is a very nice cleanser and has a natural touch to it. Makes you feel and really after a long day.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; should have tipped me off. This is NOT the original product.  Can&#x27;t find the original product anymore.  Paid twice as much for this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one as what I pay for the &amp;#34;youth code&amp;#34; product that L&#x27;Oreal substituted for the one that really worked.</li>
            <li> Smooth, very gentle on skin. Feels good and smells good. Probably not the best face wash if you really need something strong to prevent breakouts, but if you have minor acne it might be good to switch between your harsher wash and something light like this one.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever bought!!! Removes all eye makeup gently... I love it! Give it a try, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere anymore so was very excited to find it thru Amazon. This has a very light scent, cleans well, can remove eye makeup, and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy but rather fresh and clean.  I have the typical 40&#x27;s skin...some oily patches, some dry areas...this stuff does extremely well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this once daily to help keep my face clear. and for lack of other guy postings on this product, I&#x27;d love to share my story. It works wonders. Yes I&#x27;m a guy! I use the Olay spin brush to clean my skin real good then apply a smal amount of this pore minimizer to my face immediately after. I have never seen my face clearer!</li>
            <li> It was EXACTLY what I ordered !! Same cleanser I have used for the past 3 years... Definitely minimizes pores as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month now and so far it has worked well. I use it once a day and so far I noticed that I have less pimples than before. Also my pores look a bit smaller, that&#x27;s probably the cause of my decreasing acne. Now I only have a little bit of pimples on my forehead! Also the product takes off make up pretty well and I haven&#x27;t noticed this product drying out my skin like acouple of other face products.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this cleanser and we have been having difficult time trying to find this in department stores. We really hope L&#x27;Oreal does not decide to discontinue or replace this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have enlarged pores on my forehead &amp; cheeks. This stuff somehow makes them less visible. They don&#x27;t shrink; they simply reflect light differently, I think....which makes them less visible. I&#x27;m also using a skin lightening cream &amp; the combination is a definite plus in my book. I wish the formulation had Vitamin C in it but even without it, I&#x27;d buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> [...]    Ive been using this product for over 6 months and I&#x27;m finally running out. Besides the fact that it last long, it did make my pores smaller and make my skin feel clean.  Im so mad that they decided to discontinue it, and now all these re-seller&#x27;s are asking for $10-$30, which is crazy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with the outcome of this product. My very sensitive skin looks and feels so much better and I love the touch my face at all time now.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and sad that it is a discontinued product by L&#x27;Oreal.  Smells so nice and really makes my face feel good after washing with it.  I am trying to stretch my bottle as long as I can.  Luckily it only takes a little bit to wash with.</li>
            <li> Makes the pores much smaller, skin looks a lot better.  I would recommend this to everyone who has large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problematic oily skin for most of my life. There are a few things I can put on it that won&#x27;t result in me breaking out or developing an itchy rash. This product is one of them. Not only does this not make my skin react, it actually improves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was a skeptic. I have, over a life time, tried all kinds of expensive products (like proactive which is horrible) to no avail. I read all the good reviews and thought I&#x27;d this stuff a give it a try. Now mind you, at the time this was 1/2 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a week ago I tried to buy this face wash at Ulta only to have the sales lady say they were discontinuing it. Alas, I got suckered into buying the new uber expensive StriVectin line, only to return it after breaking out a day after using it. So I came back to e-bay to buy this stuff. It&#x27;s more expensive now, but a little goes a long way. I had 1 bottle for 6 months and I wash my face 3-4 times a day with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pore minimizing goes, it does help a little. But I have found that the products that do appear to work at pore minimizing in the beginning, aren&#x27;t worth it in the long run. Many times they just dry out you&#x27;re skin and make you break out more. This stuff leaves your skin so soft and refreshed, it&#x27;s also great fro make up removal, and it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do without it L&#x27;Oreal truely stops making it. I say we start a petition! ~</li>
            <li> I have definately seen a difference in pore size however i am using several products at the same time to target large pores. I have cut back on the other products and have not noticed a change for the worse so we shall see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pore minimizing gel for quite a long time. When used with a complexion brush, skin is clean and soft, not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I compared the ingredients of this product with L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code pore minimizing and found they were almost identical. The newer Youth Code has the addition of lye (sodium hydroxide). I&#x27;m not going to subject my skin to that because my skin is already dry. Perhaps younger women with oily skin would prefer the Youth Code.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten where I purchased this, and now that I know where I will probably buy some more.  Good.</li>
            <li> They changed the name to Youth Code and changed the formula.  The original, Skin Genesis, worked very well to clean my skin of both makeup and dirt.  My skin gets very oily and this cleanser was great for that.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good and gets off stubborn eye makeup flawlessly. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t notice any pore minimizing but it cleans my face well, and the scent is wonderful so I still enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I use baby oil to get my eye make up off, but with this I don&#x27;t need to. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This product i can no longer find in stores, but I adore the fragrance and the way my skin reacts to the product, lovely and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works great along with my power scrubber.</li>
            <li> waw ,,, this product is great it has its effect from the first use !!!!&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels so much softer , cleaner ,and less pores or pimples&lt;br /&gt;i love L oreal ,,,,&lt;br /&gt;buy it without hesitation</li>
            <li> The most amazing product for my skin</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser I don&#x27;t understand why it was discontinued. I had terrible breakouts spent money on a dermatologist the prescriptions were not as effective as this cleanser. Only used it for two weeks and the results are amazing. I wish loreal could bring it back!</li>
            <li> What is wrong with you Loreal? I have been using this product for the past two years and love love love it!!! I am over 55 and nothing, even the more expensive products in Macy&#x27;s and Norstroms do not hold a candle to this product. I use it in conjuction with my other facial cleansers and I the pores on my face where nonexistent until I had to use an inferior product since I was unable to find it on the shelves. I am buying this in bulk from Amazon so I will have it when it completly dissapears off amazon. Shame on you for taking a great product off the market. The new product you replaced it with is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> this actually cleard my face from acne, blackheads and blemishes. i searched for years and finally found something that really works.</li>
