            <li>I find that the patches work much better and give better relief.</li>
            <li>Love this oil synergy</li>
            <li>so it spreads more, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I bought a roller ball top dispenser to use with it</li>
            <li>I love this oil blend.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a more potent blend than the one I made myself, but it is not.</li>
            <li>He love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Between the wonderful smell and the warming feeling in combination it really helps to calm your pain.</li>
            <li>so I was able to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything and seen many doctors for my pain.</li>
            <li>Love love love this oil one of my favorites</li>
            <li>AWESOME essential oil!!!!</li>
            <li>but it sure helps.</li>
            <li>I will be trying more of these oils and will buy this one again.</li>
            <li>This oil takes the edge off almost immediately and has a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and really helps.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and smells good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m up right now catching up with work that I missed out on while I was laid up today.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>and my neck was pain free.</li>
            <li>You will smell like a pack of wintergreen gum for awhile, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant enough for what it is.</li>
            <li>The smell is distinct and strong but not unbearable - what you would expect for a muscle aid.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell - prefer to have something natural than all the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves the massages using this oil, and it helps tremendously with muscle soreness and cramps.</li>
            <li>He has a spinal fusion and has received tremendous relief from this product.</li>
            <li>This is some awesome stuff - I am on my 3rd order by now and can only recommend this.</li>
            <li>The feeling is good on the skin, and these seem to have the genuine essential oil in them which was my main concern.</li>
            <li>The strong scent may be much for some, and for that I&#x27;d recommend diluting it a bit.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered several different Plant Therapy essential oils and feel they are great products for a fair price.</li>
            <li>it would really be nice if both this and Pain Aid  were in bigger bottles</li>
            <li>I will stick with my own essential oil blending.</li>
            <li>Helps right away with muscle aches and headaches.  </li>
            <li>Was very impressed with this company I ordered several other essential oils - including the Thieves and Cinnamin oil  :)</li>
            <li>I really like this blend, and I use it frequently on my shoulders, which is where I hold most of my tension.</li>
            <li>I actually use this as a part of a scalp treatment because all of these ingredients are stimulating for the skin and therefore can be useful as a hair treatment (be sure to wash well or you&#x27;ll smell of camphor though.)</li>
            <li>He is hard to impress so it must be great.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another brand next time like Do Terra even though it costs more.</li>
            <li>Really really like this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on my husband&#x27;s sore muscles and he says he feels better the next day when he wakes up.</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>May I add my blend is non staining and while it smells potent it tones down quickly so apply after shower first thing and the application after is worth it</li>
            <li>In about 15 minutes the pain is either completely gone or diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I was sceptical, but woke up one morning with intense pain in my shoulder blade and all of left index finger.  </li>
            <li>I actually ordered the Self-Esteem oil and would appreciate that a change be made very quickly</li>
            <li>And, with the surgery, there is a large percentage something will go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this to be such an AMAZING addition to my supplement regime and overall health.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for muscles aches and soreness.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing on the muscles</li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my neck and knees and this really helps with the pain.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it helps my shoulder and neck.</li>
            <li>If you use it for about a week you may really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>(scent wise) if you suffer chronic pain you understand what I mean.</li>
            <li>If you are using these oils you expect a strong astringent and camphorous scent, not a soft perfume.</li>
            <li>And have been using this with pain aid several times a day since I received it last week at love the results</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all Plant Therapy oils.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for everyone to have it at home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cost effective as well, since I only use less than 10 drops each application</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this oil.</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>The only thing is it comes out of the bottle too fast, so I use it up to fast</li>
            <li>Very cheap price compared to other similar brands and not lacking in quality.</li>
            <li>Mix with a little coconut oil and it goes on easily and helps with the sore muscles that come to us from time to time.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from lower back and neck pain for many years and have had little relief.  </li>
            <li>you can see his veins popping up and showing clearly.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 7 year old daughter who is a competitive gymnast.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve not had any skin sensitivity but do test this oil in diluted form before using all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smell when I have a migraine</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m surprised the smell didn&#x27;t bother me, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>When he woke up this morning (typically he is even more stiff after sleeping whether or not he gets a massage), he had absolutely no knots in his shoulders, his back was more relaxed and the pain there</li>
            <li>I generally use Young Living oils, but gave this a try in place of their Panaway.  </li>
            <li>and the product did not seem to give any sensations to my skin or muscels but the fragrance relaxed my muscles and let me calm down and relax.</li>

            <li> Basically, he will be needing surgery soon considering he hardly has any free movement due to the knots.</li>
            <li> My hubby was having shoulder pain, I rubbed it in, and he was surprised that about 30 minutes later, it was feeling looser and less pain.</li>
            <li> both and little while later the pain was completely gone and never returned.</li>
            <li> I only use this at home due to the smell</li>
            <li> Does not burn the skin such as Bengay and other topicals do, and it is not creasy or stains your clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to get a little stiff but nothing like it normally is by this time of day.</li>
            <li> Today my neck it still loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that I almost got Botox in the muscle like many people do for migraine relief.  </li>

            <li> It does have some fragrance - but it is not as fierce as [again] Bengay or similar topicals, and it tends to evaporate or you cannot smell it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it after chopping wood, gardening and all other chores.</li>
            <li> Oh one other thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;After searching for something to work to at least ease his pain, this works above and beyond.</li>
            <li> Less money to spend then.</li>
            <li> My migraine let up within a half hour.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a little bit of coconut oil</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this blend, and I use it frequently on my shoulders, which is where I hold most of my tension.</li>
            <li> I was looking for these ingredients for a body rub, and found this product which combines them in one for me! Yay! Less money to spend then. The quality is good. The smell is pleasant enough for what it is. If you are using these oils you expect a strong astringent and camphorous scent, not a soft perfume. The feeling is good on the skin, and these seem to have the genuine essential oil in them which was my main concern. Great for making a body oil or scalp oil for massage. The strong scent may be much for some, and for that I&#x27;d recommend diluting it a bit. I actually use this as a part of a scalp treatment because all of these ingredients are stimulating for the skin and therefore can be useful as a hair treatment (be sure to wash well or you&#x27;ll smell of camphor though.)</li>
            <li> I like the Muscle Aid Synergy Essential Oil Blend, it minty frangrance, soothing achy muscle pain relief formula and instant relief.</li>
            <li> My husband has terrible back pain related to back surgery and injury, and I used this oil in a salve. It really works. Its not going to replace painkillers on the really painful days, but it does remove some of the pain without needing medication.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I have suffered from lower back and neck pain for many years and have had little relief.  This oil takes the edge off almost immediately and has a nice clean smell.  It&#x27;s very cost effective as well, since I only use less than 10 drops each application</li>
            <li> Mix with a little coconut oil and it goes on easily and helps with the sore muscles that come to us from time to time. Recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I add this to my bath water and I also add a drop to coconut oil and use it on what ever is hurting at the time. I can&#x27;t say that it has healed my sore muscles but I do feel a benefit from it and will buy it when I use it up. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using it after chopping wood, gardening and all other chores. Works like a charm. Put it on at bedtime and in the morning no more aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Great smelling. I have only used it once. I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Ok, I was sceptical, but woke up one morning with intense pain in my shoulder blade and all of left index finger.  So painful, had to try to relieve it, so tried the muscle-aid synergy oil on both and little while later the pain was completely gone and never returned. I am recommending this to all my friends and family now.</li>
            <li> This is a superior quality oil. I love it. I combine it with Plant Therapy peppermint oil for instant relief from aching, sore, muscles. I highly recommend all Plant Therapy oils. I&#x27;ve used this oil for aches and pains for almost two years now. My husband even likes me to put the oils on him.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a mildew smell in the bottle. I was going to use it for Teitze pain and muscle pain so I used it anyway. It works but doesn&#x27;t smell that good.  I will be buying another brand next time like Do Terra even though it costs more.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!  This is a great product for use in pain management.  Will buy again and again :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the claims this works on pain.  It really does.  I won&#x27;t be without it.  I keep one with me to use.  I dilute it with some carrier oil and slater it on the affected areas.  In about 15 minutes the pain is either completely gone or diminished significantly.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself because I have a lot of muscle aches. So far I love it. I use a lot of essential oils and this added to my collection.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  Doesn&#x27;t really do much for muscles aches and soreness.  I find that the patches work much better and give better relief.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dieing husband and it worked good it relaxed him and the smell brought comfort. I used it on myself to see what it was like and the product did not seem to give any sensations to my skin or muscels but the fragrance relaxed my muscles and let me calm down and relax. If that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered the Self-Esteem oil and would appreciate that a change be made very quickly and I am just about out!!! Love this oil synergy blend!&lt;br /&gt; thank you in Advance and it has yet to arrive.looking forward to our next business transactions!&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
            <li> Helps right away with muscle aches and headaches.  I can&#x27;t quite tell the difference between this oil and the Pain-Aid one.  They both seem to work the same on me.</li>
            <li> Great product! My neck has been miserable the past few weeks and this combined with the pain oil blend has been my go to remedy!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but wonderful smell to add to muscle rub i am making with Vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and works for muscle aches and headaches. Very cheap price compared to other similar brands and not lacking in quality.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a little bit of coconut oil so it spreads more, and it works like a charm. My hubby was having shoulder pain, I rubbed it in, and he was surprised that about 30 minutes later, it was feeling looser and less pain. I bought a roller ball top dispenser to use with it so I could apply it easier.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this oil. I mix it into my Arnica oil with Plant Therapy pain aid and occasionally their stress relief blend and my chronic myofascial pain, arthritis, bursitis, tendonitis and headaches are instantly relieved. It lasts on me for about three hours so I have a glass travel bottle with rollerball I made just for this. People ask what I am using for it is quite exhilarating. I find this to be such an AMAZING addition to my supplement regime and overall health. I use tiger balm but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it like this. May I add my blend is non staining and while it smells potent it tones down quickly so apply after shower first thing and the application after is worth it (scent wise) if you suffer chronic pain you understand what I mean. None of those nasty over the counter products work and contain aspirin amongst other chemicals. Just test for allergies behind your ear or on your forearm. This is a I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> this one is great for aches and pains.  it helps me a lot.  rub it on my feet and back of neck and get relief.  i am happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Eureka - actually works.  Nice smell - prefer to have something natural than all the chemicals.  The product was packaged well.  Was very impressed with this company I ordered several other essential oils - including the Thieves and Cinnamin oil  :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my 7 year old daughter who is a competitive gymnast.  Sometimes I put a few drops in her bath and others I mix with a carrier oil for a massage.  The smell is distinct and strong but not unbearable - what you would expect for a muscle aid.  My daughter loves the massages using this oil, and it helps tremendously with muscle soreness and cramps.</li>
            <li> made my own version of the cold/hot creams we all see in the store. it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Really really like this product!  Very soothing on the muscles</li>
            <li> My daughter is using it now as she prepares for college volleyball as preseason is awakening muscles at a strenuous pace. She feels relief with this.</li>
            <li> I dlute this and use it in a rollerball on my husband&#x27;s neck. He has a spinal fusion and has received tremendous relief from this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil ! I mix it with pain aid and almond oil and massage it on my husband&#x27;s back, he has degenerative disk disease, and this relieves his pain for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this oil blend. I have arthritis in my neck and knees and this really helps with the pain. I&#x27;ve ordered several different Plant Therapy essential oils and feel they are great products for a fair price. Service is great and I received my order within a few days.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it helps my shoulder and neck. The only thing is it comes out of the bottle too fast, so I use it up to fast (I am a massage therapist).Maybe if I it put in a good oil / lotion and then use it that way would extend it use.Oh one other thing it would really be nice if both this and Pain Aid  were in bigger bottles</li>
            <li> I ordered the Pain-Aid and Muscle-Aid synergies for my boyfriend who has horrible back and shoulder pain. He has been living with it for a few years; the knots in his shoulders and back give him a really terrible headache where it&#x27;s to the point you can see his veins popping up and showing clearly. Basically, he will be needing surgery soon considering he hardly has any free movement due to the knots. And, with the surgery, there is a large percentage something will go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Pain-Aid to massage his shoulders and neck and the Muscle-Aid for his back last night. We also have some \\&quot;Eden&#x27;s Garden\\&quot; Peppermint oil I ordered a while back which i used on his temples. When he woke up this morning (typically he is even more stiff after sleeping whether or not he gets a massage), he had absolutely no knots in his shoulders, his back was more relaxed and the pain there almost gone, and his headache was lessen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching for something to work to at least ease his pain, this works above and beyond. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue to order more. :)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a more potent blend than the one I made myself, but it is not. I will stick with my own essential oil blending. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This Muscle Aid essential oil blend has wintergreen, camphor and pine. I find it numbs the pain in my back. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my husband&#x27;s sore muscles and he says he feels better the next day when he wakes up. If you use it for about a week you may really notice a difference. The reason I know it works is because I applied it to my lower back and couldn&#x27;t reach my upper back which was also sore. Within about half an hour I felt half of my back feel numb and half was in pain. So this worked where I put it. If you can have someone else massage this into your back. I dilute it in massage oil - about 16 drops essential oil to one tablespoon massage oil. So far I&#x27;ve not had any skin sensitivity but do test this oil in diluted form before using all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed. My son gets a lot of growing pains still. He love this stuff. Also I&#x27;ve been rubbing it on my husband back. He has a few back problems. He also loves it. He is hard to impress so it must be great.</li>
            <li> If you have used drug store muscle rubs you won&#x27;t be shocked by the smell but its not pleasant.  I only use this at home due to the smell but today I got a horrible migraine.  When I get a migraine the back of my neck tenses up. It&#x27;s so bad that I almost got Botox in the muscle like many people do for migraine relief.  Today I used this rub.  I am sensitive to smell when I have a migraine so I&#x27;m surprised the smell didn&#x27;t bother me, but it didn&#x27;t.  My migraine let up within a half hour. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My nausea and all symptoms are 3 out of 10 instead of 8 of 10 which it was before.  I&#x27;m up right now catching up with work that I missed out on while I was laid up today.  I&#x27;ve had this for a while but never used for migraine muscle tension and spasms.  It worked!  So happy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and nice to add to Jojoba or another carrier oil for massaging sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I suffer from daily pain. I love this stuff. It smells good and really helps.  Once you rub it on your body where you are experiencing pain it warms up your skin. Between the wonderful smell and the warming feeling in combination it really helps to calm your pain. I have ordered 5 bottles to date.  I will continue to purchase.  I don&#x27;t let it run out. I highly recommend this product.  You will not be disappointed.  If your like me you&#x27;ll do anything for pain relief. If you need pain relief then get yours today.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Helps with muscle pain and smells great. I highly recommend it for everyone to have it at home.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and in good condition.  It has a very strong scent and a little goes a long way.  I use it for bath teas and salts that I make for gifts.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my knees so I was able to sleep.  However, the smell does not go with the lavender I use to help me sleep.</li>
            <li> My Husband uses this for his knees (he has joint soreness) it works well when used daily.  My son has also been using this for his foot (he twisted it playing basketball).  Great oil to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I have horrible migraines and neck pain. I have tried everything and seen many doctors for my pain. I tried this last night mixed with grape seed oil massaged into my neck and shoulders and it worked wonders. Within minutes my neck started loosening up. Thirty minutes later and my neck was pain free. It was amazing! Today my neck it still loose. I&#x27;m starting to get a little stiff but nothing like it normally is by this time of day. My neck pain is a daily struggle for me. I&#x27;m going to go home at lunch and rub some more on my neck, that&#x27;s how great this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little warning. You will smell like a pack of wintergreen gum for awhile, but it is worth it! This is amazing stuff...Amazing!</li>
            <li> Love love love this oil one of my favorites</li>
            <li> This is some awesome stuff - I am on my 3rd order by now and can only recommend this. Works for muscle pain and also for joint pain too. Does not burn the skin such as Bengay and other topicals do, and it is not creasy or stains your clothing. It does have some fragrance - but it is not as fierce as [again] Bengay or similar topicals, and it tends to evaporate or you cannot smell it after a few minutes. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> AWESOME essential oil!!!! My husband loves this with warming arnica oil for his back!!! It&#x27;s given him amazing relief so that he can sleep!!! Also been awesome for my daughter&#x27;s shoulder!!!</li>
            <li> And have been using this with pain aid several times a day since I received it last week at love the results</li>
            <li> why does the smell oif this remind me of sweaty arm pits the smell is absolutly rancid i dont know what they did to this but its almost unbearable</li>
            <li> I haven used this on my neck and my son&#x27;s neck, as well as my husband&#x27;s knee. I consider my self to be a believing skeptic, to all things health related. That being said, I often wonder about the mind over matter issue when it comes to ailments. But, we have all found relief from our aching muscles, in using this oil. It&#x27;s not a permanent solution but it sure helps.</li>
            <li> I generally use Young Living oils, but gave this a try in place of their Panaway.  I really like it!  I mixed it with a carrier oil (almond oil) and apply at night to sore muscles.  Very soothing and smells good.  I will be trying more of these oils and will buy this one again.</li>
