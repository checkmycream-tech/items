    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>my face feels smoother feels great!!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Has helped my skin incredibly.</li>
            <li>This cream is not the best but for the money it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Great cream, good price!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t explain how happy I am with this item.</li>
            <li>But besides that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It has some good ingredients like zinc oxyde-skin healer, protector and sunscreen (so you can use it day and night, by the way the day cream does not have zinc oxyde in it, so I do not recommend it), pearl powder-exfoliates, evens the skin tone, lanolin-best skin moisturizer and protector.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and it makes your skin look and feel amazing</li>
            <li>Was so thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li>Honestly use this stuff every night ,along with virgin cocoanut oil, and I have since I was a kid</li>
            <li>Oily, goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love this concha nacar every mornin after a put it on my face</li>
            <li>Love spending time out surfing and still no signs of wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to have a glow. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, do more research.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing effect as well as the scent.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d give them to my 15-year old daughter with absolutely beautiful skin because she is taking acne medication</li>
            <li>Would recommend to all who enjoy taking care of self.  </li>
            <li>but so far seem like a nice cream.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone, any age.!!  </li>
            <li>This cream is very thick and rick, my face feels like silk when I put it on..very happy with it :)</li>
            <li>it just sits on top of the skin and makes my lines and wrinkles more noticable because my face has a shine on it due to the cream.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the results of soft clean skin.  </li>
            <li>I like everything about it except the fragrance, which I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>This is very oily.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>was delivered on time and package properly enough but after trying it out once you quickly see you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I should not have relied on the high reviews of this and the day cream products.  </li>
            <li>The texture, color and results are pretty different that the ones that I used some time ago, and it lets my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>It is hard to beat this simple but effective ingredients for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It is really thick which would be fine</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it offers an overall improvement to my skin</li>

            <li> I certainly can&#x27;t use this or the day cream, they are horrible for anyone over 40!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this Night cream and the Day cream (1 and 2) and was disappointed with both.  </li>

            <li> Oily, goes on very smoothly. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it offers an overall improvement to my skin but so far seem like a nice cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  They used to sell it at Walgreens but discontinued selling it there.  Was so thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> This cream is not the best but for the money it is a good buy. It has some good ingredients like zinc oxyde-skin healer, protector and sunscreen (so you can use it day and night, by the way the day cream does not have zinc oxyde in it, so I do not recommend it), pearl powder-exfoliates, evens the skin tone, lanolin-best skin moisturizer and protector. It is hard to beat this simple but effective ingredients for such an affordable price. Do not use it if you have oily skin or tendency for acne.</li>
            <li> I love this concha nacar every mornin after a put it on my face I feel renewed.. my face feels smoother feels great!! I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the results of soft clean skin.  Would recommend to all who enjoy taking care of self.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product! Can&#x27;t explain how happy I am with this item. Has helped my skin incredibly. Wouldn&#x27;t use any other night cream.</li>
            <li> I like everything about it except the fragrance, which I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Over 30 and this night cream does the trick.  Love spending time out surfing and still no signs of wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> Honestly use this stuff every night ,along with virgin cocoanut oil, and I have since I was a kid and it makes your skin look and feel amazing</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it does in the picture. But besides that it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not an over night thing, you have to be applying daily. But I do notice a difference in my skin. My skin seems to have a glow. :)</li>
            <li> It is not the same cream that I used before. The texture, color and results are pretty different that the ones that I used some time ago, and it lets my skin greasy. I thought through the days the results will be differents, but not.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and rick, my face feels like silk when I put it on..very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> Great cream, good price!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money.  This is very oily.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered on time and package properly enough but after trying it out once you quickly see you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this Night cream and the Day cream (1 and 2) and was disappointed with both.  It is really thick which would be fine but it is so thick it doesn&#x27;t seem to sink in and make your skin softer looking - it just sits on top of the skin and makes my lines and wrinkles more noticable because my face has a shine on it due to the cream.  I certainly can&#x27;t use this or the day cream, they are horrible for anyone over 40!!  So I thought I&#x27;d give them to my 15-year old daughter with absolutely beautiful skin because she is taking acne medication and it has caused her face to be a bit dry.  She put it on one night and after awhile it started burning so she removed it at once and by next morning she had red splotches everywhere that look like the cream burned her skin.  What is in this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, do more research.  I should not have relied on the high reviews of this and the day cream products.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone, any age.!!  Run!!!!  Find something else!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I love the moisturizing effect as well as the scent.  I have been using this cream for three years and I will continue to use it.</li>
