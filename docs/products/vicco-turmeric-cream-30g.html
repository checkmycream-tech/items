            <li>I have used this product for over a month and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it leaves a matte feel/look on my skin, and I love that it contains Turmeric (a wonderful ingredient with many amazing benefits).</li>
            <li>For reference, my skin tone is extremely fair with moles and freckles, and I burn very easily.    </li>
            <li>I have fair complexion and one dermatologist burned my skin with a very strong peeling.</li>
            <li>turmeric is over 40 times more effective at inhibiting melanin than arbutin!</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>Anyway,I love the results!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also, people have been walking up to me, telling me how amazing my skinlooks and asking me what I use</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I heard so many good things about it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews liked what I read and ordered 2 tubes.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my face, and it has reduced the size of the pores on my nose nicely.  </li>
            <li>On my chest, I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage, and it is fading nicely with use of the product.  </li>
            <li>Her Best Friend is a Very Well Respected Ayervedic Esthetician.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day after each wash, and it&#x27;s lightened the scars, minimized my oily t zone and pores, and has gives my skin a really nice glow.  </li>
            <li>Prevents pimples and made my skin more fair than it was before.</li>
            <li>I like this way better than Fair &amp; Lovely Ayurvedic regardless of the smell.</li>
            <li>My daughter has also found that it makes a good oil-inhibiting primer under makeup, although she also would like to be able to get the unscented version more reliably.  </li>
            <li>Very strong.  </li>
            <li>For sure I will not use this lotion anymore, even though I liked the smell of it and its lightweight feel.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT VERY FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>I will give it month to see if my scars have shown more improvement.</li>
            <li>TOP RATED SELLER THANK</li>
            <li>but I LOVE how well it handles any pimple</li>
            <li>And did I mention it is dirt cheap--$ 1.00!</li>
            <li>Love this Product and its working for me</li>
            <li>But there were too many</li>
            <li>Love  the smell.</li>
            <li>Since many posts were not explicit about what Vicco Turmeric Skin Cream could do for brown women, I wanted to take a chance and see how it might work for me.    </li>
            <li>The cream has parabens, but I love it anyway.    </li>
            <li>Love this cream have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>My fault, should have read more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>(its also called \\&quot;Turmeric\\&quot; not Tormeric.\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li>NOT AT ALL, it smells FANTASTIC and is so creamy and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>ALSO , this seems to be a 50 Gram tube, I read in the reviews some confusion :)</li>
            <li>but after one night of wearing this I am able to ignore the scent.</li>
            <li>but it is a good moisturizer, however the risk of the ingredients isnt worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love this cream.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s oil based.</li>
            <li>that it may or many not clog your pores.</li>
            <li>I usually love sandalwood but not in combination with the sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>will keep using for sure</li>
            <li>very clean and almost floral.  </li>
            <li>Works great for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I strongly dislike the fragrance they have added into this product.</li>
            <li>It has a strong fragrance of turmeric and sandalwood which I like.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has acne scares or just want clearer skin...</li>
            <li>They seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>so the smell is fine to me.  </li>
            <li>all, this was a huge chore.</li>
            <li>I used it for about a month and like the fact that it&#x27;s non-greasy and goes on smoothly.     </li>
            <li>It is an ayurvedic cream and does not make your skin oily!!!This is so important to me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy Ayurvedic products</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T USE VICCO IF U GREW UP DRINKING HORMONE FILLED PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>but again it would be nice to have a scent free since I would think the smell isn&#x27;t really needed for the performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard so many good reviews on this product on different boards.</li>
            <li>My skin has significantly improved since I began using this product a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Over the last few days, my best friend, who sees me regularly, told me my skin was glowing and couldn&#x27;t beleive how flawless and beautiful it looked when I woke up after a LONG night of partying.  </li>
            <li>Skin around red areas becomes calm and even-right away, so this is great after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I leave it on 10 mins and then clean off with a cotton pad soaked in toner.</li>
            <li>i personally find it to be a pleasant scent-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, very pleased for such a cheap product.</li>
            <li>So I thought that the Vicco lotion must also be nice and a natural product.</li>
            <li>I since found that sandalwood oil is actually supposed to be good for your skin and for acne.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li>The smell was a bit strong when I first started using the cream</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Okay I STILL love this product since I wrote this review back in June of 2012.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more and will hopefully get rid of the rest of my scarring :)</li>
            <li>It was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>it really works!!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite purchases on here by far!</li>
            <li>The item was shipped to my house really quick which surprised me because most sellers take longer to have products delivered.</li>
            <li>Turneric is such a wonderful to skin, like any natural ingredient, I don&#x27;t see magical results right away, but use it for acne  and pigmentation for long term.</li>
            <li>but I really, really wish they would make it scent free.  </li>
            <li>My skin is latte--very light colored, and I am very prone to hyperpigmentation and moles and freckles</li>
            <li>Harmful ingredients like this get absorbed by the skin and enter the bloodstream.     </li>
            <li>To be honest, though, the #1 reason I continue to buy it 20 years later is the sandalwood fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It cost me about $7, but it was so worth it.  </li>
            <li>this cream has a strong-ish scent (which i am ok with, but if you are sensitive to smell, be forewarned).  </li>
            <li>a nice cream, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>smells funny (not bad), but i didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it also smells good (Sandalwood), but the smell dissipates after a little bit and it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Pores do shrink right away.</li>
            <li>You can tell it acts as an astringent and shrinks it right up.  </li>
            <li>The active ingredient in turmeric root is bright skin staining yellow.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Its EXTREMELY POWERFUL yet VERY gentle for ALL SKIN TYPES &amp; CONDITIONS.</li>
            <li>Its a sweet smell that has way too much fragrance in it.  </li>
            <li>I did not find that it prevented blemishes at all, but it seemed to have a pretty obvious astringent effect, closing up my pores pretty effectively.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair but even the slightest pimple leaves a blemish behind that takes weeks to disappear.  </li>
            <li>During my pregnancy I had severe acne that left even more severe scarring.</li>
            <li>but again it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>It really just glows, brightens and fades!</li>
            <li>and I now finally see a more even skin tone</li>
            <li>Not a giant difference in cost, this one costs slightly more, just warning others.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night of use.  </li>
            <li>First let me say the positive, after just one application overnight</li>
            <li>It instantly calms Your Skin down &amp; Tones it beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like at first was the strong scent it has</li>
            <li>On top of that, it helps to heal minor skin infections.  </li>
            <li>On the box it doesn&#x27;t say anything about lightening dark spots or discolorations of any kind, yet before I purchase it , from the description or the reviews I believe it did state</li>
            <li>i applies a blob of this overnight and by morning, the bump was almost gone, and easily covered by basic makeup.    </li>
            <li>the cream itself absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see it at first though this is the 50 mg version which is not what I expected, so just be sure to read the weight/ volume as this cream comes in all kinds of sizes.</li>
            <li>There were certain numbers scratched off the tube as well as the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried garnier pure pen for my acne, which speeds up the acne life cycle to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>didnt do as much as i would of liked but it helped a little with the swelling</li>
            <li>It works very well for scars.</li>
            <li>Really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li>also have some spotting on my cheek bones which I wish I could make disappear but this hasn&#x27;t really helped</li>
            <li>I will keep using the cream on occasion despite the smell since it fades fast</li>
            <li>I wear it as a perfume as much as anything.  </li>
            <li>Jokes apart, it can be very embarassing.    </li>
            <li>I do really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it really improved the glow of my skin as well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish that this hadn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how much this works.</li>
            <li>It heals blemishes, stops new ones from forming, is non-greasy and absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of other reviews and the price seemed ok.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to find something that addressed hyperpigmentation, particularly for highly melanted skin.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results on my skin, but why buy anything else from them when they are sending me a product someone else already used half of what was supposed to be in the bottle.</li>
            <li>With my hyperpigmentation there is no change however, the more even tone around these areas does have the slight effect of making skin appear smoother.   </li>
            <li>I have VERY Sensitive &amp; NOT2mention VERY Oily Skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the company knew before they shipped this mess out.btw</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I highly recommend this for Black/Brown people with hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I pray that it will continue to work and the spots with completely disappear!!</li>
            <li>But THIS Cream FAR surpasses them ALL!!  </li>
            <li>This product is natural and really works.</li>
            <li>but since starting on birth control pills those have pretty much vanished</li>
            <li>I have tried using just a tiny tiny bit and its still strong.</li>
            <li>My skin was more vibrant almost instantly, and the severe scars began fading within the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have placed a new order for it again.  </li>
            <li>It definitely made a huge improvement to my hyperpigmentation and my pores are much smaller and refined.</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>After using the cream for about 4 days now, I can actually see the entire patch has dramatically lightened to the point where I can distinctly see the scars that I was originally trying to reduce (and they are also fading quickly) which were hidden under the larger patch of darkened, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this to lighten dark spots on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll get rid of the dry patches altogether, but I am very pleased with the improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have a friend who has lots of freckles and is starting to get large age spots, and I&#x27;ve recommended this to her.</li>
            <li>my lucky self when I ordered it, got the one that someone sent back and used half of it up first.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and combo/ oily skin ( but also sensitive), and I was afraid the turmeric would tinge me a yellow color...</li>
            <li>I used this in the hope of getting my skin clear of the persistent acne that I&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s never been so clear.</li>
            <li>, I noticed a considerable difference in my skin.     </li>
            <li>I wonder why they use a chemical preservative, since they could just use Vitamin C and E as a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft as a babies tush</li>
            <li>Vicco drys up the existing acne without leaving a scar...and it seems to have lighten the old scars on my cheeks and jar line.</li>
            <li>I like this cream because it leaved my face soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>No side effects, my ultra sensitive skin likes it, and no burning when I put it on.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the product is that it contains parabens.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a different sandalwood/turmeric cream which I much prefer.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been using it for a week now</li>
            <li>I surprisingly like the weird smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has any other good qualities as mention on the box because its so hard to get past the strong overbearing smell of flowers.</li>
            <li>MY tube was Half full, bottom line, USED</li>
            <li>The other had a fresh scent of sandalwood and nothing else.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to really help with minor psoriosis even after applying 2-3 times a day for two weeks.</li>
            <li>It really has shrunk the dry patches on my knees over 50% within one week of use!  </li>
            <li>The scars around my temples are fading as well as evening my skintone in general.  </li>
            <li>I had numerous steam facials and products to clear the acne.</li>
            <li>Remains to be seen if ut lightens a sark spot I have on the tip of my nose since using only 1 week so far.</li>
            <li>NEVER EXPECTED IT TO B</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely dumbfounded &amp; shocked in THE MOST POSITIVE WAY POSSIBLE!!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems to boast, just now starting to pay attention as I am getting into my 30s.  </li>
            <li>I bought the item based on the positive reviews, but when it arrived, the box had been previously opened.</li>
            <li>I am not the one to go through the trouble, especially without having transportation right now, to pack this up and send it back.</li>
            <li>I had a dark patch of scars and aggravated skin (from scrubbing and concealing) on my left cheek that made me very  self-conscious.  </li>
            <li>and I can already see an improvement in my skin, and as a African American with dark brown skin I am very prone to acne scares</li>

            <li> I also like the way it leaves a matte feel/look on my skin, and I love that it contains Turmeric (a wonderful ingredient with many amazing benefits).</li>
            <li> For reference, my skin tone is extremely fair with moles and freckles, and I burn very easily.    </li>
            <li> I have fair complexion and one dermatologist burned my skin with a very strong peeling.</li>
            <li> turmeric is over 40 times more effective at inhibiting melanin than arbutin!</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>

            <li> Also, people have been walking up to me, telling me how amazing my skinlooks and asking me what I use</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I heard so many good things about it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews liked what I read and ordered 2 tubes.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my face, and it has reduced the size of the pores on my nose nicely.  </li>
            <li> On my chest, I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage, and it is fading nicely with use of the product.  </li>
            <li> Her Best Friend is a Very Well Respected Ayervedic Esthetician.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day after each wash, and it&#x27;s lightened the scars, minimized my oily t zone and pores, and has gives my skin a really nice glow.  </li>
            <li> Prevents pimples and made my skin more fair than it was before.</li>
            <li> I like this way better than Fair &amp; Lovely Ayurvedic regardless of the smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter has also found that it makes a good oil-inhibiting primer under makeup, although she also would like to be able to get the unscented version more reliably.  </li>
            <li> Very strong.  </li>
            <li> For sure I will not use this lotion anymore, even though I liked the smell of it and its lightweight feel.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT VERY FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I will give it month to see if my scars have shown more improvement.</li>
            <li> TOP RATED SELLER THANK</li>
            <li> but I LOVE how well it handles any pimple</li>
            <li> And did I mention it is dirt cheap--$ 1.00!</li>
            <li> Love this Product and its working for me</li>
            <li> But there were too many</li>
            <li> Love  the smell.</li>
            <li> Since many posts were not explicit about what Vicco Turmeric Skin Cream could do for brown women, I wanted to take a chance and see how it might work for me.    </li>
            <li> The cream has parabens, but I love it anyway.    </li>
            <li> Love this cream have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My fault, should have read more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> (its also called \\&quot;Turmeric\\&quot; not Tormeric.\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li> NOT AT ALL, it smells FANTASTIC and is so creamy and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> ALSO , this seems to be a 50 Gram tube, I read in the reviews some confusion :)</li>
            <li> but after one night of wearing this I am able to ignore the scent.</li>
            <li> but it is a good moisturizer, however the risk of the ingredients isnt worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s oil based.</li>
            <li> that it may or many not clog your pores.</li>
            <li> I usually love sandalwood but not in combination with the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> will keep using for sure</li>
            <li> very clean and almost floral.  </li>
            <li> Works great for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike the fragrance they have added into this product.</li>
            <li> It has a strong fragrance of turmeric and sandalwood which I like.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has acne scares or just want clearer skin...</li>
            <li> They seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> so the smell is fine to me.  </li>
            <li> all, this was a huge chore.</li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and like the fact that it&#x27;s non-greasy and goes on smoothly.     </li>
            <li> It is an ayurvedic cream and does not make your skin oily!!!This is so important to me.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy Ayurvedic products</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T USE VICCO IF U GREW UP DRINKING HORMONE FILLED PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> but again it would be nice to have a scent free since I would think the smell isn&#x27;t really needed for the performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reviews on this product on different boards.</li>
            <li> My skin has significantly improved since I began using this product a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Over the last few days, my best friend, who sees me regularly, told me my skin was glowing and couldn&#x27;t beleive how flawless and beautiful it looked when I woke up after a LONG night of partying.  </li>
            <li> Skin around red areas becomes calm and even-right away, so this is great after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I leave it on 10 mins and then clean off with a cotton pad soaked in toner.</li>
            <li> i personally find it to be a pleasant scent-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, very pleased for such a cheap product.</li>
            <li> So I thought that the Vicco lotion must also be nice and a natural product.</li>
            <li> I since found that sandalwood oil is actually supposed to be good for your skin and for acne.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit strong when I first started using the cream</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Okay I STILL love this product since I wrote this review back in June of 2012.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more and will hopefully get rid of the rest of my scarring :)</li>
            <li> It was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> it really works!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite purchases on here by far!</li>
            <li> The item was shipped to my house really quick which surprised me because most sellers take longer to have products delivered.</li>
            <li> Turneric is such a wonderful to skin, like any natural ingredient, I don&#x27;t see magical results right away, but use it for acne  and pigmentation for long term.</li>
            <li> but I really, really wish they would make it scent free.  </li>
            <li> My skin is latte--very light colored, and I am very prone to hyperpigmentation and moles and freckles</li>
            <li> Harmful ingredients like this get absorbed by the skin and enter the bloodstream.     </li>
            <li> To be honest, though, the #1 reason I continue to buy it 20 years later is the sandalwood fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It cost me about $7, but it was so worth it.  </li>
            <li> this cream has a strong-ish scent (which i am ok with, but if you are sensitive to smell, be forewarned).  </li>
            <li> a nice cream, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> smells funny (not bad), but i didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it also smells good (Sandalwood), but the smell dissipates after a little bit and it isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Pores do shrink right away.</li>
            <li> You can tell it acts as an astringent and shrinks it right up.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in turmeric root is bright skin staining yellow.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Its EXTREMELY POWERFUL yet VERY gentle for ALL SKIN TYPES &amp; CONDITIONS.</li>
            <li> Its a sweet smell that has way too much fragrance in it.  </li>
            <li> I did not find that it prevented blemishes at all, but it seemed to have a pretty obvious astringent effect, closing up my pores pretty effectively.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair but even the slightest pimple leaves a blemish behind that takes weeks to disappear.  </li>
            <li> During my pregnancy I had severe acne that left even more severe scarring.</li>
            <li> but again it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> It really just glows, brightens and fades!</li>
            <li> and I now finally see a more even skin tone</li>
            <li> Not a giant difference in cost, this one costs slightly more, just warning others.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night of use.  </li>
            <li> First let me say the positive, after just one application overnight</li>
            <li> It instantly calms Your Skin down &amp; Tones it beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like at first was the strong scent it has</li>
            <li> On top of that, it helps to heal minor skin infections.  </li>
            <li> On the box it doesn&#x27;t say anything about lightening dark spots or discolorations of any kind, yet before I purchase it , from the description or the reviews I believe it did state</li>
            <li> i applies a blob of this overnight and by morning, the bump was almost gone, and easily covered by basic makeup.    </li>
            <li> the cream itself absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see it at first though this is the 50 mg version which is not what I expected, so just be sure to read the weight/ volume as this cream comes in all kinds of sizes.</li>
            <li> There were certain numbers scratched off the tube as well as the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried garnier pure pen for my acne, which speeds up the acne life cycle to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> didnt do as much as i would of liked but it helped a little with the swelling</li>
            <li> It works very well for scars.</li>
            <li> Really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li> also have some spotting on my cheek bones which I wish I could make disappear but this hasn&#x27;t really helped</li>
            <li> I will keep using the cream on occasion despite the smell since it fades fast</li>
            <li> I wear it as a perfume as much as anything.  </li>
            <li> Jokes apart, it can be very embarassing.    </li>
            <li> I do really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it really improved the glow of my skin as well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish that this hadn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how much this works.</li>
            <li> It heals blemishes, stops new ones from forming, is non-greasy and absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of other reviews and the price seemed ok.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find something that addressed hyperpigmentation, particularly for highly melanted skin.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results on my skin, but why buy anything else from them when they are sending me a product someone else already used half of what was supposed to be in the bottle.</li>
            <li> With my hyperpigmentation there is no change however, the more even tone around these areas does have the slight effect of making skin appear smoother.   </li>
            <li> I have VERY Sensitive &amp; NOT2mention VERY Oily Skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the company knew before they shipped this mess out.btw</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I highly recommend this for Black/Brown people with hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I pray that it will continue to work and the spots with completely disappear!!</li>
            <li> But THIS Cream FAR surpasses them ALL!!  </li>
            <li> This product is natural and really works.</li>
            <li> but since starting on birth control pills those have pretty much vanished</li>
            <li> I have tried using just a tiny tiny bit and its still strong.</li>
            <li> My skin was more vibrant almost instantly, and the severe scars began fading within the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have placed a new order for it again.  </li>
            <li> It definitely made a huge improvement to my hyperpigmentation and my pores are much smaller and refined.</li>
            <li> AND IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> After using the cream for about 4 days now, I can actually see the entire patch has dramatically lightened to the point where I can distinctly see the scars that I was originally trying to reduce (and they are also fading quickly) which were hidden under the larger patch of darkened, irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this to lighten dark spots on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll get rid of the dry patches altogether, but I am very pleased with the improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have a friend who has lots of freckles and is starting to get large age spots, and I&#x27;ve recommended this to her.</li>
            <li> my lucky self when I ordered it, got the one that someone sent back and used half of it up first.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and combo/ oily skin ( but also sensitive), and I was afraid the turmeric would tinge me a yellow color...</li>
            <li> I used this in the hope of getting my skin clear of the persistent acne that I&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s never been so clear.</li>
            <li> , I noticed a considerable difference in my skin.     </li>
            <li> I wonder why they use a chemical preservative, since they could just use Vitamin C and E as a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft as a babies tush</li>
            <li> Vicco drys up the existing acne without leaving a scar...and it seems to have lighten the old scars on my cheeks and jar line.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because it leaved my face soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> No side effects, my ultra sensitive skin likes it, and no burning when I put it on.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the product is that it contains parabens.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a different sandalwood/turmeric cream which I much prefer.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been using it for a week now</li>
            <li> I surprisingly like the weird smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has any other good qualities as mention on the box because its so hard to get past the strong overbearing smell of flowers.</li>
            <li> MY tube was Half full, bottom line, USED</li>
            <li> The other had a fresh scent of sandalwood and nothing else.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really help with minor psoriosis even after applying 2-3 times a day for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It really has shrunk the dry patches on my knees over 50% within one week of use!  </li>
            <li> The scars around my temples are fading as well as evening my skintone in general.  </li>
            <li> I had numerous steam facials and products to clear the acne.</li>
            <li> Remains to be seen if ut lightens a sark spot I have on the tip of my nose since using only 1 week so far.</li>
            <li> NEVER EXPECTED IT TO B</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely dumbfounded &amp; shocked in THE MOST POSITIVE WAY POSSIBLE!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems to boast, just now starting to pay attention as I am getting into my 30s.  </li>
            <li> I bought the item based on the positive reviews, but when it arrived, the box had been previously opened.</li>
            <li> I am not the one to go through the trouble, especially without having transportation right now, to pack this up and send it back.</li>
            <li> I had a dark patch of scars and aggravated skin (from scrubbing and concealing) on my left cheek that made me very  self-conscious.  </li>
            <li> and I can already see an improvement in my skin, and as a African American with dark brown skin I am very prone to acne scares</li>
            <li> If you have a weak moment and actually squeeze a spot (I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to, but everyone does), put some of this on and it helps to heal it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can tolerate strong smells even if it stinks, especially if its natural.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it works as I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to find out.</li>
            <li> I used this just a handful of times and noticed that it completely obliterated all of those little tiny bumps that have been on my neck for ages.  </li>
            <li> My face seemed to get less oily on days when I used it, so I developed a habit of using it as a primer under my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with such things as minor blemishes, rashes, minor sunburns, etc.</li>
            <li> Even though it can be used to clear up acne, it actually gave me more acne because it clogged my pores :(</li>
            <li> This is a herbal remedy I completely trust for my acne problem, and have used for the past ten years.</li>
            <li> A few days after as I stopped using it, the bumps started to clear up and eventually all went away.</li>
            <li> it works but takes really long</li>
            <li> I really hate that this happened because the product seems so good for oily, acne-prone skin like</li>
            <li> I want to preface this by saying I am a mocha skinned Black woman (Nigerian and African American) with an oily t-zone and a genetic pre-disposition to hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> The remaining dry patches are quite yellow from the turmeric, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Add to the fact that if I touch my face with dusty hands, I get huge pimples that never turn into whiteheads until they are a little lava mountain on the face.</li>
            <li> I had great results after having a terrible boil on my face that left a scar.  </li>
            <li> My skin was getting painfully dry.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned and dealt with dark spots from adult acne.  </li>
            <li> and this is the ONLY thing I have found that has worked in such a small amount of time.</li>
            <li> and I had tiny little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> Ive been using for a few days and already I can see a BIG difference in the clarity and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I use to use benzoyl peroxide which would bleach my towels and clothes if I wasn&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> Vicco turmeric actually cures the infected area, and dries it without messy breakage.</li>
            <li> This saved me on my wedding day when a dried dust pimple left a bump on my face-</li>
            <li> When I forgot to use the cream for a few days, the patches didn&#x27;t reduce in size for those days, which tells me it&#x27;s the cream actually working, not some placebo effect.    </li>
            <li> tries vicco...</li>
            <li> I pair the rose hip seed oil with the cream (being dark, the cream makes my skin looks whitish without it and actually gets a little shinier with out the seed oil as a base) in the morning and night.  </li>
            <li> Also benzoyl peroxide was pretty expensive because the 10% version was too drying</li>
            <li> Got multiple cysts on my cheeks and little small pimples all over my forehead and temples..</li>
            <li> I hope it will help me get rid of my dark marks as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with dark marks, as some stated it did for them</li>
            <li> It should be bit solid or bit thick.</li>
            <li> In fact, the redness and swelling start going down within an hour.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s COMPANY is #1 HANDS DOWN,</li>
            <li> Also, I am writing this during the Chicago winter wherein my skintone becomes obviously uneven and pallid due to the lack of sunlight.     </li>
            <li> I have never had a company send me a half used product.</li>
            <li> Obviously, it must have been returned by someone, and they failed to check the contents of the tube, just left it in the box, and</li>
            <li> MY TUBE WAS USED AND MISSING HALF OF WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THERE?</li>
            <li> Just sort of earthy but also a little cosmetic.    </li>
            <li> However, I am finally seeing a result-slight though, not remarkable as others have said.   </li>
            <li> and sometimes it peels a little after,</li>
            <li> May be it is due to packing not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to THE EXTREME in THE PAST.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little over a week, I had to stop using this because my pores were noticeably clogged</li>
            <li> The floral on this product is so heavy that it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also impatient and didn&#x27;t use it for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not make your face uneven or discolored.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan either and question whether to apply it anywhere under or on my nose.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t hardly wear any other fragrance once you have some of this stuff on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my husband absolutely despises the smell and literally gets mad if I put it on before bed.  </li>
            <li> I got rid of pimples using african black soap, but was left with bad scars.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream hoping it might help me vanish some melasma spots on forehead and cheeks, just a little at least, because it is unfair to ask a cream for a miracle, but nothing happened and in the end my skin got the same as always.</li>
            <li> and it was for 5 bucks for a small tube.  </li>
            <li> and the retro heavy white base (parabens?) plus yellow tumeric residue.</li>
            <li> I usually try to avoid chemicals like that in my cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I was using it on my cat because she had a small cyst below her eye.</li>

            <li> I had a small patch of pimples that I wanted to get rid of...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t work very well for my existing spots,</li>
            <li> Here is the Negative, and this is a BIGGIE...........</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, which, couple with hormonal changes, results in at least 4-5 pimples a month.</li>
            <li> At least, it did that for me.  </li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars because it has a scent I like and can moisture skin, but it wasnt helpful fading brown spots, at least in my skin.</li>
            <li> But it should be bit thick.</li>
            <li> Tectures is rather thick.</li>
            <li> course, just because this happened  to me doesn&#x27;t mean it will happen to you too.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> My acne has decreased, the oil glands around my eyes have diminished and the acne blemishes have started fading.  </li>
            <li> I MEAN EVERYTHIIIIIIIIIIIING!!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like flowers</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells funny (not bad), but i didn&#x27;t see any improvement. i guess it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone.</li>
            <li> The floral on this product is so heavy that it gave me a headache. I have no idea if it works as I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to find out.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I heard so many good things about it. First let me say the positive, after just one application overnight, I noticed a considerable difference in my skin.     Here is the Negative, and this is a BIGGIE...........MY TUBE WAS USED AND MISSING HALF OF WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THERE? I have never had a company send me a half used product. Obviously, it must have been returned by someone, and they failed to check the contents of the tube, just left it in the box, and my lucky self when I ordered it, got the one that someone sent back and used half of it up first. This is a really bad way to treat your customers. I am not the one to go through the trouble, especially without having transportation right now, to pack this up and send it back. I was pleased with the results on my skin, but why buy anything else from them when they are sending me a product someone else already used half of what was supposed to be in the bottle. Guess I wont be buying from them anymore, what a shame.  MY tube was Half full, bottom line, USED</li>
            <li> I bought the item based on the positive reviews, but when it arrived, the box had been previously opened. There were certain numbers scratched off the tube as well as the package. Has this only happened to me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brown skinned African American woman with olive undertones. During my pregnancy I had severe acne that left even more severe scarring. To my horror nothing was working to remove the scars. Thank God, this product came into my life. It works very well for scars. I would suggest waiting to use this product when your acne has subsided for optimal results on scars. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores and absorbs well into my skin. I think this is a great way to get the benefit of Turmeric without the stains. My skin was more vibrant almost instantly, and the severe scars began fading within the first few weeks. I have used this product for over a month and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> made me break out and smells terrible... try nadinola it works but takes really long</li>
            <li> Horrible Acne really bad on the areas where i applied this cream.  Really wanted it to work.  Had to stop using altogether.</li>
            <li> I ordered this turmeric skin cream because I have tried their Vicco toothpaste before and like it. So I thought that the Vicco lotion must also be nice and a natural product. I used it for about a month and like the fact that it&#x27;s non-greasy and goes on smoothly.     But yesterday I checked the ingredient list out of curiosity. I noticed that the lotion includes Methyl Paraben Sodium and Propyl Paraben, which are harmful preservatives according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database ([...]). Harmful ingredients like this get absorbed by the skin and enter the bloodstream.     For sure I will not use this lotion anymore, even though I liked the smell of it and its lightweight feel. I wonder why they use a chemical preservative, since they could just use Vitamin C and E as a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!!! Ive been using for a few days and already I can see a BIG difference in the clarity and texture of my skin. Im also using Proactiv being that I have stubborn acne, But this cream is sooooo good as a moisturizer! I hope it will help me get rid of my dark marks as well. I like this way better than Fair &amp; Lovely Ayurvedic regardless of the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems to boast, just now starting to pay attention as I am getting into my 30s.  Just thought I&#x27;d note, since everyone is, I am white as the winter snow with your basic freckles and blemishes.  I used this just a handful of times and noticed that it completely obliterated all of those little tiny bumps that have been on my neck for ages.  They are gone!  Amazing!  It makes my skin feel soft as a babies tush and I envision it glowing like the girl in the picture on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my husband absolutely despises the smell and literally gets mad if I put it on before bed.  I am not a huge fan either and question whether to apply it anywhere under or on my nose.  Definitely not something I will be using for any romantic evenings!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased for such a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two weeks now. It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I have moderate acne with a lot of hyperpigmentation. Vicco drys up the existing acne without leaving a scar...and it seems to have lighten the old scars on my cheeks and jar line. The smell was a bit strong when I first started using the cream but it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. I will give it month to see if my scars have shown more improvement. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> TOP RATED SELLER THANK YOU GREAT PRODUCT VERY FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Vicco Turmeric Cream as a bleaching cream. On the box it doesn&#x27;t say anything about lightening dark spots or discolorations of any kind, yet before I purchase it , from the description or the reviews I believe it did state it was good for lightening discolorations.  I strongly dislike the fragrance they have added into this product. I can tolerate strong smells even if it stinks, especially if its natural. But this cream is horrible when it comes to the scent. I have tried using just a tiny tiny bit and its still strong. Its a sweet smell that has way too much fragrance in it.  The smell does subside after a while. I don&#x27;t know if it has any other good qualities as mention on the box because its so hard to get past the strong overbearing smell of flowers. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like flowers but this is way overbroad. I stopped using it for now, will try to use again; I just have to prepare myself.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say I believe I have had pimples disappear over night.  I use to have bad hormonal acne but since starting on birth control pills those have pretty much vanished but I do still receive an occasional flare up and when I did I tried Vicoo Turmeric Cream on it and I swear it seemed to have disappear over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this stuff when I was dealing with my hormonal acne. I use to use benzoyl peroxide which would bleach my towels and clothes if I wasn&#x27;t careful.  Also benzoyl peroxide was pretty expensive because the 10% version was too drying so I used 5% and (at the time) I could only find one manufacture who carried it at that strength and it was for 5 bucks for a small tube.  I was told to try using benzoyl peroxide every day for preventative maintenance which did work well but again it&#x27;s pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some spotting on my cheek bones which I wish I could make disappear but this hasn&#x27;t really helped but I&#x27;m also impatient and didn&#x27;t use it for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the acne alone this stuff is awesome but I really, really wish they would make it scent free.  I feel the sandalwood smell is way over powering especially being used on the face.  It&#x27;s tolerable and the smell does go away but again it would be nice to have a scent free since I would think the smell isn&#x27;t really needed for the performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/26/2013:  Okay I STILL love this product since I wrote this review back in June of 2012.  I since found that sandalwood oil is actually supposed to be good for your skin and for acne.  I didn&#x27;t know that when I wrote this review but I STILL hate the smell but I LOVE how well it handles any pimple I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I feel a pimple developing a night or two of this keeps it from even coming up.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme based on the reviews I read, but this creme didn&#x27;t work for me it rather gave me acne and spot on my face and now am battling with the acne on my face. I can say it worked for some people but not everyone. Treatment varies from individual.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because it leaved my face soft and glowing. However, it does have a perfume smell and I don&#x27;t care for that part. I will keep using the cream on occasion despite the smell since it fades fast and it is only on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff since I was in my teens probably 20 years or so.  I dated an Indian boy back then, and he introduced me to it in an attempt to help me deal with my occasional blemishes and the redness that would not go away for weeks after they had healed.  I did not find that it prevented blemishes at all, but it seemed to have a pretty obvious astringent effect, closing up my pores pretty effectively.  My face seemed to get less oily on days when I used it, so I developed a habit of using it as a primer under my foundation.  It also seemed to temporarily reduce redness.  To be honest, though, the #1 reason I continue to buy it 20 years later is the sandalwood fragrance.  It is *heavenly*.  I wear it as a perfume as much as anything.  It is getting difficult to find the unscented version, which I prefer for my face as the sandalwood can be overwhelming on my face, but I will probably always keep this around just for the scent.  My daughter has also found that it makes a good oil-inhibiting primer under makeup, although she also would like to be able to get the unscented version more reliably.  You can&#x27;t hardly wear any other fragrance once you have some of this stuff on.</li>
            <li> This poroduct has 12% turmeric extract, which is proven to have remarkable anti microbial, anti inflammatory and melanin inhibiting properties--just google! turmeric is over 40 times more effective at inhibiting melanin than arbutin! I use vicco wso -- without sandal wood oil and it really vanishes into skin--no residue or heavy feel. And did I mention it is dirt cheap--$ 1.00!</li>
            <li> Love this Product and its working for me I have been only using it for a month its a keeper.</li>
            <li> I had great results after having a terrible boil on my face that left a scar.  You can&#x27;t tell that it was ever there.  My skin tone is African American.</li>
            <li> The date is expired on tube. I can still use it as I have used Tumeric cream before and it works great on my acne.</li>
            <li> I used this in the hope of getting my skin clear of the persistent acne that I&#x27;ve been having. I&#x27;ve intermittently used 5 or 10% benzoyl peroxide creams. They seem to work fine. But there were too many problems.&lt;br /&gt;1. My skin was getting painfully dry. I had to use a moisturizer after application.&lt;br /&gt;2. I always had to wash my face before I applied it. And if I happen to put the cream on my clothes, they used to get bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this was a huge chore. Now, this cream works wonders. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week. My skin&#x27;s never been so clear. And what&#x27;s more,it works like a good moisturizer as well. I tend to use it for 2-3 times a week. Also, try covering you acne spots with this cream and leave it over night. That worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, which, couple with hormonal changes, results in at least 4-5 pimples a month. Add to the fact that if I touch my face with dusty hands, I get huge pimples that never turn into whiteheads until they are a little lava mountain on the face. Jokes apart, it can be very embarassing.    I&#x27;ve tried garnier pure pen for my acne, which speeds up the acne life cycle to get rid of it. Vicco turmeric actually cures the infected area, and dries it without messy breakage. It does take a bit longer for the pimple to go, but it doesn&#x27;t get reinfected. This saved me on my wedding day when a dried dust pimple left a bump on my face- i applies a blob of this overnight and by morning, the bump was almost gone, and easily covered by basic makeup.    This is a herbal remedy I completely trust for my acne problem, and have used for the past ten years. No side effects, my ultra sensitive skin likes it, and no burning when I put it on. What more can I ask for!</li>
            <li> I used this to even out my skin tone my neck is 2 shades darker than my face and chest area.I read the reviews liked what I read and ordered 2 tubes.I applied it according to directions and waited for the (((miracle)))! Well not a damn thing happened!this crap doesn&#x27;t work either cause it doesn&#x27;t or the fact that it expired in 2006!gtfoh!!! I&#x27;m sure the company knew before they shipped this mess out.btw it smells like furniture wood polish.DONT BUY ! ITS A LIE! UPDATE 03/15/2012: IT DOES WONDERS ON UNTREATED WOOD!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:17425361]][[ASIN:B000HLH79E Turmeric Cream]]  It is an ayurvedic cream and does not make your skin oily!!!This is so important to me.It has a strong fragrance of turmeric and sandalwood which I like.</li>
            <li> Love  the smell. It goes on smooth. Remains to be seen if ut lightens a sark spot I have on the tip of my nose since using only 1 week so far.</li>
            <li> I want to preface this by saying I am a mocha skinned Black woman (Nigerian and African American) with an oily t-zone and a genetic pre-disposition to hyperpigmentation.  Also, I am writing this during the Chicago winter wherein my skintone becomes obviously uneven and pallid due to the lack of sunlight.     Search: I really wanted to find something that addressed hyperpigmentation, particularly for highly melanted skin.  Since many posts were not explicit about what Vicco Turmeric Skin Cream could do for brown women, I wanted to take a chance and see how it might work for me.    Cost: I bought it at the Chicago Macy&#x27;s (we have a Merz Apothecary which is the same vendor as Smallflower on amazon. com ) It cost me about $7, but it was so worth it.  It was way cheaper than hauling cosmetics that only aggravated my skin or jeopardizing my health with horrible bleaching creams.    Smell: I enjoy Ayurvedic products so the smell is fine to me.  Just sort of earthy but also a little cosmetic.    Results:  I pair the rose hip seed oil with the cream (being dark, the cream makes my skin looks whitish without it and actually gets a little shinier with out the seed oil as a base) in the morning and night.  I had a dark patch of scars and aggravated skin (from scrubbing and concealing) on my left cheek that made me very  self-conscious.  After using the cream for about 4 days now, I can actually see the entire patch has dramatically lightened to the point where I can distinctly see the scars that I was originally trying to reduce (and they are also fading quickly) which were hidden under the larger patch of darkened, irritated skin.  The scars around my temples are fading as well as evening my skintone in general.  Over the last few days, my best friend, who sees me regularly, told me my skin was glowing and couldn&#x27;t beleive how flawless and beautiful it looked when I woke up after a LONG night of partying.  Also, people have been walking up to me, telling me how amazing my skinlooks and asking me what I use and it has really been just a few days.     Cons: The cream has parabens, but I love it anyway.    Ultimately, I highly recommend this for Black/Brown people with hyperpigmentation.  It does not make your face uneven or discolored.  It really just glows, brightens and fades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my earlier review from no effect to some effect. My skin is latte--very light colored, and I am very prone to hyperpigmentation and moles and freckles and I stay virtually out of the sun.   60 days of daily application and I now finally see a more even skin tone but I wouldnt say fading. It still burns a bit after its on, and it makes you look ashy as it dries or soaks in. However, I am finally seeing a result-slight though, not remarkable as others have said.   Pores do shrink right away. Skin around red areas becomes calm and even-right away, so this is great after exfoliating. With my hyperpigmentation there is no change however, the more even tone around these areas does have the slight effect of making skin appear smoother.   Leave it on 15 mins til it soaks in before removing, and them moisturize. Best applied at night.  The downside is the smell (inside of Moms purse?) and the retro heavy white base (parabens?) plus yellow tumeric residue. I leave it on 10 mins and then clean off with a cotton pad soaked in toner.</li>
            <li> My skin has significantly improved since I began using this product a couple of weeks ago.  My acne has decreased, the oil glands around my eyes have diminished and the acne blemishes have started fading.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the product, very good quality, excellent seller deal.</li>
            <li> this cream has a strong-ish scent (which i am ok with, but if you are sensitive to smell, be forewarned).  i personally find it to be a pleasant scent- very clean and almost floral.  the cream itself absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel soft.  i have not noticed any lightening effects as of yet (i&#x27;ve been using at night for about a month).  a nice cream, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> After almost a year of trying every over the counter remedy I could think of for psoriasis on my knees, I gave this a try.  It really has shrunk the dry patches on my knees over 50% within one week of use!  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll get rid of the dry patches altogether, but I am very pleased with the improvement.  The remaining dry patches are quite yellow from the turmeric, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  When I forgot to use the cream for a few days, the patches didn&#x27;t reduce in size for those days, which tells me it&#x27;s the cream actually working, not some placebo effect.    I have also used it on my face, and it has reduced the size of the pores on my nose nicely.  On my chest, I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage, and it is fading nicely with use of the product.  I joke with my husband that soon I&#x27;ll be slathering my entire body in this stuff.    For reference, my skin tone is extremely fair with moles and freckles, and I burn very easily.    I like the smell of the product.  It is quite floral, which I don&#x27;t always like, but with the combination of the sandalwood oil I do really like it.  To me, it smells like nag champa incense.    The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the product is that it contains parabens.  I usually try to avoid chemicals like that in my cosmetics.  I have a friend who has lots of freckles and is starting to get large age spots, and I&#x27;ve recommended this to her.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two weeks ago and I can already see an improvement in my skin, and as a African American with dark brown skin I am very prone to acne scares and it really improved the glow of my skin as well it has lightened the existing spots remarkably! I have struggled with acne and the horrible scares since middle school and this is the ONLY thing I have found that has worked in such a small amount of time. I pray that it will continue to work and the spots with completely disappear!! I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has acne scares or just want clearer skin... it really works!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to lighten dark spots on my skin.  I am very fair but even the slightest pimple leaves a blemish behind that takes weeks to disappear.  I was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t work very well for my existing spots, buuuut I when I put it on a pimple that has just started, it clears it within 24 hours! Even works on cystic acne.  In fact, the redness and swelling start going down within an hour.  You can tell it acts as an astringent and shrinks it right up.  If you have a weak moment and actually squeeze a spot (I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to, but everyone does), put some of this on and it helps to heal it up quickly.  I have also used this on hangnails and mystery rashes.  Dries out the skin a bit and sometimes it peels a little after, but afterwards you can see it has healed.  I have gotten the girls in my office hooked on it, whenever they start getting a zit, they ask to use my &amp;#34;Indian Zit Cream&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Thanks</li>
            <li> It should be bit solid or bit thick. It is not even sitting in my hand. May be it is due to packing not sure. But it should be bit thick.</li>
            <li> Love this cream have been using it for years. I didn&#x27;t see it at first though this is the 50 mg version which is not what I expected, so just be sure to read the weight/ volume as this cream comes in all kinds of sizes. My fault, should have read more thoroughly. Not a giant difference in cost, this one costs slightly more, just warning others. Also, I find having shipping multiply by $4.99 for EACH item is ludicrous if ordering multiple items from this seller, i.e. 3x quantity comes to 3x shipping &#x3D; $14.97 !!! (its also called \\&quot;Turmeric\\&quot; not Tormeric.\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li> excellent cream for psoriasis skin rashes and even cranial psoriasis.this turmeric and sandalwood cream awesome. i got 4 tubes.i smells beautiful and works for my sons scalp issue.best price and free shipping from this seller.get it while you can it is,hard to find for,the sellers price,i have,used it for years.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish that this hadn&#x27;t made me break out. (The fact that I&#x27;m basically rubbing oil on my skin though my skin is already oily...) It definitely made a huge improvement to my hyperpigmentation and my pores are much smaller and refined. But the fact that it made me break out definitely outweighs the benefits. If your face does not react well with oil, do not buy this product. Otherwise, this could be an HG.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in turmeric root is bright skin staining yellow.&lt;br /&gt;This product is white. And&lt;br /&gt;I wont put parabens on my skin so this is not for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and combo/ oily skin ( but also sensitive), and I was afraid the turmeric would tinge me a yellow color...NOT AT ALL, it smells FANTASTIC and is so creamy and not greasy at all! I use it as a hand cream, put it on my face, my tummy for faded stretch marks, even bug bites. I will be buying this stuff over and over again! ALSO , this seems to be a 50 Gram tube, I read in the reviews some confusion :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SMELLS SO DREAMY AND IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SO SOFT! One of my favorite purchases on here by far!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how much this works. I was using it on my cat because she had a small cyst below her eye. I used it for months but it didn&#x27;t do anything. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what it was supposed to be used for but if it is it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My mistake - not the product I was looking for.  I have been using a different sandalwood/turmeric cream which I much prefer.  Could not find it online, so thought I would try this instead.  This product is too &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; smelling for my taste.  The other had a fresh scent of sandalwood and nothing else.</li>

            <li> This cream is amazing. So far I have been using it for a week now and I can already see great results. I bought this to even out my skin tone and found that it also helped to keep blemishes away. The only thing I did not like at first was the strong scent it has but after one night of wearing this I am able to ignore the scent. The item was shipped to my house really quick which surprised me because most sellers take longer to have products delivered. Overall, it&#x27;s a really good product and I will be repurchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of other reviews and the price seemed ok. I was disappointed as it did not work as well for me.</li>
            <li> Works great for adult acne.</li>
            <li> This product is natural and really works. It has helped with such things as minor blemishes, rashes, minor sunburns, etc. I really like this product as it also smells good (Sandalwood), but the smell dissipates after a little bit and it isn&#x27;t too strong. I also like the Amazon service. It was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that seems to be working yay!  I am dark skinned and dealt with dark spots from adult acne.  I got rid of pimples using african black soap, but was left with bad scars.  I,ve been using the Vicco turmeric for about 3 weeks now and i see about a 45% improvement.  I noticed a difference in my skin after the first night of use.  I use it twice a day after each wash, and it&#x27;s lightened the scars, minimized my oily t zone and pores, and has gives my skin a really nice glow.  The only downfall is that it took almost 3 weeks to receive the package.  However on a lighter note when i did get my cream there was a thank you letter from the owner of the company, with a mint thanking me for my purchase so i give them points for being so personal with their customers.  I will definitely be purchasing more and will hopefully get rid of the rest of my scarring :)</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with dark marks, as some stated it did for them however it didnt work for that but it is a good moisturizer, however the risk of the ingredients isnt worth it.</li>
            <li> My mom had acne and she used vicco... Her skin is glowing and beutiful(ah grew up in India) but vicco didn&#x27;t cure her scars. She was also drinking lemon juice in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;I tries vicco... I had a small patch of pimples that I wanted to get rid of... One week with vicco and BAM! I never had such severe acne, scars and cystic bumps. I always thought that the stinging meant that that its working but no. It&#x27;s soooo horrible I had numerous steam facials and products to clear the acne. Now I use clearasil ultra rapid acne wipes and at night apply KATHA POWDER(make a paste with water) and apply at night. That&#x27;s all. I tried everything, proactive benzoyl, lemon turmerix. everything. DON&#x27;T USE VICCO IF U GREW UP DRINKING HORMONE FILLED PRODUCTS OR IF U HAVE OILY skin. It&#x27;s a waste</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. I surprisingly like the weird smell and texture. I also like the way it leaves a matte feel/look on my skin, and I love that it contains Turmeric (a wonderful ingredient with many amazing benefits). However, I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s oil based. Even though it can be used to clear up acne, it actually gave me more acne because it clogged my pores :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little over a week, I had to stop using this because my pores were noticeably clogged and I had tiny little bumps all over my face. A few days after as I stopped using it, the bumps started to clear up and eventually all went away. I really hate that this happened because the product seems so good for oily, acne-prone skin like me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, just because this happened  to me doesn&#x27;t mean it will happen to you too. Just be mindful that it may or many not clog your pores.</li>
            <li> didnt do as much as i would of liked but it helped a little with the swelling, im still using it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really help with minor psoriosis even after applying 2-3 times a day for two weeks. I&#x27;ll keep trying though.</li>
            <li> undesireable scent.  Very strong.  Gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tolerate it.  Tectures is rather thick. No noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I dis like this product after using it my skin discoloration turn darker it was scary I wont recommend this product</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Ive been using turmeric for about a year bur I heard so many good reviews on this product on different boards. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell ( the sandalwood). I usually love sandalwood but not in combination with the sandalwood. Anyway,I love the results! The smell goes away after an hour or so. I usually do my regular cleansing routine at night and finish with the turmeric. MY skin is smoother and the acne scars are lighter and my pores are smaller. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have placed a new order for it again.  I&#x27;ve used it now for about 8 months, every day.  It heals blemishes, stops new ones from forming, is non-greasy and absorbs quickly and completely.  I have a t-zone complexion and this cream helps to control that and I can even wear it under make-up.  On top of that, it helps to heal minor skin infections.  At least, it did that for me.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Turneric is such a wonderful to skin, like any natural ingredient, I don&#x27;t see magical results right away, but use it for acne  and pigmentation for long term.</li>
            <li> Vicco Cream is an incredible healing agent.&lt;br /&gt;Particularly good on bruises and sprains....it is&lt;br /&gt;an anti-inflammatory and reduces pain.&lt;br /&gt;Miraculous.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this with my family for almost 4yrs now and it is the best product. Prevents pimples and made my skin more fair than it was before.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORK FOR MY PROBLEM SO GLAD I TRIED IT..</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks now, and i know that it is working. I have melasma after the birth of my son, and it iis now starting to blend in with the rest of my skin will keep using for sure</li>
            <li> I have fair complexion and one dermatologist burned my skin with a very strong peeling. As a result my skin got brown spots which never had before. I bought this cream hoping it might help me vanish some melasma spots on forehead and cheeks, just a little at least, because it is unfair to ask a cream for a miracle, but nothing happened and in the end my skin got the same as always. I give it 2 stars because it has a scent I like and can moisture skin, but it wasnt helpful fading brown spots, at least in my skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a local indian grocery store and the lady recommended me this. Got multiple cysts on my cheeks and little small pimples all over my forehead and temples.. what the heck! I had just gotten done clearing up my forehead with my clarisonic and now I&#x27;m back to square one with acne. This product sucks!</li>
