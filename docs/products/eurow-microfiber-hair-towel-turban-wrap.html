            <li>Perfect size, and very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I had one of these turbans before, a knock-off version someone gifted me from the dollar store, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all, so</li>
            <li>TOWELS ARE JUST AS GOOD</li>
            <li>and I know it is good for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good news:</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about these microfiber turbans and decided to try for myself.  </li>
            <li>For the price, a good product.</li>
            <li>My mom bought one for me years ago, and I  loved it and used it all the time.</li>
            <li>good absorption.</li>
            <li>Good hair towel.  </li>
            <li>This is of good quality material and works just as described.</li>
            <li>turban is perfect for drying my hair quickly without hassle and while keeping it out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love this turban!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>, I know it is suppose to be better for your hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed reduced frizz or breakage or anything like that, but I will continue to use this hair towel because it is so convenient!</li>
            <li>My girls and I love these!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and the button clasp is great</li>
            <li>This turban is great - and all my hair fits easily in it.</li>
            <li>works great, easy to use</li>
            <li>I holds a lot of hair, and is very absorbent!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I sleep with conditioner in my hair, so I can rinse it out in the morning, and this turban keeps my head nice and warm at night.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a nice towel.  </li>
            <li>Wraps nicely and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair.  </li>
            <li>I found this one at BBB  for much more money so its a good value also on amazon.</li>
            <li>Nice fabric..</li>
            <li>I even sleep in it and it keeps my curls looking nice.</li>
            <li>Nice size and quality.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and very absorbent!</li>
            <li>This has been a good hair towel, it is easy to use and soaks up a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it doesn&#x27;t fit on my head/hair good.</li>
            <li>my hair on the top of my head would kind of flop over onto the side of my head (not stay nicely on the top like the picture shows.)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad because they are amazing.</li>
            <li>of all the hair turbans I have bought and still have here, this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>There is a button and a large loop - they fit perfectly together, and it never comes undone.</li>
            <li>MORE ABSORBENT&lt;br /&gt;SUPPOSE</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I just need it to absorb most of the moisture and keep the hair off my clothes.  </li>
            <li>Quality was just okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have had many of these types of towels.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>This style stays on much better.  </li>
            <li>I like the feel of 100% cotton better.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m buying more for my daughter-in-laws.  </li>
            <li>As with the towel, I love using it for my hair</li>
            <li>and I love the microfiber.  </li>
            <li>I love the Eurow Microfiber Hair turban as a hair towel.  </li>
            <li>I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li>I have yet to be able to put the turban together as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love My Microfiber Eurow Turban.</li>
            <li>Just more convenient/less bulky when you are moving around trying to get stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are thinking of buying a hair turban, I would recommend checking out another brand for sure.</li>
            <li>I love to use this turban during my hair treatments or when &amp;#34;steaming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use my regular terry cloth towel for my hair anymore because this one works great!</li>
            <li>While this is more convenient than using a bath towel, I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in drying time.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I used to just wrap a towel around my head, but this is so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a bit more fuzz that comes off than I would like.  </li>
            <li>I might buy another one if I don&#x27;t find a terry one elsewhere as I would love to have a spare for when this one is in the wash.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I bought it because it makes washing my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>I love to use this.</li>
            <li>I have and have bought many hair turbans as I find them easier to use when I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not any more absorbent than a towel, but I like that</li>
            <li>Love these hair turbans.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this would be better at drying my hair faster after trying the Turbie Twist, which did not deliver on that promise.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but it&#x27;s seen better days.  </li>
            <li>I love this turban.</li>
            <li>I have been using hair turbans for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity of this turban.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the turban would hold all of it in.</li>
            <li>and I love this towel.</li>
            <li>I feel like dries my hair better, while not causing any breakage.</li>
            <li>and that is much better than others I have bought.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of drying hair, as well!</li>
            <li>love it!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I might have a better experience with it if I had shorter or thinner hair.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>This has shortened my blow-dry time significantly!</li>
            <li>so easy to use and cute that, while visiting me, my mother stole it</li>
            <li>Would be better if had elastic for a better fit.</li>
            <li>very soft and works great</li>
            <li>I love that it has a button and loop secure.  </li>
            <li>I still have the 3 that I purchased three years ago, they still work great, just not as soft.</li>
            <li>all my hair was able to fit into this towel.</li>
            <li>Love the button closure - stays secure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft and absorbent so it will greatly reduce my blow drying time.</li>
            <li>A microfiber or shammy type of material that feels more smooth would have been preferred.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product very absorbant.</li>
            <li>I have better luck with the original twistieturbie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like my original, but microfiber instead of terry, which absorbs much better.  </li>
            <li>Much more comfortable (and secure) than the bulky towels I used to twist on my head when in the steam room and sauna.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and works as they say it will.</li>
            <li>this hair wrap easily fits all of it, and dries it perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy button and loop closure.</li>
            <li>I bought one from Amazon, and I liked it so much that I bought two more.</li>
            <li>I can easy put on a shirt while this is on my head.  </li>
            <li>could easily fall off if i bend over</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash in the washer.</li>
            <li>This also doesn&#x27;t have a cheap elastic loop that breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine,</li>
            <li>By far the best way to quickly dry my curly, frizz-prone hair safely and with no frizz!</li>
            <li>I wrap the turban per the directions and easily secure the button loop.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great stocking stuffer for any female you care about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight but it absorbs moisture and it&#x27;s really comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>the material is the kind that grips your hair so it really stays in place well.</li>
            <li>Plenty of room and great absorbancy for my larger sized head.  </li>
            <li>I bought two because they are cheap and it is nice to always have a clean one ready.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect any amazing results from this particular turban.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to hook it so it stays in place.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very compact making them very easy to take with you to the gym or the pool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the seller shipped it out very quickly, what more could you wish for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought a couple extra for gifts and everybody liked them!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair, so I was expecting it to do better - not so much.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product had many positive ratings and reviews</li>
            <li>Easy to wear, very comfortable, absorbs well even if it&#x27;s not quite as amazing as I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the main reason I can&#x27;t even use this product is that when I washed it, it got so filled with static that I almost couldn&#x27;t even pull it apart.</li>
            <li>Great for wrapping my wet hair after a bath shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really thought i would love this towel</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to use a full size towel just for my hair.</li>
            <li>The button is large and easy to secure the end to</li>
            <li>Extra large - great if you have lots of hair.</li>
            <li>While it is great for holding your hair back and not being cumbersome while getting dressed and doing my makeup, it does not absorb as much moisture as it or its competition advertises.  </li>
            <li>any more than a normal towel.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair.cuts drying time by half an doesn&#x27;t slip.washes well</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and is very absorbent.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I first found out about them!</li>
            <li>The Microfiber material is light weight and soft and comfortable against your skin.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that it was nice to have this on my head versus a regular towel I guess, because of the size.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I really cared about the button, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I own several.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as big, but dries my hair more completely and is more secure.</li>
            <li>I bought this towel because I would like something nice and light to hold my wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it fits on my head, is easy to wrap, and dries my hair quicker than a normal towel.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a significant difference in my drying time or moisture retention...</li>
            <li>It never feels like it&#x27;s on right.</li>
            <li>I have migraines and don&#x27;t want to comb my hair out right away after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry in my gym bag which is nice, and obviously not as heavy as an actual towel.  </li>
            <li>Of all the incredibly varied things I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon over the past several months, this simple hair turban is my most used and absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>really absorbent, easy to use and keeps your hair up and away until you are ready to deal with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great solution to wearing a large heavy towel on your head after showers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t magically dry every strand of my hair, but honestly, what towel does?  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s far more gentle to my hair than using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and it is very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much, I ordered a second one.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, totally worth the purchase, and great for all you curly-haired girls who don&#x27;t want to drip dry in order to avoid frizz from a traditional towel.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for keeping wet hair off my neck and face while i do other things.  </li>
            <li>Good product, just twist and button, helps me get my long air out of the way and dried more quickly</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I paid full price for mine.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK, BUT BACK TO TOWELS FOR ME</li>
            <li>I have tried different types of towels and turbans - but this turban takes the cake for sure.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it any more absorbent than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t remember the brand of the last one, but it was much more absorbant than this one which I don&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re even better for the gym and deep conditioning my hair!</li>
            <li>When I remove the turban my hair is still pretty damp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was interested to try this product out after reading I should not be using terrycloth towels on my hair</li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty absorbent.</li>
            <li>Once you start using these hair towels, you&#x27;ll never be able to go back to full-size towels.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker and sturdier than my first one, and I use it every time I shower.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my wet hair out of the way and keeps your head warm too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of microfiber, but most of these are made of microfiber.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a regular towel.</li>
            <li>works just exactly as I</li>
            <li>last one I bought was alot thicker and the towel type fabric was of better quality.</li>
            <li>The towel might be great if you have a large head and a lot of thick hair...</li>
            <li>They absorb a lot of water very quickly, they&#x27;re super soft AND they dry quickly.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product, and echo other reviewers that these make great gifts.</li>
            <li>While it does absorb more water than a regular towel (and does stay on my head while getting ready much easier), it doesn&#x27;t soak up quite as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to put on and the button in the back ensures it stays put.</li>
            <li>Plus it is smaller and way more convenient than a normal bath towel.</li>
            <li>Downside, I had to wash several times to get rid of a strong chemical odor.  </li>
            <li>It was just too large.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use and fluff up nice after they are washed and dried.</li>
            <li>The material is very soft and absorbent, more so than your traditional terry cloth.  </li>
            <li>These are NOT thin or flimsy at all.  </li>
            <li>The microfiber is a bit static-y on my hair and the material doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water from damp hair as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I blow-dry my wayward bangs straight.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t air-dry very well.</li>
            <li>so much I am putting it on my Christmas</li>
            <li>I really like the softness and how it soaks up the excess water after shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this turban.</li>
            <li>It is really absorbent and allows me to keep getting ready in the morning without worrying about it falling off my head.</li>
            <li>Microfiber dries very well.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Very please with this product.</li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh much</li>
            <li>My hair dries so fast when i use it</li>
            <li>Made very well.  </li>
            <li>product makes getting ready in the morning after washing my hair SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Just wrap your hair in this turban, and getting the rest of yourself ready is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Absorbs wet hair well but attracts static in the dryer.</li>
            <li>so much easier than using a towel that falls off all the time.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much drying but it keeps my hair up and allows me to get dressed without having water everywhere.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t absorb much, if any, water).</li>
            <li>But honestly, I don&#x27;t have time to worry about drying my hair turban a different way every time than my regular towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who gets out of the shower and lounges about for a few hours before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>Good for helping to dry long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the original turbie towels and wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li>The turban can have other looks, more like a towel wrap which I like...</li>
            <li>Again, I highly recommend this for anyone who really cares about their hair.</li>
            <li>Other than it being smaller and more compact, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much better than a traditional towel.</li>
            <li>I only need one full sized towel now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Soft, absorbent, and reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li>I was hoping the microfiber would be more absorbent and cut down on blow drying.</li>
            <li>I was able to pull it back and keep it back without having to redo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>White is gonna get super ucky after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>I love that I can wear this hair towel, lay down on the couch, brush my teeth, eat breakfast and do makeup without worrying about my towel falling off my head!</li>
            <li>I have an old microfiber turban that really soaked the water from the hair.</li>
            <li>believe this towel might be useful if you have thinner hair or possibly even shorter hair, but I would stay away if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li>The microfiber works just as you&#x27;d expect, but the button closure is more trouble than convenient.</li>
            <li>This brand is large and has a loop that is long enough to go around the button easily.</li>
            <li>I originally bought her a &amp;#34;turby twist&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re much lower quality (and more expensive) than these.</li>
            <li>With long hair, I need quick absorption.</li>
            <li>and i had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is going to be the holy grail in terms of drying my hair quicker or anything like that, but at least it stays put in my head while I get dressed and put my make up on, so good enough!  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is if you are looking for this to dry your hair and your hair is long, or of medium length, you are better off using a towel.</li>
            <li>So many other brands are too short or do not clasp well.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t work any miracles when it comes to &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; hair one can really only expect so much from a towel!</li>
            <li>This is also considerably larger than most hair turbines I have used in the past, making it great for thick or long hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus, unexpected bonus: my hair is sooooo soft and not as frizzy!</li>
            <li>These are much easier to manage, and they dry your hair much quicker.  </li>
            <li>This turban felt very soft and decent quality when I first received it, but upon the first wash, the seam split down the middle about 2 inches.  </li>
            <li>I wish it would absorb water from my hair a little better, but it does it well enough.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars only because of how easy it is to wrap your hair in it, other than that I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>They attach with a button instead of elastic, so If you hair is short, these may not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>Soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>my hair though - at least I still look cute when I answer the door or if I need to go into the yard</li>
            <li>Much lighter and easier to deal with than a big bath towel.</li>
            <li>I think she had this very turban on in that movie, albeit one in a different color.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Overall I don&#x27;t really recommend this towel to anyone</li>
            <li>I have curly African-American hair (natural)</li>
            <li>naturally curly</li>
            <li>Then just slip it off and it&#x27;s nearly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my first use, I found that it was easy to use and it stayed in place... meaning it didn&#x27;t slowly creep to the back of my neck as time went on!</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I expected a lot more out of this turban than I got.</li>
            <li>When I travel they take up less space than a full towel.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier on the hair than a regular towel, and your hair will dry quite fast.</li>
            <li>This is my second microfiber hair towel, at some point I lost the old one and decided to order a new one.</li>
            <li>After this, I tried it a few more times in attempts to towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I still get a few pieces of lint in my hair but in general, It works much better than any towel that Ive ever used to dry my hair and the material is soft and quite absorbent..</li>
            <li>When I first used it and it off, my hair still looked as wet as before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly more lightweight than a regular towel, but after a few uses I went back to my towels.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it easily twists around itself and makes it hard to unbutton.</li>
            <li>White is somehow hard to find, glad i found these.</li>
            <li>This is much thicker and can handle very long hair.</li>
            <li>really helps dry my hair</li>
            <li>The turban does not help your hair dry fast.  </li>
            <li>This is a much thicker turban than the one seen on TV, and my hair is virtually dry by the time I take it off after putting on my make-up.</li>
            <li>The quality is decent--not real heavy, but easy to twirl and button.</li>
            <li>Its smaller and thinner so it gets soaked super fast with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a couple of older turbins that are terry... not terribly fond of the &amp;#34;microfiber&amp;#34;... but was unable to find the terry cloth.  </li>
            <li>When the last one got old</li>
            <li>and I barely notice that it is on my head.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to keep wet hair out of the way while getting ready.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like how the microfiber material feels on my wet ears/</li>
            <li>The turbie towels wear thin after many washings and the elastic stretches out.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred a less &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; material or a higher grade of polyester.  </li>
            <li>After so many twists and turns to get the towel situated, the elastic ends up wrapping itself around the button multiple times and it very hard to get off.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wear it a few days after dyeing my hair, but even so, it started turning a blotchy pink from my most recent red hair coloring.</li>
            <li>In the few weeks since I&#x27;ve changed how I dry my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change in my curls.</li>
            <li>The ones I&#x27;d been using most recently were thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always important for me to towel dry to cut down on drying/styling time and to prevent long term damage from over exposure to heating tools.</li>
            <li>I typically use a normal towel to pat dry my hair before I finish getting ready.</li>
            <li>If you have short or thin hair, it may not be great, because it&#x27;s a little bit loose.</li>
            <li>It smells a little funky, but I am sure the smell will go away after a few washes, I hope so!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for those looking to remove excess water; if you want your hair dried completely, this won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
            <li>It would stick to my hands in an odd way, I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li>Bought this to remove excess water from my hair, not to dry it completely.</li>
            <li>So, if a person has long or thick hair it will fit.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to button behind your head and</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read in a book that regular terry cloth towels dry out natural curly tops like mine.</li>
            <li>My hair is short thin and fine, it works well for me, but I sould never buy one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out thanks to the little button that fastens it in the back.</li>
            <li>Fabric is a little thin, but it&#x27;s nice that you can tie your hair up and get it out of the way.</li>

            <li> I had one of these turbans before, a knock-off version someone gifted me from the dollar store, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all, so</li>
            <li> TOWELS ARE JUST AS GOOD</li>
            <li> and I know it is good for my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good news:</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about these microfiber turbans and decided to try for myself.  </li>
            <li> For the price, a good product.</li>
            <li> My mom bought one for me years ago, and I  loved it and used it all the time.</li>
            <li> good absorption.</li>
            <li> Good hair towel.  </li>
            <li> This is of good quality material and works just as described.</li>
            <li> turban is perfect for drying my hair quickly without hassle and while keeping it out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I love this turban!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  </li>
            <li> , I know it is suppose to be better for your hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed reduced frizz or breakage or anything like that, but I will continue to use this hair towel because it is so convenient!</li>
            <li> My girls and I love these!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and the button clasp is great</li>
            <li> This turban is great - and all my hair fits easily in it.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to use</li>
            <li> I holds a lot of hair, and is very absorbent!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I sleep with conditioner in my hair, so I can rinse it out in the morning, and this turban keeps my head nice and warm at night.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a nice towel.  </li>
            <li> Wraps nicely and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair.  </li>
            <li> I found this one at BBB  for much more money so its a good value also on amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice fabric..</li>
            <li> I even sleep in it and it keeps my curls looking nice.</li>
            <li> Nice size and quality.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and very absorbent!</li>
            <li> This has been a good hair towel, it is easy to use and soaks up a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it doesn&#x27;t fit on my head/hair good.</li>
            <li> my hair on the top of my head would kind of flop over onto the side of my head (not stay nicely on the top like the picture shows.)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad because they are amazing.</li>
            <li> of all the hair turbans I have bought and still have here, this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> There is a button and a large loop - they fit perfectly together, and it never comes undone.</li>
            <li> MORE ABSORBENT&lt;br /&gt;SUPPOSE</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just need it to absorb most of the moisture and keep the hair off my clothes.  </li>
            <li> Quality was just okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many of these types of towels.  </li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> This style stays on much better.  </li>
            <li> I like the feel of 100% cotton better.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m buying more for my daughter-in-laws.  </li>
            <li> As with the towel, I love using it for my hair</li>
            <li> and I love the microfiber.  </li>
            <li> I love the Eurow Microfiber Hair turban as a hair towel.  </li>
            <li> I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be able to put the turban together as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love My Microfiber Eurow Turban.</li>
            <li> Just more convenient/less bulky when you are moving around trying to get stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you are thinking of buying a hair turban, I would recommend checking out another brand for sure.</li>
            <li> I love to use this turban during my hair treatments or when &amp;#34;steaming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use my regular terry cloth towel for my hair anymore because this one works great!</li>
            <li> While this is more convenient than using a bath towel, I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in drying time.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I used to just wrap a towel around my head, but this is so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a bit more fuzz that comes off than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I might buy another one if I don&#x27;t find a terry one elsewhere as I would love to have a spare for when this one is in the wash.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy I bought it because it makes washing my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love to use this.</li>
            <li> I have and have bought many hair turbans as I find them easier to use when I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not any more absorbent than a towel, but I like that</li>
            <li> Love these hair turbans.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be better at drying my hair faster after trying the Turbie Twist, which did not deliver on that promise.  </li>
            <li> I love it, but it&#x27;s seen better days.  </li>
            <li> I love this turban.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair turbans for most of my life.</li>
            <li> Love the simplicity of this turban.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the turban would hold all of it in.</li>
            <li> and I love this towel.</li>
            <li> I feel like dries my hair better, while not causing any breakage.</li>
            <li> and that is much better than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of drying hair, as well!</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I might have a better experience with it if I had shorter or thinner hair.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This has shortened my blow-dry time significantly!</li>
            <li> so easy to use and cute that, while visiting me, my mother stole it</li>
            <li> Would be better if had elastic for a better fit.</li>
            <li> very soft and works great</li>
            <li> I love that it has a button and loop secure.  </li>
            <li> I still have the 3 that I purchased three years ago, they still work great, just not as soft.</li>
            <li> all my hair was able to fit into this towel.</li>
            <li> Love the button closure - stays secure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft and absorbent so it will greatly reduce my blow drying time.</li>
            <li> A microfiber or shammy type of material that feels more smooth would have been preferred.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product very absorbant.</li>
            <li> I have better luck with the original twistieturbie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like my original, but microfiber instead of terry, which absorbs much better.  </li>
            <li> Much more comfortable (and secure) than the bulky towels I used to twist on my head when in the steam room and sauna.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and works as they say it will.</li>
            <li> this hair wrap easily fits all of it, and dries it perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy button and loop closure.</li>
            <li> I bought one from Amazon, and I liked it so much that I bought two more.</li>
            <li> I can easy put on a shirt while this is on my head.  </li>
            <li> could easily fall off if i bend over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash in the washer.</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t have a cheap elastic loop that breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine,</li>
            <li> By far the best way to quickly dry my curly, frizz-prone hair safely and with no frizz!</li>
            <li> I wrap the turban per the directions and easily secure the button loop.  </li>
            <li> Makes a great stocking stuffer for any female you care about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight but it absorbs moisture and it&#x27;s really comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> the material is the kind that grips your hair so it really stays in place well.</li>
            <li> Plenty of room and great absorbancy for my larger sized head.  </li>
            <li> I bought two because they are cheap and it is nice to always have a clean one ready.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect any amazing results from this particular turban.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to hook it so it stays in place.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very compact making them very easy to take with you to the gym or the pool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the seller shipped it out very quickly, what more could you wish for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought a couple extra for gifts and everybody liked them!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine hair, so I was expecting it to do better - not so much.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product had many positive ratings and reviews</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, very comfortable, absorbs well even if it&#x27;s not quite as amazing as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the main reason I can&#x27;t even use this product is that when I washed it, it got so filled with static that I almost couldn&#x27;t even pull it apart.</li>
            <li> Great for wrapping my wet hair after a bath shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really thought i would love this towel</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to use a full size towel just for my hair.</li>
            <li> The button is large and easy to secure the end to</li>
            <li> Extra large - great if you have lots of hair.</li>
            <li> While it is great for holding your hair back and not being cumbersome while getting dressed and doing my makeup, it does not absorb as much moisture as it or its competition advertises.  </li>
            <li> any more than a normal towel.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair.cuts drying time by half an doesn&#x27;t slip.washes well</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and is very absorbent.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I first found out about them!</li>
            <li> The Microfiber material is light weight and soft and comfortable against your skin.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that it was nice to have this on my head versus a regular towel I guess, because of the size.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I really cared about the button, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I own several.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as big, but dries my hair more completely and is more secure.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel because I would like something nice and light to hold my wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it fits on my head, is easy to wrap, and dries my hair quicker than a normal towel.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a significant difference in my drying time or moisture retention...</li>
            <li> It never feels like it&#x27;s on right.</li>
            <li> I have migraines and don&#x27;t want to comb my hair out right away after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry in my gym bag which is nice, and obviously not as heavy as an actual towel.  </li>
            <li> Of all the incredibly varied things I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon over the past several months, this simple hair turban is my most used and absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> really absorbent, easy to use and keeps your hair up and away until you are ready to deal with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great solution to wearing a large heavy towel on your head after showers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t magically dry every strand of my hair, but honestly, what towel does?  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s far more gentle to my hair than using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly and it is very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much, I ordered a second one.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, totally worth the purchase, and great for all you curly-haired girls who don&#x27;t want to drip dry in order to avoid frizz from a traditional towel.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for keeping wet hair off my neck and face while i do other things.  </li>
            <li> Good product, just twist and button, helps me get my long air out of the way and dried more quickly</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and I paid full price for mine.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK, BUT BACK TO TOWELS FOR ME</li>
            <li> I have tried different types of towels and turbans - but this turban takes the cake for sure.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it any more absorbent than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember the brand of the last one, but it was much more absorbant than this one which I don&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re even better for the gym and deep conditioning my hair!</li>
            <li> When I remove the turban my hair is still pretty damp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was interested to try this product out after reading I should not be using terrycloth towels on my hair</li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty absorbent.</li>
            <li> Once you start using these hair towels, you&#x27;ll never be able to go back to full-size towels.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker and sturdier than my first one, and I use it every time I shower.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my wet hair out of the way and keeps your head warm too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of microfiber, but most of these are made of microfiber.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a regular towel.</li>
            <li> works just exactly as I</li>
            <li> last one I bought was alot thicker and the towel type fabric was of better quality.</li>
            <li> The towel might be great if you have a large head and a lot of thick hair...</li>
            <li> They absorb a lot of water very quickly, they&#x27;re super soft AND they dry quickly.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product, and echo other reviewers that these make great gifts.</li>
            <li> While it does absorb more water than a regular towel (and does stay on my head while getting ready much easier), it doesn&#x27;t soak up quite as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to put on and the button in the back ensures it stays put.</li>
            <li> Plus it is smaller and way more convenient than a normal bath towel.</li>
            <li> Downside, I had to wash several times to get rid of a strong chemical odor.  </li>
            <li> It was just too large.</li>
            <li> They are super easy to use and fluff up nice after they are washed and dried.</li>
            <li> The material is very soft and absorbent, more so than your traditional terry cloth.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT thin or flimsy at all.  </li>
            <li> The microfiber is a bit static-y on my hair and the material doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water from damp hair as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I blow-dry my wayward bangs straight.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t air-dry very well.</li>
            <li> so much I am putting it on my Christmas</li>
            <li> I really like the softness and how it soaks up the excess water after shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this turban.</li>
            <li> It is really absorbent and allows me to keep getting ready in the morning without worrying about it falling off my head.</li>
            <li> Microfiber dries very well.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Very please with this product.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh much</li>
            <li> My hair dries so fast when i use it</li>
            <li> Made very well.  </li>
            <li> product makes getting ready in the morning after washing my hair SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Just wrap your hair in this turban, and getting the rest of yourself ready is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Absorbs wet hair well but attracts static in the dryer.</li>
            <li> so much easier than using a towel that falls off all the time.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much drying but it keeps my hair up and allows me to get dressed without having water everywhere.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t absorb much, if any, water).</li>
            <li> But honestly, I don&#x27;t have time to worry about drying my hair turban a different way every time than my regular towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who gets out of the shower and lounges about for a few hours before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> Good for helping to dry long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the original turbie towels and wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li> The turban can have other looks, more like a towel wrap which I like...</li>
            <li> Again, I highly recommend this for anyone who really cares about their hair.</li>
            <li> Other than it being smaller and more compact, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much better than a traditional towel.</li>
            <li> I only need one full sized towel now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Soft, absorbent, and reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li> I was hoping the microfiber would be more absorbent and cut down on blow drying.</li>
            <li> I was able to pull it back and keep it back without having to redo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> White is gonna get super ucky after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> I love that I can wear this hair towel, lay down on the couch, brush my teeth, eat breakfast and do makeup without worrying about my towel falling off my head!</li>
            <li> I have an old microfiber turban that really soaked the water from the hair.</li>
            <li> believe this towel might be useful if you have thinner hair or possibly even shorter hair, but I would stay away if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> The microfiber works just as you&#x27;d expect, but the button closure is more trouble than convenient.</li>
            <li> This brand is large and has a loop that is long enough to go around the button easily.</li>
            <li> I originally bought her a &amp;#34;turby twist&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re much lower quality (and more expensive) than these.</li>
            <li> With long hair, I need quick absorption.</li>
            <li> and i had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is going to be the holy grail in terms of drying my hair quicker or anything like that, but at least it stays put in my head while I get dressed and put my make up on, so good enough!  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is if you are looking for this to dry your hair and your hair is long, or of medium length, you are better off using a towel.</li>
            <li> So many other brands are too short or do not clasp well.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t work any miracles when it comes to &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; hair one can really only expect so much from a towel!</li>
            <li> This is also considerably larger than most hair turbines I have used in the past, making it great for thick or long hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus, unexpected bonus: my hair is sooooo soft and not as frizzy!</li>
            <li> These are much easier to manage, and they dry your hair much quicker.  </li>
            <li> This turban felt very soft and decent quality when I first received it, but upon the first wash, the seam split down the middle about 2 inches.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would absorb water from my hair a little better, but it does it well enough.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars only because of how easy it is to wrap your hair in it, other than that I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> They attach with a button instead of elastic, so If you hair is short, these may not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> Soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li> my hair though - at least I still look cute when I answer the door or if I need to go into the yard</li>
            <li> Much lighter and easier to deal with than a big bath towel.</li>
            <li> I think she had this very turban on in that movie, albeit one in a different color.</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Overall I don&#x27;t really recommend this towel to anyone</li>
            <li> I have curly African-American hair (natural)</li>
            <li> naturally curly</li>
            <li> Then just slip it off and it&#x27;s nearly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my first use, I found that it was easy to use and it stayed in place... meaning it didn&#x27;t slowly creep to the back of my neck as time went on!</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I expected a lot more out of this turban than I got.</li>
            <li> When I travel they take up less space than a full towel.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier on the hair than a regular towel, and your hair will dry quite fast.</li>
            <li> This is my second microfiber hair towel, at some point I lost the old one and decided to order a new one.</li>
            <li> After this, I tried it a few more times in attempts to towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I still get a few pieces of lint in my hair but in general, It works much better than any towel that Ive ever used to dry my hair and the material is soft and quite absorbent..</li>
            <li> When I first used it and it off, my hair still looked as wet as before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly more lightweight than a regular towel, but after a few uses I went back to my towels.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it easily twists around itself and makes it hard to unbutton.</li>
            <li> White is somehow hard to find, glad i found these.</li>
            <li> This is much thicker and can handle very long hair.</li>
            <li> really helps dry my hair</li>
            <li> The turban does not help your hair dry fast.  </li>
            <li> This is a much thicker turban than the one seen on TV, and my hair is virtually dry by the time I take it off after putting on my make-up.</li>
            <li> The quality is decent--not real heavy, but easy to twirl and button.</li>
            <li> Its smaller and thinner so it gets soaked super fast with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a couple of older turbins that are terry... not terribly fond of the &amp;#34;microfiber&amp;#34;... but was unable to find the terry cloth.  </li>
            <li> When the last one got old</li>
            <li> and I barely notice that it is on my head.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to keep wet hair out of the way while getting ready.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like how the microfiber material feels on my wet ears/</li>
            <li> The turbie towels wear thin after many washings and the elastic stretches out.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred a less &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; material or a higher grade of polyester.  </li>
            <li> After so many twists and turns to get the towel situated, the elastic ends up wrapping itself around the button multiple times and it very hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wear it a few days after dyeing my hair, but even so, it started turning a blotchy pink from my most recent red hair coloring.</li>
            <li> In the few weeks since I&#x27;ve changed how I dry my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change in my curls.</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;d been using most recently were thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always important for me to towel dry to cut down on drying/styling time and to prevent long term damage from over exposure to heating tools.</li>
            <li> I typically use a normal towel to pat dry my hair before I finish getting ready.</li>
            <li> If you have short or thin hair, it may not be great, because it&#x27;s a little bit loose.</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky, but I am sure the smell will go away after a few washes, I hope so!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for those looking to remove excess water; if you want your hair dried completely, this won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
            <li> It would stick to my hands in an odd way, I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li> Bought this to remove excess water from my hair, not to dry it completely.</li>
            <li> So, if a person has long or thick hair it will fit.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to button behind your head and</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read in a book that regular terry cloth towels dry out natural curly tops like mine.</li>
            <li> My hair is short thin and fine, it works well for me, but I sould never buy one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out thanks to the little button that fastens it in the back.</li>
            <li> Fabric is a little thin, but it&#x27;s nice that you can tie your hair up and get it out of the way.</li>
            <li> It may be too large for a child or someone with a small head or short hair!</li>
            <li> I kept it on for about an hour and a half, and when I took it off, my hair was still pretty wet!</li>
            <li> Better than all of those pretty much worthless cotton/terry cloth ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> And the microfiber material is really soft - much softer than the other towels I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Before the turban, it took several hours for my hair to dry unless I used the hairdryer for 10-15 minutes (!)</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is mid-length and thick enough to take forever to blow dry much less</li>
            <li> It got really worn out &amp; it was too small.</li>
            <li> This turban stays put and dries my long hair faster than a regular towel.</li>
            <li> This is big enough to contain all my hair, which is waist length; but, it is not highly absorbent.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is really a lint magnet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kept its fluffiness and ability to dry through several washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one was larger than I expected, but is not too big at all.</li>
            <li> and I do still use it, I&#x27;m not happy about it falling apart so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair, but this was still too large for me.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Turbie Twist for a long time.</li>
            <li> of all is that I don&#x27;t have to sit around with a wet towel wrapped over my head with water dripping all over my back from under it.</li>
            <li> THOSE WITH LONG HAIR, NOT ANY</li>
            <li> ...and the &#x27;&#x27;microfiber&#x27;&#x27; is not near the quality of the Aquis one I was replacing.  </li>
            <li> I would hang it up after my morning shower, and it would still be wet the next morning</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has long hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a struggle getting my long hair inside.</li>
            <li> It has a strange smell</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s still wet after wearing (and constantly fixing) it for 5hrs!</li>
            <li> With this microfiber turban (my 1st one), it was just barely damp in less than 15 mins</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought one of these (after I lost my other one at the laundromat).  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about the size because some of the other hair turbans I&#x27;ve purchased are not that big</li>
            <li> Very soft, fluffy and extremely absorbent.  </li>
            <li> As we are getting into colder weather, we needed a way to keep her very long hair off her dry clothes on the drive home.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mostly dry.  </li>
            <li> and I find it truly keeps my hair dry</li>
            <li> hang dry.</li>
            <li> I did not have to sit around in a towel for an hour to get that dry time either</li>
            <li> and then I let it air dry the rest of the way</li>
            <li> I got this microfiber hair turban in hopes that it would help my long/thick hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, this did not help dry my hair any faster.</li>
            <li> I did dry it with a dryer sheet, this is maybe why.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t help dry her hair any quicker than air drying.</li>
            <li> It also stays fairly dry</li>
            <li> This thing can&#x27;t hold hair in place, won&#x27;t dry your hair either</li>
            <li> And none of the water from my wet hair escaped and left any wet spots on my clothes.</li>
            <li> In the photo in this ad it at least looks normal; when I have it on, I think I look like Patricia Neal in Breakfast</li>
            <li> It is soft, plush and drys my hair faster and my hair usually takes forever to dry&lt;br /&gt;but not with this turban.</li>
            <li> It keeps my wet hair from dripping all over the place and helps dry my hair in the process.  </li>
            <li> had I thought of this little issue before purchasing, I never would have bought it: it&#x27;s white.</li>
            <li> just wish I had a bought a color besides white as it does get a little grungy looking after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is actually a little big</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too loose and feels so rough, especially after a few washes.</li>
            <li> The texture is bad, it doesn&#x27;t really absorb water as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> However, it feels rough when I run my hand across its surface.  </li>
            <li> I suggest buying two; after a few months and several washes, the turban doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has long dark hair and had struggled with towels (size, thickness, materials).</li>
            <li> type- started wrapping my wet hair in t-shirts until the turban arrived.</li>
            <li> It is not very absorbent.</li>
            <li> My hair was nearly as wet as it was before I wrapped it in the turban.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s wet to the touch, I can use it again and again and it still whisks away the excess water from my hair.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get my pillows, the couch, etc wet from my towel.</li>
            <li> Her hair is long thick and this Hair Turban would not dry her</li>
            <li> Dries hair while you can do other things.</li>
            <li> But, unfortunately, my dog liked it too and rendered it useless.</li>
            <li> If you use daily, expect to use at least two per year, depending on how often you wash them.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair down to below my chest-</li>
            <li> It dries my hair well too and cuts down on blow drier time.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t drop down your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The turban fits on my head and gets my hair to a level of dryness (10-15mins) where I can still put product in it and not have water dripping down my neck on my drive to work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the turban to help with dry time because I have curly thick hair and it allows me to do other things while</li>
            <li> I seriously can not say enough about this!</li>
            <li> BUT I comb it out and in less an hour</li>
            <li> Less frizz.</li>
            <li> Less tangles.</li>
            <li> And when I tried to use it on my hair, it created a staticky mess.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair, so I was looking for something that would pull my hair out of my face but also aid in drying it faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but once I turned on my hairdryer, my hair dried incredibly quick!</li>
            <li> You may have to twist it tight if you have shorter</li>
            <li> the button hole stretches and the hold is not as tight.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick hair, and it takes me forever to blow dry.</li>
            <li> My thick, curly hair still takes hours to dry with those.</li>
            <li> It might have even helped keep me a little less frizzy, but because of the issues I&#x27;ve mentioned, I stopped using it after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> When I forget, I&#x27;m always sad to use a regular towel to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really matter except it&#x27;s made an awkward looking thing look</li>
            <li> I ordered a few packs of these.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting it as a stocking stuffer for quite a few friends this year.</li>
            <li> Each time, my hair hadn&#x27;t significantly dried.</li>
            <li> ; i mean that if I grab it with my less-than-smooth hands, it basically grabs onto my rough skin like spider man.  </li>
            <li> My usual 30 minutes with the blow dryer was cut nearly in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried just blotting quickly and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find products that can work on my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The button to hold it down is hard to hook.</li>
            <li> I towel dry my very thick, below shoulder length hair after my shower.  </li>
            <li> Material wasn&#x27;t very thick and kept coming loose.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use the turbie twist but needed another and got thus instead.  </li>
            <li> so I was not able to use it effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries as well as any ordinary towel would if it were fitted with a loop and button.</li>
            <li> No more towels falling off our heads.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating buying the more expensive Aquis towels, but after being disappointed by 2 brands, I&#x27;m not going to bother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too small as some</li>
            <li> Not really ideal for longer hair and has a strange smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but &#x27;do not use fabric softener&#x27; is written on the label.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hate having a big towel on my head when I am getting dressed and waiting for my hair to dry.  </li>
            <li> the common brand name one that was flimsy after seen these ones)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works well for me though because I have medium length, curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> the button.&lt;br /&gt;A loop made of thick thread is what they use to clasp one end of the turban to the button.</li>
            <li> if you have thick hair this will not do for you.</li>
            <li> The turban is made with poor material and not easy to wrap the hair around.  </li>
            <li> You can bend down without it falling out because of the button hole keeping the towel twisted.</li>
            <li> This is a less expensive option to the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get bad smelling after several uses when hung up.  </li>
            <li> These reviews show others seem to like it, but I find it to be an awkward little turban for my thick, just-past shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> Poorly made and doesn&#x27;t absorb water well.</li>
            <li> The thing is that I just don&#x27;t like the weight of a normal towel on my head because it can get very annoying after a while.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that was an unrealistic expectation on my part.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it just felt very weird.</li>
            <li> However, for the price, it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad news:</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this towel is horrible.</li>
            <li> I hate the way it feels on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst hair towel.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always keep these on hand. Good for helping to dry long hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear, very comfortable, absorbs well even if it&#x27;s not quite as amazing as I expected. would recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I still get a few pieces of lint in my hair but in general, It works much better than any towel that Ive ever used to dry my hair and the material is soft and quite absorbent..</li>
            <li> I like this item a lot, since it helps avoid frizzy hair. But, unfortunately, my dog liked it too and rendered it useless.</li>
            <li> This product has great absorbancy and contains my waist-length hair.  However, it feels rough when I run my hand across its surface.  I&#x27;m worried it will snag my hair, so I now use it as a hand towel.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Turbie Twist for a long time. It got really worn out &amp; it was too small. This one is fabulous!!!  I holds a lot of hair, and is very absorbent!!!!!  Sometimes I sleep with conditioner in my hair, so I can rinse it out in the morning, and this turban keeps my head nice and warm at night.</li>
            <li> This has shortened my blow-dry time significantly! I have incredibly thick hair, and it takes me forever to blow dry. I had one of these turbans before, a knock-off version someone gifted me from the dollar store, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all, so I didn&#x27;t expect any amazing results from this particular turban. When I first used it and it off, my hair still looked as wet as before. I was disappointed, but once I turned on my hairdryer, my hair dried incredibly quick! I was very impressed. I suggest buying two; after a few months and several washes, the turban doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as well. If you use daily, expect to use at least two per year, depending on how often you wash them.</li>
            <li> These are longer and softer than turbie twists. They attach with a button instead of elastic, so If you hair is short, these may not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the seller shipped it out very quickly, what more could you wish for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all is that I don&#x27;t have to sit around with a wet towel wrapped over my head with water dripping all over my back from under it. This turban stays put and dries my long hair faster than a regular towel.</li>
            <li> TOWELS ARE JUST AS GOOD&lt;br /&gt;I GUESS IT LOOKS NEATER THAN A TOWEL WRAPPED AROUND YOUR HEAD&lt;br /&gt;FOR THOSE WITH LONG HAIR, NOT ANY MORE ABSORBENT&lt;br /&gt;SUPPOSE IT&#x27;S OK, BUT BACK TO TOWELS FOR ME</li>
            <li> I have tried different types of towels and turbans - but this turban takes the cake for sure. It dries my hair faster than any towel I have ever seen. The Microfiber material is light weight and soft and comfortable against your skin. Love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like the size. It has a lot of room when folded into a turban. So, if a person has long or thick hair it will fit. It is definitely roomier than others that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a nice towel.  Like I said, it fits on my head, is easy to wrap, and dries my hair quicker than a normal towel.  It doesn&#x27;t magically dry every strand of my hair, but honestly, what towel does?  I just need it to absorb most of the moisture and keep the hair off my clothes.  This does it quite well.</li>
            <li> This was a present.  Quality was just okay.</li>
            <li> Soft and absorbent. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many of these types of towels.  The ones I&#x27;d been using most recently were thin and flimsy.  These are NOT thin or flimsy at all.  They absorb a lot of water very quickly, they&#x27;re super soft AND they dry quickly. They&#x27;re also very compact making them very easy to take with you to the gym or the pool.</li>
            <li> Wraps nicely and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair.  I wish it would absorb water from my hair a little better, but it does it well enough.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has long dark hair and had struggled with towels (size, thickness, materials). She loves these turbans. I bought two because they are cheap and it is nice to always have a clean one ready. RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I really thought i would love this towel but I don&#x27;t find it any more absorbent than a regular towel.  Its smaller and thinner so it gets soaked super fast with my thick hair.  It is easy to carry in my gym bag which is nice, and obviously not as heavy as an actual towel.  But nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Giving the extra one to a friend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the Aquis microfiber hair turban....and this is NOT an acceptable replacement.  The towel might be great if you have a large head and a lot of thick hair...but I have neither!  ...and the &#x27;&#x27;microfiber&#x27;&#x27; is not near the quality of the Aquis one I was replacing.  I&#x27;ve had that one for probably over ten years....  I love that it has a button and loop secure.  I would not buy this one again</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair towel. It won&#x27;t stay on your head regardless of the button hook on the nape of you neck. I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I never had one and I thought I would try it. I think it&#x27;s great and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the original turbie towels and wanted to try something different.  The turbie towels wear thin after many washings and the elastic stretches out.  This style stays on much better.  Downside, I had to wash several times to get rid of a strong chemical odor.  I like the feel of 100% cotton better.</li>
            <li> These turbans are the best I have bought. So many other brands are too short or do not clasp well. This brand is large and has a loop that is long enough to go around the button easily. I still have the 3 that I purchased three years ago, they still work great, just not as soft. They also make a great gift. Love them.</li>
            <li> This is my second microfiber hair towel, at some point I lost the old one and decided to order a new one. I couldn&#x27;t remember the brand of the last one, but it was much more absorbant than this one which I don&#x27;t feel really helps dry my hair any more than a normal towel.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few packs of these. I love them! They&#x27;re even better for the gym and deep conditioning my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a good product very absorbant. I found this one at BBB  for much more money so its a good value also on amazon.</li>
            <li> It stays on my head, and my hair dries in such a short time....I can&#x27;t believe it!!  I bought one for my daughter and I&#x27;m buying more for my daughter-in-laws.  I love the micro-fiber cloth!!!</li>
            <li> I seriously can not say enough about this! I really got it for convenience; using my bulky bath towels just got too heavy, or they would fall all over the place - this obviously eliminates that. Plus, unexpected bonus: my hair is sooooo soft and not as frizzy! This thing is GREAT.</li>
            <li> Awful. I usually use the turbie twist but needed another and got thus instead.  Yuck.  It&#x27;s way too loose and feels so rough, especially after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Good product, just twist and button, helps me get my long air out of the way and dried more quickly</li>
            <li> The microfiber is a bit static-y on my hair and the material doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water from damp hair as I&#x27;d like. Other than it being smaller and more compact, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much better than a traditional towel. However, for the price, it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews.  I was a bit skeptical.  I tried it anyway.  It works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now.  I towel dry my very thick, below shoulder length hair after my shower.  I blow-dry my wayward bangs straight.  I wrap the turban per the directions and easily secure the button loop.  It stays put on my head while I eat breakfast, get dressed, make the bed, put on a bit of makeup.  When I remove the turban my hair is still pretty damp.  BUT I comb it out and in less an hour it&#x27;s mostly dry.  Before the turban, it took several hours for my hair to dry unless I used the hairdryer for 10-15 minutes (!) on the low setting with a diffuser.  The turban makes life easier and I think it&#x27;s far more gentle to my hair than using a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> As with the towel, I love using it for my hair and I find it truly keeps my hair dry and I know it is good for my hair. Again, I highly recommend this for anyone who really cares about their hair.</li>
            <li> What a great idea!  Much more comfortable (and secure) than the bulky towels I used to twist on my head when in the steam room and sauna.  The button is large and easy to secure the end to and I love the microfiber.  This turban and the Velcro body wrap greatly enhance my gym visits.</li>
            <li> OMG! I have fine hair that is mid-length and thick enough to take forever to blow dry much less hang dry. After using it once I was sold. My usual 30 minutes with the blow dryer was cut nearly in half. I did not have to sit around in a towel for an hour to get that dry time either like I use to do. It is so easy to use and works as they say it will. I am going to get my daughter one!</li>
            <li> I love the Eurow Microfiber Hair turban as a hair towel.  It is easy to use and is very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair down to below my chest- this hair wrap easily fits all of it, and dries it perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested to try this product out after reading I should not be using terrycloth towels on my hair type- started wrapping my wet hair in t-shirts until the turban arrived. In the few weeks since I&#x27;ve changed how I dry my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change in my curls. Less frizz. Less tangles.</li>
            <li> so easy to use and cute that, while visiting me, my mother stole it and i had to buy a new one. really absorbent, easy to use and keeps your hair up and away until you are ready to deal with it. Makes a great stocking stuffer for any female you care about.</li>
            <li> Nice fabric.. Way....to big..</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair, so I was looking for something that would pull my hair out of my face but also aid in drying it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news: all my hair was able to fit into this towel. I was able to pull it back and keep it back without having to redo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news: It is not very absorbent. My hair was nearly as wet as it was before I wrapped it in the turban. It also didn&#x27;t air-dry very well. I would hang it up after my morning shower, and it would still be wet the next morning so I was not able to use it effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this towel might be useful if you have thinner hair or possibly even shorter hair, but I would stay away if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is going to be the holy grail in terms of drying my hair quicker or anything like that, but at least it stays put in my head while I get dressed and put my make up on, so good enough!  It smells a little funky, but I am sure the smell will go away after a few washes, I hope so!</li>
            <li> Good product. Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about these microfiber turbans and decided to try for myself.  This turban felt very soft and decent quality when I first received it, but upon the first wash, the seam split down the middle about 2 inches.  While it&#x27;s still in useable shape and I do still use it, I&#x27;m not happy about it falling apart so quickly.  I am going to have to hand-wash it going forward so that it doesn&#x27;t further deteriorate.  While it does absorb more water than a regular towel (and does stay on my head while getting ready much easier), it doesn&#x27;t soak up quite as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Awesome towel for my granddaughter Christmas gift. I am sure she will love it. I like it so much I am putting it on my Christmas list.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these turban towels. I originally bought her a &amp;#34;turby twist&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re much lower quality (and more expensive) than these. Save your money and get these instead!</li>
            <li> I have yet to be able to put the turban together as shown in the picture. Each time I try, it falls off my head.</li>
            <li> Great for wrapping my wet hair after a bath shampoo. I&#x27;d purchase as a gift.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product to help keep my hair on my head and out of the towel!  Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love My Microfiber Eurow Turban. I wish I had ordered two. I really like the softness and how it soaks up the excess water after shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li> I got the turban to help with dry time because I have curly thick hair and it allows me to do other things while&lt;br /&gt;wearing it and it not killing my head like a traditional towel. Helps not to frizz my hair and then I let it air dry the rest of the way</li>
            <li> I really like this turban. It is really absorbent and allows me to keep getting ready in the morning without worrying about it falling off my head. My only complaint is that it is really a lint magnet. All kinds of bits of string and lint stick to it. If that sort of thing bothers you, you won&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I got this microfiber hair turban in hopes that it would help my long/thick hair dry faster. I was very disappointed in this product for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it doesn&#x27;t fit on my head/hair good. I have long and thick hair, but this was still too large for me. Once I would twist the towel and button it up on my head (I did use it correctly) my hair on the top of my head would kind of flop over onto the side of my head (not stay nicely on the top like the picture shows.) It was just too large. I do have to say that it was nice to have this on my head versus a regular towel I guess, because of the size. Just more convenient/less bulky when you are moving around trying to get stuff done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this did not help dry my hair any faster. Maybe that was an unrealistic expectation on my part. That&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main reason I can&#x27;t even use this product is that when I washed it, it got so filled with static that I almost couldn&#x27;t even pull it apart. And when I tried to use it on my hair, it created a staticky mess. Horrible! I did dry it with a dryer sheet, this is maybe why. But honestly, I don&#x27;t have time to worry about drying my hair turban a different way every time than my regular towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are thinking of buying a hair turban, I would recommend checking out another brand for sure.</li>
            <li> Would be better if had elastic for a better fit. Seems to be pretty absorbent. For the price, a good product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a significant difference in my drying time or moisture retention... I love to use this turban during my hair treatments or when &amp;#34;steaming&amp;#34; my hair though - at least I still look cute when I answer the door or if I need to go into the yard ...... btw - it seems durable, I&#x27;ve washed it several times in the washer and it&#x27;s holding up well!</li>
            <li> Better than all of those pretty much worthless cotton/terry cloth ones I&#x27;ve tried. My thick, curly hair still takes hours to dry with those. With this microfiber turban (my 1st one), it was just barely damp in less than 15 mins and I only wore it for a rushing 5 of those the 1st time. I&#x27;ve also tried just blotting quickly and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. This also doesn&#x27;t have a cheap elastic loop that breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read in a book that regular terry cloth towels dry out natural curly tops like mine. The product itself works great I even sleep in it and it keeps my curls looking nice. It&#x27;s easy to put on and the button clasp is great so it stays on your head. It&#x27;s lightweight but it absorbs moisture and it&#x27;s really comfortable to wear. I don&#x27;t use my regular terry cloth towel for my hair anymore because this one works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great solution to wearing a large heavy towel on your head after showers. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out thanks to the little button that fastens it in the back. I would recommend this to anyone who has long hair.</li>
            <li> Material wasn&#x27;t very thick and kept coming loose. Went back to just wrapping my hair in a towel. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Once you start using these hair towels, you&#x27;ll never be able to go back to full-size towels.  These are much easier to manage, and they dry your hair much quicker.  My mom bought one for me years ago, and I  loved it and used it all the time. I eventually had to buy another one (which is where this one from Amazon comes into the picture).  It is thicker and sturdier than my first one, and I use it every time I shower.  I recently bought one for my niece, who loves hers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read somewhere that you shouldn&#x27;t use the same towel for your hair and body, as the oil leftover from your conditioner gets on your towel you use for your hair and then you could rub it inadvertently on your body, possibly causing break-outs, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this turban! It is so much easier on the hair than a regular towel, and your hair will dry quite fast. If you have split ends like me and are using products to heal them, this turban will help speed up that process because it is gentle and doesn&#x27;t put a bunch of weight on your roots the way heavy towels do. Thank you, Eurow Microfiber Hair Turban!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who gets out of the shower and lounges about for a few hours before getting dressed. I love that I can wear this hair towel, lay down on the couch, brush my teeth, eat breakfast and do makeup without worrying about my towel falling off my head! It dries my hair well too and cuts down on blow drier time.</li>
            <li> While this is more convenient than using a bath towel, I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in drying time. I was hoping the microfiber would be more absorbent and cut down on blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these over the years. When the last one got old I thought I&#x27;d save money so picked up a cheaper version elsewhere. There is no comparison. This is much thicker and can handle very long hair. Absorbs great and cuts drying time. Easy button and loop closure.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this! Much lighter and easier to deal with than a big bath towel. Microfiber dries very well.</li>
            <li> By far the best way to quickly dry my curly, frizz-prone hair safely and with no frizz! The button and its clasp are sturdy, so no worries when washing the towel or when securing it. The only suggestion I would give this product is that it could be a bit larger. Otherwise, totally worth the purchase, and great for all you curly-haired girls who don&#x27;t want to drip dry in order to avoid frizz from a traditional towel.</li>
            <li> I should have looked closer at the photo of the woman in the ad before purchasing this. Her expression is reflective of my feelings on it....meh.  These reviews show others seem to like it, but I find it to be an awkward little turban for my thick, just-past shoulder length hair. It never feels like it&#x27;s on right. In the photo in this ad it at least looks normal; when I have it on, I think I look like Patricia Neal in Breakfast At Tiffany&#x27;s. Remember her, she was George Peppard&#x27;s sugar momma? I think she had this very turban on in that movie, albeit one in a different color. I&#x27;m not expecting to pull off Audrey Hepburn with this thing on, but come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And had I thought of this little issue before purchasing, I never would have bought it: it&#x27;s white. I didn&#x27;t wear it a few days after dyeing my hair, but even so, it started turning a blotchy pink from my most recent red hair coloring. It doesn&#x27;t really matter except it&#x27;s made an awkward looking thing look even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this -- I read several recommendations on several curly hair websites about the benefits of microfiber towels/turbans. It might have even helped keep me a little less frizzy, but because of the issues I&#x27;ve mentioned, I stopped using it after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Dries hair turbo style.  Great product!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter like it.  After a few washings, they turned into sock magnets, haha.  They are almost velcro now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the material of this hair turban at all. It would stick to my hands in an odd way, I can&#x27;t really explain it but it just felt very weird. I gave it two stars only because of how easy it is to wrap your hair in it, other than that I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Love this. I used to just wrap a towel around my head, but this is so much better. It&#x27;s light and I barely notice that it is on my head. If you have short or thin hair, it may not be great, because it&#x27;s a little bit loose. It works well for me though because I have medium length, curly thick hair. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  It keeps my wet hair from dripping all over the place and helps dry my hair in the process.  It also doesn&#x27;t get bad smelling after several uses when hung up.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought one of these (after I lost my other one at the laundromat).  I would definitely recommend this hair turban!</li>
            <li> This has been a good hair towel, it is easy to use and soaks up a lot of moisture. I don&#x27;t know if I am sold yet on microfiber, I know it is suppose to be better for your hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed reduced frizz or breakage or anything like that, but I will continue to use this hair towel because it is so convenient!</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I expected a lot more out of this turban than I got. I didn&#x27;t notice that it dried my hair any faster than a regular towel, and it didn&#x27;t really keep all of my hair in it. It&#x27;s certainly more lightweight than a regular towel, but after a few uses I went back to my towels. I&#x27;m glad this was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this because she didn&#x27;t want to damage her hair with a blow dryer. But it doesn&#x27;t help dry her hair any quicker than air drying. Pretty pointless</li>
            <li> Perfect size, and very comfortable to wear. Keeps my wet hair out of the way and keeps your head warm too.</li>
            <li> The turban does not help your hair dry fast.  It is the same as any towel you put on your head.</li>
            <li> Very please with this product. Works great on my hair.cuts drying time by half an doesn&#x27;t slip.washes well</li>
            <li> Extra large - great if you have lots of hair.</li>
            <li> Dries as well as any ordinary towel would if it were fitted with a loop and button. I have an old microfiber turban that really soaked the water from the hair. This seems to be simply terrycloth.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these and I&#x27;m glad because they are amazing. This way when I&#x27;m washing one of them I still have another one to use. I love this product. It&#x27;s soft and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love these absorbant towels!! Great way to soak up the water from your hair without soaking your clothes ! Try it.</li>
            <li> I bought one from Amazon, and I liked it so much that I bought two more. This is a much thicker turban than the one seen on TV, and my hair is virtually dry by the time I take it off after putting on my make-up.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a bit more fuzz that comes off than I would like.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of microfiber, but most of these are made of microfiber.  I hate the way it feels on my fingers.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh much and I hate having a big towel on my head when I am getting dressed and waiting for my hair to dry.  I can easy put on a shirt while this is on my head.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I really cared about the button, but it works very well.  I might buy another one if I don&#x27;t find a terry one elsewhere as I would love to have a spare for when this one is in the wash.</li>
            <li> The turban is made with poor material and not easy to wrap the hair around.  I would not recommend buying this product,</li>
            <li> Bought this to remove excess water from my hair, not to dry it completely. It definitely does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to put a rubber and at the end of the towel to make it stay on my head. Now with this I just twist, button and I&#x27;m done. I like it a lot  and I&#x27;m happy I bought it because it makes washing my hair so much easier. You may have to twist it tight if you have shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it&#x27;s wet to the touch, I can use it again and again and it still whisks away the excess water from my hair. And it doesn&#x27;t drop down your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for those looking to remove excess water; if you want your hair dried completely, this won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who swims 4-5 days a week.  As we are getting into colder weather, we needed a way to keep her very long hair off her dry clothes on the drive home.  The material is very soft and absorbent, more so than your traditional terry cloth.  however, the clasp is an elastic loop that goes over a button at the back. After so many twists and turns to get the towel situated, the elastic ends up wrapping itself around the button multiple times and it very hard to get off.  I have had to assist my daughter in trying to untwist the elastic so she could remove the towel.</li>
            <li> My girls and I love these! They are super easy to use and fluff up nice after they are washed and dried. No more towels falling off our heads.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and it is awesome. My hair dries so fast when i use it and i don&#x27;t have to wrestle with it to keep it on.</li>
            <li> I love to use this. I have seen a reduction in frizz when I use it.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and very absorbent!</li>
            <li> Its hard to find products that can work on my long, thick hair.  This turban holds all of my hair with room to spare.  Made very well.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the size because some of the other hair turbans I&#x27;ve purchased are not that big and it&#x27;s a struggle getting my long hair inside. This turban is great - and all my hair fits easily in it. It may be too large for a child or someone with a small head or short hair! Love the button closure - stays secure. And the microfiber material is really soft - much softer than the other towels I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have and have bought many hair turbans as I find them easier to use when I wash my hair.  Well, let me tell you.....of all the hair turbans I have bought and still have here, this is by far the best!  It is soft, plush and drys my hair faster and my hair usually takes forever to dry&lt;br /&gt;but not with this turban. I am so very happy I found this item and bought it!</li>
            <li> Much better than a regular towel. Not any more absorbent than a towel, but I like that it stays put on my head.</li>
            <li> Love these hair turbans. I own several. Now I don&#x27;t have to use a full size towel just for my hair. When I travel they take up less space than a full towel.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life, and why didn&#x27;t I think of buying this sooner?&lt;br /&gt;This product makes getting ready in the morning after washing my hair SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I had a bought a color besides white as it does get a little grungy looking after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it with the button in front and it works.</li>
            <li> This is big enough to contain all my hair, which is waist length; but, it is not highly absorbent. It fastens with a button, but over time (I&#x27;ve had it a month or so) the button hole stretches and the hold is not as tight. I have better luck with the original twistieturbie. It isn&#x27;t as big, but dries my hair more completely and is more secure.</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair so I only use microfiber towels on my hair, as not to frizz up my curls.  This toward doe its job - I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be better at drying my hair faster after trying the Turbie Twist, which did not deliver on that promise.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  While it is great for holding your hair back and not being cumbersome while getting dressed and doing my makeup, it does not absorb as much moisture as it or its competition advertises.  I have shoulder length, fine hair, so I was expecting it to do better - not so much.  I was contemplating buying the more expensive Aquis towels, but after being disappointed by 2 brands, I&#x27;m not going to bother.</li>
            <li> Nice size and quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect hair wrap towel! I bought this to replace one that I&#x27;ve had for years. They are great! Just wrap your hair in this turban, and getting the rest of yourself ready is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;This one was larger than I expected, but is not too big at all. It&#x27;s kept its fluffiness and ability to dry through several washes.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> The size, shape, material and practicality were optimal, best one in the market!&lt;br /&gt;(I returned to the store the common brand name one that was flimsy after seen these ones)&lt;br /&gt;I bought a couple extra for gifts and everybody liked them!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law bought me a hair turban several years ago.  I love it, but it&#x27;s seen better days.  I was considering making some replacements, but came upon the Eurow.  It&#x27;s just like my original, but microfiber instead of terry, which absorbs much better.  The quality is decent--not real heavy, but easy to twirl and button. It does a great job of drying and keeping hair out of my face while I apply my moisturizer and foundation.I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> would not buy this brand if i had to do it over again. too lose on my head. could easily fall off if i bend over</li>
            <li> With long hair, I need quick absorption. The microfiber works just as you&#x27;d expect, but the button closure is more trouble than convenient. I&#x27;m used to just pulling a towel off my hair, so I forget to unclasp the button.&lt;br /&gt;A loop made of thick thread is what they use to clasp one end of the turban to the button. Unfortunately, it easily twists around itself and makes it hard to unbutton. To save myself the annoyance, I put it at the bottom of my laundry list.</li>
            <li> good absorption. fits all hair lengths and types.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel because I would like something nice and light to hold my wet hair after a shower. Unfortunately this towel is horrible. The texture is bad, it doesn&#x27;t really absorb water as much as I would like. It also smells weird regardless of how many times I wash it. The button to hold it down is hard to hook. Overall I don&#x27;t really recommend this towel to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this turban. It soaks up the water well, it&#x27;s easy to button behind your head and the material is the kind that grips your hair so it really stays in place well. I have migraines and don&#x27;t want to comb my hair out right away after getting out of the shower. This is perfect! Keeps my hair up and out of the way without pulling at my hair.</li>
            <li> Poorly made and doesn&#x27;t absorb water well. Go with a different product. Mine went into the trash!</li>
            <li> The turban can have other looks, more like a towel wrap which I like...</li>
            <li> perfect to soak up water and make drying hair faster.  fits well, stays on.  White is somehow hard to find, glad i found these.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair turbans for most of my life. If I ever stay away from home, I try to remember to bring them with me. When I forget, I&#x27;m always sad to use a regular towel to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turban dries my hair somewhat. It also stays fairly dry so I don&#x27;t get my pillows, the couch, etc wet from my towel. The clasp is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen on a turban. There is a button and a large loop - they fit perfectly together, and it never comes undone. I always buy two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, and echo other reviewers that these make great gifts. That&#x27;s how I first found out about them!</li>
            <li> Works great. I have curly African-American hair (natural) and it&#x27;s very thick. The turban fits on my head and gets my hair to a level of dryness (10-15mins) where I can still put product in it and not have water dripping down my neck on my drive to work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps with frizz! This is a less expensive option to the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saves me room in my gym bag for a.m. workouts. I only need one full sized towel now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a darker color so I could leave it on while putting on makeup. White is gonna get super ucky after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to order one for home.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turban is perfect for drying my hair quickly without hassle and while keeping it out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can do my makeup, cook breakfast, etc without it being in my way.  Then just slip it off and it&#x27;s nearly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there I can hit it with a blow dryer or just style it and go.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a microfiber towel to use for my curly hair. Love the simplicity of this turban. It is so easy to put on and the button in the back ensures it stays put. I even take it with me when I travel...can&#x27;t shower with out it!</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting a hair turban for a while now. I saw this product had many positive ratings and reviews so I decided to try it. I am very satisfied. I have long and thick hair so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the turban would hold all of it in. It actually does hold all of my hair with no problem! It&#x27;s super easy to hook it so it stays in place. It&#x27;s also soft and absorbent so it will greatly reduce my blow drying time. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very soft, fluffy and extremely absorbent.  This is also considerably larger than most hair turbines I have used in the past, making it great for thick or long hair.  Washed up well too.</li>
            <li> I have 3b curly hair and I love this towel. I feel like dries my hair better, while not causing any breakage. Plus it is smaller and way more convenient than a normal bath towel. You can bend down without it falling out because of the button hole keeping the towel twisted.</li>
            <li> Great hair turban.  It is actually a little big and that is much better than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> Absorbs wet hair well but attracts static in the dryer. Nothing that a dryer sheet can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> Works great for longer hair. My hair dries quickly and it is very absorbent.</li>
            <li> Soft, absorbent, and reasonably priced!  I liked this product so much, I ordered a second one.  The button and loop system keeps the towel in place while I get dressed.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to keep wet hair out of the way while getting ready.  It does a fantastic job of drying hair, as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Turbie Twist towels.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like how the microfiber material feels on my wet ears/scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It is well made but just not for me.</li>
            <li> These hair turbans are wonderful....so much easier than using a towel that falls off all the time.  This has a button on the back so it stays put until you take it off.  I bought one for myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;It works just exactly as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too small as some I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would purchase another.</li>
            <li> Good hair towel.  I would have preferred a less &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; material or a higher grade of polyester.  By &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; i mean that if I grab it with my less-than-smooth hands, it basically grabs onto my rough skin like spider man.  A microfiber or shammy type of material that feels more smooth would have been preferred.  It works nonetheless.</li>
            <li> if you have thick hair this will not do for you. My hair is short thin and fine, it works well for me, but I sould never buy one for my daughter. Her hair is long thick and this Hair Turban would not dry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;the last one I bought was alot thicker and the towel type fabric was of better quality.</li>
            <li> Of all the incredibly varied things I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon over the past several months, this simple hair turban is my most used and absolute favorite! I plan on getting it as a stocking stuffer for quite a few friends this year.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is perfect for keeping wet hair off my neck and face while i do other things.  While it doesn&#x27;t work any miracles when it comes to &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; hair one can really only expect so much from a towel!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair so it&#x27;s always important for me to towel dry to cut down on drying/styling time and to prevent long term damage from over exposure to heating tools. The thing is that I just don&#x27;t like the weight of a normal towel on my head because it can get very annoying after a while. That&#x27;s why I decided to give this a shot. On my first use, I found that it was easy to use and it stayed in place... meaning it didn&#x27;t slowly creep to the back of my neck as time went on! And none of the water from my wet hair escaped and left any wet spots on my clothes. I kept it on for about an hour and a half, and when I took it off, my hair was still pretty wet! After this, I tried it a few more times in attempts to towel dry my hair. Each time, my hair hadn&#x27;t significantly dried. So now I just use it when I deep condition my hair or apply oil to it, and it keeps the product from getting everywhere. It&#x27;s easy to wash in the washer. Bottom line is if you are looking for this to dry your hair and your hair is long, or of medium length, you are better off using a towel. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> very soft and works great</li>
            <li> Abdolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li> works great, easy to use</li>
            <li> Plenty of room and great absorbancy for my larger sized head.  Go for it!  Highly recommend and I paid full price for mine.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really ideal for longer hair and has a strange smell that doesn&#x27;t go away. It has a strange smell and so I washed it without fabric softener and the smell is still there. Not sure why but &#x27;do not use fabric softener&#x27; is written on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wrap itself works ok. I might have a better experience with it if I had shorter or thinner hair. It doesn&#x27;t do much drying but it keeps my hair up and allows me to get dressed without having water everywhere. I typically use a normal towel to pat dry my hair before I finish getting ready.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Everyone should have one.</li>
            <li> This is of good quality material and works just as described. My daughter has figured out how to use this herself after she showers.</li>
            <li> Dries hair while you can do other things. Fabric is a little thin, but it&#x27;s nice that you can tie your hair up and get it out of the way.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of older turbins that are terry... not terribly fond of the &amp;#34;microfiber&amp;#34;... but was unable to find the terry cloth.  The microfiber washes well, but I don&#x27;t think it is as absorbent.  Just a personal choice, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This thing can&#x27;t hold hair in place, won&#x27;t dry your hair either (it doesn&#x27;t absorb much, if any, water). My hair&#x27;s still wet after wearing (and constantly fixing) it for 5hrs!</li>
