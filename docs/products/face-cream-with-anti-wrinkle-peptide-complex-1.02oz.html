            <li>Love this face cream.</li>

            <li>absolutely love these products  </li>
            <li>Have had many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist said (2days ago) that she is so pleased to see how much better my skin looks since 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li>I love how this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect add on to fight the dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Light and smooth, nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li>It is light on the skin and has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>is looking more smooth.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients, yummy flowery smell, and very pleasing texture that smooths over skin easily.</li>
            <li>Spoke with a rep from the company via email who confirmed that it contains 5% niacinamide.</li>
            <li>I have gotten away from using this product but reordered it as it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It has a fruity/floral smell and I am finally starting to get happy with my skin.  </li>
            <li>It not a miracle chemical filled lifting over scented cream...</li>
            <li>Originally I tried it because of the name, child of the 60&#x27;s I am.  </li>
            <li>I really seem to like this cream, makes my face feel so smooth....... :)</li>
            <li>I find it to be excellent for my skin type, I am dry to normal.  </li>
            <li>Great for use everyday as it sinks right in and leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
            <li>This is full of wonderful stuff, and my skin just sucks it up.  </li>
            <li>It is light and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, including the much touted Nerium (meh),</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and it smells great too, which is sometimes unusual for natural products.  </li>
            <li>Then fell in love with the way it makes my face feel so soft without the greasy or stickiness that I&#x27;ve experienced with other creams.</li>
            <li>Love this leaves the skin feeling very soft and no smell like some organic face creams.</li>
            <li>It has a very light soft scent</li>
            <li>I wish it was more emollient for mature skin like mine.</li>
            <li>not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>which is my biggest challenge right now.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use it on my neck and chest without a major reaction and it has made a difference.</li>
            <li>so I find this cream suitable for my skin type only as a night mousturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft with no oily or greasy sheen.  </li>
            <li>I use 1 pump/day and my first container has lasted 6 weeks with maybe one more week left to go in there.</li>
            <li>i really think it is working!</li>
            <li>this is not my first purchase.</li>
            <li>I wear it around my eyes too,  very hydrating!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth &amp; soft without over moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>First, I should mention that I&#x27;m 24</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the Mad Hippie Face Cream.</li>
            <li>You will not find another product with ingredients that are as pure.  </li>
            <li>Hippie is my new skin care company!!  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my face, makes me look a little bit younger</li>
            <li>Love my new Mad Hippie face cream and the eye cream is great as well.</li>
            <li>My face really likes this product.</li>
            <li>Used it all up, ready for another order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough for under make-up, even in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This cream is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It really bums me out that this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I mainly got this product for preventative purposes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this.  </li>
            <li>This has the Matrixyl 3000 ingredient, which seems to be effective, at least, for me.  </li>
            <li>Mad Hippie face cream is very good for people with normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use and I highly recommend this to young and older women both.</li>
            <li>I used the Mad Hippie C Serum first and was so happy with it that I decided to try this too.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something a little more affordable but still with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The size is small but a little goes a long way and because of the awesome ingredients</li>
            <li>I no longer have clogged pores and this cream works better in my opinion than the other leading brand facial creams.</li>
            <li>I use the Vict C serum first, let that set &amp; then 2 pumps of face lotion cover my entire face along with the neck area.  </li>
            <li>Its worth buying as long as you don&#x27;t mind replenishing it often!!</li>
            <li>I am a 62-year old woman with sensitive skin prone to eczema and dematitis.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for 30 days and my skin is so soft and my wrinkles have gone (I am 55)  </li>
            <li>I am over 50 and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like the fact they&#x27;re all natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I do not break out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>Not tacky, sinks right into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It works well for me--although my skin is &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; it is not dry, and the vast majority of products marketed for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin have so much oil in them that I end up with milia.  </li>
            <li>Feels light, but I have no more flakiness.  </li>
            <li>and I only have a few fine lines under my eyelids.</li>
            <li>and I would be willing to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Sinks in and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>My face was not dry or scratchy when I used it.  </li>
            <li>Mad Hippie does not contribute to these eczema flares, and my skin looks soft, relaxed, with a nice glow.  </li>

            <li> My skin is sensitive and I do not break out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to acne.  </li>
            <li> Not tacky, sinks right into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It works well for me--although my skin is &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; it is not dry, and the vast majority of products marketed for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin have so much oil in them that I end up with milia.  </li>
            <li> Feels light, but I have no more flakiness.  </li>
            <li> and I only have a few fine lines under my eyelids.</li>
            <li> and I would be willing to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Sinks in and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> My face was not dry or scratchy when I used it.  </li>
            <li> Mad Hippie does not contribute to these eczema flares, and my skin looks soft, relaxed, with a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> IMO it is not emollient enough for people with severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Using it, along with the Mad Hippie Exfoliating Serum, has pretty much put an end to my milia.  </li>
            <li> Another Mad Hippie product that I love.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as it keeps working for me!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.</li>
            <li> It lasted about 2 months for me but for the price I was hoping it would go a little further.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, started using this and their serum, but after a few days use my skin actually felt coarser and had worse texture than before.</li>
            <li> A single pump, or even slightly less than that, is all you need.  </li>
            <li> My eye lines are mainly due to allergies and eye swelling that happens while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Love all of the Mad Hippie products and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found Mad Hippie!  </li>
            <li> Thank you to Mad Hippie and to Amazon for such fast delivery.</li>
            <li> not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Lime Extract is highly irritating to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am going to be trying all their products when my other stuff runs out!</li>
            <li> I truly believe my skin is smoother and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> Waiting a little longer to see if it helps firm my skin</li>
            <li> While using the expensive cream, my face was clear and my skin glowed.  </li>
            <li> I switched from an expensive cream with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it also contains Steam Distilled Lime Extract as it&#x27;s last ingredient.</li>
            <li> not sure that I see a difference yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d order again because of the price.</li>
            <li> bummer : /</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for at least 2yrs now.  </li>
            <li> I discovered Mad Hippie&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum awhile ago, but was content with my current moisturizer at the time.  </li>
            <li> Recently I felt the urge to give Mad Hippie&#x27;s Face Cream a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> but definitely none that I have been happier using than Mad Hippie.</li>
            <li> I usually use Este Lauder products but tired of paying the price.</li>
            <li> but I think the bottle is very small.</li>
            <li> No looking up what they mean!  </li>
            <li> I started using the Mad HIppie Face Cream and my skin is broke out and just dull.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream along with Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum  and Cream Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have found that Mad Hippie works just as well.</li>
            <li> Mad Hippie face cream doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and the cream absorbs immediately.</li>
            <li> Also try the Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Mad Hippie Face Cream is not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a bad experience with this.</li>
            <li> I would not say it&#x27;s a bad face cream</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this brand for some time. It&#x27;s a great product line. One of the only ones recommended by my dermatologist while I was repairing my skin from accutane. It&#x27;s the perfect add on to fight the dry winter skin. Highly recommended. Try the vitamin c serum too!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturizers and this one is at the top!! I love the ingredients..</li>
            <li> I really seem to like this cream, makes my face feel so smooth....... :)</li>
            <li> My face really likes this product. It seems to penetrate and my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> Love it! Used it all up, ready for another order. No visible difference yet, but it felt great, no weird smell. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> One of the better face creams I have used.  Will order again.  Feels light, but I have no more flakiness.  It&#x27;s also light enough for under make-up, even in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream!  I am a 62-year old woman with sensitive skin prone to eczema and dematitis.  Many skin care products I have tried exacerbated this condition.  Mad Hippie does not contribute to these eczema flares, and my skin looks soft, relaxed, with a nice glow.  I was especially excited to see that the formulation contains niacinamide, which is a state-of-the-art skin care ingredient not found in very many skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 30 days and my skin is so soft and my wrinkles have gone (I am 55)  I have bought this for my daughers 27 and 30, they love it.</li>
            <li> Love this leaves the skin feeling very soft and no smell like some organic face creams.</li>
            <li> Love all of the Mad Hippie products and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found Mad Hippie!  I started out with the face cream and cream cleanser.  Totally worth it and loved the prices I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product itself is great, however the seller sold me a product that was a year expired.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the product appears not to be effective.</li>
            <li> Love my new Mad Hippie face cream and the eye cream is great as well. Looking to try the serum next!!</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long. I wish it was more emollient for mature skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I am over 60 and I get compliments on how beautiful my skin looks. I use this cream along with Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum  and Cream Cleanser. My favorite skin care products!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on pinterest and thought I would give it a try. I usually use Este Lauder products but tired of paying the price. I have found that Mad Hippie works just as well. It is light on the skin and has a very light fragrance. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll state here and now that I think that there is no skin cream that will stop you from getting wrinkles or make wrinkles you already have disappear. Face creams hydrate your skin, and that is all I expect. Mad Hippie face cream is very good for people with normal to oily skin. IMO it is not emollient enough for people with severely dry skin.  It works well for me--although my skin is &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; it is not dry, and the vast majority of products marketed for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin have so much oil in them that I end up with milia.  This has happened time and again.  Mad Hippie face cream doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and the cream absorbs immediately. Using it, along with the Mad Hippie Exfoliating Serum, has pretty much put an end to my milia.  I&#x27;m quite happy about that. My skin feels smooth and soft with no oily or greasy sheen.  I also like the fact that this is in a pump bottle--more hygienic.  However, I do wish that you got more product for your money.</li>
            <li> Killer list of ingredients. Sinks in and moisturizes really well. Spoke with a rep from the company via email who confirmed that it contains 5% niacinamide. I use 1 pump/day and my first container has lasted 6 weeks with maybe one more week left to go in there.</li>
            <li> nice cream but could not tell a difference in my face</li>
            <li> Lovely product, smells beautiful, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice moisturizer and I liked how it made my skin feel but I think the bottle is very small. It lasted about 2 months for me but for the price I was hoping it would go a little further. I also feel like there might have been leftover product stuck in the container but you cant get into it. Its worth buying as long as you don&#x27;t mind replenishing it often!!</li>
            <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s very hydrating and it smells great too, which is sometimes unusual for natural products.  I recommend the vitamin C serum as well</li>
            <li> I have gotten away from using this product but reordered it as it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized. I have never had a bad experience with this. I had used this for about a year and tried something else only to return to using it. It is organic and I started using it because a makeup artist used it on me and she only used organic products, she recommended it to me. I recommend it too.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, started using this and their serum, but after a few days use my skin actually felt coarser and had worse texture than before.</li>
            <li> I discovered Mad Hippie&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum awhile ago, but was content with my current moisturizer at the time.  Recently I felt the urge to give Mad Hippie&#x27;s Face Cream a try, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It moisturizes without causing breakout and it&#x27;s loaded with great ingredients.  A single pump, or even slightly less than that, is all you need.  I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the Mad Hippie Face Cream. i really think it is working! I feel like in combination with the Vitamin C and Exfoliating my face is looking more smooth. I also feel like the Cream helps reduce puffiness around my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> Another Mad Hippie product that I love.  Feels great on my face, makes me look a little bit younger but then I just started using it.  Saw this in a health food store for almost 2 times as much.&lt;br /&gt;Mad Hippie is my new skin care company!!  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Lover these products!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I love the smell. It has a fruity/floral smell and I am finally starting to get happy with my skin.  Also try the Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!  Originally I tried it because of the name, child of the 60&#x27;s I am.  Then fell in love with the way it makes my face feel so soft without the greasy or stickiness that I&#x27;ve experienced with other creams.</li>
            <li> This product works well as a moisturizer.  Not tacky, sinks right into your skin.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I Love this! I am over 50 and have sensitive skin. This is the only cream (consistency of a lotion) that I can use. It is light and feels fresh. And, my skin looks great. It not a miracle chemical filled lifting over scented cream...it&#x27;s a simple lotion that feels great and makes my skin happy. I highly recommended it. A little pricey, but worth it. And, on Amazon, sometimes I can get it on sale. A win-win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as it keeps working for me!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  You will not find another product with ingredients that are as pure.  No looking up what they mean!  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> These products are awesome!  I like the fact they&#x27;re all natural. I no longer have clogged pores and this cream works better in my opinion than the other leading brand facial creams. Will continue to use and I highly recommend this to young and older women both. Thank you !</li>
            <li> Love this face cream. Light and smooth, nice fragrance too.</li>
            <li> This is full of wonderful stuff, and my skin just sucks it up.  It smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it because it has a great deal of proven anti-aging ingredients in it for a great price. Unfortunately it also contains Steam Distilled Lime Extract as it&#x27;s last ingredient. Lime Extract is highly irritating to anyone with sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t use the lotion on my face without breaking out. I am able to use it on my neck and chest without a major reaction and it has made a difference. It&#x27;s a light, very nice feeling lotion but I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they discontinue the Lime Extract, which I believe is nothing more than a fragrance additive.</li>
            <li> This cream is reasonably priced.  My skin is sensitive and I do not break out. It is not greasy at all.  I have only been using for about&lt;br /&gt;a week and not sure that I see a difference yet but I will continue to use it.  I like that it has peptides in it and that is suppose to be the key&lt;br /&gt;ingredient to help with anti aging.  The bottle has a nice pump on it and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this.  It makes my skin look and feel silky beautiful.  Waiting a little longer to see if it helps firm my skin which is my biggest challenge right now.  Overall, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...this is not my first purchase. And the eye cream does wonders, too.</li>
            <li> absolutely love these products  Have had many compliments on my skin.  My dermatologist said (2days ago) that she is so pleased to see how much better my skin looks since 3 months ago.  Thank you to Mad Hippie and to Amazon for such fast delivery. MERRY CHRISTMAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EL</li>
            <li> I truly believe my skin is smoother and less wrinkled.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on anti-wrinkle creams, lotions, etc.  This has the Matrixyl 3000 ingredient, which seems to be effective, at least, for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many products, including the much touted Nerium (meh), but definitely none that I have been happier using than Mad Hippie.</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy. It absorbs quickly, making it great for use under makeup. I don&#x27;t love how expensive this is for the amount you get. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d order again because of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It contains everything I was looking for such as peptides and antioxidants.  Great for use everyday as it sinks right in and leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so I find this cream suitable for my skin type only as a night mousturizer. Even though it isn&#x27;t greasy it does leave a bit of shine.. I prefer a day cream with spf and matte effect.  It has a wonderful smell, light texture and absorbs nicely and quickly. I wear it around my eyes too,  very hydrating!  The size is small but a little goes a long way and because of the awesome ingredients I think it is worth the price.  Keep it in the fridge for a fresher sensation!</li>
            <li> Mad Hippie Face Cream is not oily or greasy.  My face was not dry or scratchy when I used it.  However, my skin just does not seem to like it.  I switched from an expensive cream with natural ingredients.  I was looking for something a little more affordable but still with natural ingredients.  I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to acne.  While using the expensive cream, my face was clear and my skin glowed.  I have never used that term before but it did and I looked amazing.  I started using the Mad HIppie Face Cream and my skin is broke out and just dull.  It really bums me out that this product did not work for me. I would not say it&#x27;s a bad face cream and I would be willing to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> Love the product, you feel like your doing something good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Would ot hold up to a NYC winter. Only a summer moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked this.  I am going to be trying all their products when my other stuff runs out!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  It smells great and is not greasy.  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have just delved into the peptides.  So far so good!  I&#x27;m going to try the serum next.</li>
            <li> had a small dermalogical reaction/rash after the first use, when used in combination with the cream cleanser I had no reaction, however the process left my face feeling greasy and &amp;#34;not clean&amp;#34; I will probably not order this product again</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for at least 2yrs now.  I find it to be excellent for my skin type, I am dry to normal.  I use the Vict C serum first, let that set &amp; then 2 pumps of face lotion cover my entire face along with the neck area.  It leaves my face smooth &amp; soft without over moisturizing.  It has a very light soft scent, that does not interfere with performance</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it but it is braking me out.  I tried three times to use it, and weaning out what I thought the brake outs were from, and it is defiantly the cream.  bummer : / not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> First, I should mention that I&#x27;m 24 and I only have a few fine lines under my eyelids. My eye lines are mainly due to allergies and eye swelling that happens while I sleep. Therefore, it might not be possible to correct with a cream anyway. I mainly got this product for preventative purposes. I used the Mad Hippie C Serum first and was so happy with it that I decided to try this too.  I like this even more than the serum!  Good ingredients, yummy flowery smell, and very pleasing texture that smooths over skin easily. The packaging design is so cute too!  My only wish is that they would have it in a larger container.</li>
