            <li>Great Christmas gift for the wife.  </li>

            <li>You cant beat a great, rechargeable razor for this price.</li>
            <li>It did a great job on armpits and the bikini area.</li>
            <li>GREAT deal.</li>
            <li>Three shaving heads are great for a closer shave and the blade for longer hair works well too.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job on legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>Worked great, until three months after purchase.  </li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for a good product.  </li>
            <li>The price is astounding, too!</li>

            <li>The ladies rechargeable is good for when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>This shaver is good for its price.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed at how smooth my arms and bikini area got.  </li>
            <li>So nice to make someone happy.  </li>
            <li>- I have good luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>Awesome buy and totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Very good, deliver a smooth silky skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy and consumer reports rates it in their top electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my old razor for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, but after reading 35+ five star reviews, I guess I was expecting something perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 2 years and love it!  </li>
            <li>After dropping it once too many times in the shower I just ordered another!</li>
            <li>-- I wanted to make sure I liked it before reviewing!    </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She liked it at first and especially liked the way it looked, the color, etc.</li>
            <li>It is so easy for me to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>For my bikini line I use it in the shower after exfoliating and with plenty of shaving cream, and it works splendidly, whereas with a traditional razor I suffered incredible irritation and formidable ingrown hairs!    </li>
            <li>It holds a charge nicely</li>
            <li>Pop-up trimmer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Nice that it&#x27;s wet/dry and rechargeable.</li>
            <li>It also provides a very nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It works quite good, but I have more skin irritations than compared to my Braun shaver I am using for many years now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color :]  </li>
            <li>This razor is nicely priced and I love it.  </li>
            <li>--I was able to get as close a shave with it as a I able to get with a bade and without any irritation, which feels so absolutely nice.</li>
            <li>However, I find that the best results are when I hold it more directly against the skin rather than an angle that I don&#x27;t have any irritation, redness or razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor when I had foot surgery as it wasn&#x27;t very easy to shave in the shower any more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a camcorder, no? :))</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very happy with this and would recommend to anyone (especially for the price!)</li>
            <li>My mother and I bought a rechargeable shaver years ago, but neither of us were satisfied with it</li>
            <li>All-in-all I am incredibly satisfied.</li>
            <li>This electric razor comes in the shower with me and does it perfectly AND leaves NO red bumps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this shaver-</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the wet/dry ability.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I thought, if I gave it time, it would get better, but it never did.  </li>
            <li>The shaver tends to &#x27;chew&#x27; up my skin and it takes many passes in order to cut the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry versatility.</li>
            <li>There is a tendency to pull every once in a while, but that can be managed by repeated use and making sure the blades are maintained.  </li>
            <li>It looked better than I imagined it looking.</li>
            <li>This shaver is SO much better than the one it replaced.</li>
            <li>The foils  are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>In an effort to make shaving more appealing, I decided to use this instead of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The result of the shaving is ok.</li>
            <li>Love the Compact space-saving charger.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>so perhaps I&#x27;m a bit biased that ANYTHING would be better than what I had,</li>
            <li>Esecially for $21 and free shipping!</li>
            <li>(you get the picture), I love this one.  </li>
            <li>Love that this is a wet/dry shaver; I had checked the various reviews before choosing to purchase; I even checked Consumer Reports which gave Panasonic the best marks for ladies electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>I have a razor for in-shower, but how many times have I missed a section or more often</li>
            <li>This one is a bit better</li>
            <li>but it was $40 or more</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave.   </li>
            <li>of course the first time she used she told my wife she loved it &amp;</li>
            <li>With this razor it is easy - cordless - to shave with legs supported by an ottoman with a towel on top.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled to find it, never a disappointment.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of its good reviews and I was totally happy with it for less than a year.  </li>
            <li>And to recharge it is super easy!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first electric one I&#x27;ve had, but I love it!</li>
            <li>this makes it easy</li>
            <li>The Panasonic does do well in the water, and is easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0002D5Y60 Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver]]My wife loves this shaver,says that it is much better than a blade razor,just as close a shave and no nicks,easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>She likes it, and it is easy for her to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>It is noisy because the strong power of the blades.</li>
            <li>Strong and durable.</li>
            <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t not pay very much.</li>
            <li>the two rotating heads are pretty amazing how they move along the skin (like over your knees).  </li>
            <li>(they were interested and some wanted to get one because of how much I liked it)</li>
            <li>Product is \\&quot;as described\\&quot; and was received promptly in good, new condition.</li>
            <li>I use the shaver on my arms and my legs and it works fine.</li>
            <li>This razor works okay for a quick shave, but it will not give a close shave.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, and in phenomenal shape.</li>
            <li>I can do this while watching tv and always feel comfortable now.    </li>
            <li>It is really a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous razor until the head rusted and until it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>They both gave a great shave, but if you are looking for something to last longer than a year, I would probably recommend a Remington.</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice white bag which I probably will never use, but a nice touch nevertheless.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver and was very pleased to find this one online and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>The bikini line feature is very useful as well.</li>
            <li>Also love that it has a charger on the plug, very smart idea.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, cleans easily.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I thought this was going to be a good reliable product and much better than waxing(something</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth shave and the battery holds a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>steal it when she left, so it was shared by them two for a good 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>find it works best slowly, in the shower, with shaving cream, on your legs and armpits.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my legs and it works for quick jobs however does not get close as a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned up quick with a splash of running water.   </li>
            <li>I was very impressed by this shaver and would definitely purchase the same one again.</li>
            <li>but suffice to say that I am very satisfied with this, and can&#x27;t imagine going back to waxing or shaving with razors.  </li>
            <li>From the very first time I used this razor, it pulled the hair out (with both legs &amp; bikini line).</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the package the razor is hypo allergenic for sensitive skin, which is a total plus and there was a sticker on the box saying that it was a Consumers Digest Best Buy, and after using it I can definitely see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a charger that plugs into the wall and the razor sits on top of that.</li>
            <li>After a year and having to recharge so many times, it pretty much lost its mojo.</li>
            <li>But I finally wised up when I saw the new model of just what I had used before and at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and quick, I can live with this!</li>
            <li>I liked this...didn&#x27;t live up to its reviews, but still it was a decent shaver...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with her using a regular razor, so I gave this one a try, as it seemed to be one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>According to the booklet, 1 charge should last you all week, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I have owner a few electric shavers and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I thought that paying about 35 would make it worth my time and money.</li>
            <li>It works great for quick dry touch ups and with shaving creme for a lasting smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I just threw it away, right before writing this review, after coming across it in a drawer.</li>
            <li>I have been very aggravated with this shaver, and I hope the next one I purchase will be better!</li>
            <li>I love this razor because it&#x27;s great for a quick clip dry in just a few areas or in the shower with my legs all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery life is good, you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li>This shaver is very durable, nice looking and built well overall.</li>
            <li>It is also very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t get into the details of my personal hygiene here  :)  </li>
            <li>I tried using it several times (used it in the shower, too), tried cleaning it, making sure the battery was charged...</li>
            <li>; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now,Oct 2012, this was stolen by my daughter on her way to collage</li>
            <li>I no longer have to make sure I have extra cartirdges on hand.</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic shaver.</li>
            <li>It takes almost 20 minutes to shave my legs with this shaver because I have to go over the same spots MANY times.  </li>
            <li>I guess everone has different skin types etc, so it may work better with others.     </li>
            <li>I had already shaved my legs and arms most of the way yesterday with my regular razor, then found the spots I&#x27;d missed on the backs of my legs and my arms and did them today.  </li>
            <li>The shave under the arms or legs is anything but close and a regular razor works 100% better.</li>
            <li>Read all the other reviews before purchasing and it is everything they said and more!  </li>
            <li>Nevetheless the shave is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(the bottom is low, the razor is on top).</li>
            <li>A bit rough feeling but handy.</li>
            <li>I charged it for about 3-4 hours before using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and my wife is charging it for her first use...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The drawback to this razor, to me, is that my 25 year old dry Remington does just as good a job as this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I have an old electric Remington shaver (corded, can&#x27;t use in water) and thought it would be nice to upgrade to one that would theoretically get a closer shave and could be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Not bumps no irritation, shave was as close as my other razor, hair grew back slower, worked great for bikini/armpit area.</li>
            <li>The battery last surprisingly long, very easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>It works ok dry, but a bit of water makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>I have osteo-arthritis and cannot really bend over to shave my legs the way I used to.</li>
            <li>Haha.    </li>
            <li>but it is really convenient.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Also it is a very price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a shame because it is very well made and it seems like the company put alot of effort into the body of the shaver</li>
            <li>As I said my wife is very satis fied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to dump this electric shaver and go back to the cheap razors.  </li>
            <li>It is compact, which maKeS it very portable for my business trips.</li>
            <li>The charger is very compact.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>this is really nothing...</li>
            <li>And I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>if you know going into it an electric razor will not leave your legs as smooth as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Although the feel of this in the hand is nice, I have gotten several \\&quot;razor burns\\&quot; when trying to get a close enough shave.  </li>
            <li>I was only willing to purchase this for quick shave and go</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shaver, based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I always scrub my arms and legs in the shower and shave right afterward while the skin and hair is still soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with a rechargeable (other one was battery operated).  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other electric shaver that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>B001E6SWKO Venus Embrace Value Pack]], which is practically useless, and [[ASIN:B001ET6WHG Schick Intuition Plus All-In-One Cartridges for Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 3 cartridges (Pack of 2)]], which is great but needs very frequent refills (which add up).</li>
            <li>In short, this razor does what I couldn&#x27;t do with my Venus razor -- cleanly shaves my armpits.  </li>
            <li>The only problem with this shaver is that, you have to shave 2-3 time till clean.</li>
            <li>She says the cheap big box store one she had before this one worked much better (meaning it shaved closer with less work).</li>
            <li>It is light weight, holds a charge for a long time and, while I have not tried it, can be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Overall, not bad if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li>I haveb tried several electric razors over the years and was never quite satisfied with the result, (they all left stubble)   </li>
            <li>I have had much more expensive shavers but none have done a better job.</li>
            <li>I use the old razor occasionally when I want my legs completely smooth and to do around the ankles.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to all women and the ease of use -</li>
            <li>It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do, but maybe I had high standards.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Close, clean &amp; smooth shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my bickini area, but sadly was lacking on my legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to using Remington(that one lasted five years before the blades dulled too much to be useful).</li>
            <li>Definitely your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>ago,&lt;br /&gt;she hasnt asked my wife for a new one</li>
            <li>I live in a college dorm</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a new razor in over 11 years, umm that includes blades...</li>
            <li>I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Just about might as well buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I sent it in to Panasonic and they replaced it with a new one.</li>
            <li>The new one has worked for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li>Razors and shavers are different and using just a touch of a different angle can make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think I will be very pleased if this device lasts past the 1 year mark.</li>
            <li>Does it shave my legs as close as a traditional razor -- not quite, but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if you would be able to get a close shave from any electric razor.</li>
            <li>I had bought it for my daughter back in 2007, when she first started shaving her legs.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with skin that is sensitive to razor shaving all my life!  </li>
            <li>It needs to be charged for 8 hours prior to the first use.</li>
            <li>I found when I first started with an electric shaver than I held it the same as my razor.  </li>
            <li>I ended up going back to my nine year old Remington shaver after this shaver died, because it gave a better shave than my other Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s performance is pretty lousy though, honestly.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and gets all the visible stubble although there is still a little roughness detectable by your hand.</li>
            <li>The trimmer which pushes up often snags my hair, especially along the bikini line, which is where it is meant to help mostly, and I often end up with a little blood, probably from the snag pulling at my hair</li>
            <li>Well, I come to find out after 5 years that it costs a little more than double.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t really cut or scratch, since the actual razor is inside the shaving apparatus (which is also why the shave isn&#x27;t that close).</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The ease of use makes it much easier to use on a daily basis.   </li>
            <li>I also have really sensitive legs that always leave me with razor</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a bit loud to my liking, it did</li>
            <li>The old adage \\&quot;You get what you pay</li>
            <li>Much quicker than a regular razor too...</li>
            <li>I looked at some more expensive razors thinking more expensive is better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 yr old niece.  </li>
            <li>It has a nifty charge pack that you simply plug into the shaver, and then plug the whole thing into an outlet.</li>
            <li>I DID manage to cram both in there, but it doesn&#x27;t close up completely.</li>
            <li>A bit loud.</li>
            <li>My wife claims it actual shaving preformance as poor to fair.</li>
            <li>I have tried shaving more frequently and also waiting a few extra days to see if hair length affects ability to function properly.  </li>
            <li>Gets all the hair, leaves skin smooth, can be used dry or wet, and its portable.</li>
            <li>The other day I decided to purchase this razor out of pure desperation since where I live</li>
            <li>when 5 minute showers would do - shaving in the shower takes way too long and uses up way too much water and electricity.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much those cost, but in the long run it&#x27;s gotta be cheaper than buying razor blades--those things are just too</li>
            <li>As I said it takes a little longer, because you have to go back and forth over an area to get it tolerably smooth.   </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t that be fun to watch a fat, stiff old lady remove hair from her lower extremities?!?</li>
            <li>It takes a little more time than a razor, but it&#x27;s much less messy and you can do it comfortably sitting on your bed, rather than trying to balance on one leg in the shower.</li>
            <li>(the mirror is out just far enough that the razor won&#x27;t clear) - won&#x27;t work on horizontal outlets either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cost the same as 2 refill packs for my old razor; never again!</li>
            <li>In fact, I went back to using my old Remington shaver, because it actually gave me a closer shave than the brand new Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a Panasonic (that just died after 15 years!), so being familiar with this brand I wasn&#x27;t hesitant at all to re-purchase a similar shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver, it has a long battery life, and the pop up feature takes care of the hard to shave parts.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, so I do shave in the shower when going somewhere fancy or remotely non-casual.</li>
            <li>Back to the old fashioned Razor for me.</li>
            <li>You need to be bit careful with the trimmer, it can chew up your skin if run over your skin very rapidly.</li>
            <li>so the two shavers combined really compliment each other.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m worried it will break, but what really irks me is that this set up basically blocks the other outlet too</li>
            <li>This shaver is very gentle on skin and leaves little irritation.</li>
            <li>In general I prefer a wet shaver and therefore I mainly use this razor for the bikini area, only.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to loud the charger dosn&#x27;t have a cord and it runs a long time between charging.</li>
            <li>The on and off switch was a bit stiff at first, but now it turns on and off with ease.</li>
            <li>Since shaving takes so long, I can only get one complete shave from the charged battery.  </li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy and consumer reports rates it in their top electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my old razor for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, but after reading 35+ five star reviews, I guess I was expecting something perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 2 years and love it!  </li>
            <li> After dropping it once too many times in the shower I just ordered another!</li>
            <li> -- I wanted to make sure I liked it before reviewing!    </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She liked it at first and especially liked the way it looked, the color, etc.</li>
            <li> It is so easy for me to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> For my bikini line I use it in the shower after exfoliating and with plenty of shaving cream, and it works splendidly, whereas with a traditional razor I suffered incredible irritation and formidable ingrown hairs!    </li>
            <li> It holds a charge nicely</li>
            <li> Pop-up trimmer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s wet/dry and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> It also provides a very nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It works quite good, but I have more skin irritations than compared to my Braun shaver I am using for many years now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice color :]  </li>
            <li> This razor is nicely priced and I love it.  </li>
            <li> --I was able to get as close a shave with it as a I able to get with a bade and without any irritation, which feels so absolutely nice.</li>
            <li> However, I find that the best results are when I hold it more directly against the skin rather than an angle that I don&#x27;t have any irritation, redness or razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor when I had foot surgery as it wasn&#x27;t very easy to shave in the shower any more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a camcorder, no? :))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy with this and would recommend to anyone (especially for the price!)</li>
            <li> My mother and I bought a rechargeable shaver years ago, but neither of us were satisfied with it</li>
            <li> All-in-all I am incredibly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This electric razor comes in the shower with me and does it perfectly AND leaves NO red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this shaver-</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the wet/dry ability.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver and I love it.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I thought, if I gave it time, it would get better, but it never did.  </li>
            <li> The shaver tends to &#x27;chew&#x27; up my skin and it takes many passes in order to cut the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry versatility.</li>
            <li> There is a tendency to pull every once in a while, but that can be managed by repeated use and making sure the blades are maintained.  </li>
            <li> It looked better than I imagined it looking.</li>
            <li> This shaver is SO much better than the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> The foils  are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> In an effort to make shaving more appealing, I decided to use this instead of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The result of the shaving is ok.</li>
            <li> Love the Compact space-saving charger.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> so perhaps I&#x27;m a bit biased that ANYTHING would be better than what I had,</li>
            <li> Esecially for $21 and free shipping!</li>
            <li> (you get the picture), I love this one.  </li>
            <li> Love that this is a wet/dry shaver; I had checked the various reviews before choosing to purchase; I even checked Consumer Reports which gave Panasonic the best marks for ladies electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I have a razor for in-shower, but how many times have I missed a section or more often</li>
            <li> This one is a bit better</li>
            <li> but it was $40 or more</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave.   </li>
            <li> of course the first time she used she told my wife she loved it &amp;</li>
            <li> With this razor it is easy - cordless - to shave with legs supported by an ottoman with a towel on top.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled to find it, never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of its good reviews and I was totally happy with it for less than a year.  </li>
            <li> And to recharge it is super easy!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first electric one I&#x27;ve had, but I love it!</li>
            <li> this makes it easy</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does do well in the water, and is easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002D5Y60 Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver]]My wife loves this shaver,says that it is much better than a blade razor,just as close a shave and no nicks,easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> She likes it, and it is easy for her to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> It is noisy because the strong power of the blades.</li>
            <li> Strong and durable.</li>
            <li> and I honestly didn&#x27;t not pay very much.</li>
            <li> the two rotating heads are pretty amazing how they move along the skin (like over your knees).  </li>
            <li> (they were interested and some wanted to get one because of how much I liked it)</li>
            <li> Product is \\&quot;as described\\&quot; and was received promptly in good, new condition.</li>
            <li> I use the shaver on my arms and my legs and it works fine.</li>
            <li> This razor works okay for a quick shave, but it will not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and in phenomenal shape.</li>
            <li> I can do this while watching tv and always feel comfortable now.    </li>
            <li> It is really a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous razor until the head rusted and until it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> They both gave a great shave, but if you are looking for something to last longer than a year, I would probably recommend a Remington.</li>
            <li> It is fairly easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a nice white bag which I probably will never use, but a nice touch nevertheless.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and was very pleased to find this one online and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> The bikini line feature is very useful as well.</li>
            <li> Also love that it has a charger on the plug, very smart idea.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I thought this was going to be a good reliable product and much better than waxing(something</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave and the battery holds a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> steal it when she left, so it was shared by them two for a good 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> find it works best slowly, in the shower, with shaving cream, on your legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs and it works for quick jobs however does not get close as a razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned up quick with a splash of running water.   </li>
            <li> I was very impressed by this shaver and would definitely purchase the same one again.</li>
            <li> but suffice to say that I am very satisfied with this, and can&#x27;t imagine going back to waxing or shaving with razors.  </li>
            <li> From the very first time I used this razor, it pulled the hair out (with both legs &amp; bikini line).</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the package the razor is hypo allergenic for sensitive skin, which is a total plus and there was a sticker on the box saying that it was a Consumers Digest Best Buy, and after using it I can definitely see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a charger that plugs into the wall and the razor sits on top of that.</li>
            <li> After a year and having to recharge so many times, it pretty much lost its mojo.</li>
            <li> But I finally wised up when I saw the new model of just what I had used before and at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and quick, I can live with this!</li>
            <li> I liked this...didn&#x27;t live up to its reviews, but still it was a decent shaver...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with her using a regular razor, so I gave this one a try, as it seemed to be one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to the booklet, 1 charge should last you all week, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have owner a few electric shavers and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I thought that paying about 35 would make it worth my time and money.</li>
            <li> It works great for quick dry touch ups and with shaving creme for a lasting smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I just threw it away, right before writing this review, after coming across it in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I have been very aggravated with this shaver, and I hope the next one I purchase will be better!</li>
            <li> I love this razor because it&#x27;s great for a quick clip dry in just a few areas or in the shower with my legs all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery life is good, you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> This shaver is very durable, nice looking and built well overall.</li>
            <li> It is also very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get into the details of my personal hygiene here  :)  </li>
            <li> I tried using it several times (used it in the shower, too), tried cleaning it, making sure the battery was charged...</li>
            <li> ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now,Oct 2012, this was stolen by my daughter on her way to collage</li>
            <li> I no longer have to make sure I have extra cartirdges on hand.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic shaver.</li>
            <li> It takes almost 20 minutes to shave my legs with this shaver because I have to go over the same spots MANY times.  </li>
            <li> I guess everone has different skin types etc, so it may work better with others.     </li>
            <li> I had already shaved my legs and arms most of the way yesterday with my regular razor, then found the spots I&#x27;d missed on the backs of my legs and my arms and did them today.  </li>
            <li> The shave under the arms or legs is anything but close and a regular razor works 100% better.</li>
            <li> Read all the other reviews before purchasing and it is everything they said and more!  </li>
            <li> Nevetheless the shave is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> (the bottom is low, the razor is on top).</li>
            <li> A bit rough feeling but handy.</li>
            <li> I charged it for about 3-4 hours before using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> and my wife is charging it for her first use...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The drawback to this razor, to me, is that my 25 year old dry Remington does just as good a job as this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I have an old electric Remington shaver (corded, can&#x27;t use in water) and thought it would be nice to upgrade to one that would theoretically get a closer shave and could be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Not bumps no irritation, shave was as close as my other razor, hair grew back slower, worked great for bikini/armpit area.</li>
            <li> The battery last surprisingly long, very easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> It works ok dry, but a bit of water makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I have osteo-arthritis and cannot really bend over to shave my legs the way I used to.</li>
            <li> Haha.    </li>
            <li> but it is really convenient.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Also it is a very price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a shame because it is very well made and it seems like the company put alot of effort into the body of the shaver</li>
            <li> As I said my wife is very satis fied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to dump this electric shaver and go back to the cheap razors.  </li>
            <li> It is compact, which maKeS it very portable for my business trips.</li>
            <li> The charger is very compact.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> this is really nothing...</li>
            <li> And I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> if you know going into it an electric razor will not leave your legs as smooth as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Although the feel of this in the hand is nice, I have gotten several \\&quot;razor burns\\&quot; when trying to get a close enough shave.  </li>
            <li> I was only willing to purchase this for quick shave and go</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver, based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I always scrub my arms and legs in the shower and shave right afterward while the skin and hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went with a rechargeable (other one was battery operated).  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other electric shaver that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> B001E6SWKO Venus Embrace Value Pack]], which is practically useless, and [[ASIN:B001ET6WHG Schick Intuition Plus All-In-One Cartridges for Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 3 cartridges (Pack of 2)]], which is great but needs very frequent refills (which add up).</li>
            <li> In short, this razor does what I couldn&#x27;t do with my Venus razor -- cleanly shaves my armpits.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with this shaver is that, you have to shave 2-3 time till clean.</li>
            <li> She says the cheap big box store one she had before this one worked much better (meaning it shaved closer with less work).</li>
            <li> It is light weight, holds a charge for a long time and, while I have not tried it, can be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not bad if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li> I haveb tried several electric razors over the years and was never quite satisfied with the result, (they all left stubble)   </li>
            <li> I have had much more expensive shavers but none have done a better job.</li>
            <li> I use the old razor occasionally when I want my legs completely smooth and to do around the ankles.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to all women and the ease of use -</li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do, but maybe I had high standards.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Close, clean &amp; smooth shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my bickini area, but sadly was lacking on my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to using Remington(that one lasted five years before the blades dulled too much to be useful).</li>
            <li> Definitely your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> ago,&lt;br /&gt;she hasnt asked my wife for a new one</li>
            <li> I live in a college dorm</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new razor in over 11 years, umm that includes blades...</li>
            <li> I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Just about might as well buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I sent it in to Panasonic and they replaced it with a new one.</li>
            <li> The new one has worked for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li> Razors and shavers are different and using just a touch of a different angle can make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think I will be very pleased if this device lasts past the 1 year mark.</li>
            <li> Does it shave my legs as close as a traditional razor -- not quite, but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if you would be able to get a close shave from any electric razor.</li>
            <li> I had bought it for my daughter back in 2007, when she first started shaving her legs.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with skin that is sensitive to razor shaving all my life!  </li>
            <li> It needs to be charged for 8 hours prior to the first use.</li>
            <li> I found when I first started with an electric shaver than I held it the same as my razor.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going back to my nine year old Remington shaver after this shaver died, because it gave a better shave than my other Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s performance is pretty lousy though, honestly.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and gets all the visible stubble although there is still a little roughness detectable by your hand.</li>
            <li> The trimmer which pushes up often snags my hair, especially along the bikini line, which is where it is meant to help mostly, and I often end up with a little blood, probably from the snag pulling at my hair</li>
            <li> Well, I come to find out after 5 years that it costs a little more than double.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t really cut or scratch, since the actual razor is inside the shaving apparatus (which is also why the shave isn&#x27;t that close).</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The ease of use makes it much easier to use on a daily basis.   </li>
            <li> I also have really sensitive legs that always leave me with razor</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit loud to my liking, it did</li>
            <li> The old adage \\&quot;You get what you pay</li>
            <li> Much quicker than a regular razor too...</li>
            <li> I looked at some more expensive razors thinking more expensive is better.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 yr old niece.  </li>
            <li> It has a nifty charge pack that you simply plug into the shaver, and then plug the whole thing into an outlet.</li>
            <li> I DID manage to cram both in there, but it doesn&#x27;t close up completely.</li>
            <li> A bit loud.</li>
            <li> My wife claims it actual shaving preformance as poor to fair.</li>
            <li> I have tried shaving more frequently and also waiting a few extra days to see if hair length affects ability to function properly.  </li>
            <li> Gets all the hair, leaves skin smooth, can be used dry or wet, and its portable.</li>
            <li> The other day I decided to purchase this razor out of pure desperation since where I live</li>
            <li> when 5 minute showers would do - shaving in the shower takes way too long and uses up way too much water and electricity.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much those cost, but in the long run it&#x27;s gotta be cheaper than buying razor blades--those things are just too</li>
            <li> As I said it takes a little longer, because you have to go back and forth over an area to get it tolerably smooth.   </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t that be fun to watch a fat, stiff old lady remove hair from her lower extremities?!?</li>
            <li> It takes a little more time than a razor, but it&#x27;s much less messy and you can do it comfortably sitting on your bed, rather than trying to balance on one leg in the shower.</li>
            <li> (the mirror is out just far enough that the razor won&#x27;t clear) - won&#x27;t work on horizontal outlets either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cost the same as 2 refill packs for my old razor; never again!</li>
            <li> In fact, I went back to using my old Remington shaver, because it actually gave me a closer shave than the brand new Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic (that just died after 15 years!), so being familiar with this brand I wasn&#x27;t hesitant at all to re-purchase a similar shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver, it has a long battery life, and the pop up feature takes care of the hard to shave parts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, so I do shave in the shower when going somewhere fancy or remotely non-casual.</li>
            <li> Back to the old fashioned Razor for me.</li>
            <li> You need to be bit careful with the trimmer, it can chew up your skin if run over your skin very rapidly.</li>
            <li> so the two shavers combined really compliment each other.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m worried it will break, but what really irks me is that this set up basically blocks the other outlet too</li>
            <li> This shaver is very gentle on skin and leaves little irritation.</li>
            <li> In general I prefer a wet shaver and therefore I mainly use this razor for the bikini area, only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to loud the charger dosn&#x27;t have a cord and it runs a long time between charging.</li>
            <li> The on and off switch was a bit stiff at first, but now it turns on and off with ease.</li>
            <li> Since shaving takes so long, I can only get one complete shave from the charged battery.  </li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to purchase as it far exceeds the more expensive shavers on the market!</li>
            <li> If I wait until I&#x27;m all dry, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and leaves my skin dry and irritated.     </li>
            <li> It took a long time and the very next morning I had stubble.  </li>
            <li> but I recently purchased the panisonic electric razor and can hardly believe the close shave it gives me......  almost like a real razor, but without any discomfort......    </li>
            <li> my daughter, it wasn&#x27;t too bad as far as the left behind stubble, since the hair on her legs had never been shaved before and was still so very fine and thin, but it did pull the hair alot and took so many passes to clear areas.</li>
            <li> only dry.</li>
            <li> It was also easy to shave around my knees, which I had found to be difficult with another electric razor that I&#x27;ve had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that you can use it dry outside of the shower.  </li>
            <li> But the inner blade rusted after only one use as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> This one certainly does the trick - I have had it for a few weeks and have used it almost every other day.</li>
            <li> It lasts long enough on single charge.</li>
            <li> killer - the razor plugs in directly using a little plastic piece on the charger (literally stands on it)</li>
            <li> No nicks and scratches like my previous (and much more expensive) shaver.</li>
            <li> - Also, the hair seems to grow back slightly faster, but it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as I can no longer use a razor blade to shave my legs due to medical issues.  </li>
            <li> It gave a close shave, but as it neared the end of the warranty I noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> I use it both dry, and in the shower with shower gel, so I no longer have to buy shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Dry shaving results are dismal, so are underarm shaving results.  </li>
            <li> think you can dry shave, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Have used it in water and dry.</li>
            <li> The included storage bag is pretty useless; it&#x27;s much too small.  </li>
            <li> It works to my satisfaction- wet or dry</li>
            <li> This shaver does not shave closely, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> Except, when I got my legs wet and tried it, it didnt seem to work, so I dont know about the WET/dry thing, but I like using it when my legs are dry.</li>
            <li> This was my second Panasonic Shaver, both of them lasted just a little longer than a year, before they became virtually unusable.</li>
            <li> Seems to even take the hair a little bit longer to grow back.</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.</li>
            <li> I really expected that there would be some improvements in electric razors over this time</li>
            <li> Now a year later, the battery is already dead and I&#x27;d have to replace the battery.  </li>
            <li> I am disabled and have the use of only one hand.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was tired of the razor burn/red bumps on my legs, especially the thighs.  </li>
            <li> the shaver is good for wet and dry shaving and the rechargable base is really small.</li>
            <li> It shaves relatively close; not as close as an ordinary razor, but it does well for an electric.  </li>
            <li> Other people have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t have a cord to attach -- but I keep mine charged fully all the time, so this hasn&#x27;t been an issue.     </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other electric razors</li>
            <li> I have tried other shavers, but this seems to have lasted longer and is easier to use than others.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver last year and it&#x27;s really been a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me</li>
            <li> One big negative point</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use the razor on a regular basis, the booklet says that you should charge it at least once every 6 months to preserve the battery</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you do need to run over the same area twice, but it leaves me with a close shave and the battery lasts me at least 2 sessions.  </li>
            <li> The down points:   -</li>
            <li> until one fall from about 3ft down to the carpet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as smooth, if not better, than my expensive razors I use in the shower!  </li>
            <li> This shaver is hard to hang on to, when your hands are wet or soapy (although, a wide rubberband wound around the handle helps).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have gotten a few ingrown hairs since using this, but that may be because I&#x27;m using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer isn&#x27;t what I expected to be and will probably get very little use from me.</li>
            <li> I have never really liked shaving my legs, messy and usually getting nicks or having some burning for the next day.    </li>
            <li> It comes with one of those little brushes to separate hair and etc.</li>
            <li> - The BIGGEST down point is that it is noisy!</li>
            <li> , it also recommends that the outer foil is replaced at least once a year and that the inner blade is replaced at least once every two years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this has not been a complete cure for that problem yet, but my experiment continues.  </li>
            <li> Leaves harsh stubble.  </li>
            <li> But within a few weeks after the warranty expired, the battery died, and would no longer charge at all.</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday because of the hair on my legs and this did not do the trick.</li>
            <li> It is annoying to plug into the wall, as the shaver sits atop the charger and won&#x27;t fit where my one bathroom outlet is located.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for christmas &#x27;cause she always noticing at work where she missed a few places and is embarrassed for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Shaved my legs, arms and bikini in  a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Got my shaving done in less than 3 minutes this morning, put on my dress and off to work!</li>
            <li> I still use my blade razor for my underarms in the shower because I&#x27;ve never suffered irritation from it, even with plain water.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer to shave with this, than with a plain razor.  </li>
            <li> In the winter shaving is NOT a top priority</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve had a water ban for the past 3 weeks since our water has been contaminated</li>
            <li> the package in small print</li>
            <li> I figured that a cheap electric razor would save me some money and make me feel less awful about using up resources.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other people found that is not great.  </li>
            <li> I can also shave daily now, which I was never able to do before because my skin was too sensitive and I would end up with horrible razor burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the razor is not fully charged, it only has a plug in small recharging base that can&#x27;t be used remotely.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems like it is getting dull faster than the the one I used to have.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver when my Remington started to get dull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for one month and noticed that the blades are already dull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to realize that it&#x27;s too hard to shave your arms in the shower because the hair just does NOT want to come off for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have always been clumsy and decided years ago to use an electric shaver on my legs to avoid cuts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least 5 years since I bought it</li>
            <li> , you have to use it slowly if you&#x27;re looking for a close shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sick of the little red spots I get from razors.  </li>
            <li> The price made it a very, very small risk.</li>
            <li> I also have weakness in my left leg making moving around very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I also tried an epilator -- but that was too painful for me to do regularly.</li>
            <li> After a year of using this electronic shaver, it got weak and served no purpose.</li>
            <li> I use it for my legs, bikini line and underarms, no more razor burn!!</li>
            <li> (I use the Venus) for a month or so, I began having terrible problems with ingrown hairs around my elbows, no matter how much I exfoliated and even though I used shaving cream.     </li>
            <li> Worse yet, the part of the shaver that extends to cut longer hair just rips the hair out...</li>
            <li> It leaves stubble behind and catches/pulls hairs alot.</li>
            <li> The blades on the sides pull even worse.</li>
            <li> I tried an electric razor years ago and was not happy.  </li>
            <li> and when it finally died after about 10 years of use and have been dropped dozens of times, I decided not to replace it but to use some of the newer creams, (hated the smell and all the places it missed).  </li>
            <li> No more bloody nicks behind my ankles.</li>
            <li> I find too difficult to be a practical solution).  </li>
            <li> Since I shave my arms (weird massage therapist thing - hair holds oil and body ick</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been unable to shave.</li>
            <li> I had one and used it for years, unable to find a replacement until checking on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t shocked or terribly dissapointed as you normally get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> One bad aspect--it doesn&#x27;t come with a cord.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> She got really frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But, I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very painful experience!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this razor because I found myself taking 20 minute showers when 5 minute showers would do - shaving in the shower takes way too long and uses up way too much water and electricity. I figured that a cheap electric razor would save me some money and make me feel less awful about using up resources. This one certainly does the trick - I have had it for a few weeks and have used it almost every other day. It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave, so I do shave in the shower when going somewhere fancy or remotely non-casual. It can&#x27;t really cut or scratch, since the actual razor is inside the shaving apparatus (which is also why the shave isn&#x27;t that close). Overall, I think I will be very pleased if this device lasts past the 1 year mark.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this razor. I have osteo-arthritis and cannot really bend over to shave my legs the way I used to. With this razor it is easy - cordless - to shave with legs supported by an ottoman with a towel on top.  (Noticed I could do a video review... Wouldn&#x27;t that be fun to watch a fat, stiff old lady remove hair from her lower extremities?!? Too bad I don&#x27;t have a camcorder, no? :))</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver that I&#x27;m still using.  I just bought the Panasonic bikini trimmer so the two shavers combined really compliment each other.</li>
            <li> I have never really liked shaving my legs, messy and usually getting nicks or having some burning for the next day.    I haveb tried several electric razors over the years and was never quite satisfied with the result, (they all left stubble)   but I recently purchased the panisonic electric razor and can hardly believe the close shave it gives me......  almost like a real razor, but without any discomfort......    I would highly recommend it to all women and the ease of use - I can do this while watching tv and always feel comfortable now.    carol</li>
            <li> Why do stores no longer sell ladies&#x27; shavers?  I needed a new shaver and was very pleased to find this one online and at such a great price. the shaver is good for wet and dry shaving and the rechargable base is really small. It is really a comfortable shave.  No pulling and \\&quot;tearing\\&quot; of the hair while shaving. One bad aspect--it doesn&#x27;t come with a cord.  If the razor is not fully charged, it only has a plug in small recharging base that can&#x27;t be used remotely.  If you forget to charge, be prepared to stay fuzzy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago and it&#x27;s great.  I use it both dry, and in the shower with shower gel, so I no longer have to buy shaving cream.  I won&#x27;t get into the details of my personal hygiene here  :)  but suffice to say that I am very satisfied with this, and can&#x27;t imagine going back to waxing or shaving with razors.  The bikini line feature is very useful as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for its \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; use (for my legs), and I also wanted an electric shaver for my bikini line. I&#x27;ve had electric shavers before that worked well... not the case with this razor! From the very first time I used this razor, it pulled the hair out (with both legs &amp; bikini line). I tried using it several times (used it in the shower, too), tried cleaning it, making sure the battery was charged... everything I could, but it just did not work for me. Very painful experience!</li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic (that just died after 15 years!), so being familiar with this brand I wasn&#x27;t hesitant at all to re-purchase a similar shaver.  I&#x27;m so glad I went with a rechargeable (other one was battery operated).  This is the best shaver...the two rotating heads are pretty amazing how they move along the skin (like over your knees).  And to recharge it is super easy!  I&#x27;m very, very happy with this and would recommend to anyone (especially for the price!)</li>
            <li> Fabulous razor until the head rusted and until it stopped charging.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of its good reviews and I was totally happy with it for less than a year.  That&#x27;s when it stopped charging.  Think of this razor as a throw-away.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for an electric razor.  It holds a charge nicely but when you put it on the charger, you have to move it around a bit to get the connection made.  Also, it seems like it is getting dull faster than the the one I used to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 2 years and love it!  After dropping it once too many times in the shower I just ordered another! This is an excellent value and product. It works great for quick dry touch ups and with shaving creme for a lasting smooth shave. Do not hesitate to purchase as it far exceeds the more expensive shavers on the market!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a more expensive JC Penny Model that didnt hold a charge. The Panasonic name came thru. wife uses it in the shower. She was pleeased. P/U my brownie points. ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now,Oct 2012, this was stolen by my daughter on her way to collage 2 semesters ago,&lt;br /&gt;she hasnt asked my wife for a new one so I know its still working.&lt;br /&gt;And of course the first time she used she told my wife she loved it &amp;&lt;br /&gt;would steal it when she left, so it was shared by them two for a good 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and I&#x27;m sick of the little red spots I get from razors.  Unfortunately this has not been a complete cure for that problem yet, but my experiment continues.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to use water with this, since I&#x27;m trying to conserve.  It shaves relatively close; not as close as an ordinary razor, but it does well for an electric.  Unfortunately I have gotten a few ingrown hairs since using this, but that may be because I&#x27;m using too much pressure.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery life is good, you can use it wet or dry (shave gel/cream is optional)... it&#x27;s really an excellent value.</li>
            <li> My mother and I bought a rechargeable shaver years ago, but neither of us were satisfied with it and so we just didn&#x27;t use it. Recently, however, I began shaving my arms, and while traditional razors worked well (I use the Venus) for a month or so, I began having terrible problems with ingrown hairs around my elbows, no matter how much I exfoliated and even though I used shaving cream.     I then decided to find a different hair removal method and settled on a rechargeable shaver, and upon studying customer reviews, decided to purchase this one. The price made it a very, very small risk. I received it in no time and tried it out, and I must say, I adore it! I have been using it for about a month -- I wanted to make sure I liked it before reviewing!    I use the shaver on my arms and my legs and it works fine. It takes a little more time than a razor, but it&#x27;s much less messy and you can do it comfortably sitting on your bed, rather than trying to balance on one leg in the shower. I always scrub my arms and legs in the shower and shave right afterward while the skin and hair is still soft. If I wait until I&#x27;m all dry, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and leaves my skin dry and irritated.     I still use my blade razor for my underarms in the shower because I&#x27;ve never suffered irritation from it, even with plain water. For my bikini line I use it in the shower after exfoliating and with plenty of shaving cream, and it works splendidly, whereas with a traditional razor I suffered incredible irritation and formidable ingrown hairs!    This shaver is very gentle on skin and leaves little irritation. It shaves just as well as a traditional razor!    The down points:   - As I said it takes a little longer, because you have to go back and forth over an area to get it tolerably smooth.   - Also, the hair seems to grow back slightly faster, but it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a traditional razor. The ease of use makes it much easier to use on a daily basis.   - The BIGGEST down point is that it is noisy! I live in a college dorm and I made it a point to tell all my friends on my floor that I have a shaver (they were interested and some wanted to get one because of how much I liked it) so they didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something else! If I use it in the shower I have to go in when the bathroom is deserted! This is the reason I gave a four instead of a five. When I use it at home there is no problem at all with the noise. It sounds like a lawnmower, it&#x27;s a beast! Haha.    Other people have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t have a cord to attach -- but I keep mine charged fully all the time, so this hasn&#x27;t been an issue.     All-in-all I am incredibly satisfied. If you have troubles with ingrown hairs and irritation, buy this product. It is inexpensive and it works splendidly.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do, but maybe I had high standards. The trimmer which pushes up often snags my hair, especially along the bikini line, which is where it is meant to help mostly, and I often end up with a little blood, probably from the snag pulling at my hair so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to use it slowly if you&#x27;re looking for a close shave. It isn&#x27;t as close as a regular razor, but it NEVER has given me irritation or bumps, and I ALWAYS got that with my regular razor. I can also shave daily now, which I was never able to do before because my skin was too sensitive and I would end up with horrible razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it works best slowly, in the shower, with shaving cream, on your legs and armpits. Not bikini. I&#x27;ll stick to my old razor for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, but after reading 35+ five star reviews, I guess I was expecting something perfect.</li>
            <li> In short, this razor does what I couldn&#x27;t do with my Venus razor -- cleanly shaves my armpits.  With the hand razors, I couldn&#x27;t get an angle that would allow me to get a close shave.  This electric razor comes in the shower with me and does it perfectly AND leaves NO red bumps.  I also use it on my bikini line and never get the red bumps or ingrown hairs.  I tried the Norelco and it actually left \\&quot;burn\\&quot; marks on my pits and took a week to heal.  Does it shave my legs as close as a traditional razor -- not quite, but pretty darn close.  I even bought a second one of these for my beach house.  I also tried an epilator -- but that was too painful for me to do regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before but this is a great product.  Comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this shaver-I no longer have to make sure I have extra cartirdges on hand. It works to my satisfaction- wet or dry and it does the job- Alice</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic shaver. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave but it is really convenient. In the winter shaving is NOT a top priority but when I go to the gym or go swimming it&#x27;s such a hassle to have to get in the tub an shave- this makes it easy and I can be done in a minute! I also have really sensitive legs that always leave me with razor burn no matter what I use- there is no razor burn with this product- I love it!</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave and the battery holds a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this baby month ago, and it looks nicer than the picture on website.  The only problem with this shaver is that, you have to shave 2-3 time till clean. I only charged once when it arrived, and use it twice a week, it still works quite well. I guess the battery inside is durable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this over a year ago and it worked great in the beginning. Although it&#x27;s a bit loud to my liking, it did it&#x27;s job on the legs. After a year and having to recharge so many times, it pretty much lost its mojo. Now that I try to recharge it and power on, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. After a year of using this electronic shaver, it got weak and served no purpose. Time to switch to another brand...</li>
            <li> This is constantly nicking, even though i keep it on the charger. And, it finally died, after a year. Even though it says it&#x27;s charging, it has no power.  I have been very aggravated with this shaver, and I hope the next one I purchase will be better!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that it would be quicker and easier to use than regular razors.  I was pleased with the wet/dry ability.  However, the ability to shave in the shower or out of the shower is the ONLY benefit to this Shaver.    This product does NOT work well and I would give it 0 stars if I could.  The shaver does not shave well.  It takes almost 20 minutes to shave my legs with this shaver because I have to go over the same spots MANY times.  I have tried shaving more frequently and also waiting a few extra days to see if hair length affects ability to function properly.  No matter what the hair length, the shaver does NOT work well.    Since shaving takes so long, I can only get one complete shave from the charged battery.  I can get almost done with a second shaving, but the battery runs out before I get finished.    Even when hair IS cut, this shaver does not give a close shave.  Leaves harsh stubble.  Worse yet, the part of the shaver that extends to cut longer hair just rips the hair out...OUCH!    Save your money and time buy purchasing a different product.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver and I love it. It&#x27;s not to loud the charger dosn&#x27;t have a cord and it runs a long time between charging.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor when I had foot surgery as it wasn&#x27;t very easy to shave in the shower any more. So I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet. The battery last surprisingly long, very easy to handle and clean. Charging set is convenient to use. This razor works okay for a quick shave, but it will not give a close shave. I haven&#x27;t tried other electric razors so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Not sure if you would be able to get a close shave from any electric razor. The style, ease of use and handling make this razor a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers and this is one of the best. It gives a very close shave. Also it is a very price. I have had much more expensive shavers but none have done a better job.</li>
            <li> The ladies rechargeable is good for when you are in a rush. The adapted the pulls forward is great for trimming up, even your man&#x27;s side burns. Not as close as I had hoped. Back to the old fashioned Razor for me.</li>
            <li> My wife told me that this is the greatest shaver she ever had. In a month she needed only 3 times to use it. Very good, deliver a smooth silky skin after shaving. She used only for legs and underarms. I don&#x27;t know how other people found that is not great.  It is noisy because the strong power of the blades. Very easy to clean she didn&#x27;t used in shower, only dry. Is like a charm</li>
            <li> I have an old electric Remington shaver (corded, can&#x27;t use in water) and thought it would be nice to upgrade to one that would theoretically get a closer shave and could be used in the shower.  Although the feel of this in the hand is nice, I have gotten several \\&quot;razor burns\\&quot; when trying to get a close enough shave.  The Panasonic does do well in the water, and is easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback to this razor, to me, is that my 25 year old dry Remington does just as good a job as this Panasonic.  I really expected that there would be some improvements in electric razors over this time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT buy this again, given that I already have an electric razor.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like this. We saw the great reviews but found it did not give a close shave. I guess everone has different skin types etc, so it may work better with others.     She swiched back to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver when my Remington started to get dull.  I was incredibly disappointed.  In fact, I went back to using my old Remington shaver, because it actually gave me a closer shave than the brand new Panasonic.  I thought, if I gave it time, it would get better, but it never did.  I would definitely recommend Remington over this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very durable, nice looking and built well overall. I had bought it for my daughter back in 2007, when she first started shaving her legs. I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with her using a regular razor, so I gave this one a try, as it seemed to be one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She liked it at first and especially liked the way it looked, the color, etc. It&#x27;s performance is pretty lousy though, honestly. It does not give a close shave at all. It leaves stubble behind and catches/pulls hairs alot. You have to go over areas multiple times, but even then it still leaves stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my daughter, it wasn&#x27;t too bad as far as the left behind stubble, since the hair on her legs had never been shaved before and was still so very fine and thin, but it did pull the hair alot and took so many passes to clear areas. She got really frustrated. That&#x27;s when I decided to give it a shot and realized that it does leave stubble and skips areas and pulls. The blades on the sides pull even worse. Trying to do the bikini area would be traumatizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame because it is very well made and it seems like the company put alot of effort into the body of the shaver and then just gave no thought to the blades. 5 years later, it still charges and runs, but it never gets used of course. I just threw it away, right before writing this review, after coming across it in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as I can no longer use a razor blade to shave my legs due to medical issues.  The shaver tends to &#x27;chew&#x27; up my skin and it takes many passes in order to cut the hairs.  I&#x27;ve used it for one month and noticed that the blades are already dull.  I will be looking for another razor soon.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I thought this was going to be a good reliable product and much better than waxing(something I find too difficult to be a practical solution).  But the inner blade rusted after only one use as a wet shaver. I&#x27;ll go back to using Remington(that one lasted five years before the blades dulled too much to be useful).</li>
            <li> Yesterday I finally convinced myself to buy an electric shaver. Since I shave my arms (weird massage therapist thing - hair holds oil and body ick and I don&#x27;t need anyone else&#x27;s body ick on me) I&#x27;ve come to realize that it&#x27;s too hard to shave your arms in the shower because the hair just does NOT want to come off for some reason. I always miss spots when I shave with my regular razor in the shower ... so I bought myself a Panasonic Triple Blade Wet/Dry electric shaver. It is awesome! I had already shaved my legs and arms most of the way yesterday with my regular razor, then found the spots I&#x27;d missed on the backs of my legs and my arms and did them today.  It&#x27;s just as smooth, if not better, than my expensive razors I use in the shower!  Awesome buy and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and was really happy with it. It gave a close shave, but as it neared the end of the warranty I noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long. I had assumed that it was just getting moved around on the charger, causing it to not charge. But within a few weeks after the warranty expired, the battery died, and would no longer charge at all. This was my second Panasonic Shaver, both of them lasted just a little longer than a year, before they became virtually unusable. I ended up going back to my nine year old Remington shaver after this shaver died, because it gave a better shave than my other Panasonic. They both gave a great shave, but if you are looking for something to last longer than a year, I would probably recommend a Remington.</li>
            <li> This razor turned out to be just what I wanted. Not bumps no irritation, shave was as close as my other razor, hair grew back slower, worked great for bikini/armpit area.</li>
            <li> The old adage \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; pops into my mind. The shaver works well in a pinch, but is no substitute for a blade.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002D5Y60 Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver]]My wife loves this shaver,says that it is much better than a blade razor,just as close a shave and no nicks,easy to keep clean.  As I said my wife is very satis fied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver last year and it&#x27;s really been a disappointment.  It&#x27;s my 1st electric shaver so I have nothing to compare it to, but it&#x27;s never worked well.  The shave under the arms or legs is anything but close and a regular razor works 100% better. Also I was getting bumps under my arms after shaving with this product.  Now a year later, the battery is already dead and I&#x27;d have to replace the battery.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me and I&#x27;m going to dump this electric shaver and go back to the cheap razors.  I guess you get what you pay for and do not recommend buying this shaver.</li>
            <li> I was only willing to purchase this for quick shave and go b/c of the affordable price. It obviously doesn&#x27;t cut closer than a manual razor, but it helps if you miss a spot and don&#x27;t have shaving cream/water nearby.   The trimmer isn&#x27;t what I expected to be and will probably get very little use from me. The charger plugs into the wall with no cords and your shaver sits ontop of it.    It comes with a nice white bag which I probably will never use, but a nice touch nevertheless. It comes with one of those little brushes to separate hair and etc. It&#x27;s a nice color :]  The on and off switch was a bit stiff at first, but now it turns on and off with ease. It works ok dry, but a bit of water makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Great shaver!  Read all the other reviews before purchasing and it is everything they said and more!  Glad to have found this! Saved lots of time and effort in shopping from store to store.</li>
            <li> This shaver is good for its price. It lasts long enough on single charge. But does not give close shave as blade. Nevetheless the shave is pretty neat. You need to be bit careful with the trimmer, it can chew up your skin if run over your skin very rapidly.</li>
            <li> Close, clean &amp; smooth shave wet or dry. No razorburn. Seems to even take the hair a little bit longer to grow back. Pop-up trimmer is a nice feature. Charges quickly, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.  I got it Monday, Shaved tuesday &amp; was off to work.  No cuts, bumps or anything.  Nice clean shave.   GET IT!!!!!!!!   Much quicker than a regular razor too...</li>
            <li> I made this purchased based on my son&#x27;s recommendation. He has the wet/dy shaver from panasonic for men.  I love the wet/dry versatility. I use it for my legs, bikini line and underarms, no more razor burn!! No batteries or cords, just keep it on the charger when not in use.  It is compact, which maKeS it very portable for my business trips.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have the use of only one hand.  I also have weakness in my left leg making moving around very difficult.  I wanted a razor that I can use without a cord.  I looked at some more expensive razors thinking more expensive is better.  This razor is nicely priced and I love it.  It is so easy for me to use and does a great job.  I&#x27;d say it is a winner and a keeper.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the money!  There is a tendency to pull every once in a while, but that can be managed by repeated use and making sure the blades are maintained.  I have discovered that no electric razor will be perfect, so you have to know what to expect.  This one does the job well and won&#x27;t cost you an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday because of the hair on my legs and this did not do the trick. It took a long time and the very next morning I had stubble.  It worked great on my bickini area, but sadly was lacking on my legs.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, who just started shaving.  She likes it, and it is easy for her to use.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver, based on the positive reviews.  But, I am disappointed.  This shaver does not shave closely, wet or dry.  Dry shaving results are dismal, so are underarm shaving results.  It takes a lot longer to shave with this, than with a plain razor.  After 3-4 uses, I can already notice the battery life is shorter per charge.  It is annoying to plug into the wall, as the shaver sits atop the charger and won&#x27;t fit where my one bathroom outlet is located.  This shaver is hard to hang on to, when your hands are wet or soapy (although, a wide rubberband wound around the handle helps).  The included storage bag is pretty useless; it&#x27;s much too small.  It is fairly easy to clean.  However, when I run out of razor blades, if this is charged, I can still shave!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and in phenomenal shape. It looked better than I imagined it looking. I can&#x27;t wait to see if the lady likes it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, use it for underarms and it works like a charm.  I tried it on my legs and it works for quick jobs however does not get close as a razor in the shower.  This is a great price for a good product.  Also love that it has a charger on the plug, very smart idea.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. It works but requires several passes. I wasn&#x27;t shocked or terribly dissapointed as you normally get what you pay for. Nice that it&#x27;s wet/dry and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This shaver is SO much better than the one it replaced. The foils  are nice and smooth. No nicks and scratches like my previous (and much more expensive) shaver. The charger is very compact. The shaver holds the charge for quite a while. It also provides a very nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with skin that is sensitive to razor shaving all my life!  I&#x27;ve used a million creams and razors.  I can&#x27;t believe the miracle of this shaver.  The price is astounding, too!</li>
            <li> I have always been clumsy and decided years ago to use an electric shaver on my legs to avoid cuts.  I used a man&#x27;s razor for over 10 years.  I decided to try the Panasonic after reading a review of it.  It is light weight, holds a charge for a long time and, while I have not tried it, can be used in the shower.  It is comfortable to use and gets all the visible stubble although there is still a little roughness detectable by your hand.</li>
            <li> In an effort to make shaving more appealing, I decided to use this instead of [[ASIN:B001E6SWKO Venus Embrace Value Pack]], which is practically useless, and [[ASIN:B001ET6WHG Schick Intuition Plus All-In-One Cartridges for Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 3 cartridges (Pack of 2)]], which is great but needs very frequent refills (which add up). In my situation, this augments a traditional razor but does not replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-can be used wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;-rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use/replace blades&lt;br /&gt;-no nicks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I needed to use this with shaving cream, so it didn&#x27;t save time&lt;br /&gt;-didn&#x27;t work so well on underarms (left hair behind)&lt;br /&gt;-Deal killer - the razor plugs in directly using a little plastic piece on the charger (literally stands on it) - I&#x27;m worried it will break, but what really irks me is that this set up basically blocks the other outlet too (the bottom is low, the razor is on top). Also, it needs a tall clearance and wide clearance on the back, so it won&#x27;t charge on my wall mount near my mirror (the mirror is out just far enough that the razor won&#x27;t clear) - won&#x27;t work on horizontal outlets either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If think you can dry shave, give it a shot. Otherwise, I can&#x27;t say I would recommend it - especially over the intuition.</li>
            <li> This razor is an excellent razor.  It gets as close a shave as an electric razor can get.  It is also very reasonably priced.  Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> The result of the shaving is ok. In general I prefer a wet shaver and therefore I mainly use this razor for the bikini area, only. It works quite good, but I have more skin irritations than compared to my Braun shaver I am using for many years now.  One big negative point: The power supply supports 110 Volt only. Therefore this shaver is not designed for the use for travelling to Europe or somewhere else where 220 Volt are used. (I also checked with Panasonic: they don&#x27;t offer any alternative power supply for this device.)</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift for the wife.  Excellent for taking in the shower and doing the shaving there.  Works great!  She loves it!</li>
            <li> It works better than any other electric shaver that I have ever purchased. It is easy to use and hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> Have used it in water and dry. Works really well. Love the Compact space-saving charger.</li>
            <li> A bit rough feeling but handy.</li>
            <li> The other day I decided to purchase this razor out of pure desperation since where I live we&#x27;ve had a water ban for the past 3 weeks since our water has been contaminated and I&#x27;ve been unable to shave. My only regret with this purchase is that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner! I should have bought something like this years ago. I just received my razor today and let me just tell you that it&#x27;s wonderful--I was able to get as close a shave with it as a I able to get with a bade and without any irritation, which feels so absolutely nice. It was also easy to shave around my knees, which I had found to be difficult with another electric razor that I&#x27;ve had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the package the razor is hypo allergenic for sensitive skin, which is a total plus and there was a sticker on the box saying that it was a Consumers Digest Best Buy, and after using it I can definitely see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a charger that plugs into the wall and the razor sits on top of that. It needs to be charged for 8 hours prior to the first use. According to the booklet, 1 charge should last you all week, which is nice. If you don&#x27;t use the razor on a regular basis, the booklet says that you should charge it at least once every 6 months to preserve the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the package in small print, it also recommends that the outer foil is replaced at least once a year and that the inner blade is replaced at least once every two years. I don&#x27;t know how much those cost, but in the long run it&#x27;s gotta be cheaper than buying razor blades--those things are just too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor seems like a great product and it has a great price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who asked me about it.</li>
            <li> I have owner a few electric shavers and this is the best so far. Strong and durable. Travels well. Great shaver!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for christmas &#x27;cause she always noticing at work where she missed a few places and is embarrassed for the rest of the day. She loves it, it fits in her purse so she can take it to work or in the car so when she see she missed spot, it only takes a second to take care of it. Gets all the hair, leaves skin smooth, can be used dry or wet, and its portable. After trying hers out, I ordered one for myself and my mom. You cant beat a great, rechargeable razor for this price. It cost the same as 2 refill packs for my old razor; never again! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best ladies electric shaver my wife has ever owned (and she has had several).    Product is \\&quot;as described\\&quot; and was received promptly in good, new condition.</li>
            <li> Bought this in the store because of the price.  It was already charged when I took it out of the box. So what the hey, decided to test drive this baby!  Shaved my legs, arms and bikini in  a few minutes.  I was really impressed at how smooth my arms and bikini area got.  I was worried because I heard that electric shavers dont get as close as razors but I am pleased.  Smooth and quick, I can live with this!</li>
            <li> I used to have a razor just like this and when it finally died after about 10 years of use and have been dropped dozens of times, I decided not to replace it but to use some of the newer creams, (hated the smell and all the places it missed).  Then I went to razors and endured cuts all over.  But I finally wised up when I saw the new model of just what I had used before and at a great price.  I love this razor because it&#x27;s great for a quick clip dry in just a few areas or in the shower with my legs all lathers up.  I give this a five star review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 yr old niece.  She loves it!  So nice to make someone happy.  Very good quality - I have good luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a new razor in over 11 years, umm that includes blades...so perhaps I&#x27;m a bit biased that ANYTHING would be better than what I had, but since I use it intermittently it wasn&#x27;t an issue. Until my last shaving incident. So I looked around, read reviews, considered prices and ended up here with the Panasonic ES2206AC Rechargeable Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver. It has a nifty charge pack that you simply plug into the shaver, and then plug the whole thing into an outlet. I charged it for about 3-4 hours before using it for the first time. It did a great job on armpits and the bikini area. It cleaned up quick with a splash of running water.   The only thing I didnt like, and this is really nothing...is the draw string bag they include to house your razor really isn&#x27;t big enough for the charge pack as well. I DID manage to cram both in there, but it doesn&#x27;t close up completely. That&#x27;s all. I can live with that. Esecially for $21 and free shipping! GREAT deal. And I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other shavers, but this seems to have lasted longer and is easier to use than others.  I purchased it quite a while back, and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> This razor works perfectly! it&#x27;s the first electric one I&#x27;ve had, but I love it! I got it for christmas, and I used it that day and it worked great! Except, when I got my legs wet and tried it, it didnt seem to work, so I dont know about the WET/dry thing, but I like using it when my legs are dry. Anyway, Great razor!!!</li>
            <li> Shaves close, no cuts, I can even shave under my arms without getting cut.  Three shaving heads are great for a closer shave and the blade for longer hair works well too.  This is a great buy and consumer reports rates it in their top electric shavers.  Nothing shaves like a regular razor, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t have time to spend time shaving in the shower and rinsing, shave and rinse (you get the picture), I love this one.  Got my shaving done in less than 3 minutes this morning, put on my dress and off to work!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever tried!  It does a great job on legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> Love that this is a wet/dry shaver; I had checked the various reviews before choosing to purchase; I even checked Consumer Reports which gave Panasonic the best marks for ladies electric shavers.  The report agreed that your regular razors are going to be closer, etc., but I find that that means nicks, cuts, &amp; ingrown hairs as well.  I have a razor for in-shower, but how many times have I missed a section or more often, I need just a touch up for a pair of capri&#x27;s or sleeveless blouse, etc.  This shaver gives me the flexibility to do any or all of the above.  One note, razor burn - I found when I first started with an electric shaver than I held it the same as my razor.  However, I find that the best results are when I hold it more directly against the skin rather than an angle that I don&#x27;t have any irritation, redness or razor burn.  Razors and shavers are different and using just a touch of a different angle can make a huge difference.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was tired of the razor burn/red bumps on my legs, especially the thighs.  I tried an electric razor years ago and was not happy.  This one is a bit better if you know going into it an electric razor will not leave your legs as smooth as a regular razor.  It takes a bit longer, I have to go over my legs 2-3 times.  When completed it feels like one days growth had I used a regular razor.  Not enought to be seen but you can feel it.  I will keep using it because there is no razor burn or red bumps.  I use the old razor occasionally when I want my legs completely smooth and to do around the ankles.  Overall, not bad if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of stubble.  I do like that you can use it dry outside of the shower.  Great for sensitive skin.  A bit loud.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, it has a long battery life, and the pop up feature takes care of the hard to shave parts. Definitely your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I liked this...didn&#x27;t live up to its reviews, but still it was a decent shaver...until one fall from about 3ft down to the carpet. Something in the head broke. I still don&#x27;t know what. I was going to replace the head...but it was $40 or more everywhere I looked. Just about might as well buy a new one. I&#x27;m now considering an epilator.</li>
            <li> Worked great, until three months after purchase.  Stopped working and can&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li> This thing is still kicking something like 4-5 years later. It works about as well as I expect any electric shaver to work.</li>
            <li> I only purchased this shaver because it was the \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deal\\&quot; on Amazon and I purchased it for under twenty dollars.  It works great.  Sometimes, you do need to run over the same area twice, but it leaves me with a close shave and the battery lasts me at least 2 sessions.  No more bloody nicks behind my ankles. I was very impressed by this shaver and would definitely purchase the same one again.</li>
            <li> Truly incredible product. I had one and used it for years, unable to find a replacement until checking on Amazon.Com. Thrilled to find it, never a disappointment. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, one of the things that she&#x27;d asked for Christmas.  It performs as designed.</li>
            <li> these are sold for a fraction of the price listed here but because it was a gift; i ate the hose job price and my wife is charging it for her first use... if it&#x27;s crappy i will edit my review, but for now; keep shopping because the newer model is about a quarter of the price...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this specific model for quite some time. It&#x27;s been at least 5 years since I bought it and I honestly didn&#x27;t not pay very much. As a matter of fact, I thought that paying about 35 would make it worth my time and money. Well, I come to find out after 5 years that it costs a little more than double. It&#x27;s a very good shaver and it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my wife as a gift. It worked one time and then quit. It appears the charger won&#x27;t charge the battery. I sent it in to Panasonic and they replaced it with a new one. The new one has worked for about 6 months now. My wife claims it actual shaving preformance as poor to fair. She says the cheap big box store one she had before this one worked much better (meaning it shaved closer with less work). I should have just purchased another one of those.</li>
