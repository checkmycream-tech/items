    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I purchased this product about a year ago, and for the price it was great!  </li>
            <li>I would buy it again, and the price is great!</li>
            <li>and boy is it good or wat !</li>
            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>Really happy with them</li>
            <li>and of course it shut its self off (great feature)</li>
            <li>This works great for that.    </li>
            <li>I recommend the Infinity 4-in-1, it did great things for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great bargin.  </li>
            <li>I would happily buy it again at twice the cost, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>After many years of trying out all kinds of brands and models, I have found THE perfect styling tool.  </li>
            <li>And having a straightener and a huge roller all in one is a great idea!  </li>
            <li>SHE TOTALLY LOVED THIS CURLING IRON.  </li>
            <li>The Conair does as good a job at straightening and smoothing my hair as the T3 or the Jilbere.</li>
            <li>It straightens very easily and makes great curls.</li>
            <li>My best friend has a Hot Tools curling iron that she LOVES, and the curls stay forever!  </li>
            <li>It is a convenient alternative to the 4-in-1 (which I love as well, but I lost it!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and a great price.</li>
            <li>But the Conair is an amazing bargain.</li>
            <li>that is how amazing it has been.</li>
            <li>but I do love this product, the finish is nice</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR MY TEENAGED DAUGHTER AS ONE OF HER MANY XMAS GIFTS.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;re better off having separate curling and straightening irons...</li>
            <li>and I truly believe that you will not find a better value out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for straightening and curling, so it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>I still love the convenience of the two-in-one, though.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome - totally love it and want to buy another one in case the one I have currently breaks for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>I am able to achieve great hairstyles because of the versatility in switching from curling iron to straightener; so much so that people continue to ask me if I have hair extensions</li>
            <li>just love this product and want to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>If I flat-iron in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t get perfectly sleek by a long shot, although it looks a lot better than before.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I was staying in Europe for 2 months and needed something that wouldn&#x27;t take up my precious luggage space.</li>
            <li>I wish I had spent more and got the Sedu since it had very good reviews.  </li>
            <li>When you try to compensate for this, you can easily get burned as I have.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product as I have been a loyal and happy consumer of Conair products for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>I use it on the 2nd lowest of 4 heat settings, and in one pass my fine frizzy hair looks sleek and beautiful</li>
            <li>For less than $30 and to have the convenience of a curling iron / straightener in one, I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and not too clunky, as I had originally thought.  </li>
            <li>I own the Infiniti hair straightening blow dryer, which I really like</li>
            <li>I could still use the straight iron part (not that great on its own), but doesn&#x27;t defeat the purpose of having something that&#x27;s supposed to do two different jobs?  </li>
            <li>&quot; I could use a 1\\&quot;, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:    </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend a fortune on a good straightening iron, and I really wanted a large barrel curling iron too.  </li>
            <li>The product is good the only problem I have with it is when you use the curling iron part of it</li>
            <li>Okay I have to say that it was a really goooooood piece of machine</li>
            <li>even though it looks really cool</li>
            <li>I love this iron so much, I bought two of them.  </li>
            <li>but good luck find it or anything even similar.</li>
            <li>The power light and temp control are right on the front, so I can tell at a glance whether it&#x27;s on or not.</li>
            <li>It heats up quick and provides you the versatility of a curling iron or straightener at the flick of a finger.</li>
            <li>I can get my hair done rather quickly with this because of the plate length.</li>
            <li>This multitasking tool helps me achieve sexy wavy ringlets, stick straight hair, it helps boost volume in my hair (when used right), and allows me to do \\&quot;hair</li>
            <li>It also gets very hot, even on the lowest temperature.</li>
            <li>This curling iron heats up quick and has an extra long cord which is great!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it has a five year warranty, and when I called Conair this morning, they told me to ship it to them for a replacement (I have to pay the shipping costs, but that&#x27;s better than shopping for a new one right now).  </li>
            <li>I use my loyal conair hot rollers to curl my hair.     </li>
            <li>Knowing how much I like the Conair Infiniti brand, however, I was excited to find this 2-in-1 from them.  </li>
            <li>The curling feature is totally cumbersome, and very easy to burn your skin in the process.</li>
            <li>All in all, for the price, it was a great product and worked well until it shut off last weekend and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on!  </li>
            <li>It has 5 heat levels, and it&#x27;s heated super fast.</li>
            <li>I can style my hair exactly the way I want.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky smooth and the rotating cable makes it easy to maneuver around while you&#x27;re styling (minimal cable untangling after you&#x27;re done).</li>
            <li>Once I flat iron it, it stays so nice and smooth the next day</li>
            <li>It still does an okay job, but I find myself looking longingly at the Chi flat irons whenever I pass a display.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly more wieldy than a flat iron or curling iron alone, but that&#x27;s almost always the case when you get a 2-in-1 anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to switch back and forth between curling iron and straightener.</li>
            <li>I have very thin short hair, and this has been perfect for quick touch-ups after blow drying, or for full-on straightening jobs.  </li>
            <li>IT IS VERY WELL MADE OF CERAMIC.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that I always take it on vacation with me, and although it doesn&#x27;t specify that it can operate at 220V, I&#x27;ve used it in Europe without any issues or needing a power converter.</li>
            <li>So I have had this product for about 3 to 4 months now and I will have to say that I really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the blowdryer as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li>Nice Iron -- I only wish that the curling iron was a bit smaller -- it&#x27;s approx.</li>
            <li>Two years later I still have this accessible, but never use</li>
            <li>any longer - but to be clear I have used this continually for 7 years and it is still going pretty well.</li>
            <li>This was such a great item and the flat iron still works but the clip for the curling iron is loose on one side</li>
            <li>I finally found this one, which does not seem to be available in stores near me.  </li>
            <li>First of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the ceramic iron, and once you&#x27;ve used ceramic, you really can&#x27;t go back to regular metal.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this curling tool.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>With my other flat iron, my hair would still be pretty good even the next morning.  </li>
            <li>- my hubby actually thought I had gotten a haircut the other day because my hair looked so nice.  </li>
            <li>In the mean time I will have to borrow my daughter&#x27;s Chi :)!</li>
            <li>You can have your hair straight or soft curls.</li>
            <li>Now I have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened.  </li>
            <li>I wish to buy a new one but they no longer exist.</li>
            <li>it always feels very soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I used to have a different model of conair 2-in-1, which worked pretty well for about a year before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>My only complaints were the large \\&quot;unguarded\\&quot; barrel would lead to forehead burns on occasion while straightening and</li>
            <li>I have courser wavy hair that is starting to thin a bit, and I live in the southeast where the humidity is high for many months!  </li>
            <li>My only warning is that if you have bangs around your face and use straighteners to smooth them out, when using this product be EXTREMELY careful to not put the tool to close to your face.</li>
            <li>It has completely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Because I was so use to my old straightener with the plastic around the plates, I accidentally placed this tool too close to my forehead.</li>
            <li>With the other flat irons, I had to look between the plates to see the light.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is that the curling iron doesn&#x27;t grab my fine hair as tightly as I&#x27;d like it to -</li>
            <li>And I love having one less hair appliance/cord and one less cord cluttering my counter.</li>
            <li>It also snags my hair if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that it has an auto turn off for forgetful people like me.  </li>
            <li>it is a little bulky to use at first.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, very wavy, high volume Hispanic hair</li>
            <li>I bought this because it seemed really convenient (and required half the space to store it, too).  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this curling/straightening iron, I owned a $150 Wet-to-Dry T3 Tourmaline flat iron (see my review), a $50 Jilbere flat iron, and a run-of-the-mill drugstore curling iron.</li>
            <li> I actually like the Conair better than the T3 or the Jilbere, because no matter how careful I was, the T3 was terrible at pulling my hair, and the Jilbere, while better, still caught the stray hair now and then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pricing curling irons, flat irons,</li>
            <li> I have tough, thick curly hard-to-manage hair, but this product does an amazing job as both straightener and curling iron.</li>
            <li> HAS AN EXTRA LONG CORD FOR MOVING AROUND!  </li>
            <li> but at the moment my hair is cut short in an inverted bob, and it really was not effective.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, very wavy (almost curly) hair--</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t even require a minor touch up.    </li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair and the flat iron part of it straightens all my hair in 5 min.  </li>
            <li> I actually ordered this as a replacement to my old one, which I had for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair is naturally wavy, so this iron tames it and give it a little body where I want it, and not where I don&#x27;t!    </li>
            <li> When I straightened or curl my hair with this it definitely cut down on the frizziness (with additional frizz styling products).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, having a 2-in-1 (like 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner) seems to mean that both of its parts are mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> This Flat Iron Combo Curler is not worth the money that I spent for it.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it... seriously.</li>
            <li> Pity.</li>
            <li> the clip doesn&#x27;t hold it closed like it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s mainly due to having to account for the rounded outer shape when straightening.</li>
            <li> One small nitpick is that I wish I could set the temp and it would default to the same temp</li>
            <li> There is nothing protecting the device from your skin, so you have to be very careful not to burn yourself.       </li>
            <li> The curling iron is too big to make small tight curls, but I wanted it to help give my hair some shape and curve while I was straightening it.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with pretty much every aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it a little farther away from your scalp.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the Conair no longer worked as well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if mine&#x27;s a fluke, but the mechanism that holds the straightening plates together so you can use the curling iron instead didn&#x27;t lock in and wouldn&#x27;t lock no matter what.  </li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a negative thing I can say about this product.  </li>
            <li> If anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work.  </li>
            <li> Although I must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry.  </li>
            <li> It is cumbersome to use, as it is heavy and awkward.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous flaw in the iron design.</li>
            <li> Even with the correct grip, the curl feature just stinks.</li>
            <li> I was being too hasty, and the on/off and temperature buttons are in a really bad spot.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace it, but it was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter and wanted to keep them. They are great. You can have your hair straight or soft curls. Really happy with them and so is my daughter so you would not let me keep them! Shge llives in a different city from me. Pity.</li>
            <li> The product is good the only problem I have with it is when you use the curling iron part of it the clip doesn&#x27;t hold it closed like it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
            <li> I have tried both straightning and curling using this one..and wat a product. I am not a pro at curing hair at all...just searched a utube video on how to do it..and boy is it good or wat !</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a year ago, and for the price it was great!  I have courser wavy hair that is starting to thin a bit, and I live in the southeast where the humidity is high for many months!  When I straightened or curl my hair with this it definitely cut down on the frizziness (with additional frizz styling products).  It did what I wanted it to do.  My only complaints were the large \\&quot;unguarded\\&quot; barrel would lead to forehead burns on occasion while straightening and I was being too hasty, and the on/off and temperature buttons are in a really bad spot.  I would find that I while styling my hair with this product, I would often hit the buttons and turn it off or adjust the temperature without meaning to do so!  All in all, for the price, it was a great product and worked well until it shut off last weekend and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on!  Thankfully, it has a five year warranty, and when I called Conair this morning, they told me to ship it to them for a replacement (I have to pay the shipping costs, but that&#x27;s better than shopping for a new one right now).  In the mean time I will have to borrow my daughter&#x27;s Chi :)!</li>
            <li> The controls for this iron are located on the handle and you are constantly turning it off when you attempt to turn the iron to do the curls. When you try to compensate for this, you can easily get burned as I have. This is a dangerous flaw in the iron design. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Okay I have to say that it was a really goooooood piece of machine but it has one flaw....even though it looks really cool i have had mine for about a year and i left it on one day and of course it shut its self off (great feature) but when i turned it on the next day to use it the plastic around the iron had melted then when i tried to turn the iron on it wouldnt turn on</li>
            <li> I love this iron. It is a convenient alternative to the 4-in-1 (which I love as well, but I lost it!).  It is easy to use and not too clunky, as I had originally thought.  I have very thin short hair, and this has been perfect for quick touch-ups after blow drying, or for full-on straightening jobs.  The curling iron is too big to make small tight curls, but I wanted it to help give my hair some shape and curve while I was straightening it.  This works great for that.    If you&#x27;re looking for something to make smaller curls I recommend the Infinity 4-in-1, it did great things for my hair.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR MY TEENAGED DAUGHTER AS ONE OF HER MANY XMAS GIFTS.  SHE TOTALLY LOVED THIS CURLING IRON.  NOT ONLY IS IT A CURLING IRON BUT A HAIR STRAIGHTENER AS WELL.  IT IS VERY WELL MADE OF CERAMIC.  IVE NEVER SEEN A CURLING IRON SO WELL-MADE.  HAS AN EXTRA LONG CORD FOR MOVING AROUND!  ID RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> Great bargin.  I have pretty thin hair and the flat iron part of it straightens all my hair in 5 min.  it is a little bulky to use at first.  i am a total klutz and i have not burned myself yet.  the curling iron part works just like a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed really convenient (and required half the space to store it, too).  Unfortunately, having a 2-in-1 (like 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner) seems to mean that both of its parts are mediocre at best.  The curling iron doesn&#x27;t give my hair a lasting curl like my friends&#x27; curling irons.  My best friend has a Hot Tools curling iron that she LOVES, and the curls stay forever!  The straightening iron only works if you put in teeny bits of hair at a time, and MAN, it rips my hair out!  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to anyone.  I think you&#x27;re better off having separate curling and straightening irons...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this product.  After my Revlon Straightening/Curling iron exploded in a shower of sparks a couple months ago, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a replacement.  I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend a fortune on a good straightening iron, and I really wanted a large barrel curling iron too.  I finally found this one, which does not seem to be available in stores near me.  I own the Infiniti hair straightening blow dryer, which I really like but at the moment my hair is cut short in an inverted bob, and it really was not effective.  Knowing how much I like the Conair Infiniti brand, however, I was excited to find this 2-in-1 from them.  It has completely exceeded my expectations.  I use it on the 2nd lowest of 4 heat settings, and in one pass my fine frizzy hair looks sleek and beautiful - my hubby actually thought I had gotten a haircut the other day because my hair looked so nice.  The only issue I have with it is that the curling iron doesn&#x27;t grab my fine hair as tightly as I&#x27;d like it to - I&#x27;ve learned to work with it anyway.  I&#x27;ve been pricing curling irons, flat irons, and 2-in-1&#x27;s for 2 months now, and I truly believe that you will not find a better value out there.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up quick and has an extra long cord which is great!</li>
            <li> I love this iron so much, I bought two of them.  It&#x27;s great for straightening and curling, so it&#x27;s very versatile. It&#x27;s light enough that I always take it on vacation with me, and although it doesn&#x27;t specify that it can operate at 220V, I&#x27;ve used it in Europe without any issues or needing a power converter. Definitely recommend it for anyone who want&#x27;s the flexibility to straighten or curl their hair.</li>
            <li> So I have had this product for about 3 to 4 months now and I will have to say that I really like it. I don&#x27;t use the blowdryer as much as I thought I would but I do love this product, the finish is nice it doesn&#x27;t leave me hair brittle it always feels very soft and bouncy. I would buy it again, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> This iron is everything it says it is. It&#x27;s easy to use and a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon for 29.99. I had high hopes for this product as I have been a loyal and happy consumer of Conair products for over 20 years. I am very disappointed with pretty much every aspect of this product. It is cumbersome to use, as it is heavy and awkward. It also gets very hot, even on the lowest temperature. There is nothing protecting the device from your skin, so you have to be very careful not to burn yourself.       The straightening feature works well enough, but leaves crimps in your hair if you are a novice. The curling feature is totally cumbersome, and very easy to burn your skin in the process. Even with the correct grip, the curl feature just stinks. I use my loyal conair hot rollers to curl my hair.     All in all, a total bomb. Will I use the product: sometimes. Would I buy it again. NO WAY!    UPDATE: Two years later I still have this accessible, but never use, I pulled it out last week, and was reminded how cumbersome and impractical this is.</li>
            <li> Not sure if mine&#x27;s a fluke, but the mechanism that holds the straightening plates together so you can use the curling iron instead didn&#x27;t lock in and wouldn&#x27;t lock no matter what.  I could still use the straight iron part (not that great on its own), but doesn&#x27;t defeat the purpose of having something that&#x27;s supposed to do two different jobs?  Needless to say, I returned it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  After a few uses, the Conair no longer worked as well.  It still does an okay job, but I find myself looking longingly at the Chi flat irons whenever I pass a display.  If I flat-iron in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t get perfectly sleek by a long shot, although it looks a lot better than before. And it requires touch-ups by evening.  With my other flat iron, my hair would still be pretty good even the next morning.  It also snags my hair if I&#x27;m not careful.  I still love the convenience of the two-in-one, though.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:    I have extremely thick, coarse, very wavy (almost curly) hair--definitely a challenge for any flat iron. Prior to this curling/straightening iron, I owned a $150 Wet-to-Dry T3 Tourmaline flat iron (see my review), a $50 Jilbere flat iron, and a run-of-the-mill drugstore curling iron. The Conair does as good a job at straightening and smoothing my hair as the T3 or the Jilbere. Once I flat iron it, it stays so nice and smooth the next day it doesn&#x27;t even require a minor touch up.    I actually like the Conair better than the T3 or the Jilbere, because no matter how careful I was, the T3 was terrible at pulling my hair, and the Jilbere, while better, still caught the stray hair now and then. I have never gotten a hair snagged by the Conair. And I love having one less hair appliance/cord and one less cord cluttering my counter. I also really like that it has an auto turn off for forgetful people like me.  It is slightly more wieldy than a flat iron or curling iron alone, but that&#x27;s almost always the case when you get a 2-in-1 anything. I think it&#x27;s mainly due to having to account for the rounded outer shape when straightening. You have to hold it a little farther away from your scalp. I can&#x27;t think how they could&#x27;ve made it easier, though, while still keeping the 2-in-1 design.     It&#x27;s easy to switch back and forth between curling iron and straightener. The power light and temp control are right on the front, so I can tell at a glance whether it&#x27;s on or not. With the other flat irons, I had to look between the plates to see the light. One small nitpick is that I wish I could set the temp and it would default to the same temp everytime I turn it on. As it is, I have to turn it up every time.     But the Conair is an amazing bargain. For less than $30 and to have the convenience of a curling iron / straightener in one, I am highly impressed. I would happily buy it again at twice the cost, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This Flat Iron Combo Curler is not worth the money that I spent for it.  First of all it does not get hot enough to straighten my hair.  Although I must admit that my hair is very thick and wiry.  If anyones hair is the least bit thick it will not work.  I wish I had spent more and got the Sedu since it had very good reviews.  Now I have to start over and buy a new one because this iron cannot be returned if it has been opened.  Now, tell me how anyone would know if it works or not if it is not opened and used.  \\&quot;DUH\\&quot;</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a negative thing I can say about this product.  I love the ceramic iron, and once you&#x27;ve used ceramic, you really can&#x27;t go back to regular metal.  And having a straightener and a huge roller all in one is a great idea!  Also, my hair is naturally wavy, so this iron tames it and give it a little body where I want it, and not where I don&#x27;t!    I actually ordered this as a replacement to my old one, which I had for at least 5 years.  But my toddler threw it on the ground and broke it, so for the time I had to wait for it to be shipped to me, it was like losing an arm!</li>
            <li> I have thick, very wavy, high volume Hispanic hair and I highly recommend this curling tool.  After many years of trying out all kinds of brands and models, I have found THE perfect styling tool.  It heats up quick and provides you the versatility of a curling iron or straightener at the flick of a finger. Makes my hair silky smooth and the rotating cable makes it easy to maneuver around while you&#x27;re styling (minimal cable untangling after you&#x27;re done). It&#x27;s awesome - totally love it and want to buy another one in case the one I have currently breaks for whatever reason. Can&#x27;t live without it... seriously.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I was staying in Europe for 2 months and needed something that wouldn&#x27;t take up my precious luggage space. And even though I am back home now, I continue to still use it almost every day.     I am able to achieve great hairstyles because of the versatility in switching from curling iron to straightener; so much so that people continue to ask me if I have hair extensions or if I have gone to beauty school. This multitasking tool helps me achieve sexy wavy ringlets, stick straight hair, it helps boost volume in my hair (when used right), and allows me to do \\&quot;hair end\\&quot; curls that especially work for layered hair to achieve that va-va-voom look.     My only warning is that if you have bangs around your face and use straighteners to smooth them out, when using this product be EXTREMELY careful to not put the tool to close to your face. Because I was so use to my old straightener with the plastic around the plates, I accidentally placed this tool too close to my forehead. Since there are no buffers or barriers on the tool, I burned my forehead.</li>
            <li> I used to have a different model of conair 2-in-1, which worked pretty well for about a year before it stopped working. I bought this one to replace it, but it was awful. It ripped my hair out every time I used it. My hair would get caught in the straightener between the plastic end and the metal barrel and get yanked out.    I recommend not buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought this 7 years ago! I wish to buy a new one but they no longer exist. This was such a great item and the flat iron still works but the clip for the curling iron is loose on one side so I don&#x27;t use that piece any longer - but to be clear I have used this continually for 7 years and it is still going pretty well. It&#x27;s like I paid $3.50 per year of use - that is how amazing it has been. I can get my hair done rather quickly with this because of the plate length. I suppose if I pinch my hair ends between the plates I could still use it as a curling iron or I can use it as a clipless one. Anyway I highly recommend this but good luck find it or anything even similar.</li>
            <li> Nice Iron -- I only wish that the curling iron was a bit smaller -- it&#x27;s approx. 1.5\\&quot; I could use a 1\\&quot;, but overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have tough, thick curly hard-to-manage hair, but this product does an amazing job as both straightener and curling iron. &lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair silky and shiny. I can style my hair exactly the way I want. It has 5 heat levels, and it&#x27;s heated super fast. &lt;br /&gt;I just love this product and want to recommend it to everyone. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It straightens very easily and makes great curls. Part of handle does get in the way but you learn to work around it.</li>
