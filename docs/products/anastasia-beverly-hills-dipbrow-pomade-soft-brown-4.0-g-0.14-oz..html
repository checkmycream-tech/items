            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This pomade is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really get the perfect carved brow with this and the brow wiz and Pro pencil.  </li>
            <li>This color is a warm brown with reddish undertones.  </li>
            <li>It is a quality high end product and as a brunette with highlights this is the perfect color.</li>
            <li>I have the Anastasia brow powder duo in Medium Brown and it works great, just not in the hot weather.  </li>
            <li>I advise using a very fine angled brush to apply this, the thinner and stiffer the better.  </li>
            <li>The dip brow glides on very smoothly and lasts all day until I wash my makeup off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used  : )</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>

            <li>and I love this more than anything I will continue to order this forever</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So much better than an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I love this shade.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this..</li>
            <li>It will work better for ladies with more fuller eyebrows</li>
            <li>LOVE IT ...</li>
            <li>one better</li>
            <li>I was able to remove it quite easily with a baby wipe.</li>
            <li>I daintily dip my brush and then wipe it off on the back of my hand before applying to my brows.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt come off that easily with oily skin or water but it will smudge or come off depending on how you touch it.</li>
            <li>So easy does on amount applied until you get desired effect.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and evenly, and is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I fill my eyebrows with this to have light ash brows.</li>
            <li>ENOUGH SAID LOL</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the way Dipbrow works, I just need to find the right color.  </li>
            <li>okay, however, I&#x27;m still in search of the right eyebrow tools for me.  </li>
            <li>And yet, if you make a mistake, it can be wiped off easily if you&#x27;re quick about it</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eyebrow pomade!</li>
            <li>I use a Japonesque travel brow brush, which is pretty fine</li>
            <li>This is OK but nothing I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>it looks so natural, I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>&amp; after I purchased this I realized famous people wear this &amp; professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li>and I have never found anything easier to use or more natural looking.</li>
            <li>I thought Soft Brown would work better.  </li>
            <li>The pot is a decent size and will last years, so it&#x27;s a good beauty buy.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my brows in line and adds just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>I loved this color for dark brown eyebrows</li>
            <li>Make sure to order a shade lighter than your actual brow hair or you could end up with sharpie looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Color was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Liked it, just would use at nite since it is a bit darker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Love Anastasia products especially the dip brow.</li>
            <li>The same great review I did with the other color.</li>
            <li>My hair is a warm dark blond with a lot of gold in it so this color didn&#x27;t work too well for me.  </li>
            <li>I was so ready to try it since YouTube bloggers all rave about it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>I do use the spooly on the back of my Anastasia brush to help my brows look more natural and then set it with my Anastasia brow gel.</li>
            <li>and it is perfect if ur eyebrows natural color is black or dark brown</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it anymore!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it goes on smooth and you can control whether you want a dramatic or natural look.</li>
            <li>I like the new medium brown</li>
            <li>It goes on snooth and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little too light</li>
            <li>I apply this right after my foundation but before loose powder.  </li>
            <li>This is a much lighter color than chocolate (which also has a red undertone I&#x27;ve since discovered), which I was going to get until I saw soft brown.</li>
            <li>so I decided to get the soft brown</li>
            <li>Also small or fine tip brush is a must.</li>
            <li>Quickly replaced my previous eyebrow routine with this!</li>
            <li>Mine are kind of faded with age and coloring them made me go through a few days of very dark brows (not real natural looking).  </li>
            <li>Only concern is big learning curve to get correct amount of gel to achieve natural look.</li>

            <li> Only concern is big learning curve to get correct amount of gel to achieve natural look.</li>
            <li> It looks like the size of the product will last a long time too judging by how little you really need to use.  </li>
            <li> I use it every single day</li>
            <li> so I had recently purchased the dark brown</li>
            <li> My brows are still a neutral brown and Soft Brown isn&#x27;t dark enough but with the red undertone, it&#x27;s clearly the wrong color.  </li>
            <li> For easiest use scoop out a small amount onto the lid and spread it into a small section on the lid so that it get distributed onto the brush, then make light small stokes onto the eyebrow to the shape you desire.</li>
            <li> (I have very dark brown hair but colored it with blonde ambre&#x27;)</li>
            <li> if you only need to fill in a few spots</li>
            <li> as expected</li>
            <li> albeit darker than expected.</li>
            <li> I use this dip brow with the Anastasia brush, but be careful use this product sparingly</li>
            <li> Sweat and water resistant, if you rub while wet it sometimes comes off.</li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> In other words, you can tell I&#x27;ve done something a bit drastic.  </li>
            <li> works well but a little too heavy for daily use.</li>
            <li> and it was too dark for me</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and thought this would be lighter than the dark chocolate</li>
            <li> yet the color is ashy and dark anyhow.</li>
            <li> I am a little worried</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, it will stay on until I wash my face.</li>
            <li> This product was a total game changer for me.</li>
            <li> Its not easy to apply unless your an expert using it.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, however, you need very little product and too much will result in a very fake drawn-on look.  </li>
            <li> The only thing thats disappointing is that i thought this product would come off with oil skin or water.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color 😱</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t end up having angry eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This product works so well and does not look like a fake line drawn in with a pencil.  </li>
            <li> How can anyone write a bad review of Anasasia?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this brown pomade!!  Best brown color I&#x27;ve used  : )</li>
            <li> Great product. Stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> okay so I had recently purchased the dark brown and it was too dark for me, I have chestnut hair so I decided to get the soft brown and it is perfect if ur eyebrows natural color is black or dark brown this is the one because it looks like ur not wearing any eyebrow shadow. it looks so natural, I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I love the color I really get the perfect carved brow with this and the brow wiz and Pro pencil.  All from Anatasia BH</li>
            <li> I love this product, it goes on smooth and you can control whether you want a dramatic or natural look. The only thing thats disappointing is that i thought this product would come off with oil skin or water. It doesnt come off that easily with oily skin or water but it will smudge or come off depending on how you touch it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Way better than pencil or powder. Definetly worth the money. I have bleach blonde hair and I fill my eyebrows with this to have light ash brows. No red undertones and once it dries it does not rub off or smear</li>
            <li> Anastasia is always a great product</li>
            <li> Love this product. Make sure to order a shade lighter than your actual brow hair or you could end up with sharpie looking eyebrows. If you have sparse brows you need this in your life. if you only need to fill in a few spots I&#x27;d go iwth the ABH pencil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The best for brows</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my brows. &amp; it stays on even after being in water</li>
            <li> Great product ! as expected</li>
            <li> Love this pomade! It helps keep my brows in line and adds just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> does yours say made in PRC instead of made in China ? I am a little worried</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works well in humid weather.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for eyebrows ever!  I&#x27;ve tried many many many things and I love this more than anything I will continue to order this forever</li>
            <li> albeit darker than expected.</li>
            <li> Color was exactly what I was looking for. It goes on really smoothly and evenly, and is really easy to apply. Stays on all day. Quickly replaced my previous eyebrow routine with this!</li>
            <li> Will buy again, love the color!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color 😱</li>
            <li> If I had known that the product was made in China I would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great quality</li>
            <li> Even better result than the brow wiz and lasts longer too! Constantly getting compliments on my brows!</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate this 10 stars, Anastasia Beverly Hills seems to make everything she makes turn to gold. This is the perfect eyebrow color for me (I have very dark brown hair but colored it with blonde ambre&#x27;) It&#x27;s not too dark and not too light. The dip brow glides on very smoothly and lasts all day until I wash my makeup off. This product also lasts forever. I use this dip brow with the Anastasia brush, but be careful use this product sparingly so you don&#x27;t end up having angry eyebrows. For easiest use scoop out a small amount onto the lid and spread it into a small section on the lid so that it get distributed onto the brush, then make light small stokes onto the eyebrow to the shape you desire. I do use the spooly on the back of my Anastasia brush to help my brows look more natural and then set it with my Anastasia brow gel. This is one of my holy grail beauty products and I will buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, stays on until you take it off. Sweat and water resistant, if you rub while wet it sometimes comes off. Only concern is big learning curve to get correct amount of gel to achieve natural look. So easy does on amount applied until you get desired effect. Also small or fine tip brush is a must.</li>
            <li> I honestly only bought this because I didn&#x27;t want a Powdery eyebrow fill in. &amp; after I purchased this I realized famous people wear this &amp; professional makeup artists. I use it everyday, it will stay on until I wash my face. It&#x27;s a perfect pasty texture &amp; it works AWESOME. Also, the color was perfect.</li>
            <li> So much better than an eyebrow pencil.  This used with a brush (purchased separately on Amazon) make my eyebrows look great.  Mine are kind of faded with age and coloring them made me go through a few days of very dark brows (not real natural looking).  This product works so well and does not look like a fake line drawn in with a pencil.  It looks like the size of the product will last a long time too judging by how little you really need to use.  I am throwing away the color and the pencil and sticking with this.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that has happened to eyebrows since the tweezer or Audrey Hepburn. buy it! This product was a total game changer for me. I have used every big name eyebrow liner, gel and powder and I have never found anything easier to use or more natural looking.</li>
            <li> Liked it, just would use at nite since it is a bit darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> This color is a warm brown with reddish undertones.  I had been using Blond but it&#x27;s a little too light and I have since darkened my hair a level, so I thought Soft Brown would work better.  It didn&#x27;t.  The fashion magazines say that for blonds,  the brows should be two shades darker than the hair. My hair is a warm dark blond with a lot of gold in it so this color didn&#x27;t work too well for me.  My brows are still a neutral brown and Soft Brown isn&#x27;t dark enough but with the red undertone, it&#x27;s clearly the wrong color.  In other words, you can tell I&#x27;ve done something a bit drastic.  On the plus side, however, you need very little product and too much will result in a very fake drawn-on look.  I daintily dip my brush and then wipe it off on the back of my hand before applying to my brows.  This seems to work well.  This is a much lighter color than chocolate (which also has a red undertone I&#x27;ve since discovered), which I was going to get until I saw soft brown. I think Medium Brown is the way to go.  I have the Anastasia brow powder duo in Medium Brown and it works great, just not in the hot weather.  I have oily skin and Dipbrow lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t change color at all.  It stays put.  And yet, if you make a mistake, it can be wiped off easily if you&#x27;re quick about it and you can start over.  I apply this right after my foundation but before loose powder.  The powder seems to help the Dipbrow set.  My brows are sparse in places and Dipbrow helps to emphasize them, giving my face balance.  I advise using a very fine angled brush to apply this, the thinner and stiffer the better.  I use a Japonesque travel brow brush, which is pretty fine but I may buy an Anastasia brush eventually.  You need a minuscule amount of product for each application.  The pot is a decent size and will last years, so it&#x27;s a good beauty buy.  All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the way Dipbrow works, I just need to find the right color.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The same great review I did with the other color.</li>
            <li> works well but a little too heavy for daily use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this shade. I love this product. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Color is good. A little difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Its ANASTASIA BEVERLY HILLS!!!! ENOUGH SAID LOL</li>
            <li> After trying multiple brands of eyebrow pencils, powders, gels etc. I&#x27;ve finally found the one! This pomade is amazing. It goes on snooth and looks very natural. It doesn&#x27;t come off until you want it to. I was able to remove it quite easily with a baby wipe. This is by far my favorite eyebrow pomade!</li>
            <li> I just got my Anastasia Dipbrow , and the package came in perfect condition and I cannot wait to try it out !</li>
            <li> absolutely love this..I put it on and it stays all day!!</li>
            <li> All these items where great</li>
            <li> Love Anastasia products especially the dip brow. My brows are flawless with the dip brow pomade.</li>
            <li> It will work better for ladies with more fuller eyebrows</li>
            <li> I use it every single day</li>
            <li> This is OK but nothing I can&#x27;t live without. I was so ready to try it since YouTube bloggers all rave about it. I have medium brown hair and thought this would be lighter than the dark chocolate so I got this one. But a little goes a long way yet the color is ashy and dark anyhow. Its not easy to apply unless your an expert using it. I can&#x27;t seem to get it to fill up areas that I need it on. Maybe next time I will try a different color.</li>
            <li> How can anyone write a bad review of Anasasia? It is a quality high end product and as a brunette with highlights this is the perfect color. Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> I loved this color for dark brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> I like this pomade okay, however, I&#x27;m still in search of the right eyebrow tools for me.  I think drawing eyebrows are so personal that it takes practice to find what works on you.  I would probably purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> amazing !! LOVE IT ...</li>
            <li> Perfect for lighter hair but two light for me I like the new medium brown one better</li>
            <li> Love it! It stays on all day! I no longer have to worry about it wiping off. This stuff is a godsend!</li>
            <li> Just like the one in stores ! Great product</li>
