            <li> Update:  I recently ordered the Vibrant Pink in hopes of having a slightly darker but still natural color for a different look, however, I received the regular pink instead.  It&#x27;s a great product, but not what I paid for.  I&#x27;m hoping to resolve the matter with the seller and get the project I ordered.  Will update when appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:  I love this product, it is the only powder brand I will use.  Works amazing for everything from mixing with color powders and glitters to 3D art.  Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and isn&#x27;t runny either.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It flows beautifully with ease and is easy to control.  Be sure to wait until it is completely dry before you try to smooth the finish.

            <li> This is MY favorite brand of acrylic powder to use. I&#x27;ve used everything from very high end to the very cheap. After all of them I still prefer this Ez flow  brand.</li>
            <li> This acrylic is a very good acrylic good for beginners. The only reason why I give this product a 3 is because when I opened my package there was acrylic powder every where, as I unwrapped the product I noticed that there was a crack in the jar.</li>
