            <li>I love this product and will probably continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and the light smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I do not find the Perricone products any more helpful than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>came quickly and was as represented.</li>
            <li>I see no difference in what the claims are or my own visual skin firmness.</li>
            <li>The hipe and the cost of this product doesn&#x27;t  work any better than my regular skin products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However,  I noticed results the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>Botox and definitely plastic surgery are really the way to go if affordable; I do not believe that this is a magic formula in any way.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change after using almost the entire jar</li>
            <li>After 30 days the only true results came from a $130 debit to my bank account.</li>

            <li> So expensive and it didn&#x27;t even do anything.</li>
            <li> Have applied twice a day for 2 weeks. Notice very little improvement.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see the result...hopefully soon...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any significant change after using almost the entire jar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see if I see any results</li>
            <li> Saw noticeable changes in my neck!</li>
            <li> came quickly and was as represented. Will wait for results to post more info. Update  to follow after I have used it long enough.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me that any store-bought cream wouldn&#x27;t do. I actually gave two jars a try, so I did use it for quite a while. Sadly, I do not find the Perricone products any more helpful than the cheaper ones. Botox and definitely plastic surgery are really the way to go if affordable; I do not believe that this is a magic formula in any way.</li>
            <li> Nice scent! Otherwise, a major disappointment. The price leads one to believe the product is superior. After 30 days the only true results came from a $130 debit to my bank account.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different products all my life. I am now 51 years old and have lots of sun damage on my neck so I thought I would give this a try.  Been using it everyday for nearly 3 weeks.  I saw no improvement in any way shape&lt;br /&gt;Or form.&lt;br /&gt;Il stick with my vitamin c oils and RX systems which I love.&lt;br /&gt;C ya perricone line.  Won&#x27;t ever buy u again.</li>
            <li> Love this product since others can see that it is working</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the light smell of this product. Not sure the results are worth the price when other less expensive products seem to help the neck area as much.</li>
            <li> Have used for a number of years would not be without it</li>
            <li> It has a very annoying fishy odor</li>
            <li> absolute must purchase works great on my chin area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since Dr Perricone invented it. I use it morning and night. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> The hipe and the cost of this product doesn&#x27;t  work any better than my regular skin products. I see no difference in what the claims are or my own visual skin firmness. I&#x27;ll stick to my other tried and true skin care.</li>
            <li> Too  soon to see any results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and have not seen any discernable difference in my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone however and will see if there is any difference in how I look.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 4 star simply because I did not like the business practices of the company. Was sold all the creams for a payment of 59.99 and later on they said that they sent a 3 month aupply. So the 59.99 became 194 plus taxes.&lt;br /&gt;However,  I noticed results the first time I tried it. I used it  on my neck and forehead. My complexion has also crear up and my neck and forehead is way smoother. I love this product and will probably continue to use it. I&#x27;ll just have.to buy it on Amazon from now on.</li>
