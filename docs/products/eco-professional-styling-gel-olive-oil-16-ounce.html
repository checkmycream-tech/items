            <li>They all still latch on to the hair and plasticize it, and in many cases work against moisture as they are not moisturizers, but plasticizing emollients and moisturizing agents that need to work in conjunction with water in order to be effective in hydration.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for defining my natural curl pattern</li>
            <li>I have very fine 3b/c curls</li>

            <li>I will elaborate on why this is what this gel does</li>
            <li>source is reliable despite being on yahoo answers, as it was answered by a top contributor in the chemistry section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer.</li>
            <li>Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein</li>
            <li>this can be changing my hair&#x27;s ph, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>just be safe and shook it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love this product, wen</li>
            <li>I love this gel</li>
            <li>then you\\&quot;ll love this.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Always will love this product</li>
            <li>I chose this because it was more product then the Jam, and it has olive oil in it, which I figured would be more beneficial to my hair.</li>
            <li>it has some good ingredients, I like that it has glycerin and that the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li>The gel has really nice hold and the smell has a very light perfume scent that I love it just has like a fresh light scent..</li>
            <li>If it worked for my edges as it does my curly hair I would have given it five stars, regardless this is a great gel for natural girls!</li>
            <li>Great styling options for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>But it was very good for when I wanted to sleek back my hair into a ponytail.</li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>Great for doing 2 or 3 strand twist with natural hair.</li>
            <li>no flaking and it holds great on my natural hair</li>
            <li>Many People recommened it as a protein free gel.</li>
            <li>Great gel to old hair with.</li>
            <li>No alcohol, much more eco friendly, made from olive oil... etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 5 yrs now, and I honestly cannot recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best product in terms of price, ingredients, performance and availability (retailers).  </li>
            <li>Light hold not flakey with a very mild smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product, has a great hold without making my hair dry, flaky or crunchy.</li>
            <li>method and setting my hair, I found that I needed some kind of gel to control the fly away ends and to smooth down my damaged edges.  </li>
            <li>Still this gel is a very stable product for my hair routine and is alcohol free love it!</li>
            <li>I used this to smooth my hair into one.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a cheap alternative but its not.</li>
            <li>I began to read up on people who experienced similar reactions and had concluded the protein in this gel was to blame.</li>
            <li>The price is well worth it to know my hair is healthy and thriving.</li>
            <li>I put my hair in a bun and my edges are so laid and smooth</li>
            <li>my hair was laid and smooth with this gel...</li>
            <li>YOU NEVER SUSPECTED, CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC SOURCES POSTED, ALONG WITH CONCLUSIONS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but wen I use this product my 4a section smooth out and blend to a 3c.</li>
            <li>After you remove the scarf you have a smooth ponytail and/or</li>
            <li>Seems gentle but effective</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product, but I think it works better on longer hair.</li>
            <li>The hold is pretty great but don&#x27;t expect silky bouncy or soft hair.</li>
            <li>Holds my natural hair very well and creates a beautiful wave pattern i have 4c hair</li>
            <li>Peace of mind is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>I think that this one is great as it does not make my hair feel dry after use</li>
            <li>I like the clean feeling</li>
            <li>nice, soft hold with no flakes!</li>
            <li>WHAT THE WHAT)? I could have gotten this at my local beauty supply 4$ cheaper but its all good</li>
            <li>I am hispanic &amp; have thick curly hair &amp; it is the best gel i&#x27;ve tried EVER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again...</li>
            <li>I love this gel sooo much.</li>
            <li>that its cool helps my curls shine</li>
            <li>and i still have a full jar</li>
            <li>It smells good and is probably better for your hair than regular gel, but it does not hold very well on stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>, the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not.</li>

            <li>My 3rd purchase of same bucket, this is best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It doesnt flake too much even with the big globs of gel i use lol.</li>
            <li>I have to many product w/ high ph, and I&#x27;m not using anything to balance my hair&#x27;s ph</li>
            <li>I have to many product w/ high ph, and I&#x27;m not using anything to balance my hair&#x27;s ph</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for curly girls who have 3a-c hair, especially if your hair is fine!!</li>
            <li>This product does a great job at making a neat bun, BUT i needed to use another gel along with this one to get my edges to lay down.</li>
            <li>It is great for my short natural hair and it smells very nice and not real oil.</li>
            <li>love this gel, it leaves my hair super soft and controls my frizz and flyaway all day.</li>
            <li>I have been using this gel for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t experienced any flakes or loss of hold.</li>
            <li>The top off this eco professional styling gel was broke</li>
            <li>likes item , useful for my needs</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Ethanolamine is an organic compound that is naturally found in coconut oil and is a primary amine and primary alcohol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068</li>
            <li>much proves it.</li>
            <li>much proves it.</li>
            <li>I got so many complements, even ordered some for friends Who are going natural.</li>
            <li>swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>It comes from coconut, so it must not be denatured right?</li>
            <li>The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact</li>
            <li>The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact</li>
            <li>the consistency is just right</li>
            <li>I liked this product when i first made the big chop</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all, I have fuzzy hair and at my edges I was hoping for some hold but at least it was A moisturizer that would soften the new growth around my edges, so this product wasnt the one for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing you will find is that is turns white when you use with any type of oil based product, but once it dries it&#x27;s shiny and with great hold.  </li>
            <li>I was really waiting for this one and I have to say that the wait was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>I will certainly be back to buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>it works pretty well on my hair.</li>
            <li>its the first one ive used from this line.</li>
            <li>first i just apply coconut oil and cantu pudding.</li>
            <li>The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed.</li>
            <li>it came to function, The blue eco was alright-- gave shine, definition, and it also gave me more Hair Loss.</li>

            <li>I bought this not knowing how much it could do!</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite out of the entire eco line.</li>
            <li>Held good but dried out my hair.</li>
            <li>I loved this gel because it held firm</li>
            <li>My hair follicles are damaged, the bald spot is completely smooth bare.</li>
            <li>My hair follicles are damaged, the bald spot is completely smooth bare.</li>
            <li>Better than edge control by a long shot!</li>
            <li>I tried this product out of pure curiosity</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, holds very well (like a strong mousse, actually), does not flake...</li>
            <li>/&gt;it took me a very long time to notice what was in this product that was directly agitating what I assumed to be my protein sensitivity, since they marketed themselves as protein free and alcohol free.</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing and defining natural hair (black natural hair)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying to find this gel on foot first.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>My shipment of the Eco Styler Gel came at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>When i opened the box, the jar was wet, and I washed it off, noticing a crack in jar from top to bottom, so I&#x27;m transferring to another</li>
            <li>the wash n go effect as much as the Argan oil one does.</li>
            <li>but if I don&#x27;t put any product in my hair it will look very frizzy and undefined.</li>
            <li>This worked wonders and holds our hair very well.  </li>
            <li>is that it really holds throughout the day,</li>
            <li>this does very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and it holds my Kinky hair very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my daughters coily hair</li>
            <li>I much prefer ICE Fantasia Gel to the Eco Style Gel.</li>
            <li>this will to set the hair in place for the whole day.</li>
            <li>When the gel drys off it makes my hair very flaky.</li>
            <li>but it absolutely did not give me the hold I needed, that I was hoping for seeing as how it is a gel.</li>
            <li>Flakes will happen if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I dont really like for wash and goes, but then again i dont really like gels, but if i had to pick one</li>
            <li>The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice hold overall, however it does flake once dry.</li>
            <li>It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li>It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li>it is the more it WONT lay it down at all)</li>
            <li>but more for slicking down hair for ponytails or baby hair</li>
            <li>Just make sure after you apply the gel that you wrap your edges down with a satin scarf for about 10 min...</li>
            <li>I love amazon and it is definitely my go to place to get items cheaper, but this is definitely not one of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also the main dissolving agent in lye relaxers.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars out of five only because I have to add a little oil to make it more smooth and because it&#x27;s not 100% natural but</li>
            <li>If it is b/c the ph is too high, I&#x27;ve lowered it w/ the acidic vinegar.</li>
            <li>If it is b/c the ph is too high, I&#x27;ve lowered it w/ the acidic vinegar.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using a lot of gel because normally my edges are fine once I use a wet brush.  </li>
            <li>I applied this product on dry second day hair and it worked perfectly, and left no flakes, crumbs or mess.  </li>
            <li>While I was in search of products to use as a replacement, I ran across Wet line gel, which claimed to be alcohol free, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This product really works in natural hair ...</li>
            <li>is a normal size tube</li>
            <li>but we only get one head of hair decide if ruining it for a one day hairstyle is worth it.</li>
            <li>I normally use the &amp;#34;African Pride Silky Edges&amp;#34;, but a friend recommended this so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>As a newly transitioning natural this product works really well with nu hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a Black women with natural hair and as you can image...it can be challenging to style my hair and achieve a sleek look.</li>
            <li>Have not used it yet, as I am using a different product right now that is works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on what I learned, too much high ph can actually DISINTEGRATE the hair, which is exactly what was happening to me.</li>

            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about flaking and it holds your edges down quite nicely all day long.</li>
            <li>It works wonders for natural hair!</li>
            <li>form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is  must have gel for my natural hair!  </li>
            <li>Have been since I was small, so much more so since I had dreads for a while).</li>
            <li>It is a pretty big jar of the gel for the price.</li>
            <li>If your a person who likes you edges to be slicked down and smooth....</li>
            <li>Eco styler gel has a pretty high ph of 7, coupled with conditioners and other products I use that also have high ph, (like shea moisture conditioner which i leave in)</li>

            <li>I know that while reading the other reviews on this product you will find ones that say that it is amazing that it lays down your edges and defines curls</li>
            <li>I have an anti-dandruff shampoo/conditioner that I wash this out with every day or every other day (because black people aren&#x27;t supposed to wash their hair every day, but I don&#x27;t like leaving any kind of hair grease that isn&#x27;t specifically a moisturizer</li>
            <li>The fact that this is a clear gel means it was heated, and therefore denatured.</li>
            <li>These gels wouldn&#x27;t be this clear if they didn&#x27;t contain denatured alcohol.</li>
            <li>Once heated, that is when it forms a clear, gel consistency.</li>
            <li>This is where these products holding abilities and clear consistency come</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mix the product with anything, I have been natural for about 3 years now, 4b/c</li>
            <li>curls passion fruit paste works wonders and is natural and as for a gel/ jelly that will define your curls</li>
            <li>I have ordered this three times this far.</li>
            <li>Purchased because I have seen a lot of tutorials in which women with natural hair have used it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do my natural hair and I</li>
            <li>Yes, if you use too much or over use without washing your hair in between, or if its used with a product that does not compliment the gel&#x27;s components the you may get white flakes.</li>
            <li>I use it to define my natural hair curl pattern.</li>
            <li>it makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have used it ever since I became natural which was 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Now over a year later I find that this products really doesn&#x27;t absorb well when i do my braids or kinky twists.</li>
            <li>Might work for others bc of natural ingredients</li>
            <li>/&gt;The alcohol does have a natural resistance to turning into salt and ammonia, however.</li>
            <li>Very drying and in 3rd ingredient.</li>
            <li>The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had thinning on my edges, and a piece of hair near that nickle sized bald spot that still hasn&#x27;t gone away</li>
            <li>I just wanted it far away from me</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve had natural hair for 6 years.</li>
            <li>It was soft.</li>

            <li>It was soft.</li>
            <li>It also does not build up (unless you use too much) and you can wake up the next morning with no residue or anything showing that you had gel in your hair the day before.</li>
            <li>My daughter has natural hair</li>
            <li>However, I went on and discontinued use, clarified my hair, and within two washes my hair was back to normal, shedding normal amounts.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to slick down my edges, I don&#x27;t really care much about curl definition, but i can&#x27;t even do that.</li>

            <li>I applied it right out of the shower with soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t particularly dry, it was pretty moisturized, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>hopefully all natural to do the exact same thing this does for your edges especially with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Got it for the first time and because i am trying to be as natural as possible, I will be making the flax seed gel in the future.</li>
            <li>No matter if i used small amounts or more, or mixed it w/ oil or conditioner, it&#x27;s garbage.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve got tight 4b hair that gets more loose toward the nape of my neck, btw.</li>
            <li>I usually put some gel in the palm of my hand (maybe 1 tbsp), rub my hands together, and then smooth the product on both sides of my head.  </li>
            <li>It smells plain but not bad.</li>
            <li>The product is decent for my natural hair, but I can only use it unless I mix it with olive oil to combat the white flakes.</li>
            <li>african american and our hair is of a yaki texture and this held our styles very well without drying or breakage.  </li>
            <li>I explained last week in The 5 Most Common Mistakes</li>
            <li>but am willing to try it out without using any other product to see the outcome...</li>
            <li>more watery consistency, slightly opalescent, slightly cloudy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth edges that stay in place, but do not feel hard and has no flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I may try this gel again with different products or wait until my hair is totally natural.</li>
            <li>I just gave up on natural hair gels and holding creams and decided to purchase this product after watching reviews on Youtube and going to different hair sites.</li>
            <li>For those shorter or more stubborn pieces of hair, take gel in your fingertips and apply directly to that; 3) Then use a bristle brush to comb and smooth hair down, then place in ponytail (if that is desired style); and 3) Place a silk scarf around your head, tie it as tight as you can stand it, for at least 15-20 minutes (the scarf should be a long rectangular scarft that can wrap around twice).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s gonna take for the nickle sized spot near my edges to fill in, but it&#x27;s already been a year.</li>

            <li>It took several deep conditioning treatments and heavy leave in conditioners to get my hair back to a healthy lustrous black color.  </li>
            <li>it stiffen the hair itself, but did not hold it down to my scalp at all, no matter how much gel I applied to it.</li>
            <li>I am a African American female and I have been using natural hair products for five years now and my hair has grown to mid back length</li>
            <li>I have mixed textured 3A and 3B hair, and I live in a very dry environment.</li>
            <li>The only throw down was I had to pay so much in clearing it ...</li>

            <li> it has some good ingredients, I like that it has glycerin and that the first ingredient is water.</li>
            <li> The gel has really nice hold and the smell has a very light perfume scent that I love it just has like a fresh light scent..</li>

            <li> method and setting my hair, I found that I needed some kind of gel to control the fly away ends and to smooth down my damaged edges.  </li>
            <li> Still this gel is a very stable product for my hair routine and is alcohol free love it!</li>
            <li> I used this to smooth my hair into one.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cheap alternative but its not.</li>
            <li> I began to read up on people who experienced similar reactions and had concluded the protein in this gel was to blame.</li>
            <li> The price is well worth it to know my hair is healthy and thriving.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again...</li>
            <li> I love this gel sooo much.</li>
            <li> that its cool helps my curls shine</li>
            <li> and i still have a full jar</li>
            <li> It smells good and is probably better for your hair than regular gel, but it does not hold very well on stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> , the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not.</li>

            <li> I recommend this product for curly girls who have 3a-c hair, especially if your hair is fine!!</li>
            <li> This product does a great job at making a neat bun, BUT i needed to use another gel along with this one to get my edges to lay down.</li>
            <li> It is great for my short natural hair and it smells very nice and not real oil.</li>
            <li> love this gel, it leaves my hair super soft and controls my frizz and flyaway all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t experienced any flakes or loss of hold.</li>
            <li> The top off this eco professional styling gel was broke</li>
            <li> likes item , useful for my needs</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanolamine is an organic compound that is naturally found in coconut oil and is a primary amine and primary alcohol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068</li>
            <li> much proves it.</li>
            <li> much proves it.</li>
            <li> I got so many complements, even ordered some for friends Who are going natural.</li>
            <li> swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> It comes from coconut, so it must not be denatured right?</li>
            <li> The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact</li>
            <li> The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact</li>
            <li> the consistency is just right</li>
            <li> I liked this product when i first made the big chop</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all, I have fuzzy hair and at my edges I was hoping for some hold but at least it was A moisturizer that would soften the new growth around my edges, so this product wasnt the one for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing you will find is that is turns white when you use with any type of oil based product, but once it dries it&#x27;s shiny and with great hold.  </li>
            <li> I was really waiting for this one and I have to say that the wait was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I will certainly be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> it works pretty well on my hair.</li>
            <li> its the first one ive used from this line.</li>
            <li> first i just apply coconut oil and cantu pudding.</li>
            <li> The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed.</li>
            <li> it came to function, The blue eco was alright-- gave shine, definition, and it also gave me more Hair Loss.</li>

            <li> I bought this not knowing how much it could do!</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite out of the entire eco line.</li>
            <li> Held good but dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this gel because it held firm</li>
            <li> My hair follicles are damaged, the bald spot is completely smooth bare.</li>
            <li> My hair follicles are damaged, the bald spot is completely smooth bare.</li>
            <li> Better than edge control by a long shot!</li>
            <li> I tried this product out of pure curiosity</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, holds very well (like a strong mousse, actually), does not flake...</li>
            <li> /&gt;it took me a very long time to notice what was in this product that was directly agitating what I assumed to be my protein sensitivity, since they marketed themselves as protein free and alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing and defining natural hair (black natural hair)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying to find this gel on foot first.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> My shipment of the Eco Styler Gel came at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> When i opened the box, the jar was wet, and I washed it off, noticing a crack in jar from top to bottom, so I&#x27;m transferring to another</li>
            <li> the wash n go effect as much as the Argan oil one does.</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t put any product in my hair it will look very frizzy and undefined.</li>
            <li> This worked wonders and holds our hair very well.  </li>
            <li> is that it really holds throughout the day,</li>
            <li> this does very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake and it holds my Kinky hair very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my daughters coily hair</li>
            <li> I much prefer ICE Fantasia Gel to the Eco Style Gel.</li>
            <li> this will to set the hair in place for the whole day.</li>
            <li> When the gel drys off it makes my hair very flaky.</li>
            <li> but it absolutely did not give me the hold I needed, that I was hoping for seeing as how it is a gel.</li>
            <li> Flakes will happen if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I dont really like for wash and goes, but then again i dont really like gels, but if i had to pick one</li>
            <li> The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice hold overall, however it does flake once dry.</li>
            <li> It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li> it is the more it WONT lay it down at all)</li>
            <li> but more for slicking down hair for ponytails or baby hair</li>
            <li> Just make sure after you apply the gel that you wrap your edges down with a satin scarf for about 10 min...</li>
            <li> I love amazon and it is definitely my go to place to get items cheaper, but this is definitely not one of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also the main dissolving agent in lye relaxers.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars out of five only because I have to add a little oil to make it more smooth and because it&#x27;s not 100% natural but</li>
            <li> If it is b/c the ph is too high, I&#x27;ve lowered it w/ the acidic vinegar.</li>
            <li> If it is b/c the ph is too high, I&#x27;ve lowered it w/ the acidic vinegar.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using a lot of gel because normally my edges are fine once I use a wet brush.  </li>
            <li> I applied this product on dry second day hair and it worked perfectly, and left no flakes, crumbs or mess.  </li>
            <li> While I was in search of products to use as a replacement, I ran across Wet line gel, which claimed to be alcohol free, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product really works in natural hair ...</li>
            <li> is a normal size tube</li>
            <li> but we only get one head of hair decide if ruining it for a one day hairstyle is worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally use the &amp;#34;African Pride Silky Edges&amp;#34;, but a friend recommended this so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> As a newly transitioning natural this product works really well with nu hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a Black women with natural hair and as you can image...it can be challenging to style my hair and achieve a sleek look.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, as I am using a different product right now that is works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on what I learned, too much high ph can actually DISINTEGRATE the hair, which is exactly what was happening to me.</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about flaking and it holds your edges down quite nicely all day long.</li>

            <li> Have been since I was small, so much more so since I had dreads for a while).</li>
            <li> It is a pretty big jar of the gel for the price.</li>
            <li> If your a person who likes you edges to be slicked down and smooth....</li>
            <li> Eco styler gel has a pretty high ph of 7, coupled with conditioners and other products I use that also have high ph, (like shea moisture conditioner which i leave in)</li>

            <li> I know that while reading the other reviews on this product you will find ones that say that it is amazing that it lays down your edges and defines curls</li>
            <li> I have an anti-dandruff shampoo/conditioner that I wash this out with every day or every other day (because black people aren&#x27;t supposed to wash their hair every day, but I don&#x27;t like leaving any kind of hair grease that isn&#x27;t specifically a moisturizer</li>
            <li> The fact that this is a clear gel means it was heated, and therefore denatured.</li>
            <li> These gels wouldn&#x27;t be this clear if they didn&#x27;t contain denatured alcohol.</li>
            <li> Once heated, that is when it forms a clear, gel consistency.</li>
            <li> This is where these products holding abilities and clear consistency come</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mix the product with anything, I have been natural for about 3 years now, 4b/c</li>
            <li> curls passion fruit paste works wonders and is natural and as for a gel/ jelly that will define your curls</li>
            <li> I have ordered this three times this far.</li>
            <li> Purchased because I have seen a lot of tutorials in which women with natural hair have used it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do my natural hair and I</li>
            <li> Yes, if you use too much or over use without washing your hair in between, or if its used with a product that does not compliment the gel&#x27;s components the you may get white flakes.</li>
            <li> I use it to define my natural hair curl pattern.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have used it ever since I became natural which was 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Now over a year later I find that this products really doesn&#x27;t absorb well when i do my braids or kinky twists.</li>
            <li> Might work for others bc of natural ingredients</li>
            <li> /&gt;The alcohol does have a natural resistance to turning into salt and ammonia, however.</li>
            <li> Very drying and in 3rd ingredient.</li>
            <li> The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> hopefully all natural to do the exact same thing this does for your edges especially with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Got it for the first time and because i am trying to be as natural as possible, I will be making the flax seed gel in the future.</li>

            <li> I usually put some gel in the palm of my hand (maybe 1 tbsp), rub my hands together, and then smooth the product on both sides of my head.  </li>
            <li> It smells plain but not bad.</li>
            <li> The product is decent for my natural hair, but I can only use it unless I mix it with olive oil to combat the white flakes.</li>

            <li> I explained last week in The 5 Most Common Mistakes</li>
            <li> but am willing to try it out without using any other product to see the outcome...</li>
            <li> more watery consistency, slightly opalescent, slightly cloudy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smooth edges that stay in place, but do not feel hard and has no flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I may try this gel again with different products or wait until my hair is totally natural.</li>
            <li> I just gave up on natural hair gels and holding creams and decided to purchase this product after watching reviews on Youtube and going to different hair sites.</li>
            <li> For those shorter or more stubborn pieces of hair, take gel in your fingertips and apply directly to that; 3) Then use a bristle brush to comb and smooth hair down, then place in ponytail (if that is desired style); and 3) Place a silk scarf around your head, tie it as tight as you can stand it, for at least 15-20 minutes (the scarf should be a long rectangular scarft that can wrap around twice).  </li>

            <li> It took several deep conditioning treatments and heavy leave in conditioners to get my hair back to a healthy lustrous black color.  </li>
            <li> it stiffen the hair itself, but did not hold it down to my scalp at all, no matter how much gel I applied to it.</li>

            <li> I have mixed textured 3A and 3B hair, and I live in a very dry environment.</li>
            <li> The only throw down was I had to pay so much in clearing it ...</li>
            <li> This product also made my hair stiff and it does flake, I didn&#x27;t have much flaking but it did flake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large tub and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> luckily I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have tried this product with two stand twist, braid outs, buns and all the other natural hair style.</li>

            <li> so when I need it to lay flat all day</li>
            <li> There would be times that I would spend an hour in the mirrior laying my curls down to have a smooth look for my ponytails or buns,I even tried tieing my hair down at night with heavy oils and natural creams but nothing laid my curls down</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry me out, holds curl which later softens after hair dries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are told this is a moderate irritant, and has been shown to be a human skin toxin or allergent, and expected to cause non-reproductive organ toxicity, and STUDIES SHOW has been linked to cancer.</li>
            <li> Salt is already drying, let alone putting the main ingredient used in relaxers in your product.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It is ethanolamine&#x27;s primary alcohol characteristic that makes it possible to be suspended in a soy Oil base as neither sodium carbonate (a primary salt) or ammonia (a primary base)</li>
            <li> I had the gut feeling it was triethanolamine, which was proven to be an irritant, but was unable to find specific testimony, so I was more or less speculating maybe it had something to do with the alkaline ph at the time.</li>

            <li> but unfortunately I could not find a natural hair product that could lay my very curley wavy hair down while putting my hair in protective styles like buns and ponytails.</li>
            <li> Beware, pen spring tight 4b/ 4c curly girls, be vigilant and as soon as you notice your hair thinning, drop the product, it only gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/2/13&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>

            <li> The gel did not leave my hair crunchy;however, after continued use my hair became dry and this product turned my black hair to a whitish grey in color.</li>
            <li> Again, as in my other reviews I wanted a gel that wouldn&#x27;t dry our hair and didn&#x27;t contain alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Does hard well as the clear version</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c natural hair, I was looking for some type of gel that wouldn&#x27;t flake or leave my hair hard as a brick.</li>
            <li> and my mom is white, so i didnt want to use something to harsh on my hair</li>
            <li> i ordered the pink and cocktail ones too</li>
            <li> But in the end it remained a mystery that closed the book</li>
            <li> or i wonder if its because am using it on wet hair....</li>
            <li> I continued to use this product for three months, slowly realizing I was losing 3, 4 times the amount of hair I naturally shed in the shower.</li>
            <li> Because I am a black female with natural hair it is beyond hard to find a gel that will lay down my edges and make a neat bun.</li>
            <li> but i didnt want to use something not strong enough if that makes scence.</li>
            <li> Thick viscosity, sharply transparent clear color.</li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Some common products in which triethanolamine is found are liquid laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids, general cleaners, hand cleaners, polishes, metalworking fluids, paints, shaving cream and printing inks\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I read other reviews that warned against this product causing bald spots.</li>
            <li> that has hold to it but does not contain alcohol or other harmful products.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s being charged is what I usually pay for the giant container.</li>
            <li> I was warned by other users that this gel flaked, but I didn&#x27;t listen.</li>
            <li> but it does flake other then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the DRYING effect that can lead to other problems.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;futurederm(dot)com/2012/04/19</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;The triethanolamine NEUTRALIZES fatty acids, adjusts and buffers the pH, and SOLUBILISES oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water.</li>

            <li> My tip is to either LOC method your hair or use a heavy moisturizer before applying the gel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works really well. Dries nicely without drying my hair out.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel for natural hair that I have found.  It&#x27;s alcohol-free and works well with most leave in conditioner.  The only thing you will find is that is turns white when you use with any type of oil based product, but once it dries it&#x27;s shiny and with great hold.  When used as a braid out, it can be refreshed with just a spritz of leave in conditioner or plain water.</li>
            <li> love this gel its a really good gel it pops my curls alot and its one of those gels that has moisture too love it</li>
            <li> The gel is ok. I have long thick transitioning hair and this gel seems to dry out my hair and I also notice itchy scalp. I may try this gel again with different products or wait until my hair is totally natural.</li>
            <li> Silly me i bought this online thinking it was a big tube lol but when it came i was like ( WHAT THE WHAT)? I could have gotten this at my local beauty supply 4$ cheaper but its all good not the buyers fault i should have looked at the size 16 oz  is a normal size tube although the gel was a good price understandably the shipping was what cost the most! Still this gel is a very stable product for my hair routine and is alcohol free love it!</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware. This product causes your hair to thin, break and fall out. DO NOT PURCHASE. I used this to smooth my hair into one. At first it was great but after 3 months, I noticed that my edges were thinning. Then I read other reviews that warned against this product causing bald spots. I threw all away and purchased my usual kinky Curly gel. I thought this was a cheap alternative but its not. DO NOT USE ON AN EXTENDED BASIS. This product is bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> I was really waiting for this one and I have to say that the wait was well worth it.</li>
            <li> My shipment of the Eco Styler Gel came at a reasonable time. Although, I thought I was getting the 16oz. I actually got the 32oz. The product is decent for my natural hair, but I can only use it unless I mix it with olive oil to combat the white flakes. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product, but I think it works better on longer hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a banging wash &amp; go!</li>
            <li> Always had use a diffent gel but love this one</li>
            <li> nice, soft hold with no flakes!</li>
            <li> When i opened the box, the jar was wet, and I washed it off, noticing a crack in jar from top to bottom, so I&#x27;m transferring to another jar.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, just bummed jar was cracked.&lt;br /&gt;It was in a plastic baggy, glad about that!&lt;br /&gt;In the pic you can see crack going through the &amp;#34;E&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Goes all the way down. It&#x27;s just a hairline crack but enough to need to change it out, as it did leak in transient.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite wash and go products. I&#x27;m not sure why this is causing some people to have thinning/balding but I&#x27;ve never had that issue. My tip is to either LOC method your hair or use a heavy moisturizer before applying the gel. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but the scent reminds me of the dust in a froot loops bag (is that weird)</li>
            <li> leaves edges of hair dry and flaky.  if you don&#x27;t mind white flakes seen on your edges as dandruff, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I wanted to love it because I saw nothing but great reviews! Ummm no such highlight. I have tried this product with two stand twist, braid outs, buns and all the other natural hair style. I always end up with white flakes and it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair. I don&#x27;t think I am doing it wrong I don&#x27;t mix the product with anything, I have been natural for about 3 years now, 4b/c hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product is for thicker hair, maybe more 3a/2b hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all, I have fuzzy hair and at my edges I was hoping for some hold but at least it was A moisturizer that would soften the new growth around my edges, so this product wasnt the one for me.</li>
            <li> I know that while reading the other reviews on this product you will find ones that say that it is amazing that it lays down your edges and defines curls and yes it does do all of that sorta ( the edges depends on what type of hair you have the thicker/ coarser it is the more it WONT lay it down at all) but it is a very heavy duty product and each time i used it i kept thinking to myself that it was a very heavy duty product. i honestly thinik that you can find something better and hopefully all natural to do the exact same thing this does for your edges especially with thicker hair. curls passion fruit paste works wonders and is natural and as for a gel/ jelly that will define your curls Curls blueberry bliss jelly would do a excellent job. yes they may cost more but we only get one head of hair decide if ruining it for a one day hairstyle is worth it.</li>
            <li> This gel is great.It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t flake and it&#x27;s not sticky. definitely would recommend to my friends. product arrived when they said it would, plus they kept me up to date as to the deleivery.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does not make the hair hard.</li>
            <li> Love this gel - I used it extensively when I was growing out my relaxer, and then additionally while rocking my afro. Great for twist-outs and braid-outs. Not sticky, no residue. I&#x27;d also use it for wash-n-go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have used Kinky Curly, Ms. Jessie Curling Pudding, Bantu&#x27;s offering and who knows what else.  This is hands down the best product in terms of price, ingredients, performance and availability (retailers).  My regular routine is to wash &amp; shampoo with Shea Moisture and follow up with Eco Style(r).  This NEVER leaves my hair crunchy, flakes or dries my hair out.  It&#x27;s the perfect styling component.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. As a newly transitioning natural this product works really well with nu hair.  I have ordered this three times this far.</li>
            <li> Love it! I love this gel! It works wonders for natural hair! It&#x27;s a lot of product for a little money!</li>
            <li> My 3rd purchase of same bucket, this is best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Love it. Was very good, I used it for the kids n my hair and I  did had a lot of curls.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product looking for a gel that performed similarly to kinky curly. The results were not the same but still within the range of acceptable. I continued to use this product for three months, slowly realizing I was losing 3, 4 times the amount of hair I naturally shed in the shower. I began to read up on people who experienced similar reactions and had concluded the protein in this gel was to blame. Previously I had NEVER had a bad result from using proteins, so I cannot guarantee it was that. However, I went on and discontinued use, clarified my hair, and within two washes my hair was back to normal, shedding normal amounts. I will not recover the strands I lost for a long time, sadly :( luckily I have very long and thick hair so only I can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not using this for extended amounts of time. I&#x27;m back to kinky curly. The price is well worth it to know my hair is healthy and thriving. Peace of mind is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this gel but it doesn&#x27;t give me the wash n go effect as much as the Argan oil one does.</li>
            <li> This gel is phenomenal. I am hispanic &amp; have thick curly hair &amp; it is the best gel i&#x27;ve tried EVER. Doesnt dry me out, holds curl which later softens after hair dries. Just love it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave 3 stars because this is overpriced.....i just happened to stroll into a beauty supply and found a 24oz for only $2.99!!!!!!!!!! I love amazon and it is definitely my go to place to get items cheaper, but this is definitely not one of them. I highly recommend trying to find this gel on foot first.</li>
            <li> Because I am a black female with natural hair it is beyond hard to find a gel that will lay down my edges and make a neat bun. This product does a great job at making a neat bun, BUT i needed to use another gel along with this one to get my edges to lay down. If it worked for my edges as it does my curly hair I would have given it five stars, regardless this is a great gel for natural girls!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake/break hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine 3b/c curls and I was weary about trying a gel because it can leave my hair so crunchy and thin looking. Leave-ins tend to weigh my hair down but if I don&#x27;t put any product in my hair it will look very frizzy and undefined. The product feels a bit weird, almost like you are applying Vaseline to your hair! That scared me big time! But it is in no way greasy! When I tried the eco styler gel I applied it right out of the shower with soaking wet hair. I used about a quarter size amount on each side, finger combed it through, and then scrunched my curls up. I then put my hair in a towel to dry for about 20 minutes. Once I took my hair down I let me curls dry for another 1-2 hours. My curls look so healthy and defined! I take a blow dryer and just dry my hair for about a minute just to give it some volume and then take a pick comb and fluff it out. My hair looks so thick and my curls are not weighed down at all! I recommend this product for curly girls who have 3a-c hair, especially if your hair is fine!!</li>
            <li> This Gel was A Staple for me at one time until my crown and my Edges became really thin.I noticed that as Soon as I stopped using it my Edges started growing back in so Lesson Learned!!</li>
            <li> It does not hold and dries away as if it were never there. Purchased because I have seen a lot of tutorials in which women with natural hair have used it.  It doesn&#x27;t do my natural hair and I any good. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This gel is a good choice. No alcohol, much more eco friendly, made from olive oil... etc. Yes, if you use too much or over use without washing your hair in between, or if its used with a product that does not compliment the gel&#x27;s components the you may get white flakes. It happens. If you do experience flakes simply reevaluate your use, but don&#x27;t give up on the product. Trust me, anything that has alcohol in it is not good for your hair. Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Huge tub of gel! Very happy thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for hair gel... that has hold to it but does not contain alcohol or other harmful products. This is a difficult chore. I was happy to find this product has olive oil in it, but there is no hold what-so-ever. It&#x27;s cheap and worth a try, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again... sorry.</li>
            <li> Got it for the first time and because i am trying to be as natural as possible, I will be making the flax seed gel in the future.</li>
            <li> The top off this eco professional styling gel was broke</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel that gives me all day hold. It doesnt flake too much even with the big globs of gel i use lol. It smells plain but not bad. It does seem too itch to me after a while but i think i just have dry hair. I love this product and definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this gel sooo much. I use it on my hair everyday.I use it to define my natural hair curl pattern.It doesn&#x27;t dry or flakes It&#x27;s good to do a two strand twist out.And my hair don&#x27;t get dry it makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product It is great for my short natural hair and it smells very nice and not real oil.</li>
            <li> Again, as in my other reviews I wanted a gel that wouldn&#x27;t dry our hair and didn&#x27;t contain alcohol.  This worked wonders and holds our hair very well.  We are  african american and our hair is of a yaki texture and this held our styles very well without drying or breakage.  Will repeat the orders because I didn&#x27;t not find in my local beauty supply unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The product was mentioned on youtube and I decided to try it.  I have always used items that include olive oil and when I found out that Eco style gel included olive oil, I was extremely happy.  Great product and would recommend it to every women that needs to style her hair.  I will certainly be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> I received 3 instead of 4 of the eco styling gel that i had ordered and paid for. Besides the sizes of both the eco styling gel and coconut wash were 8 oz instead of 16 oz that i had ordered and paid for. This is the worst purchase experience that i have ever had with amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c natural hair, I was looking for some type of gel that wouldn&#x27;t flake or leave my hair hard as a brick. I found it! This gel is awesome, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the desired effect. Washes out well. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This gel is very good. I have used it ever since I became natural which was 4 years ago.  The low rating I&#x27;d for the price. What&#x27;s being charged is what I usually pay for the giant container.</li>
            <li> Great product for styling updo&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t have to worry about flaking and it holds your edges down quite nicely all day long. I would recommend eco styled gel.</li>
            <li> Holds my natural hair very well and creates a beautiful wave pattern i have 4c hair</li>
            <li> Held good but dried out my hair. Had to wash my hair several times the same day to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> Love this so much! Has a wonderful shine and I like the texture that it adds to my hair!</li>
            <li> I usted for years LA Looks Gel 10, a Friend of mine gave me a tube of this gel, what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this gel is that it really holds throughout the day, still in the afternoon it maintains its fresh-just-put look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it keeps my hair looking shinny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like The most is that it doesn&#x27;t flake in The afternoon When others starts flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This gel gives great hold without the flakes! I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great, no alcohol, great for my natural hair and there&#x27;s no flaking, I just love  this gel it works , get it</li>
            <li> good gel, but it is cheaper to buy in store. Great for smoothing and defining natural hair (black natural hair)</li>
            <li> I was warned by other users that this gel flaked, but I didn&#x27;t listen. It does indeed flake and it causes my scalp to itch horribly.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this gel for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t experienced any flakes or loss of hold. Inexpensive and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Dry natural black hair out, leaving it brittle and then comes the breakage.</li>
            <li> the gel works wonders and i love it but it does flake other then that its cool helps my curls shine and i still have a full jar and i bought this a while ago</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but it still leaves flakes in your hair I&#x27;m just looking for a product that don&#x27;t leave flakes</li>
            <li> I opened my box and my gel was all over the place how sad, now I have to find another container to keep this is will never order again</li>
            <li> Does hard well as the clear version</li>
            <li> it works pretty well on my hair. ive been looking at things to buy for my curls forever. my dad is black with a jerry curl lol and my mom is white, so i didnt want to use something to harsh on my hair but i didnt want to use something not strong enough if that makes scence. this does very well. its the first one ive used from this line. and it leaves no flakes and does not get hard. and they are bouncy. i ordered the pink and cocktail ones too and well see how that goes!!!!!! first i just apply coconut oil and cantu pudding.</li>
            <li> Great for doing 2 or 3 strand twist with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s natural. Last all day no flaking. Buy it, use it, love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this feel. It doesn&#x27;t flake and it holds my Kinky hair very well. Great for up do&#x27;s and twist outs!!</li>
            <li> I am a African American female and I have been using natural hair products for five years now and my hair has grown to mid back length but unfortunately I could not find a natural hair product that could lay my very curley wavy hair down while putting my hair in protective styles like buns and ponytails.There would be times that I would spend an hour in the mirrior laying my curls down to have a smooth look for my ponytails or buns,I even tried tieing my hair down at night with heavy oils and natural creams but nothing laid my curls down they would just pop up from out of my bun, which made it seem as though I didn&#x27;t even bother to do any type of grooming to my hair. I just gave up on natural hair gels and holding creams and decided to purchase this product after watching reviews on Youtube and going to different hair sites. I am glad that I purchased this gel it has some good ingredients, I like that it has glycerin and that the first ingredient is water. I put my hair in a bun and my edges are so laid and smooth there are no curls popping up all over my head and my wave pattern is nice and shiny..I did have to add just a subtle amount of my coconut oil to my hair because the gel was just a little hardning but after applying a dime size amount of my coconut oil my hair was laid and smooth with this gel...The gel has really nice hold and the smell has a very light perfume scent that I love it just has like a fresh light scent..I gave this product 4 stars out of five only because I have to add a little oil to make it more smooth and because it&#x27;s not 100% natural but either than that I will keep this gel as my go to gel from now on.</li>
            <li> no flaking and it holds great on my natural hair</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! Better than edge control by a long shot!</li>
            <li> I liked this product when i first made the big chop and my hair was starting to grow back. Now over a year later I find that this products really doesn&#x27;t absorb well when i do my braids or kinky twists. I always see a white residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> Gel arrived on time.  Have not used it yet, as I am using a different product right now that is works.</li>
            <li> This product will define your curls, but when it dries it will leave some white flakes in your hair. Had to wash this gel out of my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> I loved this gel because it held firm but it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard. It washes out very easy.</li>
            <li> Works great! No flakes.  Little bit goes a long way. Less chemicals than other hair gels. No alcohol.  for men or women.</li>
            <li> I use this with my TWA. Eco style gel gives it great texture and nice curl pattern. I have 3c hair.</li>
            <li> likes item , useful for my needs</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this besides putting on my baby hairs. It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t mix well with my other hair products so it leaves white flakes. The hold is pretty great but don&#x27;t expect silky bouncy or soft hair. It will leave a crunch after drying. It eventually goes away if you run your fingers through your hair but you run the risk of flaking. I have 3b/c hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It&#x27;s a large tub and a little goes a long way so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have it forever. Might work for others bc of natural ingredients but I&#x27;m not sold. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a styler but more for slicking down hair for ponytails or baby hair</li>
            <li> not really ma favorite coz is ma hair so crisp</li>

THE INGREDIENT YOU NEVER SUSPECTED, CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC SOURCES POSTED, ALONG WITH CONCLUSIONS.&lt;br /&gt;Why you may want avoid TEA in your water based hair products, depending on your hair&#x27;s porosity, thickness, types, and sensitivities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, everyone. I have previously posted my previous negative experiences with ecostyler gel causing me baldspots, due to my protien sensitivity, in my low porosity type 4 hair. While I was in search of products to use as a replacement, I ran across Wet line gel, which claimed to be alcohol free, and moisturizing. Many People recommened it as a protein free gel. After i still experienced continuous thinning and immediately quit the product. I was aware my hair hated proteins, due to the brittle crunchy feeling I got when I used them. But something wasn&#x27;t right. My hair was thinning and I wasn&#x27;t seeing hair coming out, just like with the Ecostyler gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it took me a very long time to notice what was in this product that was directly agitating what I assumed to be my protein sensitivity, since they marketed themselves as protein free and alcohol free. I had the gut feeling it was triethanolamine, which was proven to be an irritant, but was unable to find specific testimony, so I was more or less speculating maybe it had something to do with the alkaline ph at the time. But in the end it remained a mystery that closed the book on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recently looked at the chemical structure of triethanolamine and did some thorough research. I discovered a few shocking things about the ingredients in this product, and how they work together: triethanolamine and polyacrylate acid.  I will order my points from bad to worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WE ALREADY KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;carcinogens-and-toxic-chemicals(DOT)blogspot(DOT)com/2012/11/triethanolamine-toxic-chemical-in(DOT)html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ewg(dot)org/skindeep/ingredient/706639/TRIETHANOLAMINE/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are told this is a moderate irritant, and has been shown to be a human skin toxin or allergent, and expected to cause non-reproductive organ toxicity, and STUDIES SHOW has been linked to cancer. These have all been brushed off as moderate concerns though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine is a surficant. Yes it is a water soluble surficant. So are proteins, and some watersoluable silicones. Proteins in gel act as water soluble surficants. Coconut oil is a water soluable surficant. They all still latch on to the hair and plasticize it, and in many cases work against moisture as they are not moisturizers, but plasticizing emollients and moisturizing agents that need to work in conjunction with water in order to be effective in hydration.  But you are still leaving this on your hair for a substantial amount of time, and depending on your hair type and sensitivities, Use Caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, look at the word, triETHANOLamine. Ethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethanol is a drying alcohol. If any of you are reporting dryness and brittleness, this is what is affecting you, it isn&#x27;t random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanolamine is an organic compound that is naturally found in coconut oil and is a primary amine and primary alcohol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;As I explained last week in The 5 Most Common Mistakes Even Skin Experts Make, it is well-established that ethanol can reduce water content via a form of water loss known as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) (1), lipid content via extraction and dissolution (2), and protein content via denaturation (3). These properties allow for ethanol to be an effective (and drying) penetration enhancer.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Ethanol in itself isn&#x27;t harmful. It&#x27;s the DRYING effect that can lead to other problems.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;futurederm(dot)com/2012/04/19/is-ethanol-in-skin-care-products-safe/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STILL NOT CONVINCED??? Why is this ethanol actually drying? For an ethanol to be drying to the hair it must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. extract and dissolute lipids. What are lipids? Fatty ACIDS. I will elaborate on why this is what this gel does later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. be denatured. You may claim the ethanol in triethanolamine is not denatured. It comes from coconut, so it must not be denatured right? False. The fact that this is a clear gel means it was heated, and therefore denatured. These gels wouldn&#x27;t be this clear if they didn&#x27;t contain denatured alcohol. Below is a scientific study that shows the effect of denaturzation on the viscosity of protein systems. Note it also says some things about NaOH, which this product contains. No matter the amount of NaOH, it will always denature the protein systems in water based substances once heated. Once heated, that is when it forms a clear, gel consistency. This is where these products holding abilities and clear consistency come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;europepmc(dot)org/articles/PMC2141169/pdf/341(dot)pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Triethanolamine is an aminoalcohol. Neutralize acids to form SALTS plus water in exothermic reactions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;chemicalbook(dot)com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9852620(dot)htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The triethanolamine NEUTRALIZES fatty acids, adjusts and buffers the pH, and SOLUBILISES oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water. Some common products in which triethanolamine is found are liquid laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids, general cleaners, hand cleaners, polishes, metalworking fluids, paints, shaving cream and printing inks\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;phs 10-14. depilatory. swell hairs as much as 10 times the original size; may dissolve hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;images116(dot)fotki(dot)com/v715/photos/9/3265899/12913134/dissolveproof-vi(dot)jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because TEA is the 3rd ingredient in this gel and has a ph of 10, Polyacrylate acid was used to balance the ph and neutralize TEA, and TEA make Polyacrylate acid water soluble. Unfortunately the combination of the two forms a drying effect on the hair-- it turns into SALT, aka Sodium Hydroxide, aka NaOH which is also water soluble, btw.&lt;br /&gt;answers(dot)yahoo(dot)com/question/index?qid&#x3D;20080324143837AAcJ1Im&lt;br /&gt;this source is reliable despite being on yahoo answers, as it was answered by a top contributor in the chemistry section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also the main dissolving agent in lye relaxers. Lye&#x3D; NaOH&#x3D; Salt&#x3D;Sodium Hydroxide. Ethanolamine is also a form of ammonia.&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Triethanolamine is produced from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;en(dot)wikipedia(dot)org/wiki/Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol does have a natural resistance to turning into salt and ammonia, however. BUT ONLY when oil is added to the formulation as a base. It needs to be oil based. Gel is water based, including this one. Salt is already drying, let alone putting the main ingredient used in relaxers in your product.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It is ethanolamine&#x27;s primary alcohol characteristic that makes it possible to be suspended in a soy Oil base as neither sodium carbonate (a primary salt) or ammonia (a primary base) will dilute with oil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;EzineArticles(dot)com/6884068&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION. Very drying and in 3rd ingredient. The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact TEA had a depilatory ph of 10 that dissolves hair, forms a SALT compound called NaOH, aka lye or sodium hydroxide, commonly used as an agent to break bonds in the protein of the hair in hair relaxers. This is the case with all acids. This is just how triETHANOLamine reacts with acid, AND YOU CAN&#x27;T PUT tEa in a hair product, with out adding some form of acidic compound to bring the ph down to a nondepilatory level. There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer. Hmmm.. Just like lye relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;LET ME REPEAT THIS IN THE MOST SUMMED UP BLATANT WAY POSSIBLE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. LYE relaxers, which active ingredient is SODIUM HYDROXIDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Relaxers have been linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THIS water based gel has ingredients, TRIETHANOLAMINE and POLYACRYLATE ACID which together, (unless formulated in an oil base, which this gel \\&quot;WETLINE\\&quot; is NOT, it&#x27;s a water based gel, the first ingredient is water) form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This gel has ingredients that forms a compound--&gt; Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, NaOH, SALT. Whatever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Studies about Triethanolamine, already show \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; cancer link. Where is the cancer link coming from? Sodium Hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not. The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed. Compare to low lye relaxers, which still break bonds of hair diluted Sodium Hydroxide to 2.5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A Low Lye RELAXER has the LOWEST CONCENTRATION of sodium hydroxide which is less than 2.5%. It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient. The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;designessentials(dot)com/professional/science-of-hair/types-of-relaxers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much proves it. Note there is a review on here where someone gave this product 1 star saying it makes their hair act like a relaxer, a few years ago. Everyone thumbed them down, but in  the end they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t. Moisturizing, when it isn&#x27;t. Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein Free\\&quot; styling gel. For you protein sensitive&#x60;s, It has panthenol, which absorbs into the hair cortex similar to ethanol and plasticizes it, leaving a gummy waxy build up after awhile that causes dryness similar to protein and coconut oil can. Hope I helped you guys. NONE of you are crazy. and now you know which ingredient to avoid. i now use kinky curly curling custard. NO TEA, No Protein, NO BALD SPOTS EVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 5th, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time i used this product--whether just on my edges, an entire wash and go, or mixing it with oils or conditioners-- It thinned my hair. I ended up with 3 bald spots in the middle of my head, and it made my edges thin. I kept using it b/c i was in denial, but ultimately it broke my hair. It was strange b/c i never saw hair fall out on my bed or in my brush, but then i would see the thinning, like it disintegrated my hair or something. I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s gonna take for the nickle sized spot near my edges to fill in, but it&#x27;s already been a year. I want to be able to slick down my edges, I don&#x27;t really care much about curl definition, but i can&#x27;t even do that. It also made my hair crunchy when i used it and stiff. No matter if i used small amounts or more, or mixed it w/ oil or conditioner, it&#x27;s garbage. I&#x27;ve got tight 4b hair that gets more loose toward the nape of my neck, btw. I&#x27;m gonna try using the blue eco hold level 5 and hopefully that works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/1/13&lt;br /&gt;After buying the blue medium hold gel, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the hardness of the hold has nothing to do with the bald spots. This solidified what already knew from my results w/ layering and mixing the eco styler w/ oils and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to function, The blue eco was alright-- gave shine, definition, and it also gave me more Hair Loss. I had thinning on my edges, and a piece of hair near that nickle sized bald spot that still hasn&#x27;t gone away have shortened to half the size. I hate this brand of gel. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with balding until using this. I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend it to someone I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I gave the green one away to my cousin b/c I just wanted it far away from me ages ago. She&#x27;s telling me that the product has started thinning her hair as well. My hair follicles are damaged, the bald spot is completely smooth bare. It hasn&#x27;t grown back since I noticed it a year ago, and even the blue one now has caused me problems. I am very frustrated with this product. Hopefully I can grow my curls back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this gel; it&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, so I don&#x27;t know what the problem is. Is it the excessive amount of protein? W/ the eco blue, My hair wasn&#x27;t hard or tangled, and I no longer comb or brush my hair. I go in the shower, and let the water detangle while I smooth sections of hair w/ my fingers, and it get perfectly detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#x27;s no logical reason to me what could be causing the breakage. Maybe my hair just hates whatever is in this product. Like the TEA. I hope someone can investigate the effects of excessive protein. My hair wasn&#x27;t particularly dry, it was pretty moisturized, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used flax seed gel, and another type of protein gel before that didn&#x27;t claim to be \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; but also didn&#x27;t leave me a naked spot on my head. And I&#x27;ve had natural hair for 6 years. Ah well, someone w/ this issue has to speak up about this so they can know they aren&#x27;t the only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Beware, pen spring tight 4b/ 4c curly girls, be vigilant and as soon as you notice your hair thinning, drop the product, it only gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/2/13&lt;br /&gt;Been doing some research about ph. Curly hair&#x27;s ph must be acidic, 4-5.5 ph. Eco styler gel has a pretty high ph of 7, coupled with conditioners and other products I use that also have high ph, (like shea moisture conditioner which i leave in) this can be changing my hair&#x27;s ph, and not for the better. I have to many product w/ high ph, and I&#x27;m not using anything to balance my hair&#x27;s ph back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on what I learned, too much high ph can actually DISINTEGRATE the hair, which is exactly what was happening to me. My hair&#x27;s ph was suffering. I did an apple cider (already came diluted to 5% in the gallon) rinse on my hair and when i saw the effect i decided to leave it in my hair all night. It was soft. This is what lead me to research about ph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned if the ph is too acidic, it can eat the keratin and protein in the hair, and basically disintegrate the hair as well, so you want in that 4 to 5.5 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information lead me to pour the cider in my blue eco styler. If my hair loss is due to excessive protein, the vinegar should help neutralize some of it and eat it away. If it is b/c the ph is too high, I&#x27;ve lowered it w/ the acidic vinegar. My hair was still defined, the hold was a bit softer, it didn&#x27;t effect the lasting and definition. I think i poured like 2 cups just be safe and shook it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try one last time and see if this is a solution, and if i notice thinning I&#x27;ll report back here. I also will take too adding a bit of vinegar to my spray bottle with water, oil mixed in to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 3rd:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah this gel isn&#x27;t for me. I still had thinning, my bald spot got bigger. Eco Styler is dead to me.CONCLUSION. Very drying and in 3rd ingredient. The ingredient right after it, polyacrylate acid, meant to make up for the fact TEA had a depilatory ph of 10 that dissolves hair, forms a SALT compound called NaOH, aka lye or sodium hydroxide, commonly used as an agent to break bonds in the protein of the hair in hair relaxers. This is the case with all acids. This is just how triETHANOLamine reacts with acid, AND YOU CAN&#x27;T PUT tEa in a hair product, with out adding some form of acidic compound to bring the ph down to a nondepilatory level. There are also many proven reports that TEA is an irritant, and has been linked to cancer. Hmmm.. Just like lye relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;LET ME REPEAT THIS IN THE MOST SUMMED UP BLATANT WAY POSSIBLE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. LYE relaxers, which active ingredient is SODIUM HYDROXIDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Relaxers have been linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THIS water based gel has ingredients, TRIETHANOLAMINE and POLYACRYLATE ACID which together, (unless formulated in an oil base, which this gel \\&quot;WETLINE\\&quot; is NOT, it&#x27;s a water based gel, the first ingredient is water) form the exact same compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This gel has ingredients that forms a compound--&gt; Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, NaOH, SALT. Whatever you want to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Studies about Triethanolamine, already show \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; cancer link. Where is the cancer link coming from? Sodium Hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the top 5 ingredients contain tea, which means it is the top 5 most active ingredients in the gel formulation, whether the sodium hydroxide is at 5% concentration or not. The dilution in water is the exact reason the compound is formed. Compare to low lye relaxers, which still break bonds of hair diluted Sodium Hydroxide to 2.5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A Low Lye RELAXER has the LOWEST CONCENTRATION of sodium hydroxide which is less than 2.5%. It is EQUALLY AS EFFECTIVE as other Sodium Hydroxide relaxers however much more mild due to the percentage of active ingredient. The low lye relaxer gently loosens the bonds for increased manageability, while maintaining some level of texture in the hair.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;designessentials(dot)com/professional/science-of-hair/types-of-relaxers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much proves it. Note there is a review on here where someone gave this product 1 star saying it makes their hair act like a relaxer, a few years ago. Everyone thumbed them down, but in  the end they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product markets itself as being alcohol free, when it isn&#x27;t. Moisturizing, when it isn&#x27;t. Many people also claim this is a \\&quot;Protein Free\\&quot; styling gel. For you protein sensitive&#x60;s, It has panthenol, which absorbs into the hair cortex similar to ethanol and plasticizes it, leaving a gummy waxy build up after awhile that causes dryness similar to protein and coconut oil can. Hope I helped you guys. NONE of you are crazy. and now you know which ingredient to avoid. i now use kinky curly curling custard. NO TEA, No Protein, NO BALD SPOTS EVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 5th, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time i used this product--whether just on my edges, an entire wash and go, or mixing it with oils or conditioners-- It thinned my hair. I ended up with 3 bald spots in the middle of my head, and it made my edges thin. I kept using it b/c i was in denial, but ultimately it broke my hair. It was strange b/c i never saw hair fall out on my bed or in my brush, but then i would see the thinning, like it disintegrated my hair or something. I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s gonna take for the nickle sized spot near my edges to fill in, but it&#x27;s already been a year. I want to be able to slick down my edges, I don&#x27;t really care much about curl definition, but i can&#x27;t even do that. It also made my hair crunchy when i used it and stiff. No matter if i used small amounts or more, or mixed it w/ oil or conditioner, it&#x27;s garbage. I&#x27;ve got tight 4b hair that gets more loose toward the nape of my neck, btw. I&#x27;m gonna try using the blue eco hold level 5 and hopefully that works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/1/13&lt;br /&gt;After buying the blue medium hold gel, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the hardness of the hold has nothing to do with the bald spots. This solidified what already knew from my results w/ layering and mixing the eco styler w/ oils and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to function, The blue eco was alright-- gave shine, definition, and it also gave me more Hair Loss. I had thinning on my edges, and a piece of hair near that nickle sized bald spot that still hasn&#x27;t gone away have shortened to half the size. I hate this brand of gel. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with balding until using this. I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend it to someone I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I gave the green one away to my cousin b/c I just wanted it far away from me ages ago. She&#x27;s telling me that the product has started thinning her hair as well. My hair follicles are damaged, the bald spot is completely smooth bare. It hasn&#x27;t grown back since I noticed it a year ago, and even the blue one now has caused me problems. I am very frustrated with this product. Hopefully I can grow my curls back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this gel; it&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, so I don&#x27;t know what the problem is. Is it the excessive amount of protein? W/ the eco blue, My hair wasn&#x27;t hard or tangled, and I no longer comb or brush my hair. I go in the shower, and let the water detangle while I smooth sections of hair w/ my fingers, and it get perfectly detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#x27;s no logical reason to me what could be causing the breakage. Maybe my hair just hates whatever is in this product. Like the TEA. I hope someone can investigate the effects of excessive protein. My hair wasn&#x27;t particularly dry, it was pretty moisturized, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used flax seed gel, and another type of protein gel before that didn&#x27;t claim to be \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; but also didn&#x27;t leave me a naked spot on my head. And I&#x27;ve had natural hair for 6 years. Ah well, someone w/ this issue has to speak up about this so they can know they aren&#x27;t the only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Beware, pen spring tight 4b/ 4c curly girls, be vigilant and as soon as you notice your hair thinning, drop the product, it only gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/2/13&lt;br /&gt;Been doing some research about ph. Curly hair&#x27;s ph must be acidic, 4-5.5 ph. Eco styler gel has a pretty high ph of 7, coupled with conditioners and other products I use that also have high ph, (like shea moisture conditioner which i leave in) this can be changing my hair&#x27;s ph, and not for the better. I have to many product w/ high ph, and I&#x27;m not using anything to balance my hair&#x27;s ph back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on what I learned, too much high ph can actually DISINTEGRATE the hair, which is exactly what was happening to me. My hair&#x27;s ph was suffering. I did an apple cider (already came diluted to 5% in the gallon) rinse on my hair and when i saw the effect i decided to leave it in my hair all night. It was soft. This is what lead me to research about ph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned if the ph is too acidic, it can eat the keratin and protein in the hair, and basically disintegrate the hair as well, so you want in that 4 to 5.5 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information lead me to pour the cider in my blue eco styler. If my hair loss is due to excessive protein, the vinegar should help neutralize some of it and eat it away. If it is b/c the ph is too high, I&#x27;ve lowered it w/ the acidic vinegar. My hair was still defined, the hold was a bit softer, it didn&#x27;t effect the lasting and definition. I think i poured like 2 cups just be safe and shook it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try one last time and see if this is a solution, and if i notice thinning I&#x27;ll report back here. I also will take too adding a bit of vinegar to my spray bottle with water, oil mixed in to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 3rd:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah this gel isn&#x27;t for me. I still had thinning, my bald spot got bigger. Eco Styler is dead to me.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. excellent product</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how much it could do! You can use this for poofs to keep your hair in the front down, for accentuation of your curls with mega hold, or just to get those edges! It also does not build up (unless you use too much) and you can wake up the next morning with no residue or anything showing that you had gel in your hair the day before. Great stuff. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product, wen I started using it I got so many complements, even ordered some for friends Who are going natural. I have combination hair 3c/ 4a but wen I use this product my 4a section smooth out and blend to a 3c. Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my daughters coily hair</li>
            <li> Still have this I love this gel please buy if you want something different</li>
            <li> It leaves whitish particles when the hair dries....unless its doing that cus i use another product with it...or i wonder if its because am using it on wet hair....i will still experiment with it other ways to prove weather am wrong about the product....i used the ic gel the same way and it dont leave no white particles tho....but am willing to try it out without using any other product to see the outcome...</li>
            <li> This product really works in natural hair ... Since I&#x27;ve been using it my curls stay curly and I have been getting lots of compliments .... The only throw down was I had to pay so much in clearing it ... But excellent product</li>
            <li> I normally use the &amp;#34;African Pride Silky Edges&amp;#34;, but a friend recommended this so I decided to give it a try.  I usually put some gel in the palm of my hand (maybe 1 tbsp), rub my hands together, and then smooth the product on both sides of my head.  I was disappointed to find that it makes my hair stiff and it DOES leave white flakes in my hair! I&#x27;m not using a lot of gel because normally my edges are fine once I use a wet brush.  I just wanted extra shine and curl definition at the roots.  I&#x27;ve been natural for 5 yrs now, and I honestly cannot recommend this product! I shouldn&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day because of gel residue in my hair!</li>
            <li> I think that this one is great as it does not make my hair feel dry after use and it smells really good as well, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> love this gel, it leaves my hair super soft and controls my frizz and flyaway all day. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> When I initially started using Eco Style Gel I was somewhat impressed.  The gel did not leave my hair crunchy;however, after continued use my hair became dry and this product turned my black hair to a whitish grey in color. It took several deep conditioning treatments and heavy leave in conditioners to get my hair back to a healthy lustrous black color.  This product will build up in your hair.  I much prefer ICE Fantasia Gel to the Eco Style Gel.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite out of the entire eco line. This is  must have gel for my natural hair!  Excellent for defining my natural curl pattern and it doesn&#x27;t flake!  You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and I like to wear my hair loose but this would just weight my hair down the gel feels way to dense. But it was very good for when I wanted to sleek back my hair into a ponytail. Smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day to get the styles I want.  My hair is extremely curly so when I need it to lay flat all day this product does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave any residual guck.  I continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about three days, but it does the work that I had about five other products to do (I&#x27;m very serious about taking care of my hair. Have been since I was small, so much more so since I had dreads for a while). It moisturizes, holds very well (like a strong mousse, actually), does not flake...it does it all. I have an anti-dandruff shampoo/conditioner that I wash this out with every day or every other day (because black people aren&#x27;t supposed to wash their hair every day, but I don&#x27;t like leaving any kind of hair grease that isn&#x27;t specifically a moisturizer in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> I am a Black women with natural hair and as you can image...it can be challenging to style my hair and achieve a sleek look. I use to use edge control on my edges but it left my hair feeling so pasty and white. I tried this product out of pure curiosity and I don&#x27;t regret it.  If your a person who likes you edges to be slicked down and smooth.... then you\\&quot;ll love this. Just make sure after you apply the gel that you wrap your edges down with a satin scarf for about 10 min...this will to set the hair in place for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Use this product to loc my hair.  Light hold not flakey with a very mild smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It gives me hold to help my hairstyles last longer would definitely  purchase again!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, has a great hold without making my hair dry, flaky or crunchy. Staple product for everyday use</li>
            <li> I love the gel! It makes my curls so defined with just enough shine! It does not build up nor cause flaking. I recommend it hands down!!</li>
            <li> This product works great with the L.O.C method.  I was following the CGC method and my hair became dry, so I switched back to a hair regimen that contained oil.  I have mixed textured 3A and 3B hair, and I live in a very dry environment. After trying the LOC (L-Kinky Curly Knot Today, and O- Argon Oil followed by C- Olive Oil hair hair moisturizer or Lusters Pink Oil or African Pride bouncy curls Pudding)  method and setting my hair, I found that I needed some kind of gel to control the fly away ends and to smooth down my damaged edges.  I applied this product on dry second day hair and it worked perfectly, and left no flakes, crumbs or mess.  I use Argon oil in my L.O.C regimen, so I think I will try the Argon Oil Eco Styler next.  My hair was shiny and had a presence of oil, when I applied this, so it mixes well with an oil on my dry / slighly damp hair.</li>
            <li> When the gel drys off it makes my hair very flaky. Leaving it with a lot of flakes on my hair.</li>
            <li> Always will love this product</li>
            <li> I like the olive oil Eco styler gel......hasn&#x27;t caused any flakes in my hair when applied! Would definitely purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice hold overall, however it does flake once dry. The flakiness and stiffness would be my only complaint. The dandruff look isn&#x27;t in.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is probably better for your hair than regular gel, but it does not hold very well on stubborn hairs. It does NOT get hard like hairspray, so that might be a plus or negative per customer. It is a pretty big jar of the gel for the price.</li>
            <li> This product define my curls. I have 4c, 4b hair. This product also made my hair stiff and it does flake, I didn&#x27;t have much flaking but it did flake. I used almond oil to help with the stiffness and dryness. I will not use this gel to do any twisted outs, but I will use  as a wash n go.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job and it makes the hair look good and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but from a physical store. I wanted/needed something to hold my hair down in the back b/c I just got a pixie cut. My decision was between this and Jam. I chose this because it was more product then the Jam, and it has olive oil in it, which I figured would be more beneficial to my hair. I like the clean feeling, the smell, it&#x27;s a nice product... but it absolutely did not give me the hold I needed, that I was hoping for seeing as how it is a gel. I used this 3 times to hold my hair in the back of my pixie, it did not work at all. The hair ended up, when finished drying, lifting up from the scalp...it stiffen the hair itself, but did not hold it down to my scalp at all, no matter how much gel I applied to it. So I just use it to gel to hold down my sideburns... that&#x27;s about it. I wish I had gone with the Jam instead, oh well... I&#x27;ll just buy the jam, &amp; have both the gel and jam for use.</li>
            <li> so smooth and goes on great and does not flake! love it!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutley great.  My daughter has natural hair and I have relaxed hair, and it works great for both of us!  I noticed some reviews complained of flakes and poor hold.  I know everyone is different, but we don&#x27;t experience those issues.  1) To combat flakes we use Oganic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Moisturizing lotion.  Squeeze some in your hand and run it over your hair, brush it through; 2) Rub some Eoc Styler gel in your hands and rub it through your hair.  For those shorter or more stubborn pieces of hair, take gel in your fingertips and apply directly to that; 3) Then use a bristle brush to comb and smooth hair down, then place in ponytail (if that is desired style); and 3) Place a silk scarf around your head, tie it as tight as you can stand it, for at least 15-20 minutes (the scarf should be a long rectangular scarft that can wrap around twice).  Viola! After you remove the scarf you have a smooth ponytail and/or smooth edges that stay in place, but do not feel hard and has no flakes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: to prevent build-up, spray gelled area with water at night for take down and repeat process the next day for natural hair.  Also you may use coconut oil or some other type of oil if you prefer not to use any moisturizer, but use one or the other, not both.  A build up of any product may cause flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you purchase this product....happy smooth edges and ponytails!!!!!</li>
            <li> This oil hold  nicely.</li>
            <li> Great styling options for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Will lay your edges to hell, but the lay is temporary. No flake, no smell. I like it. Seems gentle but effective</li>
            <li> Somehow I have missed &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; stiffness rating in the description. It is quite stiff for me, but then I don&#x27;t use gel often. Flakes will happen if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Great gel to old hair with. I dont really like for wash and goes, but then again i dont really like gels, but if i had to pick one it would def be this one.</li>
            <li> no clumpy like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; gel. the consistency is just right and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch or flake after you put it one and then someone touches it.</li>
