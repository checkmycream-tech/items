            <li>This is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Even though this mist smells awesome; it is more water than it is oil based.  </li>
            <li>Still pleasant while it lasts.</li>
            <li>pleasant scent.</li>

            <li>Still fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it seems to have added benefits.</li>
            <li>I love spritzing it all around my house, on bed linens, in closets; I even spray it into the air and walk through it.</li>
            <li>That just means it&#x27;ll last longer though; I&#x27;m very happy with this scent.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love these products.  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again even though I love the sandalwood citrus aroma.  </li>
            <li>so I go for more earth tones.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is so refreshing</li>
            <li>It may be my favorite scent of all time.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good price, and authentic scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and citrusy more than sandalwood.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a sandlewood smell as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>Strong smells tend to give me headaches</li>
            <li>HUGE fan of this company and their frankensence and myrh scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a male.</li>
            <li>If you just need to clear the air before working on someone, its a good mist for that</li>
            <li>The sandalwood and citrus is a nice strong and masculine aroma.</li>
            <li>I learned about this product from a friend and what they had seems more pure.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a change, but I prefer frankenscence and myrr.</li>
            <li>This combination is so clean and fresh and, well, heady.</li>
            <li>A few sprays will last all day, it couldn&#x27;t be more perfect.  </li>
            <li>This spray smells really good and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>If you want a lite fresh smell to freshen up your house, this is the one.</li>
            <li>and it LASTS!&lt;br /&gt;It is natural and made with really great essential oils!</li>
            <li>The first time I thought it was coincidence</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters even love them.</li>
            <li>They smell fantastic and last longer than any perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed before I left my house, returned about 1/2 hour later and the scent was still pretty strong</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order it in summer though, if you live where it&#x27;s hot and it sits in a mailbox or hot delivery vehicle the essential oils leak out leaving nothing but water.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this particular scent, much stronger/ very heavy incense-y smell</li>
            <li>But it has a completely difference fragrance inside.</li>
            <li>Natural spray that can be used as room or body fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Am a big fan of essential oils and love their room sprays - and other products as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to go overboard with this spray, so apply cautiously.</li>
            <li>For the price, you could buy a natural oil and put it in water and get the same affect; make five bottles yourself and save forty dollars.</li>
            <li>Does not smell good when you spray it on and the lingering scent smells just as bad</li>

            <li> Fast delivery, good price, and authentic scent.</li>
            <li> The zum mist is the best for an air freshener without chemicals. We use them all the time for the car and in the house.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful!  I just wish it was a little stronger and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> If you want a lite fresh smell to freshen up your house, this is the one. Does not over power or linger too long.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it seems to have added benefits. I was developing a horrible headache and after spraying this mist it went away. The first time I thought it was coincidence but the second time it did the same thing. I&#x27;ll keep it around for obvious reasons! I look forward to trying other scents from Zum Mist!</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Doesn&#x27;t last long enough though.</li>
            <li> This combination is so clean and fresh and, well, heady. It lifts my spirits. I love spritzing it all around my house, on bed linens, in closets; I even spray it into the air and walk through it.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is great! It&#x27;s easy to go overboard with this spray, so apply cautiously. That just means it&#x27;ll last longer though; I&#x27;m very happy with this scent.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a change, but I prefer frankenscence and myrr. It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a sandlewood smell as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from a friend and what they had seems more pure. What I recieved seems diluted.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these products.  They smell fantastic and last longer than any perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought.  My teenage daughters even love them.</li>
            <li> Even though this mist smells awesome; it is more water than it is oil based.  If you just need to clear the air before working on someone, its a good mist for that; doesn&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;d like to see Zum Mist change it up a bit.  I was disappointed.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again even though I love the sandalwood citrus aroma.  For the price, you could buy a natural oil and put it in water and get the same affect; make five bottles yourself and save forty dollars.</li>
            <li> Natural spray that can be used as room or body fragrance.  I know that sounds crazy, but the ingredients are all natural so it does no harm to the body.  The smell is light and citrusy more than sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Does not smell good when you spray it on and the lingering scent smells just as bad</li>
            <li> Great calming scent. I spray it on my bed before I sleep. Strong smells tend to give me headaches so I go for more earth tones. It&#x27;s the perfect combo that still smells great without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Don&#x27;t order it in summer though, if you live where it&#x27;s hot and it sits in a mailbox or hot delivery vehicle the essential oils leak out leaving nothing but water. So sad.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood and citrus is a nice strong and masculine aroma. The citrus oil tones down the woody aroma of the sandalwood. This is a great product for a male.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different scents of Zum Mist. This one actually smells like sandalwood, and the scent lasts longer than the others. Which is not to say it&#x27;s long-lasting. Within an hour or so it fades to nothing. Still pleasant while it lasts. I would not bother buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this spray!  It is so refreshing and it LASTS!&lt;br /&gt;It is natural and made with really great essential oils!</li>
            <li> pleasant scent. Fast service.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING!  The scent is fresh and natural.  It may be my favorite scent of all time.  A few sprays will last all day, it couldn&#x27;t be more perfect.  Even my non-hippy friends approve and compliment it!</li>
