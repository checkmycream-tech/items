            <li>We love the results.</li>

            <li>I Love the flex rods would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>although i order too many cause</li>
            <li>and i love it .</li>
            <li>I love love love love it.</li>
            <li>This was perfect because it comes with 6 flex rods and it came pretty fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Purchase this merchandise and the flexi rods holds the curls pretty good.</li>
            <li>Sleeping on them is really not bad, though of course, it is not as comfortable as sleeping without them!  </li>
            <li>I must say I was very concerned about doing a flexi rod set on my own hair.</li>
            <li>i wear them to bed their every comfortable</li>
            <li>But these are just the opposite, they are great to sleep in.</li>
            <li>These were great and even though I had to purchase them as an add on the cost of the flex rods are cheaper than what I can find in my local beauty shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so light on the head.</li>
            <li>She loved the results as did I. Ordered two packs, just needed one pack plus an extra three.</li>
            <li>I use these very often when I twist my hair and because the top of my hair is shorter (my hair is layered)</li>
            <li>This flexi rods is good for medium, or big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>She likes using them, they are quick to put in.</li>
            <li>they shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast Drying, easy to take out.</li>
            <li>I love that you can sleep comfortably with them in head.love the short purple ones thank U.</li>
            <li>Love these they make tight luscious curls with long lasting results any one would love to have these creation, there the best!</li>
            <li>They are the right size and my curls came out well.</li>
            <li>just right-</li>
            <li>and, I just don&#x27;t care to worry about whether or not I got it just right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to use as I got it in nice and tight on the first try.</li>
            <li>Sleeping in it was not very comfortable, but isn&#x27;t there always a price to pay to look good?</li>
            <li>First time using these on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Just moisten my hair a bit before use and sleep with them , they are not uncomfortable to sleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are the largest size like I thought it would be from the descriptions, because in the package, the form that came along with it has larger sizes, more like what I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>Curling irons and hot rollers just did not work as well.  </li>
            <li>Price was extremely affordable and the product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>So, I have accepted that sleeping on them is the only way to really make the most of the time I spend setting my hair.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t absorb much moisture from my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I got a lot of complements, so it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and work very well.....</li>
            <li>My hair was really curly</li>
            <li>They came sooner than I expected and worked better than I thought they would.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>hope you other ladies enjoy !</li>
            <li>They are the smaller ones out of the flexy rod crew, but they make for great, bouncy, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>When my natural hair is a frizzy mess, I twist it then use the flex-rods to roll it and 10 minutes later, I have great curl definition.</li>
            <li>A little bit uncomfortable to sleep on, but it gives you the most gorgeous Taylor Swift curls!</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to have in, but like any other large curler I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them.</li>
            <li>This particular size will give you very tiny curls not big enough to wrap, but makes a cute curly hair</li>
            <li>They are soft and you can easily get either a spiral curl or a regular curl, and they don&#x27;t leave a mark where the clip would be on regular rollers.  </li>
            <li>But I can set my hair and have fun curls for a few days, which is worth it not to have to spend all that time with the curling iron and then have the curls fall out anyway.</li>
            <li>the only thing I hav to say, make sure to do it 2-4 hours before the time you plan to go out, if your hair is completely wet.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t like the extra shipping which hiked the price up higher.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to sleep in if you don&#x27;t wrap your hair too tight, but they are not the quality of the Conair.  </li>
            <li>really give a nice girl and aren&#x27;t that uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Have yet to try them on my natural hair.and</li>
            <li>i bought four of them the product came early</li>
            <li>They curl my hair just right and the curls last several days.  </li>
            <li>This size is still a little small for me, but I got free shipping and the price was right.</li>
            <li>They were a little bigger than I expected but my curls came out lovely.</li>
            <li>Your hair needs to be just barely damp for these; gotta get it</li>
            <li>I always wanted to try this type of hair curlers however other products were 15 to 20 dollars for a large pack of 20</li>
            <li>These are a bit difficult to keep in, but they are comfortable enough to sleep in and do produce some pretty, natural-looking curls.  </li>
            <li>For me it was impossible to get curls because  I have thin straight hair and this have saved my life nothing worked until I tried this, the best .</li>

            <li> I have fine, thin, slightly wavy hair naturally.</li>
            <li> Their hair is thick, very long, and very straight.</li>
            <li> They are Soft to sleep on and the curl is not too tight.</li>
            <li> As I never curl my hair, so it took some people a long time to recognize me.</li>
            <li> Which work as well as the long ones.</li>
            <li> i dont like it loose</li>
            <li> I will probably end up buying another set, but a slight smaller diameter.  </li>
            <li> I have learned to put these rods in when their hair is mostly dry or the hair remains wet and the curls don&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> When I just leave them in for a few hours, they may get dry but the curls really don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> But I could have gotten them in the store for cheaper minus the delivery charge.</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders and pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Plus your not wasting your time, with curling irons, or other wire curlers, which get tangle in your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to Amazon&#x27;s free shipping, and hate to have to pay for extra shipping.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I just need to practice as I did them way too tight  </li>
            <li> ill have to buy another pack to complete my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using them with very slightly damp hair with mousse in it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to determine size when ordering,</li>
            <li> I was shocked!!!</li>

            <li> these are great for quick sets. When my natural hair is a frizzy mess, I twist it then use the flex-rods to roll it and 10 minutes later, I have great curl definition. I use these regularly.</li>
            <li> im not so good at using these..i dont like it loose</li>
            <li> These are great.  I only gave it four stars because there are only 6 in the pack.  ill have to buy another pack to complete my hair.</li>
            <li> I love these! So much better on your hair than using heat. I am still trying to figure them out but they work pretty great.</li>
            <li> A little bit uncomfortable to sleep on, but it gives you the most gorgeous Taylor Swift curls!</li>

            <li> I used this once for church...

It gives you the nice curls without the heat damage.  I should use this more often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use as I got it in nice and tight on the first try. Taking it out was a breeze too.  Sleeping in it was not very comfortable, but isn&#x27;t there always a price to pay to look good?</li>
            <li> Great curlers and hold a curl in my hair unlike any curling iron. I just need to practice as I did them way too tight  and my hair looked like Shirley Temple rather than the waves I was going for.</li>
            <li> I use these for my weaves and it works well.  They arrived on time. I recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes great curls</li>
            <li> They curl my hair just right and the curls last several days.  They are Soft to sleep on and the curl is not too tight. I love them.</li>
            <li> The flexi rods are quite good in quality..... Arrived on time and work very well..... My hair was really curly</li>
            <li> Great for styling!  Easy to use and good quality.  Price was extremely affordable and the product is amazing.  Good job!</li>
            <li> I must say I was very concerned about doing a flexi rod set on my own hair. Yes I&#x27;m one of those people who went to the hair dresser weekly for a roller set. Lets just say that these flexi rods will get the job done just as well. They were easy to handle made perfect curls without frizz. I did moisturize and seal my relaxed hair before starting. This particular size will give you very tiny curls not big enough to wrap, but makes a cute curly hair style.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you other ladies enjoy !</li>
            <li> I use these very often when I twist my hair and because the top of my hair is shorter (my hair is layered) these work great! I also bought some bigger ones from Sally&#x27;s and they work great as well!</li>
            <li> For me it was impossible to get curls because  I have thin straight hair and this have saved my life nothing worked until I tried this, the best . Just moisten my hair a bit before use and sleep with them , they are not uncomfortable to sleep.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try this type of hair curlers however other products were 15 to 20 dollars for a large pack of 20 but I only wanted 4 to 6 in a pack. This was perfect because it comes with 6 flex rods and it came pretty fast in the mail. They keep there shape and flex in any way you need them too. I am satisfied with this purchase and the price was awesome!</li>
            <li> They are the smaller ones out of the flexy rod crew, but they make for great, bouncy, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> i love them i wear them to bed their every comfortable</li>
            <li> These do a great job of curling my hair without heat. My hair is just past my shoulders and pretty thick. It took 2 packages to do my entire head. They are comfortable to have in, but like any other large curler I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these rods on a friend&#x27;s recommendation,because i wanted to curl my hair without using damaging heat,i was not disapointed.</li>
            <li> I use these in my girls&#x27;, ages 7 and 10, hair overnight. Their hair is thick, very long, and very straight. I have learned to put these rods in when their hair is mostly dry or the hair remains wet and the curls don&#x27;t stay. We love the results. Their hair stays curly for 2 days. The girls say these rods are more comfy to sleep in than the sponge curlers.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter. She likes using them, they are quick to put in. Fast Drying, easy to take out. She bought her self some smaller ones too. Which work as well as the long ones. Plus your not wasting your time, with curling irons, or other wire curlers, which get tangle in your hair. Not very comfortable to sleep in. But these are just the opposite, they are great to sleep in. Very easy, like 1,2,3 then its done.  Good price, and quick delivery time.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than I expected and worked better than I thought they would. I will probably be ordering them in the larger sizes as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them! Hard to determine size when ordering, but I know they will work well when I do</li>
            <li> Love these they make tight luscious curls with long lasting results any one would love to have these creation, there the best!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like the extra shipping which hiked the price up higher. I&#x27;m so used to Amazon&#x27;s free shipping, and hate to have to pay for extra shipping. I don&#x27;t think these are the largest size like I thought it would be from the descriptions, because in the package, the form that came along with it has larger sizes, more like what I would have preferred. I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, so we&#x27;ll see. But I could have gotten them in the store for cheaper minus the delivery charge.</li>
            <li> Purchase this merchandise and the flexi rods holds the curls pretty good. Very good for your hair without using heat tools. This flexi rods is good for medium, or big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I Love the flex rods would recommend to anyone, received ahead of schedule. Great product and it works very well</li>
            <li> Nice product and price.I love that you can sleep comfortably with them in head.love the short purple ones thank U.</li>
            <li> These worked so well for my weave!! I was shocked!!! I love them. Have yet to try them on my natural hair.and they shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> These were great and even though I had to purchase them as an add on the cost of the flex rods are cheaper than what I can find in my local beauty shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really give a nice girl and aren&#x27;t that uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Me encantó esté producto en él momento en que lo pedí en mí país no aparecía,me gusta, como quedan mí rizos con los fexi rod.Casi cumpliré  o tengo ya 9 meses con ellos,sencillos de material muy flexible y facil de usar,con el tiempo que tengo con ellos están como nuevos,eso si nunca le he dado calor,para protegerlo más y cuidar mejor mi cabello.</li>
            <li> although i order too many cause i bought four of them the product came early and i love it . next time i go to style my hair this product will definitely be used!!!!!!!!!! cant wait</li>
            <li> Well, I have been experimenting for awhile with curling my hair, and have decided these work the best of what I have tried.  They are soft and you can easily get either a spiral curl or a regular curl, and they don&#x27;t leave a mark where the clip would be on regular rollers.  I have been using them with very slightly damp hair with mousse in it.  My hair is very fine and does not take a curl well.  When I just leave them in for a few hours, they may get dry but the curls really don&#x27;t last.  But when I sleep on them, the curls will last for about 2-3 days.  So, I have accepted that sleeping on them is the only way to really make the most of the time I spend setting my hair.  Curling irons and hot rollers just did not work as well.  Sleeping on them is really not bad, though of course, it is not as comfortable as sleeping without them!  But I can set my hair and have fun curls for a few days, which is worth it not to have to spend all that time with the curling iron and then have the curls fall out anyway.</li>
            <li> I lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve it. arrive on time. The easiest hair roller and it&#x27;s so light on the head. I love love love love it. the only thing I hav to say, make sure to do it 2-4 hours before the time you plan to go out, if your hair is completely wet.</li>
