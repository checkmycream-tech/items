            <li>I am being very honest in this post.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent and wonderful creamy feel.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent, it&#x27;s moisturizing benefits are amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing!  </li>
            <li>It is a good product and I am happy wit it</li>
            <li>This shea butter never does a very good job moisturizing in my opinion but is phenomenal for healing the skin.</li>
            <li>Good price for the quantity-</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be good to soften leather?</li>

            <li>It good</li>
            <li>I laughed and said-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good rub for arthritis.  </li>
            <li>No cover  good and no writing on the outer lid</li>
            <li>Every night after I shower I grab a good bit of this stuff and rub it between my hands.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, people say it does not come full in the container or underweight.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin very healthy.  </li>
            <li>took a chance with ordering this product, but I am VERY pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>Despite the poverty, they are surprisingly honest, happy, and healthy.</li>

            <li>Thanks for a marvelous item...</li>

            <li>nice quality and color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Making my own cosmetics is a breeze with this Shea Butter.  </li>

            <li>Although this product is excellent, natural and unrefined, I would recommend to&lt;br /&gt;change</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is by far one of the best!  </li>
            <li>I really liked it and was really glad I could find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but I do kindly deny. :-)  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, functions well and even better than that, it heals skin after time.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li>I proceeded to warm it in the palm of my hand and it appeared to be fine.  </li>
            <li>you want to go all natural, this is a very good quality product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This product can be used for many things.</li>
            <li>Will be making more lotion bars for this winter.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>is better for your health or if it makes a difference...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But it is magical for chaffed nose, you know what that means:</li>
            <li>halaeveryday makes a better product.</li>
            <li>that just my opinion, It could have been better.....</li>
            <li>I cleaned the top off.</li>
            <li>bottom love this stuff</li>
            <li>I give the credit to my creator - through the Shea! :-).  </li>
            <li>The shea butter itself looks okay</li>
            <li>but I love how this stuff moisturizers and it stays for awhile.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep the product, more in support of helping the economy of Ghana, but will not be ordering it again unless the color changes and the ingredients are listed on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Have to reapply often, but that&#x27;s okay with me.  </li>
            <li>Even if you do, better that than blood.</li>
            <li>This is one of my most used products, i use it in lotions that i purchase and mix the two together, it works really well and keeps me and my skin happy...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Makes the belly butter so much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I read many a review</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>So many uses for it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.2.14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found real shea butter and realize this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I got if for eczema doing ok for it even though I have to use vaseline to get that moist feeling</li>
            <li>I love the way my hands feel after using it.</li>
            <li>Tried a blended commercial cosmetic product that contained shea butter and was fairly impressed-</li>
            <li>and I thought it might be even better for my skin than the cosmetic I&#x27;d used.</li>
            <li>And- just ordered 3 more for my mom-</li>
            <li>I understand that since it&#x27;s unrefined it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like peaches n cream, but sure would have helped :) Now I don&#x27;t want to use the stuff.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>even more...</li>
            <li>but I LOVE using it on my skin.</li>
            <li>top grade shea butter.</li>
            <li>Love this on my neck and elbows andwhatever else</li>
            <li>There are no words for how satisfied I am.  </li>
            <li>The feel of Shea Butter is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will gladly order this product again.</li>
            <li>In just a week my eczema patch on my leg looks a 100 times better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to stretch it out a while.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would help for more things</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is the absolute best, use right after you take a shower</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth and easy to manipulate as it warms and softens in your hands.</li>
            <li>My surgeons asked what I used on them because they healed quicker then normal and look great.  </li>
            <li>and the whole selling &amp; Delivry experience were remarkable.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT product for dry, chapped, cracked winter skin.  </li>
            <li>This is wonderful for dry skin</li>
            <li>great for natural (hide) drum heads.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is a great natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural product.</li>
            <li>Product ordered was not as pictured and was incredibly grainy and felt gross.</li>
            <li>Cant say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li>Shea butter is easy to use and works wonders on the skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Both melt easily just from the heat of my hand, and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it was easy to scrape out the container.</li>
            <li>But the grease is easy to remove from your palms once you are done applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Strong container.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with it, the Shea butter really works.</li>
            <li>.it makes your skin sooo soft and feeling great specially if you apply it after shower .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought some before that were grainy, but this is smooth and creamy...makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>A wonderful.product made skin smooth as a babies</li>
            <li>This product maxed my skin smooth, and my hair to grow.</li>
            <li>oh so smooth for hours after application.</li>
            <li>coconut oil is nice too but too much makes me feel greasy.</li>
            <li>My Shea butter came packaged in a tub like the one pictured above and not melted which is great</li>
            <li>African Shea Butter is great...</li>
            <li>Arrived and its full to the top no air pockets to make it look like its full.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>But the trick is, to scrape the shea butter with the top of your nails, then rub the shea butter between your palms, and it will warm up a bit, then it will feel more softer and manageable, finally, apply to your skin (make sure it is rubbed into your skin very well, so there isn&#x27;t any</li>
            <li>It seems to be more effective than any of the higher priced and highly refined skin products available in drug stores and supermarkets.</li>
            <li>I was so excited once I opened  my package the container  of the shea butter  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I dont understand why people are saying it is stinky , the smell is totally fine, kind of nutty, natural smell.</li>
            <li>Clean and godly living helps -</li>
            <li>Praise Jah for her and natural products to make our lives more enjoyable on this side of Paradise.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love it as much as cocoa butter...</li>
            <li>I finally found something that works, and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your body nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>No bad smell either.</li>
            <li>I like that its a great lubricant and moisturizer without giving that shiny look like other oils.</li>
            <li>It does not come in terrific packaging but overall is a very good product so who cares about fancy packaging!</li>
            <li>I use it for my belly because I&#x27;m pregnant &amp; sometimes all over my body.</li>
            <li>When I learned I was pregnant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 8 1/2 months pregnant &amp; NO stretch</li>
            <li>and then ( I am 6 months pregnant).</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li>I use it every night after her bath and her eczema like skin has cleared tremendously.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And there was no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>I am happy enough with this product to not try any other kind or brand.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li>Yes, I put it on a scale and the full weight was accurate, love this product especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I did  not  receive all the pieces that I have ordered ..! : /</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having this available.  </li>
            <li>I have always found shea butter to be an amazing addition to my skin regimen especially in winter</li>
            <li>Three of them were ivory colored and very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>BUT it is definitely in a really flimsy tray type container, and the container is so cheap that just opening the cellophane wrap made it crack in a bunch of spots</li>
            <li>Real shea butter has a smooth, buttery consistency.</li>
            <li>faded- zits healed up fast - skin looked and felt fabulous.</li>
            <li>great in lip balms, body butters and salves..greasy for a few minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will continue to use this natural product.  </li>
            <li>but anyway, I tried this after hearing that Amber Rose only uses this.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;grains&#x27; do melt away when rubbed in, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy and contact me with any questions!rom Ghana - with no artificial anything.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE ON A FRESH SURGICAL SITE.  </li>
            <li>Love this to moisturize my extremely sensitive and allergy prone skin.</li>
            <li>But there are many uses for this natural product.</li>
            <li>I so love this all natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>Service was pretty quick.</li>
            <li>They shipped it very quickly and the product is just great, works on almost anything for your skin and can be used as a base for more elaborate moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>: the price was REALLY right - it helped the \\&quot;village women\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>Product came right on time.  </li>
            <li>I make body butters with it or use it right out of the container.</li>
            <li>My container came full and packed to the top with solid butter, no chunks or anything like that...</li>
            <li>Shea butter makes a great ointment for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I feel is more nourishing than the ultra refined super white shea butter that I used to use.</li>
            <li>My skin in particular has changed significantly in the 3 months I have used Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Very very very gooooooooood</li>
            <li>It was my no fail formula</li>
            <li>this shea or African butter was ok.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this when I was in South Africa.  </li>
            <li>Instead it&#x27;s more whitish and smells different.</li>
            <li>It was my first time to try it ,</li>
            <li>It is straight from the Shea tree from Ghana - with no artificial anything.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first time i got Shea butter in the condition</li>
            <li>Im not the first person to post a review about mold.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast through Amazon !</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or smell pretty</li>
            <li>She put it on her face the first night-</li>
            <li>and your skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.&lt;br /&gt;Clears up scars and any dark spots better than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>My skin is now soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>First, it says 16 ounces, so I weighed it.</li>
            <li>I need to remember to buy more next time.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was on one of my find a better lotion online searches and ran across African Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Though this is my first time buying or ever using ,seeing &amp; smelling Shea butter..</li>
            <li>I LOVE african Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Although the container is different and, as stated, the color isn&#x27;t remotely the same as the picture, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that all those &#x27;shaving bumps&#x27; I had on my legs are pretty much gone since using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the tubs of shea butter are packed in Ghana (in which case we should send them a good scale) or whether they&#x27;re packed in this country (in which case, shame on us).</li>
            <li>I like this shea butter and would certainly recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;gs</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for dry, cracked hands in the winter and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li>good for keeping your hair moisture in the winter hard to wash off if you use it for your skin</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a way to mix it with a softener binder that won&#x27;t destroy the medical properties?</li>
            <li>and I find it very healing and protective because, like i said, it takes a while to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can melt if there is too much heat or become hard&lt;</li>
            <li>I had about 15 years doing this in my beauty routine to prevent ashiness and really moisturize my skin:</li>
            <li>but it was too much for it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy, but you can rub your finger tips on your arm or stomach before you touch something and not leave prints.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really ascertain its usefulness as a super-moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it stretches very well</li>
            <li>From the picture, however, I really thought the shea would come in a container.  </li>
            <li>(read somewhere containers should be glass or stainless steel), and broke up the two bricks (8 oz each) for storage.  </li>
            <li>i really lov it.</li>
            <li>it may be a bit smelly, but it fades fast.  </li>
            <li>Real product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it on my hair after straight ironing to add shine and works well for that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li>A REAL FIND.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why people are always complaining about the smell and the way it feels.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was that it did not look like the picture at all, the packaging was some kind of takeout container with no label, and 3 oz short of the description.</li>
            <li>Was shipped fast and more than I expected</li>
            <li>Going to try it on my natural hair next :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this raw shea butter and love using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural and effective moisturizer for my very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for thin dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was super surprised by how soft and manageable my hair was.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because of the color until I learned that Shea Butter isn&#x27;t supposed to be the bright  yellow color, as in most of the images of it i&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying natural shea butter</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what the description said: natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>I weighed it with a very accurate digital scale and found that it was not 16 ounces but only 13 ounces and that included the weight of the container.</li>
            <li>My hair is looking thicker ( I mainly wear my hair in protective styles).  </li>
            <li>I got into African Shea Butter when attending the Nashville African Street Festival in 2008 and purchased some more in 2010.  </li>
            <li>that she looked 10 years older than she was.</li>
            <li>It really moisturized my natural hair</li>
            <li>My batch had a greenish tint, but over all the smell and texture were normal.</li>
            <li>Quality seems good, texture and aroma similar to what I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li>but it absorbs pretty fast, especially when applying friction from vigorous rubbing from your hands...</li>
            <li>I hope when you send it to the customer save it more and put the butter in good can, because I got it Means and sparse :(</li>
            <li>But I guess I have to buy I new one.</li>
            <li>I always purchased Shea from a hideaway spot locally but as its gotten popular the size of product has went down while the price went up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for 100% natural Shea butter that are golden yellow in color like the picture of this product shown.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the African Shea Butter and got a lot more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very sensitive to temperature changes.</li>
            <li>It make my skin very soft, &amp; it help my scalp too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the first time that it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>Now all signs of early aging are GONE!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It smells just like the ones you purchase from vendors at events (where I first purchased Shea butter) or local stores.</li>
            <li>However, its still different than my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost positive this is NOT actual shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see this was in its unrefined state, nice and thick, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>any more.&lt;br /&gt;it is hard in texture, but it melts right when you are able to scrape some onto your fingers and then when you massage it in, it can stay long and moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li>Can be used on rough hair ends too but do not recommend too much on hair because it can make hair really greasy and waxy.</li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted to use all natural product on the spots where I needed to.  </li>
            <li>Far away from the picture.</li>
            <li>Felt so soft arrived early</li>
            <li>20 year old&#x27;s and 30 year old&#x27;s are  attracted to me..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product, and natural products vary in color.</li>
            <li>Its ALL natural</li>
            <li>So far, however, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Obviously natural, too.</li>
            <li>I had old eczema patches on my feet.  </li>
            <li>FOR MY OLD</li>
            <li>i doubted my own eyes: no any attached description about product itself, no any information who made this product,  content was in container wrapped a thin transparent wrapping material.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The top part is covered with grey, and I can see black dots on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Because it is a butter, if you blend it in, go easy on the amounts or you will experience quite a bit of separation and small chunks</li>
            <li>It has a slight natural smell, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>and I do like its lasting moisturizing qualities, but I will not order from this particular seller again.</li>
            <li>This is the second try to buy African Shea for my daughter after the first which was not as we ordered and returned it to Amazon .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly with Prime,  Slight odor that disappears.  </li>
            <li>I use it on dark spots and on my feet right out of the shower which keeps my feet soft for two days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healed multiple old scars I&#x27;ve had including a 2 year old sunburn!</li>
            <li>and this was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It was a dark, golden color and quite sticky.  </li>
            <li>The product itself was a pale white color, waxy, yet break apart easy.  </li>
            <li>I still wanted to try because of other positive reviews and because it is natural without any chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>It works very well for my needs, and there&#x27;s enough of it to last me forever!</li>
            <li>I spent a few weeks in that country on company business some years ago and just fell in love with the people and their culture.</li>
            <li>the soles of my feet, no other cream/moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried has ever made any difference.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the shea butter is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>A little tape around the rim or across the top and down the sides would have prevented this.</li>
            <li>excess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products, including coconut oil (greasy but thin) besides all the commercial lotions and body butters, and I find that my dry skin responds better to the raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I got it only two days after ordering it.</li>
            <li>However, I still began seeing aging signs (slight...but enough for me to see the difference) in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It can be somewhat greasy so don&#x27;t use it near your hair if you don&#x27;t intend to wash it the next day.</li>
            <li>Product actually smells like an old ashtray.</li>
            <li>When I left on the 6th day she nearly cried \\&quot;don&#x27;t take it away\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>was completely  cracked open  </li>
            <li>As far as moisturizing quality, both need to be applied at least twice daily, and both work better than over the counter lotions for dry skin.</li>
            <li>On a whim, I threw it on my new digital scale and it only weighed 12oz- including the container.  </li>
            <li>Used this product throughout my whole pregnancy, not one stretch mark and no bad smell like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I really like it, will last a long time and can use it for lots of things areas for various reasons.</li>
            <li>I expected to be able to use this butter with ease but it was so hard I had to use a knife or my nails to remove it from container.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the smooth feeling lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>My legs were pretty scarred up from an accident I had with one of my horses, &amp; after using it a few months on my legs the scars are about 80% gone</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product before in a store and it was very yellow with no other colors present.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard, but quickly softens when rubbing it in your hands.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know of slathering less chemicals</li>
            <li>I like mixing it with less hard oils like coconut oil to help it spread better.</li>
            <li>not as soft and yellow as the ones i have received in the past, but seems to be the real thing.</li>
            <li>but hard to use in any cosmetics/essential oil products due to the overwhelming and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Yes, the packaging isn&#x27;t quite pretty like the commercial ones but the STAR here is the raw product, shea butter.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using Shea on my face (2008)  - no more dry patches, no more dark spots, no more T-zones, and my skin is flawless!  </li>

            <li> This Shea butter is by far one of the best!  </li>
            <li> I really liked it and was really glad I could find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but I do kindly deny. :-)  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, functions well and even better than that, it heals skin after time.  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li> I proceeded to warm it in the palm of my hand and it appeared to be fine.  </li>
            <li> you want to go all natural, this is a very good quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product can be used for many things.</li>
            <li> Will be making more lotion bars for this winter.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> is better for your health or if it makes a difference...</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> But it is magical for chaffed nose, you know what that means:</li>
            <li> halaeveryday makes a better product.</li>
            <li> that just my opinion, It could have been better.....</li>
            <li> I cleaned the top off.</li>
            <li> bottom love this stuff</li>
            <li> I give the credit to my creator - through the Shea! :-).  </li>
            <li> The shea butter itself looks okay</li>
            <li> but I love how this stuff moisturizers and it stays for awhile.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep the product, more in support of helping the economy of Ghana, but will not be ordering it again unless the color changes and the ingredients are listed on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Have to reapply often, but that&#x27;s okay with me.  </li>
            <li> Even if you do, better that than blood.</li>
            <li> This is one of my most used products, i use it in lotions that i purchase and mix the two together, it works really well and keeps me and my skin happy...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Makes the belly butter so much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I read many a review</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> So many uses for it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.2.14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found real shea butter and realize this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I got if for eczema doing ok for it even though I have to use vaseline to get that moist feeling</li>
            <li> I love the way my hands feel after using it.</li>
            <li> Tried a blended commercial cosmetic product that contained shea butter and was fairly impressed-</li>
            <li> and I thought it might be even better for my skin than the cosmetic I&#x27;d used.</li>
            <li> And- just ordered 3 more for my mom-</li>
            <li> I understand that since it&#x27;s unrefined it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like peaches n cream, but sure would have helped :) Now I don&#x27;t want to use the stuff.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> even more...</li>
            <li> but I LOVE using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> top grade shea butter.</li>
            <li> Love this on my neck and elbows andwhatever else</li>
            <li> There are no words for how satisfied I am.  </li>
            <li> The feel of Shea Butter is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will gladly order this product again.</li>
            <li> In just a week my eczema patch on my leg looks a 100 times better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to stretch it out a while.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would help for more things</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my favorite part.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the absolute best, use right after you take a shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and smooth and easy to manipulate as it warms and softens in your hands.</li>
            <li> My surgeons asked what I used on them because they healed quicker then normal and look great.  </li>
            <li> and the whole selling &amp; Delivry experience were remarkable.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product for dry, chapped, cracked winter skin.  </li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry skin</li>
            <li> great for natural (hide) drum heads.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a great natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product.</li>
            <li> Product ordered was not as pictured and was incredibly grainy and felt gross.</li>
            <li> Cant say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li> Shea butter is easy to use and works wonders on the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Both melt easily just from the heat of my hand, and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but it was easy to scrape out the container.</li>
            <li> But the grease is easy to remove from your palms once you are done applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Strong container.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with it, the Shea butter really works.</li>
            <li> .it makes your skin sooo soft and feeling great specially if you apply it after shower .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some before that were grainy, but this is smooth and creamy...makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> A wonderful.product made skin smooth as a babies</li>
            <li> This product maxed my skin smooth, and my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> oh so smooth for hours after application.</li>
            <li> coconut oil is nice too but too much makes me feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My Shea butter came packaged in a tub like the one pictured above and not melted which is great</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter is great...</li>
            <li> Arrived and its full to the top no air pockets to make it look like its full.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> But the trick is, to scrape the shea butter with the top of your nails, then rub the shea butter between your palms, and it will warm up a bit, then it will feel more softer and manageable, finally, apply to your skin (make sure it is rubbed into your skin very well, so there isn&#x27;t any</li>
            <li> It seems to be more effective than any of the higher priced and highly refined skin products available in drug stores and supermarkets.</li>
            <li> I was so excited once I opened  my package the container  of the shea butter  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I dont understand why people are saying it is stinky , the smell is totally fine, kind of nutty, natural smell.</li>
            <li> Clean and godly living helps -</li>
            <li> Praise Jah for her and natural products to make our lives more enjoyable on this side of Paradise.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it as much as cocoa butter...</li>
            <li> I finally found something that works, and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your body nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> No bad smell either.</li>
            <li> I like that its a great lubricant and moisturizer without giving that shiny look like other oils.</li>
            <li> It does not come in terrific packaging but overall is a very good product so who cares about fancy packaging!</li>
            <li> I use it for my belly because I&#x27;m pregnant &amp; sometimes all over my body.</li>
            <li> When I learned I was pregnant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 8 1/2 months pregnant &amp; NO stretch</li>
            <li> and then ( I am 6 months pregnant).</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and looks just like the photo.</li>
            <li> I use it every night after her bath and her eczema like skin has cleared tremendously.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And there was no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I am happy enough with this product to not try any other kind or brand.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I put it on a scale and the full weight was accurate, love this product especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I did  not  receive all the pieces that I have ordered ..! : /</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having this available.  </li>
            <li> I have always found shea butter to be an amazing addition to my skin regimen especially in winter</li>
            <li> Three of them were ivory colored and very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> BUT it is definitely in a really flimsy tray type container, and the container is so cheap that just opening the cellophane wrap made it crack in a bunch of spots</li>
            <li> Real shea butter has a smooth, buttery consistency.</li>
            <li> faded- zits healed up fast - skin looked and felt fabulous.</li>
            <li> great in lip balms, body butters and salves..greasy for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will continue to use this natural product.  </li>
            <li> but anyway, I tried this after hearing that Amber Rose only uses this.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;grains&#x27; do melt away when rubbed in, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy and contact me with any questions!rom Ghana - with no artificial anything.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE ON A FRESH SURGICAL SITE.  </li>
            <li> Love this to moisturize my extremely sensitive and allergy prone skin.</li>
            <li> But there are many uses for this natural product.</li>
            <li> I so love this all natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> Service was pretty quick.</li>
            <li> They shipped it very quickly and the product is just great, works on almost anything for your skin and can be used as a base for more elaborate moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> : the price was REALLY right - it helped the \\&quot;village women\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> Product came right on time.  </li>
            <li> I make body butters with it or use it right out of the container.</li>
            <li> My container came full and packed to the top with solid butter, no chunks or anything like that...</li>
            <li> Shea butter makes a great ointment for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I feel is more nourishing than the ultra refined super white shea butter that I used to use.</li>
            <li> My skin in particular has changed significantly in the 3 months I have used Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> Very very very gooooooooood</li>
            <li> It was my no fail formula</li>
            <li> this shea or African butter was ok.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this when I was in South Africa.  </li>
            <li> Instead it&#x27;s more whitish and smells different.</li>
            <li> It was my first time to try it ,</li>
            <li> It is straight from the Shea tree from Ghana - with no artificial anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first time i got Shea butter in the condition</li>
            <li> Im not the first person to post a review about mold.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast through Amazon !</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look or smell pretty</li>
            <li> She put it on her face the first night-</li>
            <li> and your skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.&lt;br /&gt;Clears up scars and any dark spots better than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> My skin is now soft, smooth, and supple.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> First, it says 16 ounces, so I weighed it.</li>
            <li> I need to remember to buy more next time.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was on one of my find a better lotion online searches and ran across African Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Though this is my first time buying or ever using ,seeing &amp; smelling Shea butter..</li>
            <li> I LOVE african Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Although the container is different and, as stated, the color isn&#x27;t remotely the same as the picture, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that all those &#x27;shaving bumps&#x27; I had on my legs are pretty much gone since using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the tubs of shea butter are packed in Ghana (in which case we should send them a good scale) or whether they&#x27;re packed in this country (in which case, shame on us).</li>
            <li> I like this shea butter and would certainly recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;gs</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for dry, cracked hands in the winter and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> good for keeping your hair moisture in the winter hard to wash off if you use it for your skin</li>
            <li> Otherwise a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a way to mix it with a softener binder that won&#x27;t destroy the medical properties?</li>
            <li> and I find it very healing and protective because, like i said, it takes a while to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can melt if there is too much heat or become hard&lt;</li>
            <li> I had about 15 years doing this in my beauty routine to prevent ashiness and really moisturize my skin:</li>
            <li> but it was too much for it</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy, but you can rub your finger tips on your arm or stomach before you touch something and not leave prints.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really ascertain its usefulness as a super-moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it stretches very well</li>
            <li> From the picture, however, I really thought the shea would come in a container.  </li>
            <li> (read somewhere containers should be glass or stainless steel), and broke up the two bricks (8 oz each) for storage.  </li>
            <li> i really lov it.</li>
            <li> it may be a bit smelly, but it fades fast.  </li>
            <li> Real product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it on my hair after straight ironing to add shine and works well for that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> A REAL FIND.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why people are always complaining about the smell and the way it feels.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that it did not look like the picture at all, the packaging was some kind of takeout container with no label, and 3 oz short of the description.</li>
            <li> Was shipped fast and more than I expected</li>
            <li> Going to try it on my natural hair next :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this raw shea butter and love using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural and effective moisturizer for my very dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for thin dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was super surprised by how soft and manageable my hair was.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the color until I learned that Shea Butter isn&#x27;t supposed to be the bright  yellow color, as in most of the images of it i&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying natural shea butter</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what the description said: natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> I weighed it with a very accurate digital scale and found that it was not 16 ounces but only 13 ounces and that included the weight of the container.</li>
            <li> My hair is looking thicker ( I mainly wear my hair in protective styles).  </li>
            <li> I got into African Shea Butter when attending the Nashville African Street Festival in 2008 and purchased some more in 2010.  </li>
            <li> that she looked 10 years older than she was.</li>
            <li> It really moisturized my natural hair</li>
            <li> My batch had a greenish tint, but over all the smell and texture were normal.</li>
            <li> Quality seems good, texture and aroma similar to what I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> but it absorbs pretty fast, especially when applying friction from vigorous rubbing from your hands...</li>
            <li> I hope when you send it to the customer save it more and put the butter in good can, because I got it Means and sparse :(</li>
            <li> But I guess I have to buy I new one.</li>
            <li> I always purchased Shea from a hideaway spot locally but as its gotten popular the size of product has went down while the price went up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for 100% natural Shea butter that are golden yellow in color like the picture of this product shown.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the African Shea Butter and got a lot more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very sensitive to temperature changes.</li>
            <li> It make my skin very soft, &amp; it help my scalp too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the first time that it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> Now all signs of early aging are GONE!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It smells just like the ones you purchase from vendors at events (where I first purchased Shea butter) or local stores.</li>
            <li> However, its still different than my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is all natural and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost positive this is NOT actual shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see this was in its unrefined state, nice and thick, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> any more.&lt;br /&gt;it is hard in texture, but it melts right when you are able to scrape some onto your fingers and then when you massage it in, it can stay long and moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> Can be used on rough hair ends too but do not recommend too much on hair because it can make hair really greasy and waxy.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to use all natural product on the spots where I needed to.  </li>
            <li> Far away from the picture.</li>
            <li> Felt so soft arrived early</li>
            <li> 20 year old&#x27;s and 30 year old&#x27;s are  attracted to me..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product, and natural products vary in color.</li>
            <li> Its ALL natural</li>
            <li> So far, however, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Obviously natural, too.</li>
            <li> I had old eczema patches on my feet.  </li>
            <li> FOR MY OLD</li>
            <li> i doubted my own eyes: no any attached description about product itself, no any information who made this product,  content was in container wrapped a thin transparent wrapping material.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The top part is covered with grey, and I can see black dots on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Because it is a butter, if you blend it in, go easy on the amounts or you will experience quite a bit of separation and small chunks</li>
            <li> It has a slight natural smell, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and I do like its lasting moisturizing qualities, but I will not order from this particular seller again.</li>
            <li> This is the second try to buy African Shea for my daughter after the first which was not as we ordered and returned it to Amazon .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with Prime,  Slight odor that disappears.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dark spots and on my feet right out of the shower which keeps my feet soft for two days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healed multiple old scars I&#x27;ve had including a 2 year old sunburn!</li>
            <li> and this was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a dark, golden color and quite sticky.  </li>
            <li> The product itself was a pale white color, waxy, yet break apart easy.  </li>
            <li> I still wanted to try because of other positive reviews and because it is natural without any chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> It works very well for my needs, and there&#x27;s enough of it to last me forever!</li>
            <li> I spent a few weeks in that country on company business some years ago and just fell in love with the people and their culture.</li>
            <li> the soles of my feet, no other cream/moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried has ever made any difference.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the shea butter is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> A little tape around the rim or across the top and down the sides would have prevented this.</li>
            <li> excess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products, including coconut oil (greasy but thin) besides all the commercial lotions and body butters, and I find that my dry skin responds better to the raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got it only two days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> However, I still began seeing aging signs (slight...but enough for me to see the difference) in my early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It can be somewhat greasy so don&#x27;t use it near your hair if you don&#x27;t intend to wash it the next day.</li>
            <li> Product actually smells like an old ashtray.</li>
            <li> When I left on the 6th day she nearly cried \\&quot;don&#x27;t take it away\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> was completely  cracked open  </li>
            <li> As far as moisturizing quality, both need to be applied at least twice daily, and both work better than over the counter lotions for dry skin.</li>
            <li> On a whim, I threw it on my new digital scale and it only weighed 12oz- including the container.  </li>
            <li> Used this product throughout my whole pregnancy, not one stretch mark and no bad smell like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I really like it, will last a long time and can use it for lots of things areas for various reasons.</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to use this butter with ease but it was so hard I had to use a knife or my nails to remove it from container.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the smooth feeling lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> My legs were pretty scarred up from an accident I had with one of my horses, &amp; after using it a few months on my legs the scars are about 80% gone</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before in a store and it was very yellow with no other colors present.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, but quickly softens when rubbing it in your hands.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know of slathering less chemicals</li>
            <li> I like mixing it with less hard oils like coconut oil to help it spread better.</li>
            <li> not as soft and yellow as the ones i have received in the past, but seems to be the real thing.</li>
            <li> but hard to use in any cosmetics/essential oil products due to the overwhelming and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Yes, the packaging isn&#x27;t quite pretty like the commercial ones but the STAR here is the raw product, shea butter.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using Shea on my face (2008)  - no more dry patches, no more dark spots, no more T-zones, and my skin is flawless!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of annoying to put it on really because you have to heat it up</li>
            <li> Humidity where I live is very low and is awful on my skin, this works beautifully to keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really only noticed a difference after at least several weeks of CONSISTENT use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real shea butter (at first, I was skeptical).</li>
            <li> This 16oz container will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry especially in the summer months i need something like this shea butter</li>
            <li> This particular product, African Shea Butter, seems to sit on the skin&#x27;s surface, providing a protective barrier, but does not seem to absorb into the skin and does not effectively combat the actual dryness.</li>
            <li> some of my toenails were getting a bit yellowed and within a few days of starting to use this, they have completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of vitamin E oil &amp; lavender oil and then use the back of a spoon to &#x27;work it up&#x27; to soft consistency</li>
            <li> This shea butter is yellow and has a grainy texture, even when melted and mixed with other butters &amp; oils, then end product still feels grainy.</li>
            <li> much too hard too work with.</li>
            <li> a little bit so it in middle of bad and good</li>
            <li> Not really a big deal, but just not what I expected</li>
            <li> I like to melt it down and make hair products and body butters adding different essential oils.</li>
            <li> I thought that Shea Butter was expensive because of the other commercial products available (like BBW and Perlier).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s processed different due to it not being</li>
            <li> I use African Shea Butter on my skin and if a little left on my hand, I rub it through my hair.</li>
            <li> Melted well and mixed well with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Took very long with the delivery.</li>
            <li> Also, I get really dry fingers in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Why isn&#x27;t everyone (with dry, sun-damaged skin) just buying it by the boat load?</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It helped for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I was planning  on using the container to mix my oils and put back in the same container so upset waste of money .</li>
            <li> My skin looks 20..and people who do not know my age think I am no more than 35 years old.  </li>
            <li> You need to wear loose cotton clothes though because it&#x27;s \\&quot;butter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this usually last about 9 months.</li>
            <li> Amazon fixed me up though, so kudos to them, but still disappointing that that problem occurred in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sticky and smells weird.</li>
            <li> This is a mystery have for me since my hands and feet get very dry and crack.</li>
            <li> (very dry).</li>
            <li> But as of recent years and after having gone through cancer and chemo, I had become aware of all these chemicals that I was, not only consuming, but slathering on my body (body oil, cream, makeup, deodorant) and it was driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> : the butter hasn&#x27;t typical yellow color , it has grey color, it has not fully typical smell,  resembles  </li>
            <li> Item was hard to get it to be soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused because I keep reading that real Shea butter is not yellow but rather ivory color.</li>
            <li> next morning looked at least 5 years younger as sun damage faded.</li>
            <li> I used to use it on my entire body in the dead of winter</li>
            <li> The container was different, like one of these round take out boxes from a restaurant.</li>
            <li> Also as I expected, thank you.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter was harder then I expected.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit stiffer and harder to spread.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for only a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I always wet my skin then apply to trap the moisture.</li>
            <li> The product is a solid and needs to be warmed in your hands for a few seconds before using it.  </li>
            <li> I began looking for a product to reduce the chance of stretch marks--which I am prone to getting and already have a few of on my upper thighs.  </li>
            <li> This product is as expected...</li>
            <li> this is the only product that helps my dried cracked hands during the winter...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sunblock protection, healing, moisturizing, and thick enough to last on the skin.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how dusty the top of the container was when I opened the package, but I figured things sometimes get dusty sitting in a warehouse.</li>
            <li> Normally its hard and needs to be melted in the sun a few times</li>
            <li> However, when I actually opened the container the shea butter was NOT bright yellow as depicted on the site&#x27;s picture.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it to other</li>
            <li> And what I put on my legs didn&#x27;t get absorb by the skin at all, and just ended up transferring to other things.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual yellow color.</li>
            <li> I use it alone and with other products.</li>
            <li> I even tried mixing it with other better-smelling lotions/creams, to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Awaiting my exchange, will be extremely upset if that one also arrives with mold.</li>
            <li> Rough feet!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone, in place of lotion and other skin moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will want to try this next time.</li>
            <li> Of course it will not smell perfumy like other creams sold in stores because they are packed with perfume and chemicals and this product is all</li>
            <li> All I did was apply the shea butter to my feet every other night.  </li>
            <li> I even put a little drop of NOW Almond oil in her bath water to soften the water a bit and cure the dry skin.</li>
            <li> It really makes a diffeence, especially in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it arrived in a generic plastic tub with no labeling, and the lid had come off during shipping, which caused a small amount of the shea butter to escape from the tub.</li>
            <li> Not watered down with other oils, has a pliable waxy consistency and moisturizes the driest skin.</li>
            <li> This softens and smooths the skin, drastically cutting down itch and burning quickly.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!!...</li>
            <li> However I certainly don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the quality.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> Have even bought and sent to other family members!</li>
            <li> I use the shea butter as a moisturizer and melt part of it down to include with my black soap mixture.</li>
            <li> and I am a Black Creek 50</li>
            <li> Also - I use it if I accidentally scratch myself, for eczema or like yesterday, a slight burn.</li>
            <li> I use it on my scars after every shower and they healed quickly without a bad scar.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat green, with black specks in it.</li>
            <li> A little greasy</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get used to the scent</li>
            <li> (feels just a little bit greasy until then, but it&#x27;s probably the oil I add to it).  </li>
            <li> It looks just like this, in a round snap tight plastic container.  </li>
            <li> remotely how Shea butter should smells, condition is creamy but not solid,as though it was inflated, has nothing to do with condition of Shea butter which is hard.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t heat it as it would destroy usable properties.</li>
            <li> Took it with me when I went to visit my daughter who \\&quot;lives\\&quot; in the sun - her face was so wrinkled and her hair so dead and frizzy</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been doing its job, keeps me moisturized in this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> Not happy but, not enough to return it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I threw it out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I do agree with one reviewer, that it is very hard in its solid raw form.</li>
            <li> so I did a little research and decided to try this raw agricultural product</li>
            <li> I have purchased raw, unrefined shea butter from 4 sources.</li>
            <li> As raw as she a butter gets, used it in my butter butter recipe</li>
            <li> It came with a bad packaging different from the picture and the color is white.</li>
            <li> The butter was white not yellow and put it in a plate instead of container, is a bad choice.</li>
            <li> Little NOSES!</li>
            <li> A little goes along way!</li>
            <li> recommend to use a small amount to avoid over-lubrication.</li>
            <li> Not in the usual container.</li>
            <li> Ordered the usual 16oz tub</li>
            <li> I decided to take the lazy route and order it from Amazon this time (plus not wait until September which is when the festival is).  </li>
            <li> and it helps withy scars no more keloids</li>
            <li> I keep a candle warmer in the bathroom to sit a small bowl of shea butter to heat while I shower.  </li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not a magic bullet for any skin problem but it has helped me with symptoms of winter itch as well as a patch of psoriasis on each of my feet.</li>
            <li> I think people are used to lotions with a small amount of Shea butter and expect that consistency.</li>
            <li> smell is the usual Shea Butter</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering the African Shea butter and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> IT IS FAKE AFRICAN SHEA BUTTER</li>
            <li> I ran the cold water over my finger immediately after the slight burn (not even a singe but enough to know you burned yourself), placed Shea immediately over the area and within an hour..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 years, at least.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this being too hard</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic bowl, it&#x27;s about as hard as a bar of soap, and it smells &#x27;earthy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> my skin doesn&#x27;t look dull anymore.</li>
            <li> after I have read those negative reviews about it and about how stinky it is and how hard it is and how the color is not what it should be...</li>
            <li> The time period was from late May to now, late August.</li>
            <li> it feels so thick when you are smoothing it onto your skin, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is thick.</li>
            <li> Well, no more of that!  </li>
            <li> listen to those negative reviews about it!</li>
            <li> The product is very thick but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> It smelled kinda weird too, not nutty, or natural in anyway, very artificial smelling.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> and now I have to transfer the shea butter into something else so it doesn&#x27;t get stale or harden.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smells like a village of goats</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I receive had mold in it and smelled weird.</li>
            <li> Disgusting especially since on the package</li>
            <li> but it make my hand feel weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m worried about putting on clothes after I put this on my skin.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also has an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> It is an off-white color, absorbs well, and has a very faint scent.</li>
            <li> AND REALLY BAD BAD AND</li>
            <li> BAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that I received molded Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Disgusting product.</li>
            <li> Also, smells horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to use all natural product on the spots where I needed to.  Thanks Amazon for having this available.  I really like it, will last a long time and can use it for lots of things areas for various reasons.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it. Shea butter is easy to use and works wonders on the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got it only two days after ordering it. The quality is perfect and it leaves my hair feeling soft every time.</li>
            <li> texture was like salt.  I buy this product all the time, never had it like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how any of the suggestions for usage of the product could be done with the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> This is a Great Moisturizer and Sun Protection for Tanning.  It also Gets rid of Wrinkles and makes skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s real shea butter (at first, I was skeptical). This product can be used for many things. It has a slight natural smell, but not unpleasant. I used it to make a hair moisturizer. The rest will be used ro make a body butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I love it! I was skeptical because of the color until I learned that Shea Butter isn&#x27;t supposed to be the bright  yellow color, as in most of the images of it i&#x27;ve seen.  I&#x27;ve been applying it after my showers and under my eyes at night.  I see a difference under and around my eyes already! I put it in my hair every morning after applying a leave in conditioner or hair oil. I read somewhere that Shea butter  should be used as a sealant- to lock moisture in. I&#x27;m growing my hair and hoping this impacts my efforts. My hair is looking thicker ( I mainly wear my hair in protective styles).  I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will continue to use this natural product.  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> This shea butter never does a very good job moisturizing in my opinion but is phenomenal for healing the skin. It&#x27;s healed multiple old scars I&#x27;ve had including a 2 year old sunburn!</li>
            <li> Far away from the picture. It came with a bad packaging different from the picture and the color is white. BEWARE BUYERS!</li>
            <li> I have this already. Purchased from my local beauty supply store and I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 years, at least. I used to use it on my entire body in the dead of winter but I stopped because it takes forever to absorb (it would get all over my bed after my nightly showers) and it clogs my pores. I basically use it as hand lotion as home and I find it very healing and protective because, like i said, it takes a while to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY Caveat: I&#x27;m almost positive this is NOT actual shea butter. It&#x27;s Kpangnan butter, from a nut of the African Kpangnan (pronounced: pa-nya) tree. So IF you&#x27;re looking for actual shea butter, which i&#x27;d imagine you are, this isnt it. Regardless of what the label says. Just FYI.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for my body</li>
            <li> Does wonders for the complexion.  I use it daily and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Price is competitive and quality is good!</li>
            <li> Arrived and its full to the top no air pockets to make it look like its full. very happy with it</li>
            <li> Good price for the quantity- but hard to use in any cosmetics/essential oil products due to the overwhelming and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for thin dry skin. It&#x27;s sunblock protection, healing, moisturizing, and thick enough to last on the skin. Easy ordering, prompt delivery, received in good condition.</li>
            <li> Nice and buttery. Keeps skin moist</li>
            <li> Although this product is excellent, natural and unrefined, I would recommend to&lt;br /&gt;change it to other container.&lt;br /&gt;It is very sensitive to temperature changes. It can melt if there is too much heat or become hard&lt;br /&gt;when there&#x27;s cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to use a small amount to avoid over-lubrication.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry especially in the summer months i need something like this shea butter</li>
            <li> Works miracles for ultra-dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the soles of my feet, no other cream/moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried has ever made any difference. This product does!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for hands, elbows, legs and anywhere else you want to moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for natural (hide) drum heads. Yes, that&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s wonderful for that use too.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is by far one of the best!  It does not come in terrific packaging but overall is a very good product so who cares about fancy packaging!</li>
            <li> I have always found shea butter to be an amazing addition to my skin regimen especially in winter and this was exactly what I expected.  I like mixing it with less hard oils like coconut oil to help it spread better. Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I used this to make lotion bars, very nice quality Shea Butter. Will be making more lotion bars for this winter.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter! I&#x27;ve bought some before that were grainy, but this is smooth and creamy...makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product my hair is longer and thicker. Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li> What I received was a homemade blend. It was not like any Shea Butter I have ever seen. A completely different color and texture. Not in the usual container. It&#x27;s bogus. Find a different supplier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for 100% natural Shea butter that are golden yellow in color like the picture of this product shown.  But the actual product I received was nothing like the picture.  The container was different, like one of these round take out boxes from a restaurant. The product itself was a pale white color, waxy, yet break apart easy.  It smelled kinda weird too, not nutty, or natural in anyway, very artificial smelling.  I decided to give it a try anyway, but my hair ended up sticky, and looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week. And what I put on my legs didn&#x27;t get absorb by the skin at all, and just ended up transferring to other things. Worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love it. I had about 15 years doing this in my beauty routine to prevent ashiness and really moisturize my skin: Body oil and cream. It was my no fail formula and I loved it. But as of recent years and after having gone through cancer and chemo, I had become aware of all these chemicals that I was, not only consuming, but slathering on my body (body oil, cream, makeup, deodorant) and it was driving me crazy. I really don&#x27;t know of slathering less chemicals is better for your health or if it makes a difference...but anyway, I tried this after hearing that Amber Rose only uses this. So, I gave it a try and I love it. It&#x27;s kind of annoying to put it on really because you have to heat it up (I don&#x27;t have a microwave) and it feels so thick when you are smoothing it onto your skin, but it works like a charm. Even for winter feet. I was using it for my face but it was too much for it and I started breaking out. But it is magical for chaffed nose, you know what that means: Little NOSES! If your kids have a runny nose, put this on their nose and it will never be chaffed. Also, I put it on their faces when it&#x27;s freezing weather. Great for lips, hands, and face. I do this for my daughters. I haven&#x27;t had a problem. So, now I have minimized time and cost of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> this shea or African butter was ok. will not purchase again. much too hard too work with. greenish in color. did end up mixing with oils and giving to family members. however will not purchase again. halaeveryday makes a better product. that just my opinion, It could have been better.....</li>
            <li> Yes, I put it on a scale and the full weight was accurate, love this product especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Smooth and great for my skin</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this stuff!!.. my skin looks and feel amazing!!!...A little goes a long way!!!...would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I was glad to see this was in its unrefined state, nice and thick, a little goes a long way. The only issue I had was that it did not look like the picture at all, the packaging was some kind of takeout container with no label, and 3 oz short of the description.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this when I was in South Africa.  I really liked it and was really glad I could find it on Amazon.  I like the way it makes my skin feel and I like the way it is packaged.  Thank you for carrying it.</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to use this butter with ease but it was so hard I had to use a knife or my nails to remove it from container. Can&#x27;t heat it as it would destroy usable properties. Otherwise a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a way to mix it with a softener binder that won&#x27;t destroy the medical properties?</li>
            <li> I have been ordering 100% Shea Butter from RA Cosmetics for the last 2years.  Ordered the usual 16oz tub but it&#x27;s the first time that it&#x27;s not the same. Different packaging with NO description and it&#x27;s processed different due to it not being it&#x27;s usual yellow color. Instead it&#x27;s more whitish and smells different. I&#x27;ve got Dermatitis and am nervous about using it.</li>
            <li> awesome price for awesome quanity of awesome product!!! i reccomend this for use of moisterizing hair and skin without being oily</li>
            <li> It was my first time to try it , It&#x27;s great .it makes your skin sooo soft and feeling great specially if you apply it after shower . I want to order it again ..</li>
            <li> Felt so soft arrived early</li>
            <li> I have purchased raw, unrefined shea butter from 4 sources. Three of them were ivory colored and very creamy and smooth. This shea butter is yellow and has a grainy texture, even when melted and mixed with other butters &amp; oils, then end product still feels grainy. The &#x27;grains&#x27; do melt away when rubbed in, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it. I won&#x27;t reorder this brand.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how dusty the top of the container was when I opened the package, but I figured things sometimes get dusty sitting in a warehouse. I cleaned the top off. However, when I actually opened the container the shea butter was NOT bright yellow as depicted on the site&#x27;s picture.  It was a dark, golden color and quite sticky.  I checked the packaging to see if there was an &amp;#34;expiration&amp;#34; date and it indicated that it does not expire.  I proceeded to warm it in the palm of my hand and it appeared to be fine.  I have been using the product for about 30 days not and have not had any adverse skin reactions. This is my first time trying natural shea butter and I do like its lasting moisturizing qualities, but I will not order from this particular seller again.</li>
            <li> Although the container is different and, as stated, the color isn&#x27;t remotely the same as the picture, it&#x27;s an excellent product. I use it alone and with other products. It&#x27;s nice and smooth and easy to manipulate as it warms and softens in your hands.</li>
            <li> Also as I expected, thank you.This is an excellent product to mix into my own recipe for face cream. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not watered down with other oils, has a pliable waxy consistency and moisturizes the driest skin. Can be used on rough hair ends too but do not recommend too much on hair because it can make hair really greasy and waxy. A little goes a long way. I am happy enough with this product to not try any other kind or brand. Will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> not as soft and yellow as the ones i have received in the past, but seems to be the real thing. keeps my skin amazingly moisturized.</li>
            <li> A wonderful.product made skin smooth as a babies bottom love this stuff</li>
            <li> I only use Shea butter on my face  and the ends of my hair during the summer and winter.  Since I have been using Shea on my face (2008)  - no more dry patches, no more dark spots, no more T-zones, and my skin is flawless!  I receive compliments all of the time and I am a Black Creek 50+ Native American femme&#x27;.  It is stated that my face shines and is absolutely beautiful.  I give the credit to my creator - through the Shea! :-).  Also,  from my 20&#x27;s - mid 40&#x27;s I used 5 of the Oil of Olay products on my face at one time daily! However, I still began seeing aging signs (slight...but enough for me to see the difference) in my early 40&#x27;s. I was a believer of &amp;#34;fighting aging every step of the way!&amp;#34;  Well, no more of that!  Shea does not fight it - it literally reverses and stops any future process of it.  Now all signs of early aging are GONE!  My skin looks 20..and people who do not know my age think I am no more than 35 years old.  When they hear that my children are in their 30&#x27;s they freak out!  20 year old&#x27;s and 30 year old&#x27;s are  attracted to me..and I am not a cougar - but I do kindly deny. :-)  But it is all since the Shea. Clean and godly living helps - so do not think that Shea will create a miracle. It will not show what you do not have already there.  I am being very honest in this post.  Also - I use it if I accidentally scratch myself, for eczema or like yesterday, a slight burn. I ran the cold water over my finger immediately after the slight burn (not even a singe but enough to know you burned yourself), placed Shea immediately over the area and within an hour..I forgot all about it and have not felt it since - and there are no after-affect scaring. However, I have placed Shea on areas where I have burned myself a bit deeper beneath the skin cells and it aids healing like 50%+ quicker and you do not scab if you apply it daily all day - after you wash your hands for instance.  Any type of irritation - use Shea.  It is straight from the Shea tree from Ghana - with no artificial anything. God&#x27;s healing in a jar..captured.  It is purrrrfect!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and contact me with any questions!rom Ghana - with no artificial anything. God&#x27;s healing in a jar..captured.  It is purrrrfect!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and contact me with any questions!</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it for my belly because I&#x27;m pregnant &amp; sometimes all over my body. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter was harder then I expected. I end up giving it away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> My daughter brings shea butter from Burkina Faso when she visits from her volunteer ministry assignment. This product is a bit stiffer and harder to spread. But it is something that I will order again when I run out between visits. Praise Jah for her and natural products to make our lives more enjoyable on this side of Paradise.</li>
            <li> I got into African Shea Butter when attending the Nashville African Street Festival in 2008 and purchased some more in 2010.  It looks just like this, in a round snap tight plastic container.  Well, since I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;been there, done that&amp;#34; for the festival itself, and it&#x27;s about 15 miles from my house, I decided to take the lazy route and order it from Amazon this time (plus not wait until September which is when the festival is).  I purchased it from Lorem Ipsum LLC.  The shea butter itself looks okay BUT it is definitely in a really flimsy tray type container, and the container is so cheap that just opening the cellophane wrap made it crack in a bunch of spots and now I have to transfer the shea butter into something else so it doesn&#x27;t get stale or harden.  Not happy.  This product is NOT returnable according to Amazon, even if unopened (mine is open), so BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> A little greasy but I love how this stuff moisturizers and it stays for awhile. This is a mystery have for me since my hands and feet get very dry and crack.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Butter on a regular.  Although I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent, it&#x27;s moisturizing benefits are amazing!  I purchased this raw shea butter and love using it!</li>
            <li> Definitely yellow. It probably contains palm oil, but the labeling  is written so that it eludes providing the actual ingredients. This one says &amp;#34;100% Natural&amp;#34;, and the next line says &amp;#34;African shea butter is made from the nut....&amp;#34; No where does it give a list of actual ingredients on the packaging. I especially dislike that this product discolors the skin, leaving a yellow cast. It also has an unpleasant odor.  Having never used shea butter before, I purchased the Now brand at the same time. It is an off-white color, absorbs well, and has a very faint scent. As far as moisturizing quality, both need to be applied at least twice daily, and both work better than over the counter lotions for dry skin. Both melt easily just from the heat of my hand, and are easy to apply. Why damage a product by microwaving when it isn&#x27;t necessary. This particular product, African Shea Butter, seems to sit on the skin&#x27;s surface, providing a protective barrier, but does not seem to absorb into the skin and does not effectively combat the actual dryness. I decided to keep the product, more in support of helping the economy of Ghana, but will not be ordering it again unless the color changes and the ingredients are listed on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I use it as sunscreen, and it works.  Have to reapply often, but that&#x27;s okay with me.  Also, I get really dry fingers in the winter.  Literally bleeding from every finger tip.  This makes my skin very healthy.  It is very greasy, but you can rub your finger tips on your arm or stomach before you touch something and not leave prints.  Even if you do, better that than blood.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first time i got Shea butter in the condition i doubted my own eyes: no any attached description about product itself, no any information who made this product,  content was in container wrapped a thin transparent wrapping material.&lt;br /&gt; Now about Shea butter: the butter hasn&#x27;t typical yellow color , it has grey color, it has not fully typical smell,  resembles  remotely how Shea butter should smells, condition is creamy but not solid,as though it was inflated, has nothing to do with condition of Shea butter which is hard. So i deeply worry what it is.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smells like a village of goats so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really ascertain its usefulness as a super-moisturizer.  I even tried mixing it with other better-smelling lotions/creams, to no avail.  Maybe it would be good to soften leather?</li>
            <li> This is one of my most used products, i use it in lotions that i purchase and mix the two together, it works really well and keeps me and my skin happy...C.</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter for my lotion, &amp; I use it on my hair for pomade. It make my skin very soft, &amp; it help my scalp too.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I receive had mold in it and smelled weird. I&#x27;ve been using this type of Shea butter for years and this is NOT how it is supposed to look and smell. I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s good on my skin and it helps withy scars no more keloids</li>
            <li> This is the second try to buy African Shea for my daughter after the first which was not as we ordered and returned it to Amazon .&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is happy with it.</li>
            <li> The butter was white not yellow and put it in a plate instead of container, is a bad choice.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product for dry, chapped, cracked winter skin.  I have been using this mostly on my hands and feet through the winter and have solved my cracked heel/split skin problem!  Not only that, but some of my toenails were getting a bit yellowed and within a few days of starting to use this, they have completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Comes as a solid chunk of shea butter in a plastic tub. My batch had a greenish tint, but over all the smell and texture were normal. It&#x27;s a natural product, and natural products vary in color. Shea butter makes a great ointment for sensitive, dry skin. It&#x27;s also way cheaper than Aquaphor, etc.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a great natural moisturizer. It can be somewhat greasy so don&#x27;t use it near your hair if you don&#x27;t intend to wash it the next day. It&#x27;s especially great on cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I just finished my container...which i&#x27;ve had for like 6 months...it stretches very well and I&#x27;m about to order some more!</li>
            <li> Quality seems good, texture and aroma similar to what I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  From the picture, however, I really thought the shea would come in a container.  It did not.  It came in a sealed, airtight milar envelop.  I reused some containers I already had for storage (read somewhere containers should be glass or stainless steel), and broke up the two bricks (8 oz each) for storage.  Not really a big deal, but just not what I expected, so I&#x27;m commenting for others.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that I received molded Shea butter. The top part is covered with grey, and I can see black dots on the bottom. I&#x27;m not going to put molded butter in my skin. Disgusting product.</li>
            <li> Mine had mold in it. Somewhat green, with black specks in it. I have purchased this product before in a store and it was very yellow with no other colors present.  Disgusting especially since on the package it says product does not expire. How can it not expire but is susceptible to mold at the same time? Awaiting my exchange, will be extremely upset if that one also arrives with mold. Im not the first person to post a review about mold. FIX THE ISSUE.</li>
            <li> exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! And the shipping time was excellent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and I really love it!! Its ALL natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce on the lotions I used to buy. I would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Remember to warm before using.  I keep a candle warmer in the bathroom to sit a small bowl of shea butter to heat while I shower.  Spread this marvelous emollient everywhere.  Your skin! Your hair! Rough feet!  Your face!  It really makes a diffeence, especially in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand. Very satisfied with it, the Shea butter really works.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d mine last year and it is white just like I&#x27;m used to.  I use it on my scars after every shower and they healed quickly without a bad scar.  My surgeons asked what I used on them because they healed quicker then normal and look great.  DO NOT USE ON A FRESH SURGICAL SITE.  I use it on dark spots and on my feet right out of the shower which keeps my feet soft for two days.  It takes longer to put on - open the lid before your bath or shower and it does soften a tad for easier application.  One day I may melt some in the microwave to see if it applies quicker.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry skin and I feel is more nourishing than the ultra refined super white shea butter that I used to use. The price is great too!</li>
            <li> Item was hard to get it to be soft</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Makes the belly butter so much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> great a lot for your money</li>
            <li> Product actually smells like an old ashtray.</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Good hydration and smoothen the skin perfectly .........I Order twice i really lov it. I will order agin for my sisters</li>
            <li> I always purchased Shea from a hideaway spot locally but as its gotten popular the size of product has went down while the price went up! I read many a review and this was the best. When it arrived it was the perfect consistency! Normally its hard and needs to be melted in the sun a few times but this was perfect. I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. So many uses for it. You won&#x27;t be able to live without it. I use it for rashes,cuts,athritis,inflamation and as a mosturizer on my face at night. Many more uses ! Shipping was fast through Amazon !</li>
            <li> Was shipped fast and more than I expected</li>
            <li> did not I receive shea butter in the same Description is different&lt;br /&gt; and how I can receipt of the same description</li>
            <li> Product is awesome. I like it and would recommend it. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This product maxed my skin smooth, and my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone, in place of lotion and other skin moisturizing products. This is a great natural product.</li>
            <li> When I received my \\&quot;16 ounce\\&quot; tub of shea butter it seemed a bit lightweight and I could see a lot of air voids through the sides of the plastic container. I weighed it with a very accurate digital scale and found that it was not 16 ounces but only 13 ounces and that included the weight of the container. So, I feel that I have been screwed out of about 25% of the product that I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to rate only the effectiveness of the shea butter, I would probably give it four or five stars. No, it&#x27;s not a magic bullet for any skin problem but it has helped me with symptoms of winter itch as well as a patch of psoriasis on each of my feet. It seems to be more effective than any of the higher priced and highly refined skin products available in drug stores and supermarkets. I&#x27;ve used this product for only a few weeks now (I started with a 5 ounce tub), so the jury is still out on it&#x27;s effectiveness. So far, however, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like knowing that my purchase is helping the people of Ghana. I spent a few weeks in that country on company business some years ago and just fell in love with the people and their culture. Despite the poverty, they are surprisingly honest, happy, and healthy. I&#x27;m not sure if the tubs of shea butter are packed in Ghana (in which case we should send them a good scale) or whether they&#x27;re packed in this country (in which case, shame on us).</li>
            <li> Love this product! Does what it says, just wonderful! Have even bought and sent to other family members! It rocks!</li>
            <li> I was worried about this being too hard but it was easy to scrape out the container. It took a little while to get used to the scent however I prefer it to shea butter lotions. I like that its a great lubricant and moisturizer without giving that shiny look like other oils. Humidity where I live is very low and is awful on my skin, this works beautifully to keep it moisturized. I always wet my skin then apply to trap the moisture. I also use it as a barrier cream for my baby. I think people are used to lotions with a small amount of Shea butter and expect that consistency. Its a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.2.14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found real shea butter and realize this isn&#x27;t it. Real shea butter has a smooth, buttery consistency.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick but it does the job.  You have to let it melt in your hand before you can rub it in.  It doesn&#x27;t look or smell pretty but it&#x27;s good for the skin.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is thick. You need to rub it between your hands to soften it up. It makes your skin feel oh so smooth for hours after application.</li>
            <li> How expiration date ..&lt;br /&gt;I can not find the expiration date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the bottles break and leak butter</li>
            <li> It good but it make my hand feel weird. I got if for eczema doing ok for it even though I have to use vaseline to get that moist feeling</li>
            <li> it may be a bit smelly, but it fades fast.  I love the way my hands feel after using it.</li>
            <li> 6-7-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in timely manner, planned to use on skin but then used it on my hair.  I had not used shea butter  before, but thought I would try the product.  The product is a solid and needs to be warmed in your hands for a few seconds before using it.  It has a very mild but pleasant scent.  This 16oz container will last me a long time.  I was super surprised by how soft and manageable my hair was. I like this shea butter and would certainly recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;gs</li>
            <li> This African Shea Butter is nothing short of a miracle for skin! Tried a blended commercial cosmetic product that contained shea butter and was fairly impressed- so I did a little research and decided to try this raw agricultural product: the price was REALLY right - it helped the \\&quot;village women\\&quot; - and I thought it might be even better for my skin than the cosmetic I&#x27;d used. Wow! I can&#x27;t praise it enough. Brown spots faded- zits healed up fast - skin looked and felt fabulous. Took it with me when I went to visit my daughter who \\&quot;lives\\&quot; in the sun - her face was so wrinkled and her hair so dead and frizzy that she looked 10 years older than she was. She put it on her face the first night- next morning looked at least 5 years younger as sun damage faded. She used it morning and night for 4 days, and began using it on her hair as well. When I left on the 6th day she nearly cried \\&quot;don&#x27;t take it away\\&quot;. I laughed and said- \\&quot;already ordered 3 for you!\\&quot;. And- just ordered 3 more for my mom- this stuff even heals itchy skin. Why isn&#x27;t everyone (with dry, sun-damaged skin) just buying it by the boat load? Please Amazon- ALWAYS keep this in stock! Thanks for a marvelous item...</li>
            <li> Shea butter is the absolute best, use right after you take a shower and your skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.&lt;br /&gt;Clears up scars and any dark spots better than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Real product. and the whole selling &amp; Delivry experience were remarkable.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, functions well and even better than that, it heals skin after time.  My skin in particular has changed significantly in the 3 months I have used Shea Butter.  The time period was from late May to now, late August.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with coconut oil to soften it and apply it to my skin daily. My skin is now soft, smooth, and supple. I will NEVER use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I use African Shea Butter on my skin and if a little left on my hand, I rub it through my hair. It&#x27;s also a good rub for arthritis.  It&#x27;s truly amazing!  Product came right on time.  No problem with packaging.</li>
            <li> When I received my shea butter I was so excited once I opened  my package the container  of the shea butter  was completely  cracked open  I was planning  on using the container to mix my oils and put back in the same container so upset waste of money .</li>
            <li> No cover  good and no writing on the outer lid</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried unrefined shea butter. First, it says 16 ounces, so I weighed it. Not quite 16 ounces. Also, smells horrible. I understand that since it&#x27;s unrefined it&#x27;s not supposed to smell like peaches n cream, but sure would have helped :) Now I don&#x27;t want to use the stuff. I even made whipped shea butter out of it and it still smells that same. Not sure I will want to try this next time.</li>
            <li> When I learned I was pregnant I began looking for a product to reduce the chance of stretch marks--which I am prone to getting and already have a few of on my upper thighs.  I bought this to try &amp; will probably continue to use it instead of lotion forever! It comes in a plastic bowl, it&#x27;s about as hard as a bar of soap, and it smells &#x27;earthy&#x27;.  I add a few drops of vitamin E oil &amp; lavender oil and then use the back of a spoon to &#x27;work it up&#x27; to soft consistency (I do about 1/10 of the bowl at a time).  I don&#x27;t microwave it and it takes about 30 minutes to fully absorb into my skin (feels just a little bit greasy until then, but it&#x27;s probably the oil I add to it).  I&#x27;ve used it now for 6 months on my stomach &amp; legs.  I&#x27;m now 8 1/2 months pregnant &amp; NO stretch marks yay!  My legs were pretty scarred up from an accident I had with one of my horses, &amp; after using it a few months on my legs the scars are about 80% gone yay!  I also noticed that all those &#x27;shaving bumps&#x27; I had on my legs are pretty much gone since using this product. All that being said, I didn&#x27;t find this product to be an overnight miracle cure--I really only noticed a difference after at least several weeks of CONSISTENT use.  But what a difference!!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in my lipglosses.</li>
            <li> Love this to moisturize my extremely sensitive and allergy prone skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in my lotion products.  On a whim, I threw it on my new digital scale and it only weighed 12oz- including the container.  Not a happy camper.  Amazon fixed me up though, so kudos to them, but still disappointing that that problem occurred in the first place.</li>
            <li> great product. It really moisturized my natural hair plus it&#x27;s a great skin moisturizer too. I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product? I have type 4a hair and I use this to seal my hair. A little goes a long way and this usually last about 9 months. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> after I have read those negative reviews about it and about how stinky it is and how hard it is and how the color is not what it should be... I still wanted to try because of other positive reviews and because it is natural without any chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I am very impressed! I dont understand why people are saying it is stinky , the smell is totally fine, kind of nutty, natural smell. Of course it will not smell perfumy like other creams sold in stores because they are packed with perfume and chemicals and this product is all natural!&lt;br /&gt;I was using Palmer&#x27;s tummy butter before and I was still itching and got rashes now and then ( I am 6 months pregnant). I started using this Shea Butter and I don&#x27;t feel the itchiness any more.&lt;br /&gt;it is hard in texture, but it melts right when you are able to scrape some onto your fingers and then when you massage it in, it can stay long and moisturize your skin. You need to wear loose cotton clothes though because it&#x27;s \\&quot;butter\\&quot;. But the grease is easy to remove from your palms once you are done applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont listen to those negative reviews about it! These folks should then buy the products with additives and chemicals if they want it creamy, perfumy smell and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;if you want to go all natural, this is a very good quality product. I am very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, people say it does not come full in the container or underweight. My container came full and packed to the top with solid butter, no chunks or anything like that... Excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter has not only made my skin softer, but helped fade the age spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> As raw as she a butter gets, used it in my butter butter recipe and I have to say, it&#x27;s been doing its job, keeps me moisturized in this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> great in lip balms, body butters and salves..greasy for a few minutes but it absorbs pretty fast, especially when applying friction from vigorous rubbing from your hands...I love it as much as cocoa butter...add a lil Jojoba oil and you&#x27;ll like it even more...coconut oil is nice too but too much makes me feel greasy.</li>
            <li> The container was damage but because of extra wrap nothing linked. The product itself was the correct amount supplied according to description. Container was microwave safe but unable to use it because of damage.</li>
            <li> GREAT product!! No bad smell either.</li>
            <li> This product is as expected...great product! youthful experience....this was recommended by a friend and it is excellent product to use.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair but I LOVE using it on my skin. I apply it all over my body and it does an excellent job moisturizing and repairing skin with scars. It will melt once you scoop it up with your finger from your body heat. I know aome people also put it in the microwave but I prefer to warm it up with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in some reviews that some received thier shea butter in a plastic bag or that it was melted. My Shea butter came packaged in a tub like the one pictured above and not melted which is great considering I purchased in July during a heat wave. And there was no unpleasant odor. It smells just like the ones you purchase from vendors at events (where I first purchased Shea butter) or local stores.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft. It has a very light scent and wonderful creamy feel. I add different essential oils to create different scents. I make body butters with it or use it right out of the container.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. Unfortunately I&#x27;m worried about putting on clothes after I put this on my skin. It&#x27;s super sticky and smells weird. I&#x27;ve started using it on my hair after straight ironing to add shine and works well for that.</li>
            <li> top grade shea butter. a staple in my home. very good quality.</li>
            <li> My wife realy likes it.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!! Love this on my neck and elbows andwhatever else needs moisturizing. it has the grainy feeling so rub a blob in both hands before applying. Cant say enough good about this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before and, this is different, not the same color or consistency.  I like the yellow color, smell and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;Contacting them is also not an option if you have questions as to why its different. It does seem to go on the same once you soften&lt;br /&gt;it in your hands.  However, its still different than my first purchase.  Not happy but, not enough to return it.  Will give it a try.</li>
            <li> There are no words for how satisfied I am.  The feel of Shea Butter is phenomenal.  I&#x27;ve since gotten rid of all my face creams.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and looks just like the photo. Living in Fairbanks, Alaska my skin craves moisture and this stuff is amazing. Going to try it on my natural hair next :)</li>
            <li> I ordered and was charged for 16oz. The product pictured two containers so I weighed the one container I received. In the container.....the amount I received was 11 oz...and the container weighs about 2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please correct this shortage.</li>
            <li> Just as i expected,&lt;br /&gt;Very nice quality and color.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is the usual Shea Butter smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what the description said: natural shea butter. It works very well for my needs, and there&#x27;s enough of it to last me forever! The only complaint I have is that it arrived in a generic plastic tub with no labeling, and the lid had come off during shipping, which caused a small amount of the shea butter to escape from the tub. A little tape around the rim or across the top and down the sides would have prevented this. Other than that, the shea butter is exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I am happy wit it and I will purchase it again when we need it.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering the African Shea butter and have not been disappointed. It is all natural and lasts forever! Great buy</li>
            <li> I thought that Shea Butter was expensive because of the other commercial products available (like BBW and Perlier). This is what another reviewer mentioned in her review, and I have to agree with her, and mention it here, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance with ordering this product, but I am VERY pleased with the quality. Yes, the packaging isn&#x27;t quite pretty like the commercial ones but the STAR here is the raw product, shea butter. I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural and effective moisturizer for my very dry and sensitive skin. I do agree with one reviewer, that it is very hard in its solid raw form. But the trick is, to scrape the shea butter with the top of your nails, then rub the shea butter between your palms, and it will warm up a bit, then it will feel more softer and manageable, finally, apply to your skin (make sure it is rubbed into your skin very well, so there isn&#x27;t any excess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products, including coconut oil (greasy but thin) besides all the commercial lotions and body butters, and I find that my dry skin responds better to the raw shea butter. I finally found something that works, and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly order this product again. Service was pretty quick. Product was intact and had a sticker seal. I had no issues with the container.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly in the body butter I made. Melted well and mixed well with other ingredients. I need to remember to buy more next time.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Shea butter. I&#x27;m a little confused because I keep reading that real Shea butter is not yellow but rather ivory color. This Shea is very yellow. However I certainly don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the quality. Feels like butter!</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly. Great product! I like to melt it down and make hair products and body butters adding different essential oils. Its very nice to my skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I never review items, but this one deserves a glowing review. I have extremely dry skin. Name the lotion and I have tried it. No matter which one I used it never made a difference in my skin. I was on one of my find a better lotion online searches and ran across African Shea butter. What a difference this has made! Every night after I shower I grab a good bit of this stuff and rub it between my hands. I put on a solid layer all over. In just a week my eczema patch on my leg looks a 100 times better. Now when I shave I don&#x27;t have irritated skin and overall my skin doesn&#x27;t look dull anymore. Best purchase ever!</li>
            <li> Ive only used it 3 times and my skin is noticably smoother and radiant!! I will be buying more and more!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. I bought it mostly for dry, cracked hands in the winter and it works like a charm! It does not have an aromatic scent, being unrefined. But there are many uses for this natural product. I bought two tubs and whenever I run out, I will buy more!</li>
            <li> Very very very gooooooooood</li>
            <li> Came just as seen in the picture! Strong container. Though this is my first time buying or ever using ,seeing &amp; smelling Shea butter.. It seem to be as described buy others, &amp; videos as well! A little goes along way!</li>
            <li> It is good and awesome</li>
            <li> Loved it!  I used it to create a body butter and it worked great.  Great product!</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and easeGOOD</li>
            <li> I love it.  Use on my feet and hands . . .</li>
            <li> I got this on a recommendation from my father in law since his skin is like my youngest daughter (very dry). I use it every night after her bath and her eczema like skin has cleared tremendously. I even put a little drop of NOW Almond oil in her bath water to soften the water a bit and cure the dry skin. Both products used together are miracles.</li>
            <li> I ordered the African Shea Butter and got a lot more than I expected for the price. I use it on my skin and hair and I can definitely tell the difference in how moisturized my skin and hair are. I don&#x27;t have to use much so I&#x27;m able to stretch it out a while. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter is great...this is the only product that helps my dried cracked hands during the winter...and then I use it for sun protection in the summer....Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> good for keeping your hair moisture in the winter hard to wash off if you use it for your skin</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly with Prime,  Slight odor that disappears.  Gritty feel until it melts with skin warmth.  I have a rash around eyes and nothing helps.  This softens and smooths the skin, drastically cutting down itch and burning quickly.  A REAL FIND. Obviously natural, too.</li>
            <li> I so love this all natural shea butter. It&#x27;s hard, but quickly softens when rubbing it in your hands. I use this every night on my face, neck, butt, legs, thighs, arms, feet, back. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m happy with how soft i&#x27;ve become lol</li>
            <li> I have heard some horror stories regarding Shea Butter and the quality once received.  But this product was AWESOME, made lotion out of it and will order from this merchant again!!!!</li>
            <li> I use the shea butter as a moisturizer and melt part of it down to include with my black soap mixture. Because it is a butter, if you blend it in, go easy on the amounts or you will experience quite a bit of separation and small chunks but it&#x27;s all usable so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It leaves your body nice and soft.  My students say I smell like a cookie.  Go figure!  I had old eczema patches on my feet.  Umm, they are gone now.  All I did was apply the shea butter to my feet every other night.  Works miracles!</li>
            <li> I hope when you send it to the customer save it more and put the butter in good can, because I got it Means and sparse :(</li>
            <li> Took very long with the delivery. However it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> IT IS FAKE AFRICAN SHEA BUTTER AND IT IS NOT YELLOW AT ALL AND NOT EVEN RELATED TO THE PICTURE SHOWN. IF I COULD NOT GET REFUND I&#x27;M GOING TO USE IT AS A RIM, TIRE, AND PUMBER CLEANER FOR MY OLD CHEVY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT LOOKS AS A SOAP NOT A BUTTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REALLY REALLY AND REALLY BAD BAD AND BAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE IT AS  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  &amp;#34;(-)&#x27;&#x27;(5)(STAR)</li>
            <li> Perfect for making my homemade lotion bars.</li>
            <li> Product ordered was not as pictured and was incredibly grainy and felt gross. I threw it out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It helped for my dry skin but I thought it would help for more things but it&#x27;s still makes my skin glow a little bit so it in middle of bad and good</li>
            <li> I used this product for producing lotion bars.  I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I did  not  receive all the pieces that I have ordered ..! : /</li>
            <li> This product helps with chapped, cracked hands and feet.  A little goes a long way and the smooth feeling lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Used this product throughout my whole pregnancy, not one stretch mark and no bad smell like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> They shipped it very quickly and the product is just great, works on almost anything for your skin and can be used as a base for more elaborate moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to skin</li>
            <li> It turned white and I think it spoiled! But I make do ya know? I really don&#x27;t want that money to go to waste. I leave it in room temperature and I really don&#x27;t know what I did wrong. I LOVE african Shea butter. I really don&#x27;t know why people are always complaining about the smell and the way it feels. That&#x27;s my favorite part. But I guess I have to buy I new one. Maybe I should like refrigerate this or something. Idk. It came on time an stuff it&#x27;s prolly my fault it&#x27;s turning white. I&#x27;ll have to look it up or something, but whatever.</li>
            <li> Making my own cosmetics is a breeze with this Shea Butter.  It smells wonderful, feels great, and is so easy to use!</li>
