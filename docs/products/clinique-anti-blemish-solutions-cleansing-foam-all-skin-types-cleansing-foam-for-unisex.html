            <li>To his amazement, the breakout on his skin got a lot better in just a few days...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything under the sun and have even been prescribed different medications to treat the problem.</li>
            <li>It is important to use the other item (step 2 &amp; 3).</li>

            <li> My wife has been a fan of Clinique since her late teenage years, as their products were the only ones that did not irritate her skin and really helped with Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle says to use 2 pumps, but as long as your face isn&#x27;t unnaturally enormous, one pump will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> it is not 100% gone, but maybe at least 75% or so less.</li>

            <li> Excellent product. Try it.</li>
            <li> love love love this product.  After struggling with adult acne for years finally found a product that helps so much.  I use this at night along with the Clinique moisturizer (it is step three in their acne program).  I also use their anti blemish makeup.  The difference in my skin is life changing.  So happy I found this product.  By the way I DO NOT use this product twice a day.  I use a gentle face soap in the morning w/ an oil free moisturizer.  If I use these products twice a day it is too drying for me.  Also too drying if I use step 2 of their acne program.  Experiment with it to find the best fit for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and the Clinique brand seems to be the only actually works for me.  Love it...although I&#x27;ve only tried it with all 3 products together (cleansing foam, clarifying lotion, and clearing treatment).  Haven&#x27;t ever tried using just one, so it might be the combo of all 3 that actually does the trick for me.  Regardless, I&#x27;m not changing things up to figure it out, because it actually is working.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift.  She has had it before &amp; loves it.  It was on her wish list to get again, so you know she really likes it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been a fan of Clinique since her late teenage years, as their products were the only ones that did not irritate her skin and really helped with Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that our teenage, volleyball playing son started to have typical teen breakout, the first thing she did was take him to the Clinique counter for some advice.

To his amazement, the breakout on his skin got a lot better in just a few days... it is not 100% gone, but maybe at least 75% or so less. Truly remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies also recommended a liquid facial soap ([[ASIN:B000GHVCM2 Clinique Liquid Facial Soap Mild]]) that he began using when showering, and maybe that has helped him too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you or your loved one has the same type of issue, we would definitely recommend both of these products to you based on our son&#x27;s experience with them.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! This is not Acne Solutions Cleaning Foam!  It is an Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleaning Foam. Ordered expecting item from the Acne Solutions line, but received this Anti-Blemish instead which did not have anywhere on the box, bottle or paper insert ingredients listed, but I am assuming it does not have salicylic acid like the Acne Solutions does.  It also has an alcoholic smell to it that is not so pleasant.  Glad I can return free of charge, but disappointed this is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> very good! It really works fro my skin. I love this set.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cleanser I&#x27;ll ever use again. Gets rid of every breakout I have in a day or two, no other face wash has ever given me the results that this has.</li>
            <li> Helps clear skin in no time, and handy for traveling, compared to the bar version.</li>
            <li> Always use this product for my face.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not dry my face out.</li>
            <li> Great product, works even with my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> excellent product. it has helped me a lot to control the acne in my face. I highly recommended. I receive the prodcut on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for more than 2 years and love it. Started on it with the whole Clinique anti-blemish range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;- Twice daily Am/PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves my skin feeling great after wash. Looking at the mirror, I just know that&#x27;s how healthy skin should look like.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with bottle that make foam as you dispense it. It&#x27;s a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;- Contains Salicylic acid - which is what one should look for in anti-acne regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t know how effective it can be. Still get acne now and then. Really shiny/oily T-zone. But if I have to change anything in the Clinique routine, I would rather change the other two (lotion and moisturizer) cause I like the feel of this one too much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and arrived on time. Just this product is too harsh for me. I didnt know what to do with it so i threw it away. :C</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, for me the best. The acne is controled and almost eliminated. It is important to use the other item (step 2 &amp; 3).</li>
            <li> The bottle says to use 2 pumps, but as long as your face isn&#x27;t unnaturally enormous, one pump will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff helps heaps with my adult acne.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only line that works for my skin. I love how the cleanser comes out as a foam. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that is not too harsh and leaves skin feeling refreshed. Would definitely recommend this to persons seeking a tame-looking but effective solution to acne related issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years and after my recent pregnancy, it got much worse. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything under the sun and have even been prescribed different medications to treat the problem. Nothing ever worked. That is until I tried the Clinique 3 step system. My skin improved drastically and the products aren&#x27;t overly drying or too harsh so I feel comfortable using them twice a day. Love these products!</li>
            <li> I received a clarifying lotion which was not what I originally ordered!</li>
            <li> 2 stars because this product did not work for me.I originally bought the 3 step acne solution system which worked very well. I bought this because I had run out of step 1, I had used this product for about 2 weeks before I started breaking out again. This product does not contain any active ingredient for use on acne. Which is fine since it only claims to be &amp;#34;anti-blemish&amp;#34;... long story short, wasted 20 bucks on this. If you want something that might actually work use the Acne Solution line also from Clinque, it contains salicylic acid for acne. This product is also misleading as it shows the picture of the acne solution bottle even as I am writing this review.</li>
            <li> The only stuff that keeps my face clear!</li>
            <li> This stuff really keeps the breakouts down!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this face Wash. IT removes makeup and I haven&#x27;t had any blemishes since I started using it. Dec recommended</li>
            <li> I love this! This is grear for people like me who have problems with troubles on their face. Also soft after washing!</li>
            <li> did not work at all I think it actually made me break out around my jaw line.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is my cure for my mild acne! I love it. It&#x27;s ok for sensitive skin, non drying, and your face feels amazing after! I suggest using only 2 pumps each time because it does go a long way! Buy ittttt it&#x27;s worth it! :)</li>
            <li> I am a 20-something female who struggles with the occasional breakout. I&#x27;ve tried every brand of over the counter acne wash, never to find one that truly worked. I tried ProActiv, which only dried my skin. This works! Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all, leaves my face clean and refreshed. It only took about a day for the results to show. I would recommend this to any adult who has trouble finding a product that will help their acne without over-drying.</li>
