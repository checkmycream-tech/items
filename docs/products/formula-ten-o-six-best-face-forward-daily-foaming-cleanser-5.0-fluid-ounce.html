            <li>It cleans your skin, but it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
            <li>This soap is incredible.</li>
            <li>For the longest time, I used Biore&#x27;s foaming wash for combination skin (which is still a good product!), but I wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li>so I am so happy I have had good results with this cleanser no irritations at all!</li>
            <li>and I have had great results</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and awesome.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>

            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>Best Face Forward at my local Ulta store.  </li>
            <li>They should have put it in a bottle with the opening on top.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, with more oil in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li>thinking i&#x27;d be okay</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute because of the clean lines and the product smells fruity and amazing.</li>
            <li>This does get your face very clean.</li>
            <li>this right here!!</li>
            <li>It lathers great and smells good however my face feels really dried out after using it.</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat watery consistency that lightly foams.</li>
            <li>The smell is so fresh and invigorating, but not perfumey or overdone like many soaps on the market.</li>
            <li>cleanser is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I assumed this product was fragrance free</li>
            <li>love this very much</li>
            <li>but I will stick to the 10.0.6 original formula astringent</li>
            <li>&amp; I have a squeaky clean feel for hours.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that it does clean my face.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m done using it my face feels clean and oil-free.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>The product makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>, this kept my skin clear, clean, and most of all radiant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like that added water to a 1/2 full bottle of the original stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole line of products, they work better together.</li>
            <li>, i have mild oil and breakouts on my face and this works wonders.</li>
            <li>Beautiful clear clean and makes your skin back to its coloration with one use for me</li>
            <li>I first bought this at Ultra because it was cheap and the clerk recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I searched everywhere for this brand for about two weeks before finally deciding to just buy it off of amazon, definitely worth a try for anyone looking for a cheap but AMAZING face wash.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot,</li>
            <li>Be prepared to have the container right side up when squeezing it out .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for getting your face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have REALLY oily skin....not much works to keep my 30 year old face oil &amp; acne free!</li>
            <li>I have used soooo many different cleansers including Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I first found Formula 10.0.6</li>
            <li>also want to add that this is pretty heavy-duty stuff.</li>
            <li>first tried this product 4 weeks ago</li>
            <li>Green tea is the antibacterial that is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>this makes my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>So, instead of settling for something less (I&#x27;ve tried soooo many!)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts/pimples from about the time I turned 18-19, but have struggled with having oily skin, large pores, and blackheads for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got my product it was reasonably priced  and came on time..</li>
            <li>Its main purpose is cleansing, not makeup removal, but I find my entire face is make-up free after use.</li>
            <li>so far my skin feels clean and never dried out.</li>
            <li>This gets deep down into my pores and my face feels so clean and smooth</li>
            <li>I would also like to include that if you have combination or normal skin, you will have to moisturize your face after you&#x27;re done using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is normal, but either way it still works like it says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients are far better than what&#x27;s typically in cleansers.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, I don&#x27;t breakout and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face!</li>
            <li>but nope i wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>The package is really inappropriate because when you open it the stuff flows out so fast</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin when it comes to beauty products</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to make a mess.</li>
            <li>, your face will be oil free and clean, but it will also feel a little dry depending on your type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it cuts right through all the makeup, dirt, and oil but doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a fruity smell, it&#x27;s clear and has a runny consistency.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so soft &amp; not one bit oily.</li>
            <li>Most soaps leave my face feeling dry, tight and flaky-</li>
            <li>With every other cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;ve always had to remove facial makeup before washing my face, otherwise my skin wouldn&#x27;t come completely clean.</li>
            <li>This product tends to leave my skin feeling a bit dry, and I really don&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One major issue I have is how runny it is.</li>
            <li>but when I stopped using  it actually made my face become clear</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s female with extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>And as other have stated it is very liquidy</li>
            <li>If I accidently turned it upside down, a lot of it came out, so beware and don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>It really does get down in your pores, cleaning out all the clogged dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>I already have veey sensitive and dry skin  </li>
            <li>I think it lightened up some dark spots as well!&lt;br /&gt;However the main problem I had was that it was watery.</li>

            <li> Helped clear up my skin and helps with dark spots.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit liquid-ey (no need to squeeze the bottle - it pours right out), so I always pour a small bit into my hand, lather it up, and then apply to my face; a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling a bit dry and uncomfortable even with a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although my skin is dry and it did dry out my face some</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is either too dry at times or too oily on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip your skin and dry it out.</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin out if you are prone to dry skin so be careful.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other 10.0.6 products.</li>
            <li> ( it&#x27;s suppose to be the other way)</li>
            <li> Very liquidy, therefore, difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> I typically think that &amp;#34;maybe</li>
            <li> (nothing a little moisturizer cant fix)</li>
            <li> my bottle seemed a little runny.</li>
            <li> had passion fruit and green tea extracts I still used it</li>
            <li> Texture is excessively diluted ... will never buy again</li>
            <li> I tried it for two days than my face broke out :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid that it will open and spill everywhere.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a creamy thick cleanser</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terrible, but I don&#x27;t really like it either.</li>
            <li> my pores have shrunk insanely since I started using this!</li>
            <li> Horrible it made me break out</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is incredible. It has a somewhat watery consistency that lightly foams. The smell is so fresh and invigorating, but not perfumey or overdone like many soaps on the market. Its main purpose is cleansing, not makeup removal, but I find my entire face is make-up free after use. Most soaps leave my face feeling dry, tight and flaky- this makes my face feel soft and clean. The ingredients are far better than what&#x27;s typically in cleansers. The biggest benefit of all- my pores have shrunk insanely since I started using this! I typically think that &amp;#34;maybe I notice a difference,&amp;#34; but nothing drastic. This is 100% noticeable! Even my mom has commented on how glowing and even my complexion looks. There&#x27;s honestly nothing I don&#x27;t like about this product, at 7 bucks a pop even the price is a winner. Follow up cleansing with their moisturizer or mud mask!</li>
            <li> I have REALLY oily skin....not much works to keep my 30 year old face oil &amp; acne free! I&#x27;m sure that you can understand my frustration. I bought this product at a local grocery store &amp; have been using it for about 2 months. It keeps my skin so soft &amp; not one bit oily. I use it on my face, neck &amp; sometimes my shoulder&#x27;s &amp; I have a squeaky clean feel for hours. If your skin is like mine then you HAVE to get this product..I can&#x27;t wait to try the pore scrub!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with acne on and off I have oily skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything! Proactiv worked but this right here!! This is the best I mean best face wash ever combin with the stuff in the Orange bottle.. Beautiful clear clean and makes your skin back to its coloration with one use for me love this very much I always got compliments saying I was getting my color back it had me overly confident love it!!</li>
            <li> Very liquidy, therefore, difficult to use.  Simply opening the container results in lots of wastage.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff!!! Im 26 and have always had problems with acne. I first bought this at Ultra because it was cheap and the clerk recommended it to me. I have used soooo many different cleansers including Mary Kay. Nothing has worked like this stuff!!! It&#x27;s cheap and awesome. I love the smell! I look forward to trying other 10.0.6 products.</li>
            <li> Horrible it made me break out and it&#x27;s watery when u put it in my hand but when I stopped using  it actually made my face become clear ( it&#x27;s suppose to be the other way) I don&#x27;t recommend none of the products</li>
            <li> glowing. i love this product</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading a review online. The smell is pleasant but not too strong easy to use and I have had great results so far my skin feels clean and never dried out. It may be too soon to tell but I also have noticed a decrease in some of my skins oiliness. I have very sensitive skin when it comes to beauty products so I am so happy I have had good results with this cleanser no irritations at all!</li>
            <li> I first found Formula 10.0.6 Best Face Forward at my local Ulta store.  Next thing I know, they no longer carried it!!  So, instead of settling for something less (I&#x27;ve tried soooo many!), I decided to look online.  Thank you, Amazon!!  This is my forever facial wash!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s female with extremely oily skin. I haven&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts/pimples from about the time I turned 18-19, but have struggled with having oily skin, large pores, and blackheads for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product line in a local ULTA beauty store. Would have purchased from Amazon(Smile) but ULTA was running a BOGO 50% off and for what I wanted to buy, it came out cheaper. Anyway, I bought this cleanser, the salicylic acid astringent, the mattifying moisturizer, and one of the masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is fantastic. The consistency is a bit liquid-ey (no need to squeeze the bottle - it pours right out), so I always pour a small bit into my hand, lather it up, and then apply to my face; a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. This gets deep down into my pores and my face feels so clean and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that this is pretty heavy-duty stuff. With every other cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever tried, I&#x27;ve always had to remove facial makeup before washing my face, otherwise my skin wouldn&#x27;t come completely clean. I don&#x27;t have to do that when using this cleanser - it cuts right through all the makeup, dirt, and oil but doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin. It also has a sweet-smelling scent that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using these products for a week but they are already making a difference in my skin and pores. Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Ulta store. I was expecting a creamy thick cleanser but it&#x27;s watery instead. The package is really inappropriate because when you open it the stuff flows out so fast and it&#x27;s really easy to make a mess. They should have put it in a bottle with the opening on top. I can&#x27;t carry this around in my cosmetic bag. I&#x27;m too afraid that it will open and spill everywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after a suggestion on a blog. The packaging is cute because of the clean lines and the product smells fruity and amazing. One major issue I have is how runny it is. Be prepared to have the container right side up when squeezing it out . It lathers great and smells good however my face feels really dried out after using it. I think if you have oily skin this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that it does clean my face. After I&#x27;m done using it my face feels clean and oil-free. I would also like to include that if you have combination or normal skin, you will have to moisturize your face after you&#x27;re done using it. This product tends to leave my skin feeling a bit dry, and I really don&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, your face will be oil free and clean, but it will also feel a little dry depending on your type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto describe the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fruity smell, it&#x27;s clear and has a runny consistency. Is it foamy? no. It&#x27;s rather bubbly.&lt;br /&gt;I literally feel like I&#x27;m putting liquid hand soap on my face every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again? Probably not.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Although my skin is dry and it did dry out my face some (nothing a little moisturizer cant fix), this kept my skin clear, clean, and most of all radiant! I think it lightened up some dark spots as well!&lt;br /&gt;However the main problem I had was that it was watery. If I accidently turned it upside down, a lot of it came out, so beware and don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terrible, but I don&#x27;t really like it either. It cleans your skin, but it&#x27;s not the best. It leaves your skin feeling a bit dry and uncomfortable even with a light moisturizer. I finished the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is either too dry at times or too oily on my T-zone. I have tried it all to help me with my problems. For the longest time, I used Biore&#x27;s foaming wash for combination skin (which is still a good product!), but I wanted to try something else. I kept reading all these raving reviews about Formula 10.0.6 and decided to check it out. I found that there was some listed on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t help myself .. for the price, I just had to buy some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this product 4 weeks ago and I have noticed a big difference in my skin since starting. It really does get down in your pores, cleaning out all the clogged dirt and oil. It&#x27;s foamy, but not so foamy that it overpowers the wash itself. It&#x27;s just right for getting your face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have to this product is my bottle seemed a little runny. Like it was watered down. If I watch how I hold the bottle, I can get the desired amount that I need.  I don&#x27;t know if that is normal, but either way it still works like it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this stuff out, though. It&#x27;s worth a shot,</li>
            <li> Texture is excessively diluted ... will never buy again</li>
            <li> I had purchased the starter kit from a story and the consistency of it was a thicker gel like substance. The consistency of this product is very different. It&#x27;s almost like that added water to a 1/2 full bottle of the original stuff. Will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My mom happened to find this brand of face wash and I absolutely loved it from the begining, i have mild oil and breakouts on my face and this works wonders. I searched everywhere for this brand for about two weeks before finally deciding to just buy it off of amazon, definitely worth a try for anyone looking for a cheap but AMAZING face wash.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip your skin and dry it out. It cleans the pores, that I feel there&#x27;s no need for a scrub. My face feels clean after using this product. Green tea is the antibacterial that is good for my skin. I tend to have an occasional pimple. I have combination skin, with more oil in the T-zone area. The product makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my skin and helps with dark spots. I bought the whole line of products, they work better together.</li>
            <li> Got my product it was reasonably priced  and came on time..I tried it for two days than my face broke out :/ I already have veey sensitive and dry skin  I assumed this product was fragrance free but it wasn&#x27;t ir had passion fruit and green tea extracts I still used it thinking i&#x27;d be okay but nope i wanted to try something new but I will stick to the 10.0.6 original formula astringent</li>
            <li> This does get your face very clean. And as other have stated it is very liquidy but you figure that part out and I found it not to be a big deal. It will dry your skin out if you are prone to dry skin so be careful.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My skin feels clean, I don&#x27;t breakout and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face!</li>
