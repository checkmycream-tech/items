            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> (i have a sensitive sense of smell</li>
            <li> The brush is not protected so I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long.</li>
            <li> I used it to blast my D100 sensor and the only way you can do it without the ac adapter is by using bulb, Which of course makes the sensor charged and supposedly harder to blast off the particles of dirt.</li>
            <li> I even asked my sister if the blower smells really that horrible (just to make sure its not just me being overly sensitive to that smell) and</li>
            <li> Blot dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;lens cleaner solution\\&quot; had leaked all over the other materials in the kit and everything was such a mess, I don&#x27;t think I can trust to use it on my camera lenses.   </li>
            <li> but i dont want to go to all that trouble with the sending it back and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful with the Q-Tips that are included in this kit, due to the fact that even those can scratch the lens on your camera.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t ever want to use glass cleaner due to that issue.</li>
            <li> I like the cloth because it wipes down items well, even when you don&#x27;t add solution.</li>
            <li> This kit is a little bulky and stays at home when the cameras go out.  </li>
            <li> as for the rest of it, it&#x27;s just common lens cleaner, q-tips, lens tissue, and a microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li> the microfiber cloths have become so ubiquitous, that I have at least a dozen of them around the house that never get used.</li>
            <li> blower works fine, but I&#x27;ve always found them to be mostly useless, and the rubber smell on this one is horrible.</li>
            <li> The cloth is pretty horrible and I would use other quetips than those provided but the lens papers not too bad.</li>
            <li> I am not going to take any chances with my expensive material...</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The brush is useless: the hairs are falling off as soon as i touch</li>
            <li> I recommend it to those that have been in the beach, or in a very dusty place taking photos.</li>
            <li> Rinse off the liquid soap throughly with cold, running water.</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>

            <li> so i cant handle this horrible smell of rubber)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Compact and effective. The blower stopped working after about a year&#x27;s use. I&#x27;d buy another though.</li>
            <li> This is very nice set of cleaning kit. I used on not just my camera, but all my devices such as my iPad, phone, etc. I especially like the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Has everything you need. The blower got the specks off my sensor, It has excellent velocity and bulb volume. I used it to blast my D100 sensor and the only way you can do it without the ac adapter is by using bulb, Which of course makes the sensor charged and supposedly harder to blast off the particles of dirt. This air blower had the power to overcome the static charge of the sensor! It comes with a bag for everything to be carried easily and keep the blaster clean.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this item it supplies you with al the cleaning reasorces needed to start caring for your camera</li>
            <li> Comes with all the essential cleaning tools to make sure your camera is nice and pristine.  I take it with me all the time.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews, but this thing is a disaster. Upon opening the outer box, I discovered the inner packaging was open! The \\&quot;lens cleaner solution\\&quot; had leaked all over the other materials in the kit and everything was such a mess, I don&#x27;t think I can trust to use it on my camera lenses.   I would definitely go to the brick and mortar and purchase one so you can see what you are getting. I am not going to take any chances with my expensive material...</li>
            <li> Rub liquid dish soap over the air blower&#x27;s rubber surface to greatly reduce the very strong rubber smell. Rinse off the liquid soap throughly with cold, running water. Do this twice. Blot dry with a paper towel. Keep the plastic attachment in place at the end of the blower to resist water entering the rubber bulb. Do not submerge. After doing this, the rubber smell is greatly reduced and no longer as bothersome. Airing the product out as an alternative to soaping and rinsing it, has no effect.</li>
            <li> For the amateur it&#x27;s a good kit with value for money. Easy to use, carry around and as everything you need</li>
            <li> -The air blower smells so horrible (i have a sensitive sense of smell so i cant handle this horrible smell of rubber) I even asked my sister if the blower smells really that horrible (just to make sure its not just me being overly sensitive to that smell) and yup, she said the same thing. HORRIBLE. BAD. RUBBISH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is useless: the hairs are falling off as soon as i touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The solution, but its different from what it looks like in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and the rest of it is ok, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking of returning this but i dont want to go to all that trouble with the sending it back and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LET THIS BE A WARNING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING ON BUYING THIS.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t. Just don&#x27;t buy it. You will regret it just like i do.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to those that have been in the beach, or in a very dusty place taking photos. it works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars because it could be better if it had a manual of each item and how to use it.</li>
            <li> nice assortment for a fair price. Mine came with a camera package but I&#x27;ve seen to ads. It&#x27;s worth it if you have a decent camera you want to take care of.</li>
            <li> A very nice kit for the price. It has all the tools I need to keep my lenses nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a quick fashion and in new condition as it was advertised for.  It was purchased for my Granddaughter Birthday so arrival time was important.  Thanks again</li>
            <li> I got mine as part of a package deal with some camera gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blower works fine, but I&#x27;ve always found them to be mostly useless, and the rubber smell on this one is horrible. the blower went in the trash. as for the rest of it, it&#x27;s just common lens cleaner, q-tips, lens tissue, and a microfiber cloth. the microfiber cloths have become so ubiquitous, that I have at least a dozen of them around the house that never get used. I actually prefer a nice soft, well-worn, cotton bandana. lens tissues are a good choice as well, except that they are usually too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line: get a can of compressed air, a bottle of lens cleaner, an old cotton t-shirt, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I primarily bought this for the blower and brush. The liquid cleaner was nice to get too and actually came in a spray bottle. The cloth is pretty horrible and I would use other quetips than those provided but the lens papers not too bad. For the price it was worth it too me. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> very nice piece and very good service too.</li>
            <li> The delivery of the product was good, and in good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the purchase, for those interested.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you thank you</li>
            <li> This kit is a little bulky and stays at home when the cameras go out.  I like the air blower to clean out the cracks and crevices of the housing.  The brush is not protected so I don&#x27;t see it lasting very long. I&#x27;ll give it to my wife for her makeup brush shortly.(that&#x27;s what it seems like)</li>
            <li> Great Lens cleaning kit it has everything you need to clean a lens.Would buy again it a good price too!!! Highly Recommend !!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cleaning solution that is included in this kit. I find that I use it on my Kindle also. Using glass cleaner on electronics causes them to get &#x27;milky&#x27; over time. You don&#x27;t ever want to use glass cleaner due to that issue. Be careful with the Q-Tips that are included in this kit, due to the fact that even those can scratch the lens on your camera. I don&#x27;t use those, I use the cloth that is included. I like the cloth because it wipes down items well, even when you don&#x27;t add solution. I also like the blower because it reaches into areas that you can&#x27;t get to with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a great compact cleaning kit.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps someone.</li>
            <li> The set is awesome everything you need to clean the lens of the camera is there, highly recommended!!! I like the blower it gets all the dust out of the lens.</li>
            <li> It´s just as in the picture: a set for cleaning lenses. The cotton stiks are very simple, for the rest is ok.</li>
