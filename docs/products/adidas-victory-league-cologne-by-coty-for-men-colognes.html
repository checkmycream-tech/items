            <li>Would be perfect for fall and winter.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t over doing it and the price is great...</li>
            <li>Impeccable compliance deadlines.</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely wonderful and will get some more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend a ton of money to get good cologne.  </li>
            <li>My son (8th grade) started using this product this summer, and all the girls comment on how good he smells.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good this cologne is.</li>
            <li>The notes are really good - if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying, go for it.  </li>
            <li>great smell lasts most of the day</li>
            <li>Nice mix of notes in this cologne.</li>
            <li>It is true..!!  </li>
            <li>great cologne excellent scent attracts the opposite sex very good and the fragrance lasts a long time.i am going to reorder.</li>
            <li>Now he can continue impressing all the girls which, when your in 8th grade, is very important.</li>
            <li>Not the best, but the price was VERY low.</li>
            <li>wish I could say more about it</li>
            <li>Do not like the smell at all, should be named more like failure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good product arrived a day late but still very happy.</li>
            <li>It works, and is cheap.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare with the $50+ parfumes, but for everyday use is one of the best</li>
            <li>If you can grab this \\&quot;Victory League\\&quot; in the &amp;lt; $10 for 3.4 oz price range, then by all means feel free to try it.</li>
            <li>Excellent smell in my opinion and the opinion of a few women.  </li>
            <li>Victory League comes out of the gate(s) strong with a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet, and finishes with a spice, powder, and followed by lingering vanilla - all of that according to Basenotes.  </li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s twice the price it&#x27;ll be steel worthy.</li>
            <li>However, the cleanliness does not compare to \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot; by Lucky ($25 for 3.4 oz).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthy of a repeat purchase, but in a pich</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>item smells and def worth the price.</li>
            <li>Gr8product right pricing but not delivered on door had to go to pp to collect</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne at such a low price!</li>
            <li>Is slightly milder than what I prefer but smells good.</li>
            <li>One star for the seller, the other because this could be effective in keeping girls off of you if you ever needed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those curious and interested in buying Adidas colognes, I would recommend Adidas Moves ($20 for about 2 oz), Deep Energy ($12 for 3.4 oz), and Fair Play ($9 for 3.4 oz).</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I would compare this cologne to a cross of the original Curve and a lighter Joop.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth a try - you just may have to reapply as necessary.</li>
            <li>With a cologne collection now in excess of 300 bottles - try something new, you may like it..</li>
            <li>Rather, it is somewhat of a bland yet clean smell.</li>
            <li>It would be my least favorite of the collection of Adidas colognes I have.</li>
            <li>thought i was going to be badly surprised</li>
            <li>If you guys (can be women too..) are following my reviews, you note I am big on the Wow Factor</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, its much too light for anyone in your personal sphere to even notice.</li>

            <li> I have always paid at least 80.00 for my cologne, but I got this for christmas, My first thought was yike&#x27;s. But while we were cleaning up all the wrapping paper I thought what the heck, should at least take a sniff before it hits the old junk basket. Well to my surprise I really like this.  Cederwood-Musk-vanilla-cutgrass.  Smells great!!!</li>
            <li> It works, and is cheap.  Not the best, but the price was VERY low.</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s twice the price it&#x27;ll be steel worthy. Can&#x27;t compare with the $50+ parfumes, but for everyday use is one of the best</li>
            <li> Excellent experience! All according to the agreement. Impeccable compliance deadlines. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not one to spend 50+ on fragrance so i just opted to buy this. Smells great. i&#x27;ll buy in the future. excellent price as well.</li>
            <li> Good product arrived a day late but still very happy. Smells great!</li>
            <li> The cologne does not represent any \\&quot;Victory League\\&quot; in my eyes... Or nose for that matter. It would be my least favorite of the collection of Adidas colognes I have. For those curious and interested in buying Adidas colognes, I would recommend Adidas Moves ($20 for about 2 oz), Deep Energy ($12 for 3.4 oz), and Fair Play ($9 for 3.4 oz). They each have their strengths and the reviews for them on Amazon are all quite helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this scent, it has no real &#x27;exotic&#x27; properties. Rather, it is somewhat of a bland yet clean smell. However, the cleanliness does not compare to \\&quot;Lucky You\\&quot; by Lucky ($25 for 3.4 oz). If you can grab this \\&quot;Victory League\\&quot; in the &amp;lt; $10 for 3.4 oz price range, then by all means feel free to try it. But I&#x27;ll hold my ground and say that this is just not one to get, solely based off the scent. There are no musky notes in it, but the smell does not sit well, unless you are accustomed to it. I&#x27;d expect someone to train themselves to like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say more about it but it doesn&#x27;t offer the kick you&#x27;d expect from Adidas. One star for the seller, the other because this could be effective in keeping girls off of you if you ever needed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell in my opinion and the opinion of a few women.  You don&#x27;t need to spend a ton of money to get good cologne.  Take this review for what you will.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Wonderful sent that lasts all day</li>
            <li> My son (8th grade) started using this product this summer, and all the girls comment on how good he smells.  We had purchased this at TJ MAX, but it was hit or miss on inventory, so when we saw it on Amazon, we ordered for Christmas along with the 5 oz body spray version Amazon also sells.  Now he can continue impressing all the girls which, when your in 8th grade, is very important.</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell at all, should be named more like failure.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product. \\&quot;Aroma\\&quot; is so bad , that it will make people around you cover their nose.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t over doing it and the price is great...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthy of a repeat purchase, but in a pich it&#x27;s holding up well</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne at such a low price! My wife likes the fragrance. This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Adidas has produced.</li>
            <li> item smells and def worth the price. thought i was going to be badly surprised cause u cant smell items over the net. but def like the item</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product. The scent is absolutely wonderful and will get some more when it runs out. That&#x27;s how good this cologne is.</li>
            <li> Seemed &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  Do not purchase.  Not a quality item.  Somebody is working a scam here!  Do not purchase this item!!!</li>
            <li> llego en perfectas condiciones y es excelente perfume, de muy buena calidad, ademas de economico, lo volveria a comprar si es necesario</li>
            <li> great smell lasts most of the day</li>
            <li> great cologne excellent scent attracts the opposite sex very good and the fragrance lasts a long time.i am going to reorder.</li>
            <li> Nice mix of notes in this cologne. Its a pear and vanilla aroma with a touch of spice and a hint of wood. Would be perfect for fall and winter. Unfortunately, its much too light for anyone in your personal sphere to even notice. Its barely detectable on my skin after a few minutes. Baby wipes have a stronger scent. I think the only way to project this weak scent is to spray it liberally all over your clothes and face.</li>
            <li> I give this cologne 4 out of 5 stars.  If you guys (can be women too..) are following my reviews, you note I am big on the Wow Factor (compliments received by the ladies) and staying power (longevity). Victory League comes out of the gate(s) strong with a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet, and finishes with a spice, powder, and followed by lingering vanilla - all of that according to Basenotes.  It is true..!!  I would compare this cologne to a cross of the original Curve and a lighter Joop.  For the price, it is worth a try - you just may have to reapply as necessary. I am fortunate enough (or perhaps unfortunate) to carry a brief case to/from work.  For those colognes I know have weak staying power, I put the bottle in my work stuff and reapply as needed.  The notes are really good - if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying, go for it.  It is a steal..!!  With a cologne collection now in excess of 300 bottles - try something new, you may like it..</li>
            <li> Gr8product right pricing but not delivered on door had to go to pp to collect</li>
            <li> Is slightly milder than what I prefer but smells good. I have used it in the past as well and always got compliments for wearing it.</li>
