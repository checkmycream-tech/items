            <li>My hair always feels and looks amazing after using this.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then wash my hair with warm water and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I would say it smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an off-white (kind of peachy) color</li>
            <li>BUT, there was nothing at all spectacular about this product.</li>
            <li>They were both kind of shimmery and offwhite.</li>
            <li>After doing that I noticed a difference &amp; made that a once a month kind of routine.</li>
            <li>It has a nice silky feel that you feel on your hair as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I think a lot of people do give this product a lot of good comments, I think I should just save my words to give it more compliment.</li>
            <li>know this stuff is kind of pricey</li>
            <li>It works awesome on my hair, I don&#x27;t have to use as much and my hair has changed dramatically since I have started using these.</li>
            <li>This is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Using this product is the absolute BEST thing I have every done for my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not make your hair oily but it gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Love it Love  Love it!!</li>
            <li>I opened it all I could think was &amp;#34;FAKE&amp;#34; the original product has the most incredible smell.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone with damaged or dry hair, SMELLS GREAT, GREAT PRICE!!</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a warm, rich, luxurious kind of scent (like the Macadamia Oil, smells sooo good).</li>
            <li>Quite honestly it&#x27;s the most amazing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product; however, it expired to quickly</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and smelling great !</li>
            <li>It feels so silky soft when rinsing it out and makes your hair feel awesome!</li>

            <li>so far i do like it, it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>After first wash my hair felt incredibly smooth and shiny, which is great!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and prone to a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>I love it because it perfectly blends with my natural scent!</li>
            <li>My very first order was perl white, smelt great and worked magnificently....</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my hair feel so much healthier and look it too!</li>

            <li>but it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it works wonder for the scalp and hair</li>
            <li>My hair looked better than it did ever before.</li>

            <li>Wayyy better than that morocan oil hair mask</li>

            <li>do not feel like it worked magic on my hair</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky smooth and takes care of any damage!</li>
            <li>Love this product and will always buy it.</li>
            <li>My hair is in significantly better shape.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and leaves hair so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have converted many people to users as well.</li>
            <li>You will not find a better price on this than amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have damaged hair, yet my hair dresser suggested this product for routine maintenance to keep my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend 100%.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I use this product as a daily conditioner and it works great!  </li>
            <li>but I think I became more greedy</li>
            <li>the softer and better smelling your hair will be without causing any damage.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it, I  keeps my hair looking healthy at all times</li>
            <li>The one purchased from amazon smells more like baby powder.</li>
            <li>this conditioner has been my favorite for years</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My stylist uses a hydrating shampoo as well as this awesome masque treatment for deep conditioning each time I visit the salon.</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair masque for about three years now and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>It is the best commercial made hair masque I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the results, just not the price tag in the store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, my hair is so much more manageable since I started using this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>This stuff may beat out my \\&quot;more expensive\\&quot; conditioning mask.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>So do I love it?</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger than before and is growing more than it used to as well.</li>
            <li>I can actually say this smells delicious!</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth now, even after applying heat!</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told friends about this product, and they love it, too,  </li>
            <li>I love how silky my hair feel like after using the hair Masque</li>
            <li>first i liked this product a lot!</li>
            <li>I realized this product is NOT for every hair type, like many beauty gurus say out there.</li>
            <li>and I can assure you that the one I had before is 100% authentic.  </li>
            <li>and it does make my hair softer for sure</li>
            <li>I love the scent and of course the way</li>
            <li>I just ordered the larger size jar and I am very happy with the value for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed leaving the product on for 30 minutes for better results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Macadamia Oil Deep Repair for 6 months now and getting it thru Amazon is the best price!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if it is authentic or not.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it made with my favorite product argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>sure maybe u can refund me my money</li>
            <li>Works magic on my waist length, tangley hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves no oily residue, just healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love the scent and how it moisturizers my hair.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>I use this every time I wash my hair love it</li>

            <li>This is a good deep conditioner and it smells nice</li>
            <li>I would love to really like this product because it&#x27;s so popular, but I don&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very light weight and super easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>This product has a good amount of protein in it and my hair has never needed a lot of protein, my hair normally needs hydration and moisture.</li>

            <li>I was really excited to get this mask.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I knew I fell in love.</li>
            <li>i was so so so excited to purchase this given its about 50% off on amazon compared to the original price..</li>
            <li>This stuff is also great for damaged hair, color-treated hair, and dry hair.</li>
            <li>This product made it soft and healthy in one use!</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny, soft and looked healthy!</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair nice and soft and is a keeper for me!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products that are good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and has made my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product alone is so, so good and lingers on my hair for two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing my hair, I get a big scoop and massage it into my hair, paying close attention to my roots.</li>
            <li>I love this hair mask, and this one was the real deal.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse the product very well.</li>

            <li>left hair soft and love the smell great buy</li>
            <li>It has a light, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>if this is the real product i love it 100%</li>
            <li>I would really like Amazon to confirm the Authenticity of this product before I purchase more from them.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair good elasticity,and my hair is really coarse and coily.</li>
            <li>i love how much shine</li>
            <li>I learned, early in my usage, that you must make sure to rinse every bit of it out when it&#x27;s done working because it will leave a film on your hair if it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>No matter how dry, frizzy, and unmanageable your hair may be, it makes your hair SO soft, manageable, smooth and shiny!!!!</li>
            <li>Seriously the BEST product in the world.</li>
            <li>Love this Deep repair Masque, I have tried so many</li>
            <li>I picked up some Suave conditioner for $1.72 a bottle at Wal-Mart to do a quick rinse in between washings.</li>
            <li>My hair loves this stuff, it is a bit pricey but worth every cent whether your hair is straight or curly damaged or healthy</li>
            <li>The hair is smooth and soft after using both products, but I feel like the hair is more shinning and silky after using LOREAL.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>i love this product and will definitely buy more when i run out.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and is like no other product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to style my hair After I and it last a long time , my hair feels great and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product and will always use it.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and apply it in the shower leaving it in for about 5 minutes, the key is to rinse well and use an excellent product to prevent damage from irons and blow drying.  </li>
            <li>They are the real deal!!</li>
            <li>I have coarse, dry hair and this product has worked great for me!</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair which can be frizzy and dull at times, but this product leaves my hair looking healthy and smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money-on the web site</li>
            <li>looks healthy, soft, bouncy, shiny and lustrous.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but to me its been totally worth it, and I will continue to repurchase it every year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit spendy but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>i like it is worth the money i pay for it  </li>
            <li>I love how soft this makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>This masque is worth every penny...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Lasts a loonnnng time (about 6-7 months) and worth the price.</li>
            <li>So many other cheaper DCs out there that appear to be better.</li>
            <li>They were not even capable of mastering the texture of the original product.</li>
            <li>how surprised she is that my hair is so nice and healthy even at its long length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care because the price is right</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews about shampoo &amp; conditioners and when they say it smells really good, it usually smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing my hair and keep it with a good smelling for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have very over processed hair and this left my hair very soft and happy.</li>
            <li>The Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque definitely does a great job on my hair, it leaves it extremely soft, shiny and much more healthier looking.</li>
            <li>After ONE application my dry, brillo bleached hair, it was shiny, soft and smelled great.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and luxurious and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>As long as I use body wash or soap, I&#x27;m able to clean off this oily residue.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty convinced it&#x27;s the right stuff.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth the money when you can go and buy a cheaper one that does the same (or better) job.</li>
            <li>so I recently bought the giant size of every macadamia product that I could find lol...</li>
            <li>I have curly, thick hair, so most &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; conditioners aren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li>Soft and manageable,  easy to control and style.  </li>
            <li>Please note that if you are sensitive to scents it may be too strong for you</li>
            <li>Very very disapointed</li>
            <li>A little bit like how Herbal Essences used to smell (but not as good) before they changed it to the fruity scents they have now.</li>
            <li>I love the entire Macadamial Nut Oil line, and will never use another brand again!</li>
            <li>I ran out and I miss it so much!</li>
            <li>Love deep repair, works</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried this product (not from Amazon), I could tell that it worked on my hair by the time I washed it out.</li>
            <li>Worth the high cost I promise!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this from root to tip</li>
            <li>At first, I purchased a sample from Ulta for $4.00, and after using it, I purchased the jumbo 16.9-oz jar from Amazon.</li>
            <li>But I will definitely keep buying :-)</li>
            <li>Used along with macadamia healing oil.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, results is exceptional!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and it leaves my hair deeply conditioned and moisturized.</li>
            <li>*First use opnion*</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the results I get with Macadamia, especially at this price.</li>
            <li>Healthy white girl hair.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>The first time I used already saw the results.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and it made my fried looking hair look like the life</li>
            <li>I need a very deep conditioning treatment that seeps into my hair, rather than sits on top without penetrating.</li>
            <li>I tried this mask for the first time today</li>
            <li>This product is exactly like the salon or beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Love this deep repair Conditioner</li>
            <li>I bought this in January and have maybe one more treatment left.</li>
            <li>Tried many products but this product has no parallel.</li>
            <li>Maybe the second use will be better....</li>
            <li>Had gotten a sample of this through the mail, and totally fell in love with it</li>
            <li>My curly hair really likes it!</li>
            <li>It works like a charm and my hair is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I used it a few years ago when I was bleaching my hair, and loved it.</li>
            <li>The masque makes your hair ridiculously smooth while in it and while it dries, but once it is dry, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will use it and know for sure as it&#x27;s affect on my hair after only a week or two is pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The shipment came very fast, the product is quite large in size, the product is everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I use a little of this masque in the shower every day and my hair looks so much healthier--is softer, stronger, and more easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I only use it 1 to at the absolute most 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>in fact, the product purchased from this seller includes at least 6 more chemicals than the authentic version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow</li>
            <li>a pretty light blonde and my natural hair color is light brown.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair from breaking, i went without a relaxer more than ten weeks and my hair was so strong I sustained no major breakage.</li>
            <li>If you use it as a deep conditioner, it works best to apply a generous amount, wrap your hair in a plastic bag, then wrap your head up in a hot towel or to apply heat in some other manner, such as the hair dryers at the salon.  </li>
            <li>first time I ordered the 8.5 ounce and it lasted me for a whole year, this time I got the 16.9 ounce</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it for a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair is nice &amp; soft after using it and it seems to style much easier; I hold the curling iron in place for lesser time.  </li>
            <li>It has great long lasting fragrance and make hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I only use it once or twice a week (in fact the jar says twice a week is the max), and it&#x27;s easy to tell which days</li>
            <li>and I ordered the large size from Amazon.</li>
            <li>After that I started using it in large quantities per treatment (just to get rid of it) and it started working quite well.</li>
            <li>I always blow dry my hair on the warm setting and after using the masque my hair is soft and manageable (bonus no split ends).</li>
            <li>it makes my hair super soft.. and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall as much anymore..</li>
            <li>Love the price even more, a tub half this size sells at my local CVS for $30.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel smoother and sleeker.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair after using it.</li>
            <li>It is 100% real.</li>
            <li>I received this product, I went straight to Ulta (which is where I would have purchased this product if not here) and compared what I received to the product in store.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I had received a free sample for this before and the texture is supposed to be white, and dense, kinda like butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely agree with those statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was rancid or the container was filled with a different product.</li>
            <li>She was hoping that it would be very moisturizing to her hair</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>This and thermal reconditioning (straight perm)</li>
            <li>I get twice as much product for under the price I paid retail in the salon.</li>
            <li>smell yummy &amp; very moisturizing</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Mine was 100% real.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I really makes a difference in the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>Before buying this hair masque, I was using the LOREAL  Absolute Repair Hair Masque.</li>
            <li>It would work wonders on frizzy, very dry,very curly, in need of moisture</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>so i can go purchase a real product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I recommend it to you.</li>
            <li>a Carol&#x27;s Daughter product user &amp; this compliments their line very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>This will be greatly appreciated</li>
            <li>This stuff gives my hair so much life and moisture....</li>
            <li>dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use this product after I shower, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li>Now, I use the L&#x27;Oreal hair masque for damaged hair because it works almost as well as the Macadamia and is so much cheaper (</li>
            <li>I really recommend it</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real masque.</li>
            <li>my wife&#x27;s hair gets.. absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>i love a good deep conditioner i hate the liquid kind it does absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>The product is so thick, creamy, and smells so good.</li>
            <li>and really makes my hair soft!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, It makes my hair softer than any other product I use, however I do with that</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t grasp that other people were able to do it.</li>
            <li>Great price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It works wonders on my hair, help me to get rid of my split ends problem, my hair is super soft and shiny now, growing healthy and heavy.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3/5 stars because I really liked the scent and the product had been lasting me quite a long time considering how I&#x27;ve been using it as my conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is the super high price tag!</li>
            <li>I have ordered before from different amazon sellers and got the real deal, but this time I didn&#x27;t get so lucky.</li>
            <li>The product smells great, a little bit goes a long way and purchasing the bigger jar is definitely the better buy</li>
            <li>Btw, this is not my first purchasing; I considered this brand as my frequent hair treatment</li>
            <li>I will not claim a true miracle and total reversal of all damage</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair and this conditioner makes it look almost normal.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t weigh down the top and to conserve the product.</li>
            <li>it was supposed to be, but then opening it later to use in the shower I saw the pink kind of tint a lot of people were talking about, maybe it was lighting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly</li>
            <li>The more expensive product I have used did add a healthy glow to my hair.</li>
            <li>(you need to use a whole lot more but still don&#x27;t gert the same smooth result; it could be mixed with other ingredients in it)</li>
            <li>When I went to a high end hair salon, they were using it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It does come highly recommended by a curly hair YouTube vlogger so I would say give it a try and see how it works on your hair.</li>
            <li>For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried this product, I highly recommend it, JUST BUY IT</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Either way I highly doubt I will ever purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This made my hair look really shiny and after using it multiple times, I find that my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other deep conditioner or hot oil treatment that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a little more slip to make it easier to put on my hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioning mask feels thick and heavy when you first put it on, and maybe a little greasy, but it rinses out clean and wonderful.</li>
            <li>But after using this I find that it grew a little more faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li>My hair really hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a normal conditioner and it didn&#x27;t work any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I needed something equipped to handle thick, coarse hair to make it smooth and more manageable.</li>
            <li>They smell pretty much the same and looked pretty much the same..</li>
            <li>But I found if you leave it on for a few hours or over night the results are much better</li>
            <li>My hair feels conditioned down to the ends, wonderfully soft, beautifully shiny, and silky feeling without feeling heavy or over conditioned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is cream colored with a kind of marbling on it just like the product I get from the salon which is half the size and double the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for amazingly soft hair!</li>
            <li>and ive heard the real macadamia masque are pure white.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love my hair especially after I use this, is always seems so much softer and appears less damaged.</li>
            <li>It is still conditioner and smells similar but completly different (cheap) texture.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Recommend this for someone looking to calm frizziness in normal to oily hair but dry frizzy ends.</li>
            <li>definitely something you should be aware of.</li>
            <li>My hair has been smooth and silky for going on day 10 and with other masques I was doing them 2X per week with nowhere near these results.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair soo soft!</li>
            <li>it does leave my hair soft but does nothing for the frizz!</li>
            <li>I first used this product after I began using violet shampoo to keep my highlights white and not yellow-toned.</li>
            <li>I bought this in a small sample size to give it a try and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, bouncy and shiny (not just shiny from the gray!)</li>
            <li>leaves hair soooo soft!</li>
            <li>I used it with heat for 20 minutes and my hair has never felt this soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I was at Ulta one day and saw this product and opened it up, it looked exactly the same as the product that I received from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Well, this masque fixed all the damage!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>only issue with this product is that it takes a large amount of the mask for my hair to feel &#x27;saturated.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Be back with an update after a little more use.</li>
            <li>every time I use, my hair feels so hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its just my inability to accept that I got a real Macadamia hair product for such a badass price.</li>
            <li>Nothing else leaves my hair as soft.  </li>
            <li>rinse, my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Aside from the smell, the color is completely off.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft after one use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, just really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>use it as described and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>It Leave it so soft and shiny...</li>
            <li>The result is my hair completely without frizz after it, bring also shiny!&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is far from the truth.</li>
            <li>and this is not a keeper so far for me.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is really heavy at first, but as you continue to use it, the smell gets less potent.</li>
            <li>Although, the bucket I received from my most recent purchase was of a different consistency and color than any of the other buckets I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>However, the first time with this, my hair was still dry.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law told I would need some intensive hair conditioning to get it back near normal.</li>
            <li>I have curly LONG hair that I dye red for fun.</li>
            <li>My hair type: young hair (not gray), but colored; straight, thick, medium brown, gets oily quickly.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair in pretty crappy condition compared to the last one I bought which worked wonders.</li>
            <li>It makes the price worth it because it last a long time!</li>
            <li>My hair is long, but very damaged at the ends because I always choose to keep my length rather than trim inches.</li>
            <li>I would say that it&#x27;s tougher to rinse out than normal conditioner, but not by enough that it matters.</li>
            <li>By the way be careful in the shower as this product is very slipper when you step on it!</li>
            <li>Genuine product if purchased directly from &amp;#34;Amazon.com&amp;#34;  I am unaware of the legitimacy of similar items purchased from other sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair and also  i live in a tropical island and this product change my life and my hair !!</li>
            <li>To this day I am not sure if it just takes a bunch of applications before the results are evident or just need to use large quantities at a time.</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair and after reading all the reviews I thought I was in for a real treat.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged and dry.</li>
            <li>and it really works well to control dry frizzy hair..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that after I rinse the product from my hair that my face, back and the back of my neck will feel really oily.</li>
            <li>THis is my second order, the first tub lasted me about 4 months, I used it once a week and have long hair, up to my tailbone.</li>
            <li>Great scent too and thick for thick</li>
            <li>that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, great hair masque, just too expensive!</li>
            <li>When I use this, my hair is immediately softer and more manageable (i.e. less tangles, less frizz).</li>
            <li>I mean I am fine with the smell</li>
            <li>I never write reviews for the products I buy on amazon, or online in general, but this one I just had to.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much or too often as it can make your hair oily.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend (who barely notices anything) said he felt a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have never used the one that apparently this version is a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and only one use of this product the ends feel so soft</li>
            <li>After several weeks of application, I can see my hair&#x27;s back to a normal condition.</li>
            <li>They both actually smelled kind of cheap, like VO5 or Suave tropical scented crap.</li>
            <li>I recently got an ombre on my hair and because of the bleach the ends of my hair got really damaged and dry.</li>
            <li>I might consider buying a small container of the same product from Ulta where I know it is legit to see if there is a difference, otherwise I feel fine about repurchasing the hair masks I have always used locally in stores.</li>
            <li>, my hair was a HOT mess</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a pink hint like other reviewers have reported and for the most part other then getting flopped over in shipping</li>
            <li>I had VERY damaged hair from a recent perm that didn&#x27;t take to my hair, so I was left with frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li>The deep oil repair masque does exactly what it says and with so little product.</li>
            <li>But the downside of that is that because all the oil is absorbed by hair, it felt VERY heavy and tooooo moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you have a lot of breakage due to your hair strength but be aware there is a difference between no strength hair breakage and dry hair breakage.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s naturally curly, on the coarse side, long,&amp; thinning @</li>
            <li>Super thick deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>If you are skeptical you should try the single pack and when you see the amazing results on your hair you will want to order the largest size possible so you can always have some on hand!</li>
            <li>I have three little boys (2 are babies and one in lots of sports) and no time to drive 20 mins to my salon and buy the real thing from my stylist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive than before , but good product though.</li>

            <li> I would say it smells nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an off-white (kind of peachy) color</li>
            <li> BUT, there was nothing at all spectacular about this product.</li>
            <li> They were both kind of shimmery and offwhite.</li>
            <li> After doing that I noticed a difference &amp; made that a once a month kind of routine.</li>
            <li> It has a nice silky feel that you feel on your hair as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell.  </li>

            <li> know this stuff is kind of pricey</li>
            <li> It works awesome on my hair, I don&#x27;t have to use as much and my hair has changed dramatically since I have started using these.</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition.</li>

            <li> It does not make your hair oily but it gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Love it Love  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I opened it all I could think was &amp;#34;FAKE&amp;#34; the original product has the most incredible smell.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone with damaged or dry hair, SMELLS GREAT, GREAT PRICE!!</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a warm, rich, luxurious kind of scent (like the Macadamia Oil, smells sooo good).</li>
            <li> Quite honestly it&#x27;s the most amazing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product; however, it expired to quickly</li>

            <li> After first wash my hair felt incredibly smooth and shiny, which is great!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and prone to a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> I love it because it perfectly blends with my natural scent!</li>
            <li> My very first order was perl white, smelt great and worked magnificently....</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses a hydrating shampoo as well as this awesome masque treatment for deep conditioning each time I visit the salon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair masque for about three years now and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> It is the best commercial made hair masque I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the results, just not the price tag in the store.</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.</li>

            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.</li>

            <li> first i liked this product a lot!</li>
            <li> I realized this product is NOT for every hair type, like many beauty gurus say out there.</li>
            <li> and I can assure you that the one I had before is 100% authentic.  </li>
            <li> and it does make my hair softer for sure</li>
            <li> I love the scent and of course the way</li>
            <li> I just ordered the larger size jar and I am very happy with the value for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed leaving the product on for 30 minutes for better results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Macadamia Oil Deep Repair for 6 months now and getting it thru Amazon is the best price!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if it is authentic or not.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product for the rest of my life :)</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s very light weight and super easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> This product has a good amount of protein in it and my hair has never needed a lot of protein, my hair normally needs hydration and moisture.</li>

            <li> This is amazing and whether it&#x27;s the real deal</li>

            <li> It makes my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> My hair felt kind of crunchy while this product was in it almost like I had put hair spray in my hair which is a sign of too much protein.</li>

            <li> I was really excited to get this mask.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I knew I fell in love.</li>
            <li> i was so so so excited to purchase this given its about 50% off on amazon compared to the original price..</li>
            <li> This stuff is also great for damaged hair, color-treated hair, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product made it soft and healthy in one use!</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny, soft and looked healthy!</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair nice and soft and is a keeper for me!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products that are good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and has made my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product alone is so, so good and lingers on my hair for two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing my hair, I get a big scoop and massage it into my hair, paying close attention to my roots.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask, and this one was the real deal.</li>

            <li> left hair soft and love the smell great buy</li>
            <li> It has a light, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> if this is the real product i love it 100%</li>
            <li> I would really like Amazon to confirm the Authenticity of this product before I purchase more from them.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair good elasticity,and my hair is really coarse and coily.</li>
            <li> i love how much shine</li>
            <li> I learned, early in my usage, that you must make sure to rinse every bit of it out when it&#x27;s done working because it will leave a film on your hair if it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> No matter how dry, frizzy, and unmanageable your hair may be, it makes your hair SO soft, manageable, smooth and shiny!!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously the BEST product in the world.</li>
            <li> Love this Deep repair Masque, I have tried so many</li>
            <li> I picked up some Suave conditioner for $1.72 a bottle at Wal-Mart to do a quick rinse in between washings.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff, it is a bit pricey but worth every cent whether your hair is straight or curly damaged or healthy</li>
            <li> The hair is smooth and soft after using both products, but I feel like the hair is more shinning and silky after using LOREAL.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> i love this product and will definitely buy more when i run out.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and is like no other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to style my hair After I and it last a long time , my hair feels great and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product and will always use it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and apply it in the shower leaving it in for about 5 minutes, the key is to rinse well and use an excellent product to prevent damage from irons and blow drying.  </li>
            <li> They are the real deal!!</li>
            <li> I have coarse, dry hair and this product has worked great for me!</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair which can be frizzy and dull at times, but this product leaves my hair looking healthy and smells good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money-on the web site</li>
            <li> looks healthy, soft, bouncy, shiny and lustrous.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> but to me its been totally worth it, and I will continue to repurchase it every year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit spendy but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> i like it is worth the money i pay for it  </li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This masque is worth every penny...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Lasts a loonnnng time (about 6-7 months) and worth the price.</li>
            <li> So many other cheaper DCs out there that appear to be better.</li>
            <li> They were not even capable of mastering the texture of the original product.</li>
            <li> how surprised she is that my hair is so nice and healthy even at its long length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care because the price is right</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about shampoo &amp; conditioners and when they say it smells really good, it usually smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing my hair and keep it with a good smelling for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very over processed hair and this left my hair very soft and happy.</li>
            <li> The Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque definitely does a great job on my hair, it leaves it extremely soft, shiny and much more healthier looking.</li>
            <li> After ONE application my dry, brillo bleached hair, it was shiny, soft and smelled great.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and luxurious and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> As long as I use body wash or soap, I&#x27;m able to clean off this oily residue.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty convinced it&#x27;s the right stuff.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth the money when you can go and buy a cheaper one that does the same (or better) job.</li>
            <li> so I recently bought the giant size of every macadamia product that I could find lol...</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick hair, so most &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; conditioners aren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li> Soft and manageable,  easy to control and style.  </li>
            <li> Please note that if you are sensitive to scents it may be too strong for you</li>
            <li> Very very disapointed</li>
            <li> A little bit like how Herbal Essences used to smell (but not as good) before they changed it to the fruity scents they have now.</li>
            <li> I love the entire Macadamial Nut Oil line, and will never use another brand again!</li>
            <li> I ran out and I miss it so much!</li>
            <li> Love deep repair, works</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried this product (not from Amazon), I could tell that it worked on my hair by the time I washed it out.</li>
            <li> Worth the high cost I promise!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this from root to tip</li>
            <li> At first, I purchased a sample from Ulta for $4.00, and after using it, I purchased the jumbo 16.9-oz jar from Amazon.</li>
            <li> But I will definitely keep buying :-)</li>
            <li> Used along with macadamia healing oil.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, results is exceptional!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and it leaves my hair deeply conditioned and moisturized.</li>
            <li> *First use opnion*</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the results I get with Macadamia, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Healthy white girl hair.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> The first time I used already saw the results.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and it made my fried looking hair look like the life</li>
            <li> I need a very deep conditioning treatment that seeps into my hair, rather than sits on top without penetrating.</li>
            <li> I tried this mask for the first time today</li>
            <li> This product is exactly like the salon or beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Love this deep repair Conditioner</li>
            <li> I bought this in January and have maybe one more treatment left.</li>
            <li> Tried many products but this product has no parallel.</li>
            <li> Maybe the second use will be better....</li>
            <li> Had gotten a sample of this through the mail, and totally fell in love with it</li>
            <li> My curly hair really likes it!</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and my hair is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I used it a few years ago when I was bleaching my hair, and loved it.</li>
            <li> The masque makes your hair ridiculously smooth while in it and while it dries, but once it is dry, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will use it and know for sure as it&#x27;s affect on my hair after only a week or two is pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The shipment came very fast, the product is quite large in size, the product is everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use a little of this masque in the shower every day and my hair looks so much healthier--is softer, stronger, and more easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I only use it 1 to at the absolute most 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> in fact, the product purchased from this seller includes at least 6 more chemicals than the authentic version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow</li>
            <li> a pretty light blonde and my natural hair color is light brown.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair from breaking, i went without a relaxer more than ten weeks and my hair was so strong I sustained no major breakage.</li>
            <li> If you use it as a deep conditioner, it works best to apply a generous amount, wrap your hair in a plastic bag, then wrap your head up in a hot towel or to apply heat in some other manner, such as the hair dryers at the salon.  </li>
            <li> first time I ordered the 8.5 ounce and it lasted me for a whole year, this time I got the 16.9 ounce</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is nice &amp; soft after using it and it seems to style much easier; I hold the curling iron in place for lesser time.  </li>
            <li> It has great long lasting fragrance and make hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I only use it once or twice a week (in fact the jar says twice a week is the max), and it&#x27;s easy to tell which days</li>
            <li> and I ordered the large size from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After that I started using it in large quantities per treatment (just to get rid of it) and it started working quite well.</li>
            <li> I always blow dry my hair on the warm setting and after using the masque my hair is soft and manageable (bonus no split ends).</li>
            <li> it makes my hair super soft.. and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall as much anymore..</li>
            <li> Love the price even more, a tub half this size sells at my local CVS for $30.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair feel smoother and sleeker.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> It is 100% real.</li>
            <li> I received this product, I went straight to Ulta (which is where I would have purchased this product if not here) and compared what I received to the product in store.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I had received a free sample for this before and the texture is supposed to be white, and dense, kinda like butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely agree with those statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was rancid or the container was filled with a different product.</li>
            <li> She was hoping that it would be very moisturizing to her hair</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> This and thermal reconditioning (straight perm)</li>
            <li> I get twice as much product for under the price I paid retail in the salon.</li>
            <li> smell yummy &amp; very moisturizing</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Mine was 100% real.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I really makes a difference in the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> Before buying this hair masque, I was using the LOREAL  Absolute Repair Hair Masque.</li>
            <li> It would work wonders on frizzy, very dry,very curly, in need of moisture</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> so i can go purchase a real product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> a Carol&#x27;s Daughter product user &amp; this compliments their line very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> This will be greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> This stuff gives my hair so much life and moisture....</li>
            <li> dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this product after I shower, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li> Now, I use the L&#x27;Oreal hair masque for damaged hair because it works almost as well as the Macadamia and is so much cheaper (</li>
            <li> I really recommend it</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real masque.</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s hair gets.. absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i love a good deep conditioner i hate the liquid kind it does absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> The product is so thick, creamy, and smells so good.</li>
            <li> and really makes my hair soft!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, It makes my hair softer than any other product I use, however I do with that</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t grasp that other people were able to do it.</li>
            <li> Great price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my hair, help me to get rid of my split ends problem, my hair is super soft and shiny now, growing healthy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3/5 stars because I really liked the scent and the product had been lasting me quite a long time considering how I&#x27;ve been using it as my conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is the super high price tag!</li>
            <li> I have ordered before from different amazon sellers and got the real deal, but this time I didn&#x27;t get so lucky.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, a little bit goes a long way and purchasing the bigger jar is definitely the better buy</li>
            <li> Btw, this is not my first purchasing; I considered this brand as my frequent hair treatment</li>
            <li> I will not claim a true miracle and total reversal of all damage</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair and this conditioner makes it look almost normal.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t weigh down the top and to conserve the product.</li>
            <li> it was supposed to be, but then opening it later to use in the shower I saw the pink kind of tint a lot of people were talking about, maybe it was lighting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly</li>
            <li> The more expensive product I have used did add a healthy glow to my hair.</li>
            <li> (you need to use a whole lot more but still don&#x27;t gert the same smooth result; it could be mixed with other ingredients in it)</li>
            <li> When I went to a high end hair salon, they were using it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does come highly recommended by a curly hair YouTube vlogger so I would say give it a try and see how it works on your hair.</li>
            <li> For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried this product, I highly recommend it, JUST BUY IT</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Either way I highly doubt I will ever purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This made my hair look really shiny and after using it multiple times, I find that my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other deep conditioner or hot oil treatment that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a little more slip to make it easier to put on my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioning mask feels thick and heavy when you first put it on, and maybe a little greasy, but it rinses out clean and wonderful.</li>
            <li> But after using this I find that it grew a little more faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li> My hair really hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I used it as a normal conditioner and it didn&#x27;t work any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed something equipped to handle thick, coarse hair to make it smooth and more manageable.</li>
            <li> They smell pretty much the same and looked pretty much the same..</li>
            <li> But I found if you leave it on for a few hours or over night the results are much better</li>
            <li> My hair feels conditioned down to the ends, wonderfully soft, beautifully shiny, and silky feeling without feeling heavy or over conditioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is cream colored with a kind of marbling on it just like the product I get from the salon which is half the size and double the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for amazingly soft hair!</li>
            <li> and ive heard the real macadamia masque are pure white.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love my hair especially after I use this, is always seems so much softer and appears less damaged.</li>
            <li> It is still conditioner and smells similar but completly different (cheap) texture.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Recommend this for someone looking to calm frizziness in normal to oily hair but dry frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> definitely something you should be aware of.</li>
            <li> My hair has been smooth and silky for going on day 10 and with other masques I was doing them 2X per week with nowhere near these results.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair soo soft!</li>
            <li> it does leave my hair soft but does nothing for the frizz!</li>
            <li> I first used this product after I began using violet shampoo to keep my highlights white and not yellow-toned.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a small sample size to give it a try and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, bouncy and shiny (not just shiny from the gray!)</li>
            <li> leaves hair soooo soft!</li>
            <li> I used it with heat for 20 minutes and my hair has never felt this soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I was at Ulta one day and saw this product and opened it up, it looked exactly the same as the product that I received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well, this masque fixed all the damage!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and does not weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> only issue with this product is that it takes a large amount of the mask for my hair to feel &#x27;saturated.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Be back with an update after a little more use.</li>
            <li> every time I use, my hair feels so hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its just my inability to accept that I got a real Macadamia hair product for such a badass price.</li>
            <li> Nothing else leaves my hair as soft.  </li>
            <li> rinse, my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Aside from the smell, the color is completely off.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft after one use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, just really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> use it as described and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> It Leave it so soft and shiny...</li>
            <li> The result is my hair completely without frizz after it, bring also shiny!&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is far from the truth.</li>
            <li> and this is not a keeper so far for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is really heavy at first, but as you continue to use it, the smell gets less potent.</li>
            <li> Although, the bucket I received from my most recent purchase was of a different consistency and color than any of the other buckets I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> However, the first time with this, my hair was still dry.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law told I would need some intensive hair conditioning to get it back near normal.</li>
            <li> I have curly LONG hair that I dye red for fun.</li>
            <li> My hair type: young hair (not gray), but colored; straight, thick, medium brown, gets oily quickly.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair in pretty crappy condition compared to the last one I bought which worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It makes the price worth it because it last a long time!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, but very damaged at the ends because I always choose to keep my length rather than trim inches.</li>
            <li> I would say that it&#x27;s tougher to rinse out than normal conditioner, but not by enough that it matters.</li>
            <li> By the way be careful in the shower as this product is very slipper when you step on it!</li>
            <li> Genuine product if purchased directly from &amp;#34;Amazon.com&amp;#34;  I am unaware of the legitimacy of similar items purchased from other sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and also  i live in a tropical island and this product change my life and my hair !!</li>
            <li> To this day I am not sure if it just takes a bunch of applications before the results are evident or just need to use large quantities at a time.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and after reading all the reviews I thought I was in for a real treat.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> and it really works well to control dry frizzy hair..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that after I rinse the product from my hair that my face, back and the back of my neck will feel really oily.</li>
            <li> THis is my second order, the first tub lasted me about 4 months, I used it once a week and have long hair, up to my tailbone.</li>
            <li> Great scent too and thick for thick</li>
            <li> that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, great hair masque, just too expensive!</li>
            <li> When I use this, my hair is immediately softer and more manageable (i.e. less tangles, less frizz).</li>
            <li> I mean I am fine with the smell</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for the products I buy on amazon, or online in general, but this one I just had to.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much or too often as it can make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend (who barely notices anything) said he felt a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair incredibly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have never used the one that apparently this version is a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and only one use of this product the ends feel so soft</li>
            <li> After several weeks of application, I can see my hair&#x27;s back to a normal condition.</li>
            <li> They both actually smelled kind of cheap, like VO5 or Suave tropical scented crap.</li>
            <li> I recently got an ombre on my hair and because of the bleach the ends of my hair got really damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> I might consider buying a small container of the same product from Ulta where I know it is legit to see if there is a difference, otherwise I feel fine about repurchasing the hair masks I have always used locally in stores.</li>
            <li> , my hair was a HOT mess</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a pink hint like other reviewers have reported and for the most part other then getting flopped over in shipping</li>
            <li> I had VERY damaged hair from a recent perm that didn&#x27;t take to my hair, so I was left with frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The deep oil repair masque does exactly what it says and with so little product.</li>
            <li> But the downside of that is that because all the oil is absorbed by hair, it felt VERY heavy and tooooo moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have a lot of breakage due to your hair strength but be aware there is a difference between no strength hair breakage and dry hair breakage.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s naturally curly, on the coarse side, long,&amp; thinning @</li>
            <li> Super thick deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical you should try the single pack and when you see the amazing results on your hair you will want to order the largest size possible so you can always have some on hand!</li>
            <li> I have three little boys (2 are babies and one in lots of sports) and no time to drive 20 mins to my salon and buy the real thing from my stylist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive than before , but good product though.</li>
            <li> I am natural with very coarse hair, so after braids or any other protective style this is my #1 deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> The other jar (that I bought from a beauty retailer) is smooth, off-white, and not quite so thick.</li>
            <li> It is processed and goes through daily flat ironing or curling irons.  </li>
            <li> and I can see a difference with less breakage, lively, and shiner hair.</li>
            <li> and I already know its fake since the original is suppose to be white not pink.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing or not, but it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li> but I prefer to go as long as possible between perms</li>
            <li> The instruction says you need to wear the Macadamia for 7 mins which is kinda long to me, and The LOREAL only need 2 mins.</li>
            <li> The mask seems to increase the amount of moisture her hair retains after washing however, she has yet to leave her hair down after using the mask so other than noticing how much longer her hair now stays damp after washing</li>
            <li> and when I tell you that I got the EXACT same results I am 100% serious.</li>
            <li> I blow dry then flat iron or curl my hair daily</li>
            <li> Brought it directly from Amazon which typically guarantees satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week as a deep conditioner for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must buy for somehow with dry thirsty hair.</li>
            <li> It is truly help for my long, coarse, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and sometimes it can feel a little rough, but using the deep repair masque my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this masque to people with thick or curly hair like myself, but not for people with thin or fine hair, as it would likely weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> This fake product is a pearly white (the original is a creamy beige)</li>
            <li> As you can see, the product purchased from this seller is slightly peachy in tone, it&#x27;s chunky, it&#x27;s super thick, and is glossy.</li>
            <li> I am on growing my hair out naturally and needed a deep conditioner that would moisturize my hair without the need for additional product aside from a small amount of hair lotion.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a long term thing.</li>
            <li> It also lasts forever because it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long blond highlighted hair that hasnt been cut in a year.</li>
            <li> I really do not feel like this product is doing any extra work for my hair.</li>
            <li> And it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> you have long hair like me, this is a must to keep your lockes in tip-top shape.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this product help with smoothing, frizz and blow drying.</li>
            <li> I see a bit of growth too, and trust me when I say my hair grows SLOW, it really does.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me months and my hair reaches down the middle of my back</li>
            <li> I HAVE DRY LONG CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li> I have long (to my waist), colored hair with dry and damage ends.  </li>
            <li> It has tamed and conditioned her long, dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Very different from the product I had bought from other sellers.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair and it is very long besides.</li>
            <li> After a hair bleaching fiasco, my hair was DRY, DRY,DRY.</li>
            <li> Maybe your hair has to be really dry and damaged to take advantage of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my hair isn&#x27;t dry nor is it oily.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry since I dyed and highlighted it.</li>
            <li> After shower, I towel dry my hair and apply this all over my hair once a week.</li>
            <li> My hair breaks and is dry from a thyroid condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is 75% gray (therefore extremely dry and brittle).</li>
            <li> This does not solve the problem for dry hair if you have dry hair try a conditioner that has hydrating/hydration on the label like herbal essences hello hydration conditioner.</li>
            <li> My dry, curly hair feels like silk when I&#x27;m done with this.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on unruly dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is oily at the scalp and dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> The macadamia oil deep repair masque works very well for my thin, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product direct from the manufacturer and the product i received is fake it smells and looks nothing like the real product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not prepared to spend the money on this stuff every single time for the rest of your life, don&#x27;t even buy it.</li>
            <li> I am multi racial and my hair loose its curl when blown dry or adding color...</li>
            <li> For someone like me -- who already has thick hair, it gives toooooooo much body and makes the texture very rough.</li>
            <li> Now I have the larger size for half the price through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> You can buy a larger size for the same price of a small size.</li>
            <li> Not white like how the counterfeits are described, but a slightly golden/pearly tan color.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Organix Hydrating Macadamia mask and Ifelt the same</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month and my hair is just now getting back to normal, even then it&#x27;s still not great.</li>
            <li> The product smells completely different from a previous one that I had ordered for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on hair products because my hair is dry</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because I have naturally very dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and I&#x60;m in the 60&#x60;s.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY dry and responds well to this product - I use it with every wash.</li>
            <li> I applied once and thats all it took to get my hair from ugly dried out to amazingly soft super shinny hair!</li>
            <li> but this makes my hair feels like silk and trust me with natural hair thats hard to do</li>
            <li> However, the product itself is designed to fluff up hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask religiously for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to research my white, fluffy, textured bucket that arrived this week.</li>
            <li> Now I have no problem combing or even brushing my hair while its wet.</li>
            <li> I got so fed up that I chopped 4 inches off my hair last week because the ends had become so dead from not using this conditioner anymore.</li>
            <li> The smell actually lingers in your hair for a few days, which I tend to appreciate.</li>
            <li> its a white/light pink color</li>
            <li> We have thick curly/wavy African American hair.</li>
            <li> The real stuff is really thick, cream colored and smells a bit nutty, the one I received was thin, the consistency of regular conditioner, was a peach-ish color and had a strong artificial floral scent.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it my hair would be completely wet after I towel dried it, but feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months and got tired of paying the high price (Especially at Ulta, it&#x27;s $30 for the small one)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my hair-- less breakage and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry!</li>
            <li> I use it maybe once a month and usually see the difference 48 hours later.</li>
            <li> I just got my package the other day</li>
            <li> The violet shampoo is extremely drying</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products</li>
            <li> Needless to say I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> my second 2 tubs where brown and had a cocobutter smell, im not sure it even works.</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount</li>
            <li> I have an extreme love/hate relationship.</li>
            <li> The other day I found out this hair masque ranks the No.1 on Amazon</li>
            <li> Before I used it, my hair was limp, dry, and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Mask is not an imitation.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick naturally curly hair that gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> There are other products out there that are cheaper that will give you the same, if not better results!</li>
            <li> The 16.9 size lasted me for 8 months and my hair is a little past the middle section of my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if the seller sells both authentic or counterfeit product but looks like I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I have thick and very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, thick coarse hair that soaks this stuff up.</li>
            <li> and I do feel like it weighed my hair down &amp; made it a bit oilier.</li>
            <li> and it does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> we can&#x27;t say if it would make a difference in her hair holding moisture through out the day if she were to leave her hair down.</li>
            <li> With a hair trim every two months, and with minimal use of heat for styling, my hair is showing lots of improvement!!</li>
            <li> I use this once every other day and it does WONDERS for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and was surprised at how little I needed.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try a few other things to save myself some money.</li>
            <li> Costs about half the price of the moroccan oil version.</li>
            <li> and I had to throw half of it away.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake the consistency is not the same this is a pearly white product used it twice</li>
            <li> I typically use a clarifying shampoo and then put this on my towel-dried damp hair afterwards once a week.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier, softer, less tangly, less frizzy, and just looks SO</li>
            <li> Not sure about other&#x27;s experience saying this is fake, but mine was the real deal.</li>
            <li> (normally my hair is difficult to comb through, but not this</li>
            <li> My hair has been a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product at Ulta before and this isn&#x27;t even close to the real thing, the smell isn&#x27;t the same nor the look or feel, did almost nothing for my hair, so incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is your going to have to clean your shower stall after using the product leaves quite a dangerous slippery residue behind.</li>
            <li> MACADAMIA Bought it at flatiron first and was so expensive compare to Amazon!</li>
            <li> and it is a little shimmery.</li>
            <li> However I do think it is a little bit on the spendy side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Macadamia is a little cheaper than LOREAL</li>
            <li> so I was a little bit worried.</li>
            <li> her hair is so silky and weightless when she uses this vs any other shampoo/conditioner the hair feels very heavy..</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so I only need to wash it 2-3x/week.  </li>
            <li> Everyday I blow-dry and use either a straightening iron or curling iron to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this masque approximately 2 times a week in place of my regular hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is the oily residue it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair for a few minutes after washing (no conditioning</li>
            <li> , i can&#x27;t believe i just wasted my money on this thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without being too heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a few photos for comparison of this product to the one I purchased from a beauty retailer.</li>
            <li> If you do you buy this and the stuff inside is brown and creamy and heavy</li>
            <li> If you happen to use the Macadamia leave in oil treatment stuff as well, you can mix a few pumps of that into this for some added oomph.</li>
            <li> As a result after i dried my hair, by the end of the day it felt so heavy and clumped that it felt</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair which has the tendency to get dried out</li>
            <li> Waste of money, would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> After using this product I would say my hair is healthier than a few people I know that don&#x27;t chemically process their hair.</li>
            <li> And it dried out my hair</li>
            <li> At first my hair was very dry after using this product and that was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I received the 16.9 oz for less than I paid for an 8.5 oz jar of this product from their website!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m korean and this is one of the few things that can tame my hair.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> And this is my first ever bad buy.</li>
            <li> Oddly the product had the opposite affect on my hair leaving it dry, brittle and nearly impossible to get a comb through.</li>
            <li> My hair has gone through a lot over the past few years, lots and lots of dying.</li>
            <li> the deep conditioner came in a pump because it is difficult to use to the tub for everyday use in the shower</li>
            <li> if so ill be VERY disappointed &amp; would LOVE my money back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reveiws</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice in the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of breakage in the past 2 weeks either.</li>
            <li> not sure what happen with this product now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of hype about this product and decided to try a small sachet sample of this that I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so I just use a small amount</li>
            <li> and im not sure i got the &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not really sure how I feel about this product as of yet.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous that it would be a fake product from the reviews stating it was a fake</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really believe Amazon would approve sellers that sell fake products so purchased this and knew it was fake as soon as I opened the tub.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this product from Amazon because of all the people saying THESE PRODUCTS ARE FAKE!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything negative to say about any Amazon purchase, however this one was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!</li>
            <li> I use it at least once to twice a week.</li>
            <li> The product itself is thick and you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to do its job.  </li>
            <li> It has thick texture with pinkish-yellowish color.</li>
            <li> has thick frizzy hair give this a try.</li>
            <li> not sure what happen with this brand !</li>
            <li> From reading the other comments, some persons claim that the product is a fake.</li>
            <li> Checking previous reviews for this seller shows that it is not just me who have been sold fake products.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used it I was expecting a very thick creamy texture, but it wasn&#x27;t overly creamy or thick..</li>
            <li> and now I just wasted money on a fake product.</li>
            <li> My dry, nasty knotted hair is improving finally!!</li>
            <li> We have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this despite the negative reviews saying it was fake.</li>
            <li> the cap was broken</li>
            <li> and she had to have my secret.</li>
            <li> False PRODUCT PLZ DO Not BUY..</li>
            <li> got this product few years ago when the star to sale it and was unbelievable !!!!</li>
            <li> I used to think getting a comb through my wet hair was a sick joke</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> I wish this product was not so expensive.  </li>
            <li> i knew it was fake</li>
            <li> I think this product might be fake, but I haven&#x27;t gone to the store to do a comparison.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews saying its fake, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I came across this product in an expensive salon/spa and tried it out after my hair was damaged from bleaching and dying processes.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews saying this item was fake and a pinkish color instead of off-white and chunky how it&#x27;s suppose to look.</li>
            <li> but im reading all this stuff about how the one sold here on amazon is a fake one.</li>
            <li> I read a couple of reviews of people who bought this thinking it was fake</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin</li>
            <li> Very unhappy the Hair Mask is suppose too be a Very thick paste not creamy</li>
            <li> So disappointing - will be contacting Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> Sad for me :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and angry.</li>
            <li> This is fake!</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I wonder if I received a faulty jar.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the bad reviews for this one.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> To bad amazon is turing in to a risky place to get deals!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hair mask is absolutely wonderful.  I love how it moisturizes my hair.  Before I used it, my hair was limp, dry, and brittle.  Ever since I used this product, my hair is supple, voluminous, and shiny.  I learned, early in my usage, that you must make sure to rinse every bit of it out when it&#x27;s done working because it will leave a film on your hair if it&#x27;s fine.  I wish this product was not so expensive.  I had to use something else because I couldn&#x27;t afford this hair mask but it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> Everyday I blow-dry and use either a straightening iron or curling iron to style my hair. I use this masque approximately 2 times a week in place of my regular hair conditioner.  The Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque definitely does a great job on my hair, it leaves it extremely soft, shiny and much more healthier looking. The only downside to this product is the oily residue it leaves behind. I&#x27;ve noticed that after I rinse the product from my hair that my face, back and the back of my neck will feel really oily. As long as I use body wash or soap, I&#x27;m able to clean off this oily residue. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but definitely something you should be aware of.</li>
            <li> I  bought the trial packet at ULTA and loved it... Now I have the larger size for half the price through Amazon.  The product itself is thick and you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to do its job.  I have long hair and apply it in the shower leaving it in for about 5 minutes, the key is to rinse well and use an excellent product to prevent damage from irons and blow drying.  I always blow dry my hair on the warm setting and after using the masque my hair is soft and manageable (bonus no split ends).</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good not to mention it literally saves your hair! Way cheaper then the salon line Moroccan oil works just as good an in my opinion smells better! I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works wonder for the scalp and hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a normal conditioner and it didn&#x27;t work any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in the shower, I leave this on for about the recommended seven minutes. The time it takes for me to listen to two songs, basically. I would say that it&#x27;s tougher to rinse out than normal conditioner, but not by enough that it matters. The masque makes your hair ridiculously smooth while in it and while it dries, but once it is dry, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference. Maybe it&#x27;s a long term thing.</li>
            <li> 3rd time buying this product!! You can not go wrong!!!! Smells is GREAT!! and really makes my hair soft!!! Will forever buy!!!</li>
            <li> Love this!!! My hair is very fine and prone to a lot of breakage. I use this one a week and leave it for about 5 minutes in. It makes my hair soft, smelling great, and most of all, I have been seeing a lot of improvement. With a hair trim every two months, and with minimal use of heat for styling, my hair is showing lots of improvement!!</li>
            <li> Good hair masque. My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Awesomest hair mask I&#x27;ve ever tried :P Leaves hair shinny and silky...thanks MACADAMIA Bought it at flatiron first and was so expensive compare to Amazon! Love the product and the Amazon price!!</li>
            <li> This hair mask was recommended to me by a friend. It is very good. Costs about half the price of the moroccan oil version.</li>
            <li> AFTER USE IT, YOU CAN FEEL HOW SMOOTH YOUR HAIR IS</li>
            <li> Can I just tell you this is amazing? I have thick and very coarse hair. It keeps out the tangles and it smells amazing. It also lasts forever because it goes a long way. This is a great product! Use only once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, it smells so nice and every time I use, my hair feels so hydrated and soft.  I want to use every day but I am arfaid that my hair get too used to having it so I use once a week or so. When I went to a high end hair salon, they were using it and I was so happy that the pro even think it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> After a hair bleaching fiasco, my hair was DRY, DRY,DRY. It felt like a brillo pad. My sister-in-law told I would need some intensive hair conditioning to get it back near normal.I had wanted to use this Deep Conditioner before I destroyed my hair. SO i decided to buy this and give it a try. After ONE application my dry, brillo bleached hair, it was shiny, soft and smelled great. My hair looked better than it did ever before. I do this once a week and my hair looks great, the color has been preserved, and I am never trying anything else. Ever.</li>
            <li> I know people have been complaining about the \\&quot;fakes\\&quot; but if this is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot;......I don&#x27;t care!  This is amazing and whether it&#x27;s the real deal or it&#x27;s a nock-off, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me because it is wonderful. My hair has been smooth and silky for going on day 10 and with other masques I was doing them 2X per week with nowhere near these results.  I will have to do this one about 2-3 times a month.  Great product and NO complaints. Will definately buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps I that I did (not in the directions but it&#x27;s what I did)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I towel dried my hair for a few minutes after washing (no conditioning and I didn&#x27;t bother combing my hair to apply product)&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply a generous amount of product&lt;br /&gt;3. I slicked it all up in a bun on top of my head and covered it with a disposable shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;4. Left it on for about 2 hours.  It&#x27;s the time it took to do homework with the kids and start dinner :)&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse hair out, easily combed through hair after rinsing my hair out too (normally my hair is difficult to comb through, but not this time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the product...I do!</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is softer and healthier than ever. I love the entire Macadamial Nut Oil line, and will never use another brand again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the girls in YouTube saying how amazing it was... I have to agree! My hair feels so healthy. I love it!</li>
            <li> as soon as i opened the container i knew it was fake, i can&#x27;t believe i just wasted my money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I ran out and I miss it so much! It definitely makes a difference!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reveiws but I think I need to on this one. I went through 2 jars of this hair mask and this is the 3rd jar so I know this product very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% sure that this hair mask I received is not 100% genuine product. It smells and looks the same to me until I tried it on my hair, it feels completely different then the ones that I used to purchased from drugstore.com. (you need to use a whole lot more but still don&#x27;t gert the same smooth result; it could be mixed with other ingredients in it) I purchased it here because if the price is cheaper. You can buy a larger size for the same price of a small size. I learnt my lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAKE !!!!FAKE!!! FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> I loveeee this hair masque. I use it as a daily conditioner, which I try to switch between my conditioners. So I&#x27;d say I use this stuff 3 times a week. I love it. The smell is amazing and is like no other product. It also lasts until the next time I shower.  It really makes my hair feel smoother and sleeker. I have curly, coarse hair, so if you have similar a hair type, DEFINITELY GET THIS PRODUCT. I will be repurchasing it asap! another good thing about this product is that it feels like the jar is never emptying for the amount of times I use it!</li>
            <li> Great product; however, it expired to quickly and I had to throw half of it away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought the one from the store but this one is really good i think.It has great long lasting fragrance and make hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love this Deep repair Masque, I have tried so many and I have lost count, but this product makes my hair feel like nothing else.  I actually leave it in my hair over night and then rinse it out in the morning.  My hair is colored regularly and is almost to my waist in length, this has brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> Seller was grreat and should get FIVE STARS.  However, the product itself is designed to fluff up hair.  For someone like me -- who already has thick hair, it gives toooooooo much body and makes the texture very rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple deep hair masks. But this one is the best ever.  Leaves your hair soft and smelling great ! Wayyy better than that morocan oil hair mask</li>
            <li> Bought this despite the negative reviews saying it was fake. Received it in the mail today and glad to find that this is in fact the original product! Not white like how the counterfeits are described, but a slightly golden/pearly tan color. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner that does everything it claims to do. It has become a staple product that I will always use unless the the formula changes.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair after using it. Didn&#x27;t make it softer or healthy looking. Maybe your hair has to be really dry and damaged to take advantage of this product. I would say it smells nice. A little bit like how Herbal Essences used to smell (but not as good) before they changed it to the fruity scents they have now.</li>
            <li> Love deep repair, works</li>
            <li> WoW.......best product EVER!  Try it it is so amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I have long blond highlighted hair that hasnt been cut in a year. We have a pool, so the chlorine is hell on my hair. This product made it soft and healthy in one use!</li>
            <li> The macadamia oil deep repair masque works very well for my thin, frizzy hair.  It moisturizes without being too heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> This mask definitely heals my hair. I have awful hair, so it&#x27;s best for me to use it 3 times a week. I can actually brush my hair now without it puffing out ^^ And my split ends are noticeably healing. Definitely worth the money-on the web site it is around $60 and on amazon it is only $25 (for 16.9 oz) Definitely try it!</li>
            <li> Definitely not a fake just received it!!! It&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen no results. I got this from YOLO Beauty.  I think this product might be fake, but I haven&#x27;t gone to the store to do a comparison. It came with the barcode covered by a white sticker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this product (not from Amazon), I could tell that it worked on my hair by the time I washed it out. However, the first time with this, my hair was still dry. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a cheap conditioner put into this container and sold for $25+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an off-white (kind of peachy) color and it is a little shimmery.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews saying its fake, but it&#x27;s not. It is 100% real. I&#x27;ve gotten this at ultra before, I ran out and was searching for a cheaper way to get it. And this is it</li>
            <li> This will honestly repair your hair immediatly! It feels so silky soft when rinsing it out and makes your hair feel awesome! Worth the high cost I promise!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed something equipped to handle thick, coarse hair to make it smooth and more manageable. The product smells great, a little bit goes a long way and purchasing the bigger jar is definitely the better buy BUT, there was nothing at all spectacular about this product. I picked up some Suave conditioner for $1.72 a bottle at Wal-Mart to do a quick rinse in between washings. Well, I decided to use that conditioner in place of this and when I tell you that I got the EXACT same results I am 100% serious. As a matter of fact, I&#x27;d say I even preferred the effects of the Suave conditioner over this. Save your money! There are other products out there that are cheaper that will give you the same, if not better results!</li>
            <li> I havent even tried it and I already know its fake since the original is suppose to be white not pink. Very very disapointed</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this product from Amazon because of all the people saying THESE PRODUCTS ARE FAKE!! but the price was so great I gave it a chance. My hair is long, but very damaged at the ends because I always choose to keep my length rather than trim inches. I have split ends and breakage and I have done a lot of coloring/highlighting. My hair is fine and pretty healthy at the root. I had great expectations for this product to help my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this product, I went straight to Ulta (which is where I would have purchased this product if not here) and compared what I received to the product in store. They smell pretty much the same and looked pretty much the same..but there did seem to be something off about the one I received. They both actually smelled kind of cheap, like VO5 or Suave tropical scented crap. I mean I am fine with the smell but I was expecting a warm, rich, luxurious kind of scent (like the Macadamia Oil, smells sooo good). They were both kind of shimmery and offwhite. When I fist opened it I thought it was the white color it was supposed to be, but then opening it later to use in the shower I saw the pink kind of tint a lot of people were talking about, maybe it was lighting. When I used it I was expecting a very thick creamy texture, but it wasn&#x27;t overly creamy or thick..I just can&#x27;t tell whether its legit or not. Maybe its just my inability to accept that I got a real Macadamia hair product for such a badass price. I guess its either real or a very good fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel like it worked magic on my hair, it was just ehh. It did not make my hair \\&quot;like butter\\&quot;. The first time I used this from root to tip and I do feel like it weighed my hair down &amp; made it a bit oilier. The second time, I worked this thoroughly into my ends &amp; used regular conditioner on my roots. I really do not feel like this product is doing any extra work for my hair. I was previously using Organix Hydrating Macadamia mask and Ifelt the same (that it was ehh) until one night I slept with it in my hair. After doing that I noticed a difference &amp; made that a once a month kind of routine. Maybe that is what I need to do with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not repurchase this item here. I might consider buying a small container of the same product from Ulta where I know it is legit to see if there is a difference, otherwise I feel fine about repurchasing the hair masks I have always used locally in stores.</li>
            <li> I am on growing my hair out naturally and needed a deep conditioner that would moisturize my hair without the need for additional product aside from a small amount of hair lotion. I saw a review on the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque and decided to try it in place of my deep conditioner. It has worked wonders. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and my hair isn&#x27;t dry nor is it oily. It feels smooth and light. I don&#x27;t have to put a ton of oil in my hair. It feels great. I&#x27;ll be using this one for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft in the shower.  Downside is that it didn&#x27;t hold up after I finished showering.  Maybe its because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough. I gave it a 3/5 stars because I really liked the scent and the product had been lasting me quite a long time considering how I&#x27;ve been using it as my conditioner.  By the way be careful in the shower as this product is very slipper when you step on it!</li>
            <li> Love it, great product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this, my hair was a HOT mess and i put this on and after the first use my hair felt GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good deep conditioner and it smells nice but it&#x27;s nothing special. I can buy a deep conditioner at the supermarket and it will work just as well. This isn&#x27;t worth the money when you can go and buy a cheaper one that does the same (or better) job.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while. It makes my hair feel silky smooth and takes care of any damage!</li>
            <li> Works amazing and makes my hair feel replenished!</li>
            <li> I have used this once already I purchased a silver heat shower cap and put that on over the product and let it sit for the recommended time. I have very over processed hair and this left my hair very soft and happy. The only negative thing I can say is your going to have to clean your shower stall after using the product leaves quite a dangerous slippery residue behind.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a beauty YouTuber. At first, I purchased a sample from Ulta for $4.00, and after using it, I purchased the jumbo 16.9-oz jar from Amazon. The smell of this product alone is so, so good and lingers on my hair for two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing my hair, I get a big scoop and massage it into my hair, paying close attention to my roots. Then, I&#x27;ll clip my hair into a bun and place a shower cap on my head. At the end of my shower, I&#x27;ll remove everything and wash the product out - the mask stays in my hair for about 7-10 minutes. One thing to be mindful of is that this stuff will make your shower slippery, but it will wash away fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this product is that it takes a large amount of the mask for my hair to feel &#x27;saturated.&#x27; My hair just soaks it all up lol. But I will definitely keep buying :-)</li>
            <li> This is our second purchase of this conditioner. It has a nice silky feel that you feel on your hair as soon as you put it on. I highly recommend this product. We have thick curly/wavy African American hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice in the past 2 weeks and I love it! Leaves my hair super soft and silky. I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of breakage in the past 2 weeks either. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily as my conditioner and I would never use anything else. I have used this for more than 2 years now and my hair is healthy, shiny and extremely strong. I dye it every 6 or so weeks, color and bleach and I never have breakage or damage. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or heavy, it&#x27;s very light weight and super easy to wash out. Love this product and will always buy it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A REVIEW ON THIS ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL,,,CURLSANDBEAUTY BYANDREA,,,THIS IS SOOO GOOD..PS: I HAVE DRY LONG CURLY HAIR</li>
            <li> This is the greatest stuff on earth.  My hair has been so dry since I dyed and highlighted it. I just put this in over night with a shower cap and rinse it out in the morning.  My hair is in significantly better shape.  I do this often. Great scent too and thick for thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could afford to use this every day.  It is absolutely amazing.  The smell is intoxicating and it leaves my hair looking and feeling so healthy!</li>
            <li> Great product i love it. Great smell and leaves hair so nice and soft. I will buy this again it ia a great product.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff, it is a bit pricey but worth every cent whether your hair is straight or curly damaged or healthy it works like a dream. I just leave this in my hair over night or if I&#x27;m home all weekend I leave it in then wash it out before styling or going somewhere. Made my hair soo soft!</li>
            <li> I have loved this stuff for a while now. Does a great job of leaving my hair soft and shiny... also helps with fly-aways. I have converted many people to users as well. You will not find a better price on this than amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells delicious. However I do think it is a little bit on the spendy side. Still I have purchased it twice now so I must like it.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake the consistency is not the same this is a pearly white product used it twice it does leave my hair soft but does nothing for the frizz! Do yourself a favor and but it in the the store so you can make sure it&#x27;s the real product!</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask, and this one was the real deal. I give it 4 stars bc the cap was broken</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, It makes my hair softer than any other product I use, however I do with that the deep conditioner came in a pump because it is difficult to use to the tub for everyday use in the shower</li>
            <li> Same review as the oil treatment.  I don&#x27;t have damaged hair, yet my hair dresser suggested this product for routine maintenance to keep my hair healthy.  I absolutely love this treatment.  My hair is nice &amp; soft after using it and it seems to style much easier; I hold the curling iron in place for lesser time.  Be careful not to use too much or too often as it can make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Brought this hair mask as a recommendation from my hair stylist. Used along with macadamia healing oil.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, results is exceptional!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels/looks healthy, soft, bouncy, shiny and lustrous. I have received many compliments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend 100%.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s the real deal. Brought it directly from Amazon which typically guarantees satisfaction. Mask is not an imitation. It&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was the one who recommended this product to me. I blow dry then flat iron or curl my hair daily plus I have highlights, so my locks are definitely put through their paces. I have coarse, dry hair and this product has worked great for me! I use it maybe once a month and usually see the difference 48 hours later. Bonus is it leaves your hair smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> This made my hair look really shiny and after using it multiple times, I find that my hair is super soft. I see a bit of growth too, and trust me when I say my hair grows SLOW, it really does. But after using this I find that it grew a little more faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li> Like some others said, the product is orangey-pink, watery, and kinda lumpy. Not sure if the seller sells both authentic or counterfeit product but looks like I got a bad batch. I had received a free sample for this before and the texture is supposed to be white, and dense, kinda like butter. RETURNED.</li>
            <li> My hair is chemically treated. After shower, I towel dry my hair and apply this all over my hair once a week. Comb it put a shower cap for 20-30 min. It makes my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for damaged hair. I have curly LONG hair that I dye red for fun. My hair, when using this product, remains silken, smooth and healthy. I only use it 1 to at the absolute most 2 times a week. Make sure to rinse the product very well. I just got my package the other day but i&#x27;ve recently conditioned my hair so i&#x27;m not going to use it for another day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cream colored with a kind of marbling on it just like the product I get from the salon which is half the size and double the price. It has the scent that I remember which is absolutely lovely, but strong. I love it because it perfectly blends with my natural scent! It has the same texture that I recall as well. I was very nervous that it would be a fake product from the reviews stating it was a fake but I&#x27;m pretty convinced it&#x27;s the right stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have a pink hint like other reviewers have reported and for the most part other then getting flopped over in shipping I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it and know for sure as it&#x27;s affect on my hair after only a week or two is pretty fast. I love how this makes my hair feel and everyone always comments on how beautiful my hair is and taking care of it is why! I don&#x27;t splurge on anything else but this and it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have long (to my waist), colored hair with dry and damage ends.  I use this product as a daily conditioner and it works great!  It is not heavy and does not weigh down my fine hair.  It also has a nice smell.  If you use it as a deep conditioner, it works best to apply a generous amount, wrap your hair in a plastic bag, then wrap your head up in a hot towel or to apply heat in some other manner, such as the hair dryers at the salon.  The heat will improve your hair&#x27;s ability to absorb the conditioner and the results will be longer lasting.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must for me. I used it a few years ago when I was bleaching my hair, and loved it. Now that I&#x27;m bleaching again, it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair mask repair I have ever used so far. It works wonders on my hair, help me to get rid of my split ends problem, my hair is super soft and shiny now, growing healthy and heavy. Don&#x27;t miss Macadamia products!! You will never regret. Deserve the 5 stars. Btw, this is not my first purchasing; I considered this brand as my frequent hair treatment but I think I became more greedy so I recently bought the giant size of every macadamia product that I could find lol... Qty of 2 of each item.. Don&#x27;t like to run out of them.</li>
            <li> Within 2 uses of this, my hair felt a lot healthier than it has in years. I recently went blonde and this helps to rebuild and soften my hair. Even my boyfriend (who barely notices anything) said he felt a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I first used this product after I began using violet shampoo to keep my highlights white and not yellow-toned. The violet shampoo is extremely drying so I needed a great conditioner to use afterwards. I bought this in a small sample size to give it a try and immediately fell in love. I use it 2-3 times a week and leave it on for about 5 minutes while in the shower. Unlike lots of conditioners, you don&#x27;t need a ton. I have very thick hair and was surprised at how little I needed. It is better than any other deep conditioner or hot oil treatment that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> You WILL NOT find another repair masque that smells AS GOOD as this brand.  I leave this mask on for about 20 min 2 times a week, and my processed hair is so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about my 4th tub purchased from Amazon and i will continue to repurchase from Amazon.  A 16 oz tub in retail stores(like Ulta or Beauty Supply stores) are $35+, but I can only find a 16 oz for $25-$30 on amazon.  Very happy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I would love to really like this product because it&#x27;s so popular, but I don&#x27;t get the hype. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve it either. I have to finish it though, because of the price. Sad for me :-( So many other cheaper DCs out there that appear to be better.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so I only need to wash it 2-3x/week.  I use this masque almost every time I wash, and my hair loves it.  The scent is lovely and it leaves my hair deeply conditioned and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This macadamia oil masque is amazing my wife and I like to put it on and go lay around the pool and let the sun BAKE it in!!!!!!!! My wifes hair has never looked so good and I just have to give amazon another thumbs up for carrying a great product at the BEST price that I have found!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously the BEST product in the world. It smells absolutely amazing so it&#x27;s not a hassle to leave it on your head for the period of time needed. This stuff leaves my hair so soft and it&#x27;s nice because the longer you leave it on, the softer and better smelling your hair will be without causing any damage.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products and i keep coming back to it! Nothing else leaves my hair as soft.  I have fine thin hair and it does not weigh it down.  BEST PRODUCT EVER!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for repairing your hair</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it, I  keeps my hair looking healthy at all times</li>
            <li> There have been many reviews saying that this product is a fake and I would absolutely agree with those statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a few photos for comparison of this product to the one I purchased from a beauty retailer. As you can see, the product purchased from this seller is slightly peachy in tone, it&#x27;s chunky, it&#x27;s super thick, and is glossy. The other jar (that I bought from a beauty retailer) is smooth, off-white, and not quite so thick. I should also mention that the scents are both different. The one purchased from amazon smells more like baby powder. I did examine the ingredients between the two jars and they are NOT the same- in fact, the product purchased from this seller includes at least 6 more chemicals than the authentic version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed that I bought this-this conditioner has been my favorite for years and now I just wasted money on a fake product.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have used this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;Use it once a week. Leave in for 20 min. rinse, my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really believe Amazon would approve sellers that sell fake products so purchased this and knew it was fake as soon as I opened the tub. The real stuff is really thick, cream colored and smells a bit nutty, the one I received was thin, the consistency of regular conditioner, was a peach-ish color and had a strong artificial floral scent. Definitely not legitimate. So disappointing - will be contacting Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> Product was rancid or the container was filled with a different product. Not good! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask religiously for a few years. I love it. Although, the bucket I received from my most recent purchase was of a different consistency and color than any of the other buckets I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I hope I didn&#x27;t get an imposter bucket. I&#x27;m wondering if the company reformulated.  If you do you buy this and the stuff inside is brown and creamy and heavy - you&#x27;re good! Great product. I&#x27;ll have to research my white, fluffy, textured bucket that arrived this week.</li>
            <li> i have used this for a while, have gone through 2 containers of it. It makes my hair so soft and smells so good! I use it about once a week as a deep conditioner for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to try this product after seeing it reviewed on YouTube. She was hoping that it would be very moisturizing to her hair so she could wear it curly. The mask seems to increase the amount of moisture her hair retains after washing however, she has yet to leave her hair down after using the mask so other than noticing how much longer her hair now stays damp after washing we can&#x27;t say if it would make a difference in her hair holding moisture through out the day if she were to leave her hair down. It does come highly recommended by a curly hair YouTube vlogger so I would say give it a try and see how it works on your hair.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of people do give this product a lot of good comments, I think I should just save my words to give it more compliment. It is great hair treatment, but I think it is not works for all hair types, please do some research before the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and also like how shiny it makes my hair--it really does moisturize well. I typically use a clarifying shampoo and then put this on my towel-dried damp hair afterwards once a week. One of these lasts me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now.  I was excited to receive my order, however the moment I opened it all I could think was &amp;#34;FAKE&amp;#34; the original product has the most incredible smell. THIS ONE WASN&#x27;T EVEN CLOSE!! Aside from the smell, the color is completely off. This fake product is a pearly white (the original is a creamy beige) They were not even capable of mastering the texture of the original product. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I&#x27;ve never had anything negative to say about any Amazon purchase, however this one was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried this product, I highly recommend it, JUST BUY IT SOMEPLACE ELSE OR FIND ANOTHER SELLER!</li>
            <li> It is working perfectly</li>
            <li> Love it Love  Love it!! I love this conditioner!! it smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling amazing as well. I always add coconut oil to it as well. I am natural with very coarse hair, so after braids or any other protective style this is my #1 deep conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! My hair has gone through a lot over the past few years, lots and lots of dying. I&#x27;ve tried several masques and deep conditioning treatments, but never has my hair had this result. My hair really hasn&#x27;t been this soft in years.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! My hair feels like silk. This is my new favorite product and will always use it.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing my hair and keep it with a good smelling for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  It smells great, works great, and is affordable. My hair is softer and less frizzy. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> its an amazing product.. I can&#x27;t live without it haha it makes my hair super soft.. and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall as much anymore.. first time I ordered the 8.5 ounce and it lasted me for a whole year, this time I got the 16.9 ounce so it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m korean and this is one of the few things that can tame my hair. This and thermal reconditioning (straight perm) but I prefer to go as long as possible between perms</li>
            <li> I love this. My hairdresser gave me a sample and I ordered the large size from Amazon. My hair breaks and is dry from a thyroid condition. Use this twice a week and you&#x27;ll have the softest hair. Definitely recommend this over Argon Oil or Macadamia oil</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best masque ever! My hair is 75% gray (therefore extremely dry and brittle). My hair is chemically straightened every 2 months and I flatiron it between straightening appointments. My stylist uses a hydrating shampoo as well as this awesome masque treatment for deep conditioning each time I visit the salon. Between visits I use this masque as well. I will tell you my hair feels like SILK after I leave the treatment on for about ten minutes and rinse. It&#x27;s nothing short of amazing. If you are skeptical you should try the single pack and when you see the amazing results on your hair you will want to order the largest size possible so you can always have some on hand! My hair is soft, bouncy and shiny (not just shiny from the gray!) Needless to say I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair masque for about three years now and have recommended it to many of my friends. It is the best commercial made hair masque I have ever used.I often use products I make myself , but I am also never without this stuff when I need a boost. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this i seen a noticable improvement in the condition of my hair. Definitely a must buy for somehow with dry thirsty hair. you will notice an improvement.</li>
            <li> I came across this product in an expensive salon/spa and tried it out after my hair was damaged from bleaching and dying processes. I fell in love with the results, just not the price tag in the store. Now that I have found it online I get twice as much product for under the price I paid retail in the salon. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for amazingly soft hair!</li>
            <li> The product was discoloured when i recieved it. My very first order was perl white, smelt great and worked magnificently.... my second 2 tubs where brown and had a cocobutter smell, im not sure it even works. Tsk</li>
            <li> This product has a good amount of protein in it and my hair has never needed a lot of protein, my hair normally needs hydration and moisture. Make sure you understand your hair before purchasing products especially products on the expensive side. My hair felt kind of crunchy while this product was in it almost like I had put hair spray in my hair which is a sign of too much protein. I would recommend this product if you have a lot of breakage due to your hair strength but be aware there is a difference between no strength hair breakage and dry hair breakage. This does not solve the problem for dry hair if you have dry hair try a conditioner that has hydrating/hydration on the label like herbal essences hello hydration conditioner.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it; she is happy to use it because it leaves a nice perfume and it is not greasy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. I don&#x27;t wash my hair often, so I only use this stuff once a week. I have a LOT of hair and it is very long besides. I only use this on the lower 1/2 of my hair so I don&#x27;t weigh down the top and to conserve the product. I only have to buy this stuff ONCE A YEAR and it lasts me all year. I get the 16.9 oz. and use that to refill one of the 8 oz. containers I have from years ago. I have never run out before I hit the one year mark.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my hair is so much more manageable since I started using this. I used to think getting a comb through my wet hair was a sick joke and I couldn&#x27;t grasp that other people were able to do it. Now I have no problem combing or even brushing my hair while its wet. Plus, whenever I get my hair trimmed the hair dresser comments on how surprised she is that my hair is so nice and healthy even at its long length.&lt;br /&gt;I know this stuff is kind of pricey but to me its been totally worth it, and I will continue to repurchase it every year. If you happen to use the Macadamia leave in oil treatment stuff as well, you can mix a few pumps of that into this for some added oomph.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be like the ojon conditioner but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s regular conditioner but i leave it in my hair anyway cuz it smells good and then just put my hair up in a clip</li>
            <li> smell yummy &amp; very moisturizing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive than before , but good product though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my hair shiny and smooth. :)</li>
            <li> Love it! You will too. Buy it. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells great but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helping my hair at all. I&#x27;ve had best results using it as a styling product and not a masque.</li>
            <li> I love love love Macadamia Products !!! They are the real deal!! I will not claim a true miracle and total reversal of all damage but I can definitely testify that this product has improved the condition of my hair dramatically.  I &lt;3 Macadamia, oh and it smells GRRRRREAT !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. I have curly hair and sometimes it can feel a little rough, but using the deep repair masque my hair very soft. It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Super thick deep conditioner. Smells really good. Makes my hair very soft. It says to leave it in for 7 minutes and wash out. But I found if you leave it on for a few hours or over night the results are much better</li>
            <li> Fantastic product,  my wife had been using for many years.  It&#x27;s a staple product in her bath cabinet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure mine is genuine. It has thick texture with pinkish-yellowish color. Smells really great too.&lt;br /&gt;I will try as soon as I finish my It&#x27;s a 10 hair mask (which is amazing too) and will update my comment. I purchased mine from amazon (ship and sold by amazon), so make sure you choose amazon as your seller to avoid getting fake products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! The smell is an added bonus! I applied once and thats all it took to get my hair from ugly dried out to amazingly soft super shinny hair! My cousin took just one look at my hair and she had to have my secret. She is now a macadamia oil believer!</li>
            <li> left hair soft and love the smell great buy</li>
            <li> *First use opnion* This stuff is wonderful, it works. I have curly, frizzy-dry hair. This conditioning mask feels thick and heavy when you first put it on, and maybe a little greasy, but it rinses out clean and wonderful. My hair feels conditioned down to the ends, wonderfully soft, beautifully shiny, and silky feeling without feeling heavy or over conditioned. My hair looks great without a curling iron. I like this stuff! Be back with an update after a little more use. This stuff may beat out my \\&quot;more expensive\\&quot; conditioning mask.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this mask. I have dry curly hair and after reading all the reviews I thought I was in for a real treat. Oddly the product had the opposite affect on my hair leaving it dry, brittle and nearly impossible to get a comb through. It zapped my curl leaving me with a frizz helmet on my head. I actually think it caused damage to my hair. It was so bad that I wonder if I received a faulty jar. I tried it twice, with the same results both times, then threw it away.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a masque that you don&#x27;t need to use every day but I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because I have naturally very dry and frizzy hair. I only need a small amount and I have very thick naturally curly hair that gets frizzy. This takes lot of the frizz away and smells good. It is really heavy at first, but as you continue to use it, the smell gets less potent. This has lasted me months and my hair reaches down the middle of my back so I think it&#x27;s a terrific value.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. It works awesome on my hair, I don&#x27;t have to use as much and my hair has changed dramatically since I have started using these.</li>
            <li> my second purchase but I prefer to get tube next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair sily smooth and smells good too.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it. use it once a week to spoil myself. smells amazing and makes your hair feel great! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received the 16.9 oz for less than I paid for an 8.5 oz jar of this product from their website! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I had read reviews saying this item was fake and a pinkish color instead of off-white and chunky how it&#x27;s suppose to look. Mine was 100% real. I compared the products as soon as I received the item in the mail. It has left my hair incredibly soft and manageable. I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner and I have an extreme love/hate relationship. Quite honestly it&#x27;s the most amazing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it, I swear by it, it makes my hair look and feel amazing. BUT! There is a big but to this. If you&#x27;re not prepared to spend the money on this stuff every single time for the rest of your life, don&#x27;t even buy it. I used it for 6 months and got tired of paying the high price (Especially at Ulta, it&#x27;s $30 for the small one) so I decided to try a few other things to save myself some money. Oh. My. Lord. My hair has been a mess. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff but once you stop using it, it starves your hair. It&#x27;s been over a month and my hair is just now getting back to normal, even then it&#x27;s still not great. When I stopped using it my hair would be completely wet after I towel dried it, but feel dry and brittle. I got so fed up that I chopped 4 inches off my hair last week because the ends had become so dead from not using this conditioner anymore. So do I love it? YES, when I&#x27;m using it, but now I know I can never purchase this stuff again because if I do and it gets discontinued I will be royally screwed all over again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so good and it really works. My hair is stronger than before and is growing more than it used to as well. And it lasts for a long time. I use it once or twice a week and still have a lot left in the container. It is great!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown normal hair that I semi-permanent dye every 6 weeks. My hair was already in good shape from using sulfate free products. This is a nice addition. It made my hair really soft after one use. I read a lot of reviews about shampoo &amp; conditioners and when they say it smells really good, it usually smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne. I can actually say this smells delicious! It has a light, fresh smell. Not overpowering. I&#x27;ll continue to use once a week. It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, just really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from Neutrogena&#x27;s deep hair repair mask to this one and it made all the difference! My hair feels silky smooth now, even after applying heat! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ever since my sister introduced me to this product, I am in love! I use this after I shower; leave it in for 8 minutes and then rinse. I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my hair-- less breakage and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry! love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairdresser for over 45 years. This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used. Just buy it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing conditioner. I have very damaged hair and this conditioner makes it look almost normal. I only use it once or twice a week (in fact the jar says twice a week is the max), and it&#x27;s easy to tell which days I use it. I really makes a difference in the way my hair looks and feels.  I&#x27;ve told friends about this product, and they love it, too,  It&#x27;s a bit spendy but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Before buying this hair masque, I was using the LOREAL  Absolute Repair Hair Masque. I love how silky my hair feel like after using the hair Masque so I replaced my hair condition with masque and use it every time I take shower. The other day I found out this hair masque ranks the No.1 on Amazon so I thought I could give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Macadamia is a little cheaper than LOREAL but they both smell great.  The instruction says you need to wear the Macadamia for 7 mins which is kinda long to me, and The LOREAL only need 2 mins. The hair is smooth and soft after using both products, but I feel like the hair is more shinning and silky after using LOREAL.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied with the results I get with Macadamia, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> The shipment came very fast, the product is quite large in size, the product is everything I was looking for. Leaving your hair smooth, silky, and smells GREAT.  My hair is tangle free for 4-5days after using it, I prefer to use it once a week. Its been only a month of using this product and I can see a difference with less breakage, lively, and shiner hair.</li>
            <li> My hair type: young hair (not gray), but colored; straight, thick, medium brown, gets oily quickly. Healthy white girl hair.&lt;br /&gt;At first i liked this product a lot! Smells amazing. After first wash my hair felt incredibly smooth and shiny, which is great! But the downside of that is that because all the oil is absorbed by hair, it felt VERY heavy and tooooo moisturized. As a result after i dried my hair, by the end of the day it felt so heavy and clumped that it felt Dirty!&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it. I realized this product is NOT for every hair type, like many beauty gurus say out there. It would work wonders on frizzy, very dry,very curly, in need of moisture hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal/oily hair, its not for you.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone with damaged or dry hair, SMELLS GREAT, GREAT PRICE!! Considering replacing my regular conditioner with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product at Ulta before and this isn&#x27;t even close to the real thing, the smell isn&#x27;t the same nor the look or feel, did almost nothing for my hair, so incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> not sure what happen with this brand ! got this product few years ago when the star to sale it and was unbelievable !!!! not sure what happen with this product now but the quality is not the same anymore .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of hype about this product and decided to try a small sachet sample of this that I purchased on Amazon. After the first use, I knew I fell in love. It smells amazing and has made my hair super soft! The smell actually lingers in your hair for a few days, which I tend to appreciate. (:</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged and dry. After several weeks of application, I can see my hair&#x27;s back to a normal condition. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for the products I buy on amazon, or online in general, but this one I just had to.  The product smells completely different from a previous one that I had ordered for my girlfriend and I can assure you that the one I had before is 100% authentic.  Checking previous reviews for this seller shows that it is not just me who have been sold fake products.  BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the bad reviews for this one.  I have never used the one that apparently this version is a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; of but I don&#x27;t care because the price is right and it does a great job.  My dry, curly hair feels like silk when I&#x27;m done with this.  It smells amazing and luxurious and lasts a really long time. I use it once a week and my hair is in the best condition its been in years.</li>
            <li> i was so so so excited to purchase this given its about 50% off on amazon compared to the original price..ive used it twice and it does make my hair softer for sure but im reading all this stuff about how the one sold here on amazon is a fake one. if so ill be VERY disappointed &amp; would LOVE my money back so i can go purchase a real product. hasn&#x27;t done anything wrrrong to my hair but its not an incredibly different result. so far i do like it, it smells WONDERFUL! if this is the real product i love it 100% but if its not shame on amazon! its a white/light pink color and ive heard the real macadamia masque are pure white. let me know if you are concerned for the same reason. i will not repurchase from here though, i will buy from an Ulta next time. dont know if i trust this..</li>
            <li> Very different from the product I had bought from other sellers.</li>
            <li> use it as described and my hair is so soft. i love this product and will definitely buy more when i run out. it smells amazing and i definitely think it made my hair softer</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! I have wavy hair which can be frizzy and dull at times, but this product leaves my hair looking healthy and smells good. I use it once a week/two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It is truly help for my long, coarse, dry hair. I have tried many other products that are good but this is one I always have on hand. I love the scent and of course the way it makes my hair smooth and shiny. I dont need to use alot of product but do leave it on for a deep conditioning once a week for about 20 mins, longer if I have the time. I just ordered the larger size jar and I am very happy with the value for the amount of product you get. I also use their macadamia oil on my ends after blow drying. Great products.</li>
            <li> One of the best masks I have ever used. I have very dry hair and I&#x60;m in the 60&#x60;s. Every week I use a moisturizing mask. This is really good. Some pople in my family are using it, and shampoo and conditioning, I will continue purchaing it, in 16,9 Oz because is good price.</li>
            <li> The deep oil repair masque does exactly what it says and with so little product. The product is so thick, creamy, and smells so good. You can hold the jar upside and it will not come out! It&#x27;s that good. I enjoyed leaving the product on for 30 minutes for better results. Once or twice a week is enough and you will see a difference. The 16.9 size lasted me for 8 months and my hair is a little past the middle section of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to all the ladies in my family. That&#x27;s how much I recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! leaves hair soooo soft! I&#x27;m mainly a Carol&#x27;s Daughter product user &amp; this compliments their line very well. Great price, a little goes a long way. My hair&#x27;s naturally curly, on the coarse side, long,&amp; thinning @ 44 yrs. Old &amp; this is great for moisture &amp; bouncy curls for sure! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Macadamia Oil Deep Repair for 6 months now and getting it thru Amazon is the best price! This stuff makes my hair not only feel wonderful but smell wonderful!!! My hair is very thin so I just use a small amount but I DO use it daily. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else... It truly is the best stuff out there! I would tell anybody to try it!</li>
            <li> I loved it. The first time I used already saw the results. My hair was shiny, soft and looked healthy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I used it for the first time and it made my fried looking hair look like the life came back to it.</li>
            <li> i love a good deep conditioner i hate the liquid kind it does absolutely nothing for my hair but this makes my hair feels like silk and trust me with natural hair thats hard to do</li>
            <li> smells awesome &amp; makes my hair feel like it has some life!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything. Works like a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Loooove this mask. My daughter and I both use it.  We have very thick hair. Can get a comb or brush through wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I use this product from Amazon and I love it. I never purchased it elsewhere so I can&#x27;t say if it is authentic or not. From reading the other comments, some persons claim that the product is a fake. I would really like Amazon to confirm the Authenticity of this product before I purchase more from them. This will be greatly appreciated</li>
            <li> This product may be pricey but works great! It smells really good as well. I use it at least once to twice a week.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this masque. It def keeps my hair healthy and strong. However, it doesn&#x27;t help my hair shine so I still have to use oil. The more expensive product I have used did add a healthy glow to my hair. I think it&#x27;s the best one of its price range.</li>
            <li> Love the product, makes your hair so smooth and silky, easy to comb and gives fresh look. Your hair is rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives my hair so much life and moisture....It Leave it so soft and shiny...I really love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> i like it is worth the money i pay for it  helps alot i will try it again i recommented</li>
            <li> I used this deep repair masque just once, and I noticed a difference immediately. I have curly, thick hair, so most &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; conditioners aren&#x27;t effective. I need a very deep conditioning treatment that seeps into my hair, rather than sits on top without penetrating. This conditioner seeped into my strands, and after rinsing it out, my hair was softer. And the scent is great, it&#x27;s very light. I&#x27;m looking forward to my hair&#x27;s improved condition as I use this conditioner repeatedly over the next couple of months. I would recommend this masque to people with thick or curly hair like myself, but not for people with thin or fine hair, as it would likely weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to style my hair After I and it last a long time , my hair feels great and smooth</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel amazing. I have wavy/curly hair which has the tendency to get dried out and it makes my hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing or not, but it did nothing for my hair. Waste of money, would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Amaaaazing product! My dry, nasty knotted hair is improving finally!! I will continue to buy this product for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> I tried this mask for the first time today but I used the sample pack and all I can say that this is amazing! I used it with heat for 20 minutes and my hair has never felt this soft and hydrated! Now I know what all the hype was about.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels after using it! Soft and manageable,  easy to control and style.  And affordable too, great.</li>
            <li> The macadamia oil deep repair masque is protective and strengthens the hair from root to tip. Keeps hair from breaking, i went without a relaxer more than ten weeks and my hair was so strong I sustained no major breakage. I also purchased the shampoo and the oil moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Best hair mask. Use this as my conditioner 1 or two times a week. Changed my hair forever.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair mask that I have ever used. I love the fact that it made with my favorite product argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenerates Damaged Hair Cells With Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure. Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I read a couple of reviews of people who bought this thinking it was fake so I was a little bit worried. I was at Ulta one day and saw this product and opened it up, it looked exactly the same as the product that I received from Amazon. I bleach my hair a pretty light blonde and my natural hair color is light brown. After using this product I would say my hair is healthier than a few people I know that don&#x27;t chemically process their hair. I would definitely buy this product again, especially for the price and amount of product.</li>
            <li> idk, i cant say im too impressed and im not sure i got the &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; masque..&lt;br /&gt;i actually use it now in my pre-poo mix.</li>
            <li> She thinks this is a miracle product!  It has tamed and conditioned her long, dry, curly hair.  She also has a section that is bleached for a strip of color.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this makes my hair.  I use this weekly for best results.  Recommend this for someone looking to calm frizziness in normal to oily hair but dry frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this stuff WORKS. Use it on a weekly basis, and you WILL see a difference in your hair. When I use this, my hair is immediately softer and more manageable (i.e. less tangles, less frizz). And with regular use, I&#x27;ve seen such a difference, even on the days where I didn&#x27;t apply it! My hair is shinier, softer, less tangly, less frizzy, and just looks SO healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair like me, this is a must to keep your lockes in tip-top shape. This stuff is also great for damaged hair, color-treated hair, and dry hair. But honesty, anyone can use this- it&#x27;s SO GOOD YOU GUYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells SO FREAKING GOOD. And the scent lingers in your hair, too. I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly like the salon or beauty supply store. There is no difference. I compared them both and the texture, color, and smell are the same. I have used this for two years and only purchased from the supply store until this paticular one, I wanted to compare it to the one I had based on the reviews of the product not being \\&quot;authentic\\&quot;, it is. I have long curly hair and this product help with smoothing, frizz and blow drying.</li>
            <li> This macadamia nut hair oil is the BEST conditioning product I have EVER used! No matter how dry, frizzy, and unmanageable your hair may be, it makes your hair SO soft, manageable, smooth and shiny!!!! I recommend it for all types of problematic hair!</li>
            <li> My hair always feels and looks amazing after using this. And it smells great. Love it. Also a really good size</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells great and makes my hair feel so much healthier and look it too! THis is my second order, the first tub lasted me about 4 months, I used it once a week and have long hair, up to my tailbone.</li>
            <li> This mask works so well for me. This is my second purchase of this product. My hair is VERY dry and responds well to this product - I use it with every wash.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it for a long time. The result is my hair completely without frizz after it, bring also shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I am always so happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I recomend these mask for your tratments.</li>
            <li> I use this once every other day and it does WONDERS for my hair! Makes the mane manageable. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this deep repair Conditioner</li>
            <li> I have bought this product direct from the manufacturer and the product i received is fake it smells and looks nothing like the real product. And it dried out my hair sure maybe u can refund me my money but u cannot grow back my hair I&#x27;m so disappointed and angry. Worst product ever. And this is my first ever bad buy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works wonders on unruly dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love the price even more, a tub half this size sells at my local CVS for $30. Works magic on my waist length, tangley hair. I bought this in January and have maybe one more treatment left. I use it about once a week or once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> nice product and much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Using this product is the absolute BEST thing I have every done for my hair. I have hair that is oily at the scalp and dry on the ends. It is processed and goes through daily flat ironing or curling irons.  I use a little of this masque in the shower every day and my hair looks so much healthier--is softer, stronger, and more easy to manage.  It leaves no oily residue, just healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this masque while visiting Scottsdale, AZ.  I stopped in a beauty supply store just to seek color for my hair.  I was given a sample of this masque.  I have never turned away since then.  It is over two years now.  Faithfully this masque have put the body back into any loss.  I love it.  I am multi racial and my hair loose its curl when blown dry or adding color...this masque is my hair savior.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> Great price for an amazing product! I have bought this is stores but have never been able to get this size! Also Shipped within the promised time!</li>
            <li> Tried many products but this product has no parallel. Of the best hair products at all.Smoothness and shine and health.I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on hair products because my hair is dry and I constantly blowdry &amp; iron my hair. If I don&#x27;t use this product after I shower, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have much hair. It smells amazing and works!&lt;br /&gt;After I shampoo and condition my hair, I towel-dry my hair and put the masque for 1-2 hours. I then wash my hair with warm water and it feels amazing. I get compliments all the time on how good my hair smells and looks. It does not make your hair oily but it gives it a nice shine. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 years and can&#x27;t get enough of it. Must buy!</li>
            <li> After all the reviews, I purchased the large jar and was expecting great results. That is far from the truth. At first my hair was very dry after using this product and that was very disappointing. After that I started using it in large quantities per treatment (just to get rid of it) and it started working quite well. To this day I am not sure if it just takes a bunch of applications before the results are evident or just need to use large quantities at a time. Either way I highly doubt I will ever purchase this product again. There are so many more to try and this is not a keeper so far for me.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how I feel about this product as of yet.  Maybe the second use will be better....</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle worker!!! I had VERY damaged hair from a recent perm that didn&#x27;t take to my hair, so I was left with frizzy and dry hair. Well, this masque fixed all the damage! It is great! The only thing is the super high price tag! Now, I use the L&#x27;Oreal hair masque for damaged hair because it works almost as well as the Macadamia and is so much cheaper (http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Hair/Hair-Care/Treatments/Advanced-Haircare-Total-Repair-5-Damage-Erasing-Balm-85oz.aspx) Overall, great hair masque, just too expensive!</li>
            <li> I recently got an ombre on my hair and because of the bleach the ends of my hair got really damaged and dry. and only one use of this product the ends feel so soft I really recommend it</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and also  i live in a tropical island and this product change my life and my hair !! Love it</li>
            <li> False PRODUCT PLZ DO Not BUY.. Very unhappy the Hair Mask is suppose too be a Very thick paste not creamy</li>
            <li> This arrived exactly as described in good condition.  I love the scent and how it moisturizers my hair.  Please note that if you are sensitive to scents it may be too strong for you but otherwise smells lovely.  This product keeps my hair nice and soft and is a keeper for me!</li>
            <li> The reviews speak for themselves, people rave about this stuff and it&#x27;s for a reason this stuff is amazing and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and shiny and more managable!! Had gotten a sample of this through the mail, and totally fell in love with it, I love the smell and it makes my hair really shiny!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product to help repair your damaged hair. I use mine regularly, about once every 3-4 weeks. It makes the price worth it because it last a long time! I love my hair especially after I use this, is always seems so much softer and appears less damaged. My curly hair really likes it!</li>
            <li> Genuine product if purchased directly from &amp;#34;Amazon.com&amp;#34;  I am unaware of the legitimacy of similar items purchased from other sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It gave my hair good elasticity,and my hair is really coarse and coily. I just wish it had a little more slip to make it easier to put on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real masque. Compared to the last one I bought this one is entirely different in color, texture and scent. It also left my hair in pretty crappy condition compared to the last one I bought which worked wonders. Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this, best thing I ever used on hair</li>
            <li> Not sure about other&#x27;s experience saying this is fake, but mine was the real deal. I would know the difference because I&#x27;ve paid top dollar for this masque else where. This masque is worth every penny...I have tried it all and NOTHING compares to what this does for my hair!</li>
            <li> Great price, and great product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> All i can say is wife loves it. she was the one looking for this product.. and it really works well to control dry frizzy hair.. her hair is so silky and weightless when she uses this vs any other shampoo/conditioner the hair feels very heavy..&lt;br /&gt;whoever has thick frizzy hair give this a try. i love how much shine my wife&#x27;s hair gets.. absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> As an African-American with chemically processed hair, I have tried a lot of conditioners over the years. This is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used. It makes my hair soft, silky and moisturized. I use it once a week, and once a month I will sit under a dryer for a deep conditioning. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and smells great. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have ordered before from different amazon sellers and got the real deal, but this time I didn&#x27;t get so lucky. This is fake! I didn&#x27;t return it only because I am still using it. I have three little boys (2 are babies and one in lots of sports) and no time to drive 20 mins to my salon and buy the real thing from my stylist. It is still conditioner and smells similar but completly different (cheap) texture. To bad amazon is turing in to a risky place to get deals!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Great item and came intact and speedy! I have purchased this twice already and will again. I have color treated, thick coarse hair that soaks this stuff up. Lasts a loonnnng time (about 6-7 months) and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this like a conditioner every time I wash my hair, which is every two days. It works like a charm and my hair is so smooth and soft. I highly, highly recommend it. x</li>
