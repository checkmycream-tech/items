            <li>This is the best stuff around.  </li>
            <li>the product is great  </li>
            <li>This TP is great.</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste around, but the pricing here is not any better than the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Toothpaste tastes good though.</li>
            <li>But this time I bought it from Amazon, surprisingly this time the product is not up to the mark.</li>
            <li>good price, effective</li>
            <li>My favorite brand!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>perfect amount of bubble distribution and makes your mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So, I decided to try it and was glad I did.</li>
            <li>Ever since I purchased this product many years ago, I have been hooked.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste, you don&#x27;t have to use a ton to get the nice punch you need to clean your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of toothpaste and I bought this during a sale so it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Aquafresh has been my favorite brand ever since I first discovered it many years ago.</li>
            <li>; variety has the same great taste, but it gives my mouth the freshest taste it&#x27;s ever had and also makes my breath smell really fresh.</li>
            <li>But after I was finished brushing, my mouth felt soooo clean.  </li>
            <li>One reason I&#x27;ve used Aquafresh all these years is because of its strong, minty taste that is ever so fresh.</li>
            <li>i must have had spiked cool aid in order to pay this price  </li>
            <li>As I used this stuff more, the tingling foam wasn&#x27;t an issue, and now that I&#x27;ve switched back to my normal toothpaste, I kind of missed it.</li>
            <li>Nothing like fresh breath</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste because you can actually feel it working.</li>
            <li>I had to trash immediately after I had used for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really like all the foaming in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have never had a product that has left my mouth feeling clean longer after brushing than this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using aquafresh for a while, and this was my first time trying their whitening action toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I recommend this particular product</li>
            <li>worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Only toothpaste I use but wish it smelled and tasted a little better....</li>
            <li>The Aquafresh Extreme Clean Whitening Action makes my mouth feel fresh and last a long time; it also helps whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this toothpaste for years, back when it came in a clear box.  </li>
            <li>Until recently I hadn&#x27;t tried the &amp;#34;Extreme Clean&amp;#34; with whitening action Aquafresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive lips (rarely have to use chapstick),</li>

            <li> so not sure what is going on here.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave a bad after taste or make your mouth dry.</li>

            <li> The best toothpaste. My favorite brand!</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy that Aquafresh discontinued adult toothpaste in the pump - I really don&#x27;t like going back to the old toothpaste tube thing.  Toothpaste tastes good though.</li>
            <li> Nothing like fresh breath</li>
            <li> Ive been using this toothpaste for years, back when it came in a clear box.  I love this stuff.  Everyone in my house keeps grabbing my tubes.  So I&#x27;m going to have to stock up.  Aquafresh deserves to do well with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
            <li> the product is great  i must have had spiked cool aid in order to pay this price  walmart--4.98  oh well</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, you don&#x27;t have to use a ton to get the nice punch you need to clean your whole mouth.  This helps conserve the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste around, but the pricing here is not any better than the grocery store.  Might even be a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of toothpaste and I bought this during a sale so it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Aquafresh has been my favorite brand ever since I first discovered it many years ago. Until recently I hadn&#x27;t tried the &amp;#34;Extreme Clean&amp;#34; with whitening action Aquafresh. However, when I found a coupon I realized that this would reduce the cost to about that of one of the regular varieties. So, I decided to try it and was glad I did. One reason I&#x27;ve used Aquafresh all these years is because of its strong, minty taste that is ever so fresh. The &amp;#34;extreme clean&amp;#34; variety has the same great taste, but it gives my mouth the freshest taste it&#x27;s ever had and also makes my breath smell really fresh.</li>
            <li> This TP is great. Doesnt leave a bad after taste or make your mouth dry. perfect amount of bubble distribution and makes your mouth feel super clean. customer for life.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste I use but wish it smelled and tasted a little better....</li>
            <li> Ever since I purchased this product many years ago, I have been hooked. This is my favorite toothpaste because you can actually feel it working. I have never had a product that has left my mouth feeling clean longer after brushing than this toothpaste. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love it! so minty! like bleaching your mouth!</li>
            <li> I was running out of toothpaste and I grabbed a tube of this stuff from my mom&#x27;s house. At first I didn&#x27;t really like all the foaming in my mouth. It tingled a little, like mouth wash. But after I was finished brushing, my mouth felt soooo clean.  As I used this stuff more, the tingling foam wasn&#x27;t an issue, and now that I&#x27;ve switched back to my normal toothpaste, I kind of missed it. Unfortunately it doesnt do anything for tooth sensitivity, which is why I won&#x27;t stick with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Aquafresh since last 2 years. Every time I bought it from Walmart or Target, But this time I bought it from Amazon, surprisingly this time the product is not up to the mark. I had to trash immediately after I had used for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Aquafresh Extreme Clean Whitening Action makes my mouth feel fresh and last a long time; it also helps whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> good price, effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using aquafresh for a while, and this was my first time trying their whitening action toothpaste. It burns my lips whenever I use it. I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive lips (rarely have to use chapstick), so not sure what is going on here. Oh well - back to non-whitening I go.</li>
