    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I would also recommend using baby oil to get the wax off, it works great for that!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li>A great kit for beginner waxers!</li>
            <li>I have used it on arms, legs, and it has been great for that, too.     </li>
            <li>Great pricing.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I have bought the wax separately in a beauty supply store and the wax itself works great.</li>
            <li>This product is a great brand</li>
            <li>A really great kit for hair waxing</li>
            <li>and my underarms look so nice!</li>
            <li>Worked great I loved it</li>
            <li>This is a good starter package for an at home waxing kit.</li>
            <li>Good kit for beginners.</li>
            <li>This was a good waxing kit for a beginner like myself.</li>
            <li>Perfect for quick eyebrow fix.</li>
            <li>When you run out of applicator just buy some cheap popsicle sticks, they work just as good!</li>
            <li>So after 3 uses the lid won&#x27;t screw on, it just kind of sticks there...</li>
            <li>so you didn&#x27;t need the microwave to warm.</li>
            <li>easy to use and effective!</li>
            <li>I was impressed that it got even the tiniest of hairs on my upper lip!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t remove more than 4 hairs at a time.</li>
            <li>and you wont regret it :)</li>
            <li>Although you will need to buy more applicators and cloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works probably for a non beginner.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>that being said, it removes hair just fine and comes with a lot of supplies.</li>

            <li>Overall great product.</li>

            <li>Otherwise I got pretty good results my first time around.</li>
            <li>This stuff is powerful!</li>
            <li>Gigi hard wax is the BEST.</li>
            <li>Gigi in general is a REALLY good brand and is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The wax is really good for upper lip and eyebrows!!!</li>

            <li>Tips: get the wax to the right temperature and have someone (if you can) pull the strip very fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with many cloth strips though, so I&#x27;d order extra.</li>
            <li>The price for the kit seemed to be affordable and I thought that it will be easier for me to do it with strips for the first time.</li>
            <li>But those can be bought separately and are not expensive.</li>

            <li>It was my first time using this product</li>
            <li>Not one of the contents inside could be salvaged; even the strips were covered in a large layer of wax.</li>
            <li>Very sticky.  </li>
            <li>Have used before and works very well</li>
            <li>Gigi honee waxing kit is one of my favorite products and my order arrived on time and as expected!</li>
            <li>i was actually about to give up before i realized that i wasnt pulling the wax in the right direction</li>
            <li>i actually had to stop and come here to review it because its actually a pretty neat product, a bit messy but nothing compared to the strip wax.. love it.</li>
            <li>be sure to screw the lid on extra tight, this product will spill and is a beast to remove.</li>
            <li>It works really well for underarms and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I have followed the directions and followed professional tips reaped from tons of research.</li>

            <li>but I could never seem to do this and keep a clean non-sticky surrounding, and I didn&#x27;t always get all the hair because it was kinda hard to do.</li>

            <li> It will last for a very long time and will save me lots of money !</li>
            <li> You gotta have your hair somewhat long.</li>
            <li> Extremely messy (but after doing it the first time it will most probably NOT be that bad other times to follow).</li>
            <li> we use it on eyebrows and cut down the sticks for multiple uses</li>
            <li> but I would recommend doing it the night before the next day just so your skin can rest and become less irritated.</li>
            <li> Tragic but overall for any other waxing uses ok</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you have tried professional hard waxing without strips, you will hate this wax, because it is so sticky.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully and waxed how I always do</li>
            <li> Not only did the product not work, it was extremely messy.</li>
            <li> Honestly, whoever had a bad experience with this product MUST have been doing it wrong because i HAVE NEVER waxed anything before either professionally or DIY</li>
            <li> Only thing that is a Pain is that it&#x27;s really messy, maybe I&#x27;m just a messy person</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY upset with this product packaging!</li>
            <li> I ended up with half a brow.</li>
            <li> lid was just slightly off the wax product and there is no seal</li>
            <li> so half of the wax spilled&lt;br /&gt;into</li>
            <li> I lost half my product, it ruined some of my</li>
            <li> This kit comes with pre- and post-waxing lotions as well as a cream to take wax off when things get messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just shave everyday or eventually get it laserd off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky messy and a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> and I must say that this product is too messy for me.</li>
            <li> The key to making the wax work is to apply a very THIN layer in the direction of the hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy this product in a package like this again, at least not from this seller.</li>
            <li> This wax sucks</li>
            <li> The only thing don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s impossible to not get wax on the part that screws the lid onto the container.</li>
            <li> Very painful and needless to say I was crying in pain with redness by the end of this torture.</li>
            <li> STINKS.</li>
            <li> , I was wrong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad on the skin</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if I couldn&#x27;t get it off with anything.</li>
            <li> and I am so unbelievably disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>

            <li> My mother, sister, and I have been using this waxing system for over 2 years at home. It works really well for underarms and upper lip. I have used it on arms, legs, and it has been great for that, too.     Tips: get the wax to the right temperature and have someone (if you can) pull the strip very fast. The wax off lotion helps to get any remaining wax.</li>
            <li> Extremely messy (but after doing it the first time it will most probably NOT be that bad other times to follow). The wax is really good for upper lip and eyebrows!!! I was impressed that it got even the tiniest of hairs on my upper lip! It&#x27;s not too bad on the skin but I would recommend doing it the night before the next day just so your skin can rest and become less irritated. Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter package for an at home waxing kit. It doesn&#x27;t come with many cloth strips though, so I&#x27;d order extra.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail and I am so unbelievably disappointed in it. I have used GiGi products before and they have worked. I thought I would try the microwaveable kind since my warmer recently broke. I followed the instructions carefully and waxed how I always do and it only removed about four hairs. Not only did the product not work, it was extremely messy. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great pricing. Good kit for beginners. Used it about 5 different times now. Perfect for quick eyebrow fix. The only thing don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s impossible to not get wax on the part that screws the lid onto the container. So after 3 uses the lid won&#x27;t screw on, it just kind of sticks there...but I guess you&#x27;ll get that anywhere. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t remove more than 4 hairs at a time. I have followed the directions and followed professional tips reaped from tons of research. This does not work. At all.</li>
            <li> Honestly, whoever had a bad experience with this product MUST have been doing it wrong because i HAVE NEVER waxed anything before either professionally or DIY, i tried this product just minutes ago and let me tell you IT WORKS! i was actually about to give up before i realized that i wasnt pulling the wax in the right direction lol but i went at it correctly and my underarms look so nice! i actually had to stop and come here to review it because its actually a pretty neat product, a bit messy but nothing compared to the strip wax.. love it. BUY IT! read and FOLLOW the directions and you wont regret it :)</li>
            <li> I have been receiving professional waxing for many years and decided to try it at home to save some money. The price for the kit seemed to be affordable and I thought that it will be easier for me to do it with strips for the first time. Honestly, if you have tried professional hard waxing without strips, you will hate this wax, because it is so sticky. Even if I can stand the pain, later I noticed that it literally pulled off my skin out of the bikini area so that I wanted to cry while walking for the next two days. After I tried the Brazilian hard wax without strips and I was totally fine.</li>
            <li> Very sticky.  Takes forever to get off your skin even with the wax-off formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing since for about 10 years and iI think this kit is worth the money and works well. Although you will need to buy more applicators and cloth. But those can be bought separately and are not expensive. This kit comes with pre- and post-waxing lotions as well as a cream to take wax off when things get messy. I would prefer to use baby oil though.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY upset with this product packaging! I finally received my Gigi wax kit only to find the container completely opened and everything inside the kid was covered in a considerable amount of wax! Not one of the contents inside could be salvaged; even the strips were covered in a large layer of wax. I have bought the wax separately in a beauty supply store and the wax itself works great. I have never bought the kit and figured I would save a lot of money by buying everything together, I was wrong! I will never buy this product in a package like this again, at least not from this seller.</li>
            <li> This product is a great brand but if you decide to use on your eyebrows becareful I ended up with half a brow. Tragic but overall for any other waxing uses ok</li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful! it definetly will rip hair out by the roots. You gotta have your hair somewhat long. I did my arms and they were pretty long and it took them right out. Only thing that is a Pain is that it&#x27;s really messy, maybe I&#x27;m just a messy person but I could never seem to do this and keep a clean non-sticky surrounding, and I didn&#x27;t always get all the hair because it was kinda hard to do. I&#x27;ve done it like 5 times but I actually don&#x27;t even bother using it anymore I&#x27;d rather just shave everyday or eventually get it laserd off.</li>
            <li> Have used before and works very well</li>
            <li> This is great for brows, pits and upper lip (I haven&#x27;t tried anything else). If you are doing bikini, get the kit specifically for that! I would also recommend using baby oil to get the wax off, it works great for that! When you run out of applicator just buy some cheap popsicle sticks, they work just as good!</li>
            <li> UGH. I used gigi wax and it got everywhere! It wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if I couldn&#x27;t get it off with anything. I tried all the tricks and IT WAS ALL OVER MY SINK. I had to scrub for 30 minutes with baby oil just to get some of the sticky wax off. My mom banned I from being in the house hahah! IT STINKS.</li>
            <li> easy to use and effective!</li>
            <li> It contains everything you need.  It will last for a very long time and will save me lots of money !</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 items on the 16th and I received this one today the 22nd.  Before my item with super saver shipping which was supposed to be here today and is not! Very satisfied!! A great kit for beginner waxers!</li>
            <li> Gigi honee waxing kit is one of my favorite products and my order arrived on time and as expected!</li>
            <li> Worked great I loved it</li>
            <li> A bit messy but the product works really well. It would be easier to have a warmer so you didn&#x27;t need the microwave to warm.</li>
            <li> This was a good waxing kit for a beginner like myself. The only downside is that the wax is very sticky and hard to avoid getting on things because of the consistency. The wax off lotion in the kit takes care of this. Otherwise I got pretty good results my first time around.</li>
            <li> Gigi hard wax is the BEST. This wax sucks and I wasn&#x27;t able to return it even though I only opened it to realize it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered. It&#x27;s sticky messy and a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> I tried it once with short hair and it hurt, and the wax went everywhere. Shame on me for trying to travel with it, because now it&#x27;s all over the back seat of my car... NOT for newbie waxers.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. It is not long gone in the trash, only used it once and it was horrible. I used it for my under arms and it took multiple applications for it to remove all hair and in the end still have some hair left. Very painful and needless to say I was crying in pain with redness by the end of this torture. (And yes, Ive waxed before). Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I read someone had else had this problem and I was hoping it was a one time issue.&lt;br /&gt;The lid was just slightly off the wax product and there is no seal so half of the wax spilled&lt;br /&gt;into the box. Trust me that stuff is STICKY. I lost half my product, it ruined some of my&lt;br /&gt;other products and it seeped on to some of my things at home because it wasn&#x27;t immediately&lt;br /&gt;noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add on how well it worked but why buy a product that arrives nearly gone and becomes&lt;br /&gt;a project you have to salvage?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works probably for a non beginner. It was my first time using this product and I must say that this product is too messy for me. I was getting wax everywhere and I could not pick up anything without the item sticking to me. When I finally put the wax on my skin it did not pull off any hair. The silver lining of this is that the little bottle of wax off does work lol. #sticky</li>
            <li> The key to making the wax work is to apply a very THIN layer in the direction of the hair growth.  If you do that, it works like a  charm!  ^_^  Gigi in general is a REALLY good brand and is definitely worth the price.  :)</li>
            <li> be sure to screw the lid on extra tight, this product will spill and is a beast to remove. that being said, it removes hair just fine and comes with a lot of supplies. we use it on eyebrows and cut down the sticks for multiple uses</li>
            <li> A really great kit for hair waxing</li>
