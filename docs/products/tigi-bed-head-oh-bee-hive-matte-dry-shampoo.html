            <li>Smells amazing, too.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best drying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a nice scent</li>
            <li>it did smell nice, but I can&#x27;t tell you how it works bc</li>
            <li>The smell is not that great either, it&#x27;s just too sweet.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, but has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>;) the product smells so good!</li>
            <li>I like it better than the rockaholic kind I had been using before</li>
            <li>In comparison really liked the L&#x27;Oreal Paris one much better.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really nice, but the shampoo just does okay.</li>
            <li>Great smell and worked really well!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for blondes - and it smells good!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>This product smells okay</li>
            <li>This is one of my all-time favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like cheap cologne or air freshener.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Once I brush it out sufficiently, this effect mostly goes away.</li>
            <li>a total bargain for a awesome product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>No haircut, no shampoo, no mousse or hairspray has ever been able to help that fact.</li>
            <li>And on top of it, my hair is prone to greasiness.</li>
            <li>me say that I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted to LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li>so I love this spray.  </li>
            <li>Kind of cheap and cloying smell.  </li>
            <li>Frankly the cheaper stuff works way better.  </li>
            <li>I love Bed</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay</li>
            <li>I also found just dabbing on baby powder on scalp works better then this does.</li>
            <li>This product works but there are better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff does the job I love it</li>
            <li>It made my hair appear nice and clean because I have to shower and wash it to get the smell out of my face.</li>
            <li>In love with this dry shampoo...the smell is amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells good and would be ideal for someone with thicker, less oily hair that just needs freshening up.</li>
            <li>This seems to be working pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>Still in search of the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong, and honestly I get a bit of a temporary headache whenever I first apply it because the fumes are so strong.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo for the price!  </li>
            <li>Dries you up to have another day of clean appearing hair!</li>
            <li>Pleasant at first, but sickly sweet after a while.  </li>
            <li>so my hair gets greasy really easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Couple of things: the smell could be too strong for some.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s way too strong...</li>
            <li>It works fine, but really don&#x27;t think it smells as nice as most reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s fine, I have a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the MUCH cheaper suave version and it works just as well but smells SOOOO much better!</li>
            <li>It works really well and smells super good.</li>
            <li>but I am happy I finally did.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>It works, but smells cheap.</li>
            <li>And both were significantly cheaper than this.  </li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great not to have to wash your hair every single day after working out.</li>
            <li>The product has a very strong smell - I personally determine it as &amp;#34;smell of cupcakes&amp;#34; - which by itself is OK,</li>
            <li>Cant honestly verify to how it worked out as far as &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It does smell sweet &amp;#34;cupcake like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Smells good- makes your hair white</li>
            <li>smells good, does not leave white residue.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>While this product works great on my fine, limp hair, the smell is overpowering.</li>
            <li>this dry shampoo goes on completely invisible and dose a awesome job and making hair fresh again</li>
            <li>, it gives way more fluffy volume and smells so good</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t buy this product to use as a dry shampoo and it does work good for that.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it when I asked my sister what type of perfume she was wearing!</li>
            <li>I rarely write online reviews, but I really love this product and wanted to share some insight since this stuff has pretty much changed my life.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>The product Smells great and works as pretty much good as any other dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several.</li>
            <li>, I use a little bit of this every morning and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and it looks great!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as soft and healthy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or at least it makes my wife&#x27;s hair smell good :)</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff and smells great.</li>
            <li>Caps come right off on every bottle I&#x27;ve gotten since then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d only recommend this if you really really love the smell of sweet cake on your hair.</li>
            <li>However I have used this product in the past and it smells and works great.</li>
            <li>its also great for when i put just a little too much smoother in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a day, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold up on a third day of non-hair-washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found by far!  </li>
            <li>She loves it and very much needed it.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair look more gray (I&#x27;m actually about 20% gray in places).</li>
            <li>but I think it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>So it really doesn&#x27;t matter how well it works because you can&#x27;t leave it in your hair!</li>
            <li>- way more so than any styling products which only contribute to the limpness and greasiness.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with dry-shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have a colleague who loves product that smell like cupcakes, or other sweet treats :) so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a lot of dusty particles on your hair and smells really good!</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo had a nice smell and really seemed to control the oil on day 3 of having my hair straight.</li>
            <li>but this might be my new favorite - no powerdy residue, and major volume.</li>
            <li>No weird white residue, no horrible smell (it is scented, but it&#x27;s subtle and smells good).  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This my favorite Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much I touch it throughout the day, it can look a little greasy on top where it isn&#x27;t super blond</li>
            <li>Not your mother&#x27;s is a much better dry shampoo and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair look any fresher than before I use it.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t really work all that well.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s an aerosol with powder instead of being wet.</li>
            <li>It worked very well and did not leave any powdery residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>Really tried to like it but smell was too much for me.  </li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Do not spray too much at once; it&#x27;ll start to look like baby powder on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have very whitish gray hair and using baby powder on my scalp blends my scalp into my gray hair</li>
            <li>It worked but I feel like i went through the bottle really fast.</li>
            <li>As others have reported, the smell is unusual.  </li>
            <li>Really works nice to remove oil from second and third day hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different dry shampoos and this one is hands down the best.  </li>
            <li>(its kind of stiff).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for all who are on the go and don&#x27;t have that extra time to do a true wash.</li>
            <li>and this means i dont have to was it as often and strip it down, plus blonds are better unwashed</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get to use this particular one, bc it was damaged, and the seller refunded me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Cornstarch took more of the greasiness out of my hair, but left more powdery residue behind.</li>
            <li>While this one does offer texture and cleaning properties, it does not seem to leave my fine, thin, naturally oily hair looking very clean after using.  </li>
            <li>I used it up very quickly, in maybe a couple weeks or less.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and this is by far my favorite Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li>I like it better than Big Sexy Hairs and that is twice as expensive</li>
            <li>I had the same problem with the first bottle I bought, but I think they may have corrected the problem since then.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted a little bit longer, seems like I only get about 10-15 uses out of it but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>The can did empty extremely quick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to wash my fine, limp hair every day to get the desired fullness.</li>
            <li>I have fine, silky hair that hangs limp when styled.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but feels a little sticky when it&#x27;s first put on.</li>
            <li>The product blends better than any other dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t fade her crazy hair colors.</li>
            <li>Bought for a young girl stuck in bed.</li>
            <li>AND if you&#x27;re sensitive to products like I am, your scalp will itch.</li>
            <li>just... wow.</li>
            <li>I then brushed my hair into style and was so pleasantly surprised to find that my hair actually looked like I had fresh shampooed it</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say how well it works because I don&#x27;t think I ever use enough of it.</li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t mind but it could bother some people who are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>If you spray too much in one place it leaves a white residue in your hair.</li>
            <li>Adds lots of volume and gets rid of so much oil, no white spots either</li>
            <li>I work a lot and don&#x27;t always find time to shower, I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>It works well to create volume, smells good,  and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any obvious residue.  </li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I have tried</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not especially good.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend and even bought an extra bottle for my sister.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a sugary sweet smell like all the other reviewers have described) and once I&#x27;m out of my tiny, unventilated bathroom</li>
            <li>It really works as a dry shampoo and add body at the end of the day for date night hair.</li>
            <li>but I found other product that worked a little better.</li>
            <li>I usually love TIGI products, but this stuff sucks!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair VERY dry and brittle (where I&#x27;ve applied the stuff) to the point that I can&#x27;t really run my hands through it.</li>
            <li>When you first spray it in it&#x27;s very white, but I just wait until it&#x27;s dry and then run a natural bristle brush through it and any splotchy white spots are evened out.</li>
            <li>Just spray as far away from your head as possible unless you want an antiqued look!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo, so my expectations may be too high...</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is my secret weapon for amazing hair on day 3.</li>
            <li>It also works in a different way than classic dry shampoo.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it did smell nice, but I can&#x27;t tell you how it works bc</li>
            <li> The smell is not that great either, it&#x27;s just too sweet.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, but has a VERY strong smell.</li>

            <li> In comparison really liked the L&#x27;Oreal Paris one much better.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really nice, but the shampoo just does okay.</li>
            <li> Great smell and worked really well!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for blondes - and it smells good!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> This product smells okay</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like cheap cologne or air freshener.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Once I brush it out sufficiently, this effect mostly goes away.</li>
            <li> a total bargain for a awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> No haircut, no shampoo, no mousse or hairspray has ever been able to help that fact.</li>
            <li> And on top of it, my hair is prone to greasiness.</li>
            <li> me say that I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li> so I love this spray.  </li>
            <li> Kind of cheap and cloying smell.  </li>
            <li> Frankly the cheaper stuff works way better.  </li>
            <li> I love Bed</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It worked okay</li>
            <li> I also found just dabbing on baby powder on scalp works better then this does.</li>
            <li> This product works but there are better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job I love it</li>
            <li> It made my hair appear nice and clean because I have to shower and wash it to get the smell out of my face.</li>
            <li> In love with this dry shampoo...the smell is amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and would be ideal for someone with thicker, less oily hair that just needs freshening up.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li> Still in search of the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong, and honestly I get a bit of a temporary headache whenever I first apply it because the fumes are so strong.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo for the price!  </li>
            <li> Dries you up to have another day of clean appearing hair!</li>
            <li> Pleasant at first, but sickly sweet after a while.  </li>
            <li> so my hair gets greasy really easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of things: the smell could be too strong for some.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way too strong...</li>
            <li> It works fine, but really don&#x27;t think it smells as nice as most reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s fine, I have a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used the MUCH cheaper suave version and it works just as well but smells SOOOO much better!</li>
            <li> It works really well and smells super good.</li>
            <li> but I am happy I finally did.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> It works, but smells cheap.</li>
            <li> And both were significantly cheaper than this.  </li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great not to have to wash your hair every single day after working out.</li>
            <li> The product has a very strong smell - I personally determine it as &amp;#34;smell of cupcakes&amp;#34; - which by itself is OK,</li>
            <li> Cant honestly verify to how it worked out as far as &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It does smell sweet &amp;#34;cupcake like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells good- makes your hair white</li>
            <li> smells good, does not leave white residue.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> While this product works great on my fine, limp hair, the smell is overpowering.</li>
            <li> this dry shampoo goes on completely invisible and dose a awesome job and making hair fresh again</li>
            <li> , it gives way more fluffy volume and smells so good</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t buy this product to use as a dry shampoo and it does work good for that.</li>
            <li> I first discovered it when I asked my sister what type of perfume she was wearing!</li>
            <li> I rarely write online reviews, but I really love this product and wanted to share some insight since this stuff has pretty much changed my life.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> The product Smells great and works as pretty much good as any other dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several.</li>
            <li> , I use a little bit of this every morning and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and it looks great!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as soft and healthy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or at least it makes my wife&#x27;s hair smell good :)</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff and smells great.</li>
            <li> Caps come right off on every bottle I&#x27;ve gotten since then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d only recommend this if you really really love the smell of sweet cake on your hair.</li>
            <li> However I have used this product in the past and it smells and works great.</li>
            <li> its also great for when i put just a little too much smoother in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a day, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold up on a third day of non-hair-washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found by far!  </li>
            <li> She loves it and very much needed it.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair look more gray (I&#x27;m actually about 20% gray in places).</li>
            <li> but I think it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> So it really doesn&#x27;t matter how well it works because you can&#x27;t leave it in your hair!</li>
            <li> - way more so than any styling products which only contribute to the limpness and greasiness.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with dry-shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a colleague who loves product that smell like cupcakes, or other sweet treats :) so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a lot of dusty particles on your hair and smells really good!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo had a nice smell and really seemed to control the oil on day 3 of having my hair straight.</li>
            <li> but this might be my new favorite - no powerdy residue, and major volume.</li>
            <li> No weird white residue, no horrible smell (it is scented, but it&#x27;s subtle and smells good).  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This my favorite Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much I touch it throughout the day, it can look a little greasy on top where it isn&#x27;t super blond</li>
            <li> Not your mother&#x27;s is a much better dry shampoo and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair look any fresher than before I use it.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t really work all that well.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s an aerosol with powder instead of being wet.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and did not leave any powdery residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> Really tried to like it but smell was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Do not spray too much at once; it&#x27;ll start to look like baby powder on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very whitish gray hair and using baby powder on my scalp blends my scalp into my gray hair</li>
            <li> It worked but I feel like i went through the bottle really fast.</li>
            <li> As others have reported, the smell is unusual.  </li>
            <li> Really works nice to remove oil from second and third day hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different dry shampoos and this one is hands down the best.  </li>
            <li> (its kind of stiff).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for all who are on the go and don&#x27;t have that extra time to do a true wash.</li>
            <li> and this means i dont have to was it as often and strip it down, plus blonds are better unwashed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this particular one, bc it was damaged, and the seller refunded me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cornstarch took more of the greasiness out of my hair, but left more powdery residue behind.</li>
            <li> While this one does offer texture and cleaning properties, it does not seem to leave my fine, thin, naturally oily hair looking very clean after using.  </li>
            <li> I used it up very quickly, in maybe a couple weeks or less.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and this is by far my favorite Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li> I like it better than Big Sexy Hairs and that is twice as expensive</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with the first bottle I bought, but I think they may have corrected the problem since then.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a little bit longer, seems like I only get about 10-15 uses out of it but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> The can did empty extremely quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to wash my fine, limp hair every day to get the desired fullness.</li>
            <li> I have fine, silky hair that hangs limp when styled.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but feels a little sticky when it&#x27;s first put on.</li>
            <li> The product blends better than any other dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t fade her crazy hair colors.</li>
            <li> Bought for a young girl stuck in bed.</li>
            <li> AND if you&#x27;re sensitive to products like I am, your scalp will itch.</li>
            <li> just... wow.</li>
            <li> I then brushed my hair into style and was so pleasantly surprised to find that my hair actually looked like I had fresh shampooed it</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say how well it works because I don&#x27;t think I ever use enough of it.</li>
            <li> which I don&#x27;t mind but it could bother some people who are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> If you spray too much in one place it leaves a white residue in your hair.</li>
            <li> Adds lots of volume and gets rid of so much oil, no white spots either</li>
            <li> I work a lot and don&#x27;t always find time to shower, I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li> It works well to create volume, smells good,  and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any obvious residue.  </li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I have tried</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not especially good.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and even bought an extra bottle for my sister.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a sugary sweet smell like all the other reviewers have described) and once I&#x27;m out of my tiny, unventilated bathroom</li>
            <li> It really works as a dry shampoo and add body at the end of the day for date night hair.</li>
            <li> but I found other product that worked a little better.</li>
            <li> I usually love TIGI products, but this stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair VERY dry and brittle (where I&#x27;ve applied the stuff) to the point that I can&#x27;t really run my hands through it.</li>
            <li> When you first spray it in it&#x27;s very white, but I just wait until it&#x27;s dry and then run a natural bristle brush through it and any splotchy white spots are evened out.</li>
            <li> Just spray as far away from your head as possible unless you want an antiqued look!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo, so my expectations may be too high...</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is my secret weapon for amazing hair on day 3.</li>
            <li> It also works in a different way than classic dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have dirty blond hair with bright blond highlites and I only wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> The scent was actually from her TIGI Bed Head Matte Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand of dry shampoo spray (TIGI Rockaholic) and it works about the same as this one.  </li>
            <li> I actually spray it in my hair as soon as it&#x27;s dry after I wash it, just to preemptively stave off greasy-bangs-syndrome and to get it to hold</li>
            <li> And the dry, brittle effect is only temporary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna look for a different dry shampoo for myself.</li>
            <li> think it would probably be a 5 star if you were using it only for a dry shampoo need.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight residue that doesn&#x27;t let my hair flow naturally</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different brands of dry shampoo based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I use it in a pinch, but not for my regular dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair (curly hair is thirsty)</li>
            <li> So for my purpose this product didn&#x27;t work as well as plain old baby powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried dry shampoo a long time ago and it was no help at all,</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s me go 2-3 days without washing which was NEVER possible with any other brands before this.</li>
            <li> and I never see any white powderiness that I have from other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue some other dry shampoos leave.</li>
            <li> so I like to spritz a dry shampoo on day 2</li>
            <li> It did feel really dry</li>
            <li> I use this as a dry shampoo and a root lifter for when I&#x27;m teasing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried this brand of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> A friend convinced me to try dry shampoo again</li>
            <li> A co-worker has been talking about using dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Got dry shampoo everywhere.</li>
            <li> dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It may look a little gray (on dark hair) when you first spray it, but give it a minute to soak in and then work it through a little bit</li>
            <li> Weighted down my hair and left my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> When I first decided to try dry shampoo I got a lousy brand that I carried with my constantly for re-application.</li>
            <li> I can only use it for a short time then shower (defeats the purpose of dry shampoo ;) because my eyes would water and the rest of the body would itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t seem to dry my roots like I expected.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it can make your hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m putting my hair up for extra volume at the crown and for a little extra stay power, but I&#x27;ve given up using it for when I want my hair down.</li>
            <li> The product is very heavy that can even be confused for a light hair hold spray.</li>
            <li> (so I didn&#x27;t reek of that trademark Johnson &amp; Johnson baby smell), always making a mess and never achieving a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I was using the Treseme dry shampoo but felt it left build up in my hair and made it almost stiff feeling.  </li>
            <li> If I wash it in the morning my bangs are greasy little strings by the end of the day if I don&#x27;t keep them pinned back.</li>
            <li> Disappointed due to having better products for the price such as Bastille.</li>
            <li> It works, but the roots never really livened they way they do when I use other dry shampoo products like Batiste.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell, but it&#x27;s so strong that it makes me and those around me nauseous (</li>
            <li> Another issue I have with this product is the cap which was extremely hard to open.</li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;ve never experienced that with dry shampoo, Im a dark blonde).</li>
            <li> , it does not have that dry shampoo smell they usually have.  </li>
            <li> Please keep in mind I am not sensitive to smells in the least, but this is cloying and...</li>
            <li> but is a little over-powering.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little pricey, but</li>
            <li> Sticky, maybe a little greasy/heavy, so cant wear it just for the scent.  </li>
            <li> I turned my head upside down and sprayed!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get dried out.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it would look like in dark hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t cleanse everyday because it kills my curls</li>
            <li> but I still felt like my hair was flat and dirty on the 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not an overly bad smell, just too much.</li>
            <li> embarrassing.. :/ )</li>
            <li> I am usually allergic to chemical products, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly sensitive to artificial perfumes, so you may not find this effect to be so overpowering if you wear a lot of perfume.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works on oily hair since my daughter doesn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> I was obviously not able to use it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to hid my pink scalp because my hair is too thin.</li>
            <li> is so hard it was making my hair stiff and greasy</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly - I read one reviewer&#x27;s comment that the cap can be hard to get off.</li>
            <li> This is a matte finish but it doesn&#x27;t completely dull shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> have really really thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> This smells awful and leaves really big white chunks in your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, if you want silky, shiny hair, this stuff is probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> I hated having to wash my hair everyday because it&#x27;s so dry at the ends and oily at the root</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t look bald or thin hair.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive when you can also just use baby powder in your hair before you go to bed each night.</li>
            <li> I used to be obsessed with Tigi Rockaholic</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look dirty</li>
            <li> Helped relieve itchy, dirty feeling scalp in hospital stay.</li>
            <li> sorry!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think the smell in itself is bad</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> This product smells okay but is a little over-powering. It really doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair look any fresher than before I use it. I have dirty blond hair with bright blond highlites and I only wash my hair every other day so it doesn&#x27;t get dried out. Depending on how much I touch it throughout the day, it can look a little greasy on top where it isn&#x27;t super blond so I like to spritz a dry shampoo on day 2 so it doesn&#x27;t look dirty but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb any of the oils...I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great smell and worked really well! The can did empty extremely quick and I did my best to conserve the product.</li>
            <li> Bought for a young girl stuck in bed. She loves it and very much needed it. She said it smelled great. Cant honestly verify to how it worked out as far as &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;.  sorry</li>
            <li> Works just as it should and smells great. I wish it lasted a little bit longer, seems like I only get about 10-15 uses out of it but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really works as a dry shampoo and add body at the end of the day for date night hair. I use it all the time. Only drawback is it can make your hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo.  Gives your hair body.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, but has a VERY strong smell. It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell, but it&#x27;s so strong that it makes me and those around me nauseous (embarrassing.. :/ )</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo for the price!  I like it better than Big Sexy Hairs and that is twice as expensive</li>
            <li> Works great. Will buy again when I run out. Only washy hair twice a week. So this helps me to make it in between washes.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite hair products. I&#x27;ve always had to wash my fine, limp hair every day to get the desired fullness. Not since my hairdresser introduced me to this product! It not only allows me to go a day without washing my hair, but it also adds body and assists teasing. Smells amazing, too. I am totally in love with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working pretty good for me.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make your hair look like you just washed it, but it does get it by until then.  I am usually allergic to chemical products, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It&#x27;s nice to have!</li>
            <li> This is just okay. Don&#x27;t understand the hype at all. The smell is not that great either, it&#x27;s just too sweet. Kind of smells like cheap cologne or air freshener. I will not purchase this again!</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Best one I have tried to date!  Great smell, it does not have that dry shampoo smell they usually have.  I actually use this after I&#x27;m done flatironing my hair at the roots for volume, but it also works to rid of oil at the roots for those non-cleansing days.  :)  Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awesome, love the volume, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and nothing could compare.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of things: the smell could be too strong for some. AND if you&#x27;re sensitive to products like I am, your scalp will itch. I can only use it for a short time then shower (defeats the purpose of dry shampoo ;) because my eyes would water and the rest of the body would itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> While this product works great on my fine, limp hair, the smell is overpowering. Please keep in mind I am not sensitive to smells in the least, but this is cloying and... just... wow.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using dry shampoo.  But I have to say I think it works wel and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and this is by far my favorite Dry Shampoo! Highly recommend for blondes - and it smells good!</li>
            <li> The product Smells great and works as pretty much good as any other dry shampoo. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Seriously. Go dunk your head in a vat of perfume. This is the experience you will have when you use this stuff. Horrible. It made my hair appear nice and clean because I have to shower and wash it to get the smell out of my face. (Disclaimer: I am fairly sensitive to artificial perfumes, so you may not find this effect to be so overpowering if you wear a lot of perfume.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, doesn&#x27;t really work all that well. But I&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo, so my expectations may be too high... It also makes my hair look more gray (I&#x27;m actually about 20% gray in places). Once I brush it out sufficiently, this effect mostly goes away. If you use a ton of this stuff, it can make greasy hair passable if you can handle the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried cornstarch after this was unbearable. Cornstarch took more of the greasiness out of my hair, but left more powdery residue behind.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful when you need a shampoo, but don&#x27;t have time to get a good wash in. I turned my head upside down and sprayed! I then brushed my hair into style and was so pleasantly surprised to find that my hair actually looked like I had fresh shampooed it and it smelled wonderful. I would recommend this product for all who are on the go and don&#x27;t have that extra time to do a true wash.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo. I first discovered it when I asked my sister what type of perfume she was wearing! The scent was actually from her TIGI Bed Head Matte Dry Shampoo. The product blends better than any other dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand of dry shampoo spray (TIGI Rockaholic) and it works about the same as this one.  However, I do prefer this scent and my husband prefers the Rockaholic.  FYI, this can be used anywhere you tend to get sweaty or sticky and helps you freshen up during road trips.</li>
            <li> It smells really good! This is the first dry shampoo I have tried so I have nothing to compare it to but I think it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong. I really can&#x27;t say how well it works because I don&#x27;t think I ever use enough of it. Not an overly bad smell, just too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome ! I like it better than the rockaholic kind I had been using before , it gives way more fluffy volume and smells so good</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo had a nice smell and really seemed to control the oil on day 3 of having my hair straight. It did feel really dry but not enough for me to not use it again.</li>
            <li> a total bargain for a awesome product. this dry shampoo goes on completely invisible and dose a awesome job and making hair fresh again, i have supper short bleach blond hair and this means i dont have to was it as often and strip it down, plus blonds are better unwashed ;) the product smells so good! its also great for when i put just a little too much smoother in my hair. &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Smells really good! I love that it&#x27;s an aerosol with powder instead of being wet. Dries you up to have another day of clean appearing hair!</li>
            <li> Smell is great but it didn&#x27;t seem to dry my roots like I expected. I&#x27;m still using 2$ baby powder to soak up the oils and then the bed head for scent.</li>
            <li> Works really good when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I use this as a dry shampoo and a root lifter for when I&#x27;m teasing my hair.  It gives great volume and smells delicious!  I have honey blonde hair and I never see any white powderiness that I have from other dry shampoos.  Did I mention it smells yummy!  I highly recommend and even bought an extra bottle for my sister.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this brand of dry shampoo but I am happy I finally did. It worked very well and did not leave any powdery residue on my hair. Try it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, use it for myself and daughters hair, perfect to freshen up.  It does smell sweet &amp;#34;cupcake like&amp;#34; which I don&#x27;t mind but it could bother some people who are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Work great to give you lots of volume</li>
            <li> The smell is awful! So it really doesn&#x27;t matter how well it works because you can&#x27;t leave it in your hair!</li>
            <li> Really tried to like it but smell was too much for me.  Gave product to a friend and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised. It&#x27;s expensive when you can also just use baby powder in your hair before you go to bed each night. If you spray too much in one place it leaves a white residue in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo. Smells excellent. Do not spray too much at once; it&#x27;ll start to look like baby powder on your hair.</li>
            <li> I rarely write online reviews, but I really love this product and wanted to share some insight since this stuff has pretty much changed my life. I just bought 3 bottles so I won&#x27;t have to be without it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really really thin, limp hair. No haircut, no shampoo, no mousse or hairspray has ever been able to help that fact. And on top of it, my hair is prone to greasiness. If I wash it in the morning my bangs are greasy little strings by the end of the day if I don&#x27;t keep them pinned back. I tried dry shampoo a long time ago and it was no help at all, so I just stuck to my routine of using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby powder (so I didn&#x27;t reek of that trademark Johnson &amp; Johnson baby smell), always making a mess and never achieving a lasting effect. A friend convinced me to try dry shampoo again and I decided to order some TIGI since it seemed like the best bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that I love this stuff. It makes my hair VERY dry and brittle (where I&#x27;ve applied the stuff) to the point that I can&#x27;t really run my hands through it. For me that&#x27;s GREAT! This stuff keeps my hair put and gives it VOLUME!! - way more so than any styling products which only contribute to the limpness and greasiness. I actually spray it in my hair as soon as it&#x27;s dry after I wash it, just to preemptively stave off greasy-bangs-syndrome and to get it to hold it&#x27;s style. I only ever use it on the hair framing my face. It&#x27;s so great not to have to wash your hair every single day after working out. What&#x27;s even better is that it lasts for days! I reapply as needed, but it definitely helps keep my hair from getting progressively greasier each day. And the dry, brittle effect is only temporary. As soon as I wash my hair it&#x27;s as soft and healthy as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you want silky, shiny hair, this stuff is probably not a good idea. I have &amp;#34;dirty blonde&amp;#34; hair and it does lighten it somewhat, but I like that. Not sure what it would look like in dark hair. When you first spray it in it&#x27;s very white, but I just wait until it&#x27;s dry and then run a natural bristle brush through it and any splotchy white spots are evened out. The smell is kind of strong, and honestly I get a bit of a temporary headache whenever I first apply it because the fumes are so strong. But I don&#x27;t think the smell in itself is bad (it&#x27;s a sugary sweet smell like all the other reviewers have described) and once I&#x27;m out of my tiny, unventilated bathroom I don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly - I read one reviewer&#x27;s comment that the cap can be hard to get off. I had the same problem with the first bottle I bought, but I think they may have corrected the problem since then. Caps come right off on every bottle I&#x27;ve gotten since then.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Or at least it makes my wife&#x27;s hair smell good :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all.  Neither the smell or how it made my hair feel.  I was looking for a product that refreshed my hair between shampoos but this was not that product! Weighted down my hair and left my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> Works great. It may look a little gray (on dark hair) when you first spray it, but give it a minute to soak in and then work it through a little bit and you&#x27;re good. I hated having to wash my hair everyday because it&#x27;s so dry at the ends and oily at the root but now I can easily go an extra day or two. Great product.</li>
            <li> In love with this dry shampoo...the smell is amazing!!!!! Definetely what i want my hair to smell like after days of not washing! Works great too.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel dirtier than before using it. The product is very heavy that can even be confused for a light hair hold spray. Disappointed due to having better products for the price such as Bastille.</li>
            <li> Smells good- makes your hair white</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  It works well to create volume, smells good,  and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any obvious residue.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A co-worker has been talking about using dry shampoo. I&#x27;m not supposed to wash my hair every day because it falls and gets oilier faster. When I first decided to try dry shampoo I got a lousy brand that I carried with my constantly for re-application. But upon trying this one, I&#x27;m never going back. Absolutely the best drying shampoo. Adds lots of volume and gets rid of so much oil, no white spots either (although I&#x27;ve never experienced that with dry shampoo, Im a dark blonde). I used it up very quickly, in maybe a couple weeks or less. I wish I could buy it every month but I resorted to using corn starch and baby powder in my hair instead.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter to use between washes in order to make her neon hair colors last longer.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t fade her crazy hair colors. Not sure how it works on oily hair since my daughter doesn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this stuff...but the scent is just way too overpowering - I&#x27;ve been sneezing all morning b/c of it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a nice scent, it&#x27;s way too strong...sorry! 4 stars for the product use; 2 stars for the over-powering scent.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo.  This is a matte finish but it doesn&#x27;t completely dull shiny hair.  Does a great job of getting rid of the greasy/oily look.  I have curly hair...I have long curly hair (curly hair is thirsty) but I have an oily scalp...I can&#x27;t cleanse everyday because it kills my curls so I love this spray.  Saves me time and it saves my hair.</li>
            <li> This exploded when I tried to use it. Got dry shampoo everywhere. it did smell nice, but I can&#x27;t tell you how it works bc I was obviously not able to use it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as reviews said</li>
            <li> It works, but smells cheap.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product.  It works fine, but really don&#x27;t think it smells as nice as most reviewers have said.  Kind of cheap and cloying smell.  And the quality is just o.k.  Frankly the cheaper stuff works way better.  In comparison really liked the L&#x27;Oreal Paris one much better.  Even prefer the Suave Keratin to the TIGI Bed Head.  And both were significantly cheaper than this.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Got this a while ago &amp; use it sometimes when I&#x27;m trying to style my hair. I&#x27;ve had those moments when I overslept my alarm, don&#x27;t have time to shower and spraying this in &amp; poofing up works. Works pretty well, but feels a little sticky when it&#x27;s first put on. Smell is good though!</li>
            <li> Helped relieve itchy, dirty feeling scalp in hospital stay.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several. And it smells good.</li>
            <li> It works, but the roots never really livened they way they do when I use other dry shampoo products like Batiste.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this particular one, bc it was damaged, and the seller refunded me. However I have used this product in the past and it smells and works great. Just spray as far away from your head as possible unless you want an antiqued look!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Wish I would have found it years ago!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is my secret weapon for amazing hair on day 3. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, silky hair that hangs limp when styled.  My hairdresser recommended this product to use to give my roots a weightless lift.  Even though it&#x27;s fine, I have a lot of hair.  This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The product has a very strong smell - I personally determine it as &amp;#34;smell of cupcakes&amp;#34; - which by itself is OK, but on one&#x27;s hair - it&#x27;s not. Another issue I have with this product is the cap which was extremely hard to open. I have a colleague who loves product that smell like cupcakes, or other sweet treats :) so I gave it to her. She told me she threw it away eventually, cause she couldn&#x27;t open it! (She&#x27;s stronger than me) LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, and the cap, it worked well on my hair. I only applied it on the visible parts of my hair, and maybe a layer or two around the visible area, and it looked as if I&#x27;ve washed it the same day. Without the spray I definitely have to wash my hair the night before or in the morning, otherwise it would look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only recommend this if you really really love the smell of sweet cake on your hair. I&#x27;m gonna look for a different dry shampoo for myself.</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head Oh Bee Hive! dry shampoo.  I was using the Treseme dry shampoo but felt it left build up in my hair and made it almost stiff feeling.  I tried several different types, including Pssst, Not Your Mamas, and Batiste.  All were improvements over the Treseme but I still felt like my hair was flat and dirty on the 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh Bee Hive adds volume to my hair and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  I also find the scent pleasant.  It blends in well with my red/blond wavy hair.  And no build up!  I love this stuff.  A bottle lasts me almost a month of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found by far!  I just moved to Florida and the water here is so hard it was making my hair stiff and greasy, I use a little bit of this every morning and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and it looks great!  It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue some other dry shampoos leave.</li>
            <li> I have used the MUCH cheaper suave version and it works just as well but smells SOOOO much better! For the cost, I was expecting much more! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> This my favorite Dry Shampoo. Does not leave a lot of dusty particles on your hair and smells really good!</li>
            <li> It worked okay but I found other product that worked a little better. I also found just dabbing on baby powder on scalp works better then this does. This product works but there are better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy this product to use as a dry shampoo and it does work good for that. I wanted something to hid my pink scalp because my hair is too thin. I have very whitish gray hair and using baby powder on my scalp blends my scalp into my gray hair and I don&#x27;t look bald or thin hair. So for my purpose this product didn&#x27;t work as well as plain old baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would probably be a 5 star if you were using it only for a dry shampoo need. It does give the hair body!</li>
            <li> It worked but I feel like i went through the bottle really fast.</li>
            <li> Not chalky and smells great!</li>
            <li> I work a lot and don&#x27;t always find time to shower, I have naturally oily hair so my hair gets greasy really easily. This stuff does the job I love it and it smells great! Thank you BedHead!!!</li>
            <li> As others have reported, the smell is unusual.  Pleasant at first, but sickly sweet after a while.  The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to dissipate.  It also works in a different way than classic dry shampoo.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo. smells good, does not leave white residue.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice, but the shampoo just does okay. It leaves a slight residue that doesn&#x27;t let my hair flow naturally (its kind of stiff). I use it when I&#x27;m putting my hair up for extra volume at the crown and for a little extra stay power, but I&#x27;ve given up using it for when I want my hair down. Guess I&#x27;ll just have to go back to baby powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is life changing! Let&#x27;s me go 2-3 days without washing which was NEVER possible with any other brands before this. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff and smells great.</li>
            <li> Really works nice to remove oil from second and third day hair. Smells wonderful. I used to be obsessed with Tigi Rockaholic but this might be my new favorite - no powerdy residue, and major volume. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This cleans hair very good even after a workout!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different dry shampoos and this one is hands down the best.  I know it&#x27;s a little pricey, but TOTALLY WORTH IT.  No weird white residue, no horrible smell (it is scented, but it&#x27;s subtle and smells good).  Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> This smells awful and leaves really big white chunks in your hair. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with dry-shampoo. It works really well and smells super good. It&#x27;s great for a day, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold up on a third day of non-hair-washing.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Not bad, but not especially good.  Smells good though.  Sticky, maybe a little greasy/heavy, so cant wear it just for the scent.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  Still in search of the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different brands of dry shampoo based on the reviews.  While this one does offer texture and cleaning properties, it does not seem to leave my fine, thin, naturally oily hair looking very clean after using.  I use it in a pinch, but not for my regular dry shampoo.  Just does not do the trick for my hair.  Smells good and would be ideal for someone with thicker, less oily hair that just needs freshening up.</li>
            <li> I usually love TIGI products, but this stuff sucks! Not your mother&#x27;s is a much better dry shampoo and much cheaper.</li>
