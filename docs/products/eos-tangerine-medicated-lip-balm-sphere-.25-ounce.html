            <li>I love the way this lip balm feels.  </li>
            <li>All of them at ones said you need to try one of the EOS Lip Balms they have so many there has to be one that can help.</li>
            <li>This product itself is ok</li>
            <li>you have to dab the dots off of your lips if your ok with this then this is for you</li>
            <li>and I LOVE them</li>

            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I think you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love EOS lip balms because they go on light, work great to sooth dry lips, and taste great.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t taste or smell that great- more like some kind of medical cream?</li>
            <li>These are so fun, and genius!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my lips smelling and tasting great, and the long lasting moisturizer is a wonderful plus.</li>
            <li>I started with the good old Medicated stuff that has been around for more than 40 years</li>
            <li>I purchased the tangerine, the sweet mint and the strawberry sorbet, thinking I&#x27;d keep the favorite and give the others to a family or friend.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>the lid is screw on/screw off and &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; to secure it when fully closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells great works great its actually orange not yellow.</li>
            <li>When my lip product arrived I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>The entire EOS Sphere line is just terrific, frankly - and I love the strawberry once lips are in better shape!!!</li>
            <li>This medicated kind put me in the mindset of Blistex and Carmex only flavored which is even better.</li>
            <li>The taste is great and I am going to make sure I get a few of the others to keep on hand</li>
            <li>The tangerine is a bit more moisturizing than the two others I&#x27;ve used, though those do moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>I am totally returning this and getting the strawberry sorbet or another good one that btw can somebody suggest to me.</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of people seem not to like this one, per reviews I have read, but it is actually my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>The only thing I will say is that I did find this product for a better price at a few different stores but other than that I really love this!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D</li>
            <li>However, the medication in it really makes delightfully smooth lips.</li>
            <li>so soft and the tube is cute, the tangerine smells like</li>
            <li>I have seen some say that because its a &amp;#34;Medicated&amp;#34; lip balm its not as good as the other.</li>
            <li>Overall, the packaging was cheap and the item itself is cheap.....</li>
            <li>and it makes my lips so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Next to the vanilla EOS, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Okay, for a start this smells gross like chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;EOS lip balms in general are decent sized, and are supposedly more &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; to apply.</li>
            <li>They really do moisturize well.</li>
            <li>This results in it going on much thicker than it should.</li>
            <li>The product is also smooth once applied (not gritty), and lasts on my lips for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was all soft and almost melted...not the right consistency for any sort of application to the lips.</li>
            <li>I suppose maybe in the long run, that might help smooth your lips with an exfoliator-like factor; however, I find it gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My problem is this particular one I bought is softer than normal.</li>
            <li>If you touch it, it feels soft and gooey, as if it were nothing more than super thick body butter.</li>
            <li>non-medicated eos is hard and applies evenly, and I really liked that version.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that I use it more or less than other lip balms, but I do like how smoothly it applies.</li>
            <li>This clearly was NOT the real thing</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true that the ball of balm is not as smooth as the others, once it&#x27;s actually applied, there is no gritty feeling left on your lips.</li>
            <li>I ordered two and the other one was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>or it was very very old.</li>
            <li>and after washing, this will leave you with a cute little container that is good for travel jewelry storage, a pill container, or any other small items!</li>
            <li>The product broke off the first time I used it - kind of like taking a lipstick and turning it so the entire lipstick is exposed, it is going to break if you use it - poor design.</li>
            <li>have a lot of flavors of this lip balm, and this one is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d find a lip balm and/lip gloss that I love as much as Victoria&#x27;s Secret Beauty Rush glosses, but this eos balm may be the winner, as it is made of natural ingredients and still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It works nice and tastes really good, but the smell is horrible</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of EOS lip balms so despite all of the negative reviews about this one, I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It goes on soft (unlike several of the other EOS Lip Balms which are firm/hard when you apply them) and keeps my lips very moisturized.</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say that these are for sale at any drug or grocery store at half the price.</li>
            <li>It arrived wrapped only in a sealed clear bag and NOT in the regular pictured way.</li>

            <li> It arrived wrapped only in a sealed clear bag and NOT in the regular pictured way.</li>
            <li> It means your lips are beyond normal Lip Balm help and you need something a little stronger to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have been using all different type of Lip Balms to help my extremely dry lips.</li>
            <li> have found that though this lip balm is difficult to carry in a front pants pocket, it fits well in a sweatshirt pocket, or is easy to find in my purse.</li>
            <li> but It also has a strange chemical smell a la</li>
            <li> How it&#x27;s possible that you cant send one product to other country with expiration too soon</li>
            <li> my lips were always so dry cracked and chapped before.</li>
            <li> So on Sunday I finally decided to break down and give this a try.</li>
            <li> Shortly after purchasing my first one, I became obsessed and had to have more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest that anyone hesitant about the tangerine at least give it a try; you may be surprised!</li>
            <li> The tangerine is minimal.</li>
            <li> It stays closed</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very slight gritty texture as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of the other DO</li>
            <li> it is not right for me.</li>
            <li> but it was not worth that money.</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the balm has a gritty texture.</li>
            <li> In less than 24 hours my lips have improved to the point that I can touch them and they are not cracking or bleeding anymore.</li>
            <li> I thought the tangerine smell would be nice but because it is medicated lip balm it smells and tastes absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> It smelled very odd, even before you opened it up.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who don&#x27;t like the medicated aspect; however, I find it very subtle and the tangerine scent definitely overpowers it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the absolute worst EOS I have ever</li>
            <li> I bought it when I had an emerging cold sore, and though it kept the cold sore at bay, the smell of the 0.5% phenol is overwhelming to me.  </li>
            <li> I am using this lip balm in 20 degree weather and despite being cold, the texture of this stuff is very soft and gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the eos lip balm collection, but this one was disgusting!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even pick out the tangerine past the smell of phenol.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting it to close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Try to apply it on your lips and you get a very thick, uneven coating.</li>
            <li> It also has a gritty texture which is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I might be addicted to eos</li>
            <li> It really has a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> little tip: Once the lip balm is gone, you can use a nail clippers to cut out the &amp;#34;spokes&amp;#34; in the base of the container-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake one or not</li>
            <li> So, unless I have a cold, this one sits in my makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all the tangerine ones are like this, or if I got part if a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in this product however.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it unless I get a lip brush out, which seems stupid for a medicated lip balm.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The texture of this is terrible.</li>
            <li> It smells like medicine and it tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> and when I did I was disgusted.</li>

            <li> Great happy with my purchases</li>
            <li> These are so fun, and genius!! I purchased the tangerine, the sweet mint and the strawberry sorbet, thinking I&#x27;d keep the favorite and give the others to a family or friend. Well I&#x27;ve changed my mind, I am keeping them all, they are so neat, and different, people ask where I get them. Plus they make your lips feel good and refreshed!! Cannot wait to purchase more, and hope they come out with more flavor&#x27;s. Especially the medicated ones!</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that these are for sale at any drug or grocery store at half the price. I just bought one at Walmart for $2.96 Anyway I don&#x27;t have this flavor, but I have tangerine. The tangerine smells and feels good so I could imagine how this one is. I have been using EOS for over a year now and it makes my lips so soft and smooth. FYI my lips were always so dry cracked and chapped before. This medicated kind put me in the mindset of Blistex and Carmex only flavored which is even better. So for all you nay sayers it is medicated and it&#x27;s intent is to heal not for taste or for smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these lip balms. They really do moisturize well. Came as described, no issues with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I love the eos lip balm collection, but this one was disgusting! It had a melted plastic smell and the texture was gritty and chunky. As soon as I got it, I was immediately repulsed. However, the medication in it really makes delightfully smooth lips.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lip balm feels.  The protection lasts and it has a GREAT tangerine scent. I will definitely  purchase it again  when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using all different type of Lip Balms to help my extremely dry lips. Nothing was working I started with the good old Medicated stuff that has been around for more than 40 years and it wasn&#x27;t working. It was at the point that my lips if a tooth brush touched them they would bleed. While talking with some friend they were coming with some stuff that I was not about to even try. So I decided to talk to the younger crowd. I talked to the girls in my daughters 5th grade class to see what they were using. It was like I had just broke a communication gap. All of them at ones said you need to try one of the EOS Lip Balms they have so many there has to be one that can help. So on Sunday I finally decided to break down and give this a try. In less than 24 hours my lips have improved to the point that I can touch them and they are not cracking or bleeding anymore. I have seen some say that because its a &amp;#34;Medicated&amp;#34; lip balm its not as good as the other. When something says &amp;#34;Medicated&amp;#34; it is listed that way for a reason. It means your lips are beyond normal Lip Balm help and you need something a little stronger to get the job done. The taste is great and I am going to make sure I get a few of the others to keep on hand so I am not dealing with the again.</li>
            <li> The product was in excellent packaging, came on time, and my daughters loved the flavor of the product. I would recommend this buyer to anyone.</li>
            <li> The best of all the EOS flavors with the most &amp;#34;difference made&amp;#34; from its use. Very good medicated product without overly medicated flavor. The entire EOS Sphere line is just terrific, frankly - and I love the strawberry once lips are in better shape!!!</li>
            <li> It arrived wrapped only in a sealed clear bag and NOT in the regular pictured way. It smelled very odd, even before you opened it up. This clearly was NOT the real thing or it was very very old. NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
            <li> Well, it arrived in an undamaged box but the product melted or something. I ordered two and the other one was perfectly fine. I am not going to bother with the hassle of returning this.</li>
            <li> i have used it since two years , in my eyes ,it&#x27;s soso .Maybe it is not right for me.</li>
            <li> This product itself is ok the smells not that great because it&#x27;s a medicated lip balm but it does moisturize your lips but the product has lumps in it you have to dab the dots off of your lips if your ok with this then this is for you</li>
            <li> The lip balm is dome shaped, just as it would appear to be. The product broke off the first time I used it - kind of like taking a lipstick and turning it so the entire lipstick is exposed, it is going to break if you use it - poor design.</li>
            <li> I love EOS lip balms because they go on light, work great to sooth dry lips, and taste great. Although there seem to be a lot if complaints about the taste/smell if the tangerine flavor, I don&#x27;t mind it. My problem is this particular one I bought is softer than normal. Like it didn&#x27;t set up correctly. This results in it going on much thicker than it should. It also has a gritty texture which is unpleasant. I don&#x27;t know if all the tangerine ones are like this, or if I got part if a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip treatment! so soft and the tube is cute, the tangerine smells like&lt;br /&gt;orange mamba candy</li>
            <li> Actually makes my lips drier. Stick with Chapstick</li>
            <li> The texture of this is terrible. I am using this lip balm in 20 degree weather and despite being cold, the texture of this stuff is very soft and gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to apply it on your lips and you get a very thick, uneven coating. If you touch it, it feels soft and gooey, as if it were nothing more than super thick body butter. There&#x27;s a very slight gritty texture as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a hint of tangerine but It also has a strange chemical smell a la carmex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The non-medicated eos is hard and applies evenly, and I really liked that version. Really disappointed in this product however.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of the other DO A lip balms and I LOVE them but when I bought this I almost puked! It smells like medicine and it tastes horrible! I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake one or not but it was not worth that money. I ended up giving it to my friend and then she wiped it on my hand so she could give me a headache. WHATEVER YOU DO DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of people seem not to like this one, per reviews I have read, but it is actually my favorite so far! I&#x27;ve tried the summer fruit, strawberry sorbet, and the tangerine. The tangerine is a bit more moisturizing than the two others I&#x27;ve used, though those do moisturize very well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who don&#x27;t like the medicated aspect; however, I find it very subtle and the tangerine scent definitely overpowers it. It leaves my lips smelling and tasting great, and the long lasting moisturizer is a wonderful plus. Some have complained that the balm has a gritty texture. While it&#x27;s true that the ball of balm is not as smooth as the others, once it&#x27;s actually applied, there is no gritty feeling left on your lips. It goes on smooth. I never thought I&#x27;d find a lip balm and/lip gloss that I love as much as Victoria&#x27;s Secret Beauty Rush glosses, but this eos balm may be the winner, as it is made of natural ingredients and still gets the job done. I would suggest that anyone hesitant about the tangerine at least give it a try; you may be surprised! Can&#x27;t wait to try them all!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  My lips feel healthy.</li>
            <li> excellent, thanks a lot</li>
            <li> The best lip balm on the market,  and now it comes in medicated!</li>
            <li> Oooooo it feels so good on the lips. I might be addicted to eos I have almost every color and I use them all the time. This one is my favorite. It goes on smooth and smells and tastes awesome.  This is an awesome company.</li>
            <li> the picture shows a yellow lip balm but it&#x27;s actually orange and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t taste or smell that great- more like some kind of medical cream? The tangerine is minimal. And it is a bit gritty on application compared to the others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The only lip balm I ever buy.</li>
            <li> I thought the tangerine smell would be nice but because it is medicated lip balm it smells and tastes absolutely horrible.  Don&#x27;t buy this flavor.</li>
            <li> i love EOS products! Smell verry good, feel good on the lips, this one has a bit smell of medication, but it realy have medication on it, so... I liked realy recomended!!</li>
            <li> what can I say this is a great product</li>
            <li> I have EOS in just about every flavor possible.  This is by far the absolute worst EOS I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, its texture is gritty.  I suppose maybe in the long run, that might help smooth your lips with an exfoliator-like factor; however, I find it gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is noxious.  It&#x27;s like a combination of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub, Goo Gone, and shoe varnish, and maybe throw in a dash of mosquito repellant.  It&#x27;s simply nauseating.  It smells medicinal, and like old-lady type product.</li>
            <li> is really good. i recommend it</li>
            <li> Another great Eos product.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!!!!!!!! It is amazing and I would recommend this to anyone who is hesitant to purchase this. I think you will love it. The only thing I will say is that I did find this product for a better price at a few different stores but other than that I really love this!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D</li>
            <li> When my lip product arrived I was so excited. I opened it up and tried it immediately. It was all soft and almost melted...not the right consistency for any sort of application to the lips. I can&#x27;t use it unless I get a lip brush out, which seems stupid for a medicated lip balm. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I discovered EOS lip balms in a beauty store years ago. Shortly after purchasing my first one, I became obsessed and had to have more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EOS lip balms in general are decent sized, and are supposedly more &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; to apply. I haven&#x27;t noticed that I use it more or less than other lip balms, but I do like how smoothly it applies. The product is also smooth once applied (not gritty), and lasts on my lips for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that though this lip balm is difficult to carry in a front pants pocket, it fits well in a sweatshirt pocket, or is easy to find in my purse. It stays closed well- the lid is screw on/screw off and &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; to secure it when fully closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of flavors of this lip balm, and this one is my least favorite.  I bought it when I had an emerging cold sore, and though it kept the cold sore at bay, the smell of the 0.5% phenol is overwhelming to me.  I can&#x27;t even pick out the tangerine past the smell of phenol.  So, unless I have a cold, this one sits in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip: Once the lip balm is gone, you can use a nail clippers to cut out the &amp;#34;spokes&amp;#34; in the base of the container- and after washing, this will leave you with a cute little container that is good for travel jewelry storage, a pill container, or any other small items!</li>
            <li> Next to the vanilla EOS, this is my favorite. It goes on soft (unlike several of the other EOS Lip Balms which are firm/hard when you apply them) and keeps my lips very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Okay, for a start this smells gross like chemicals. There is NO trace of tangerine in here. Also not to my surprise, before i even raised this to my lips, the lip balm fell out of its egg shaped container!!!!!!!!! I am totally returning this and getting the strawberry sorbet or another good one that btw can somebody suggest to me. Overall, the packaging was cheap and the item itself is cheap..... along with its gross smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not vert happy with this product, the expiration date its too soon 2015-11. How it&#x27;s possible that you cant send one product to other country with expiration too soon i cant understand.&lt;br /&gt;And i suppose that i cant finish before that. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works nice and tastes really good, but the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> Smells great works great its actually orange not yellow. But it still does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of EOS lip balms so despite all of the negative reviews about this one, I purchased it. I was so excited to try it and when I did I was disgusted. It really has a terrible smell. Also, did anyone else think it seemed like a cheaper model? I think so. I have a hard time getting it to close.</li>
