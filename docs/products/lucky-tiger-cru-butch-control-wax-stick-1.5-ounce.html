    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best control wax I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Very good brand!</li>
            <li>This is great!</li>
            <li>looking good!</li>
            <li>Works really great, and keeps your hair in place even in the wind.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping my flattop upright.  </li>
            <li>Husband always happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>The price was great too.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of straightening and positioning.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the TIGI stuff</li>
            <li>great product i cant find it on any store shelf seem it would have more sales  </li>
            <li>I bought this to control my moustache, as I used it many years ago for that purpose, and found that it also softened my moustache as well, which the ladies find more kissable!  </li>
            <li>Crew Comb had a screw on cap with more height.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger Wax Stick is the best for men&#x27;s short hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it all the time and is easy to apply&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is better than half as good, so the value purchase is good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>works great for flat tops</li>
            <li>If you use a ton of hair stuff and want more for cheaper - Lucky Tiger is a very decent substitute for the fancier/pricier stuff.</li>
            <li>Little bit stiffer hold than I was hoping for, great for my beard and mustache</li>
            <li>Goes on sticky and thick, but is great after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Always consistent.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my father who is STILL rocking a flat top after 60 years.  </li>
            <li>so I am very please to find that you have this in stock</li>
            <li>With this new package the lid get&#x27;s very sticky with product fast and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li>He loves it and will ONLY use this particular brand.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product in a different package.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly smaller than Crew Comb.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t like this wax for my son&#x27;s hair, he wears a little flip in the front, and this stuff just goes on clumpy, and doesn&#x27;t hold - within an hour</li>

            <li> You need only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to buying, but it was also half the price.</li>
            <li> his hair is limp and greasy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Flakes, too soft, poor formulation!  </li>
            <li> I usually use TIGI BedHead.</li>
            <li> I would buy this if I was in college - and wanted to save money over the stuff I usually buy.</li>
            <li> Flimsy packaging, the wax was a bit to thick for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that bad a price</li>

            <li> Great for keeping my flattop upright.  You need only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crew Comb for years but it&#x27;s no longer available. This is the exact same product in a different package.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly smaller than Crew Comb. I don&#x27;t like the lid which just pushes on and pulls off. Crew Comb had a screw on cap with more height. With this new package the lid get&#x27;s very sticky with product fast and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t like this wax for my son&#x27;s hair, he wears a little flip in the front, and this stuff just goes on clumpy, and doesn&#x27;t hold - within an hour his hair is limp and greasy with this stuff. wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast shipping.  No complaints at all.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Flimsy packaging, the wax was a bit to thick for my hair.  I usually use TIGI BedHead.</li>
            <li> Best control wax I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years.  One tube will last a long time, because just a dab will do.</li>
            <li> Flakes, too soft, poor formulation!  I bought this for my husband who always uses a hair stick. These are his words!</li>
            <li> Goes on sticky and thick, but is great after brushing.  I find I have to put it on gingerly to not have a lot of wax to brush off.  Does a good job of straightening and positioning.</li>
            <li> Husband always happy with this product.  Always consistent.  His moustache .... looking good!</li>
            <li> just as expected I always use this produce and I was having issues finding this at any stores so I am very please to find that you have this in stock</li>

            <li> Did not meet expectations.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the TIGI stuff I&#x27;m used to buying, but it was also half the price. It is better than half as good, so the value purchase is good. I would buy this if I was in college - and wanted to save money over the stuff I usually buy. I probably won&#x27;t get it again, but I don&#x27;t think $12 is that big a deal for a product that lasts me months. If you use a ton of hair stuff and want more for cheaper - Lucky Tiger is a very decent substitute for the fancier/pricier stuff.</li>
            <li> This is great! It is just like the one that the barber uses. The price was great too. It wasn&#x27;t that bad a price</li>
            <li> Little bit stiffer hold than I was hoping for, great for my beard and mustache though</li>
