            <li>Which I&#x27;m pretty happy about seeing how I&#x27;m still waiting on orders I made a week before this one.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very accurate.</li>

            <li>they are too cute.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;ll serve the purpose I bought them for still, however if you want the result shown in the image unless you have very large nails they won&#x27;t look as good as shown as they will appear out of proportion.</li>
            <li>But they R supper cute and easy</li>
            <li>i really like them good size.</li>
            <li>Love it, they are super cute and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so that was cool!</li>
            <li>Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>They also came off easily.</li>
            <li>And not as easy to come off.</li>
            <li>Still the price is decent and the studs seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly to me and I love the way it looks on my nails easy to use as well as easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Worth buying for sure.</li>
            <li>I bought these since I do my own nails every week and these hold up very well.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cheap material instead of gold</li>
            <li>Great for anytime of the year, especially Halloween.</li>
            <li>I know they were cheap but still money is money</li>
            <li>.. loved it would purchase from the seller again in the future :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is perfect in size, not too big not too small and it is has great quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For the price, you get a pretty okay product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I did get these...</li>
            <li>These are fun and apply easily.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t make it a full hour before they were all gone.</li>
            <li>and they turn into silver instead of it being gold but other than that SUPER CUTE! :)</li>
            <li>I better either be getting these studs soon, or I better get my money back, and I will NOT be ordering from this company EVER again.</li>
            <li>True to the desription and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But it was cheap so can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li>use Seche Vite topcoat to secure the studs to my nails and paint over the top with two coats of the same.</li>
            <li>They are perfect the only problem is that it takes to long to long for shipping but for the product is amazing</li>
            <li>but the thing about these is that if you wash or use ur hands alot throughout the day they fade pretty quickly</li>
            <li>She is very much into nail designs and being creative with natural nails.</li>
            <li>It looks about right to me.</li>
            <li>had raised edges that got caught and tore right off.</li>
            <li>The studs are a little bigger than I anticipated however, they are great!</li>
            <li>But the quality is ok so that makes me feel a little better.</li>
            <li>There is a separate resealable bags for each color which I like very much for storage reasons.</li>
            <li>Very small and good fro detailed designs.</li>
            <li>They look cute for a day, but only a day.</li>
            <li>WiLL DEFiNiTELY ORDER MORE...</li>
            <li>AND iT WAS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Definitely would buy more</li>
            <li>they r really pretty.</li>
            <li>Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li>Would look much better smaller.</li>
            <li>Pretty good comes in the variety as stated but it too forever to arive.these are also quite small.</li>
            <li>I can fit barely 4 on my nails at the length displayed.</li>
            <li>Small but perfect for acrylic nails and can be use for other crafting projects also</li>
            <li>I could only fit 3 on my nails (which aren&#x27;t really that short), and they fell off so easily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to count, they were only a few but great for what I paid.</li>
            <li>I can only fit 4 in a row from my cuticle to the end of my nail.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and she really likes them.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
            <li>I really like this studs</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It was not what I expected, however, it is very decorative and eye appealing.</li>
            <li>Makes for super cute manis with little effort!</li>
            <li>Bought these and many other designs for my teenager.</li>
            <li>used clear polish and a dotting tool to pick them up and place them on my nails the first time I used them and that worked out really well.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that I got pretty close to the amount promised.</li>
            <li>they are a nice small size.</li>
            <li>comes with no where near how much it says it does!</li>
            <li>I really like the pieces but wish they would have came a little more orgainzed.</li>
            <li>Instead I got half that many.</li>
            <li>I even started to use super glue after I had to apply them for a third time, and they STILL fell off.</li>
            <li>However note that they are larger than the image so no way you can use as many as they show it would cover your entire nail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you have longer nails</li>
            <li>They would be better if they were curved because personally my nails aren&#x27;t flat.</li>
            <li>I ordered these studs about a month ago, they did take a little more than the time said to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it s because I was expecting them to look like real goldish and out of this world, but they are not bad though and on top of sending you the gold one only they sent you some white ones too, so can actually match them up and create different style.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get 270 pieces, they were mostly silver studs, not half gold, half silver.</li>
            <li>Yes, they arrived very early, but I wish they would&#x27;ve given me the 270 I ordered, but at this price, I&#x27;ll settle.</li>
            <li>Tiny but exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li>My nails are pretty long and decently sized too.</li>
            <li>was another pile of pretty much the same amount so there is definitely about 270 in there.</li>
            <li>I love these they are a little smaller than I thought they looked in the picture</li>
            <li>The studs look so much smaller in the picture than they really are.</li>
            <li>they are bigger than what is shown in the picture, only three studs can fit on my nails (short and natural)</li>
            <li>I even started counting them to see how many there are since a lot of people complained and said there can&#x27;t be 270 in the package.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use these really because they&#x27;re too big for my nails.</li>
            <li>When she got the package of these tiny designs ,she was amazed,They were so tiny but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The studs overall are nice, not as small as shown in the picture, I have like average nail length and can only fit about 3 in a diamond shape and 4 close together.</li>
            <li>They were not little like the pictures shows  and we&#x27;re nothing like I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I can only fit about 3 going down the nail like in the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving them a 4 star rating because they are slightly difficult to put on your nails, but other than that they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until recently we tried them and realized how big they really are.</li>
            <li>I did several different declaration on my nails that stick well for days with just clear polish.</li>
            <li>It shipped fairly fast but they are bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>Because the bottom is not flat the glue wont hold</li>
            <li>They are not flat on the back</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very small and good fro detailed designs.</li>
            <li> They look cute for a day, but only a day.</li>
            <li> WiLL DEFiNiTELY ORDER MORE...</li>
            <li> AND iT WAS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Definitely would buy more</li>
            <li> they r really pretty.</li>
            <li> Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li> Would look much better smaller.</li>
            <li> Pretty good comes in the variety as stated but it too forever to arive.these are also quite small.</li>
            <li> I can fit barely 4 on my nails at the length displayed.</li>
            <li> Small but perfect for acrylic nails and can be use for other crafting projects also</li>
            <li> I could only fit 3 on my nails (which aren&#x27;t really that short), and they fell off so easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to count, they were only a few but great for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I can only fit 4 in a row from my cuticle to the end of my nail.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and she really likes them.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
            <li> I really like this studs</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, however, it is very decorative and eye appealing.</li>
            <li> Makes for super cute manis with little effort!</li>
            <li> Bought these and many other designs for my teenager.</li>
            <li> used clear polish and a dotting tool to pick them up and place them on my nails the first time I used them and that worked out really well.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that I got pretty close to the amount promised.</li>
            <li> they are a nice small size.</li>
            <li> comes with no where near how much it says it does!</li>
            <li> I really like the pieces but wish they would have came a little more orgainzed.</li>
            <li> Instead I got half that many.</li>
            <li> I even started to use super glue after I had to apply them for a third time, and they STILL fell off.</li>
            <li> However note that they are larger than the image so no way you can use as many as they show it would cover your entire nail.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you have longer nails</li>
            <li> They would be better if they were curved because personally my nails aren&#x27;t flat.</li>
            <li> I ordered these studs about a month ago, they did take a little more than the time said to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it s because I was expecting them to look like real goldish and out of this world, but they are not bad though and on top of sending you the gold one only they sent you some white ones too, so can actually match them up and create different style.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 270 pieces, they were mostly silver studs, not half gold, half silver.</li>
            <li> Yes, they arrived very early, but I wish they would&#x27;ve given me the 270 I ordered, but at this price, I&#x27;ll settle.</li>
            <li> Tiny but exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li> My nails are pretty long and decently sized too.</li>
            <li> was another pile of pretty much the same amount so there is definitely about 270 in there.</li>
            <li> I love these they are a little smaller than I thought they looked in the picture</li>
            <li> The studs look so much smaller in the picture than they really are.</li>
            <li> they are bigger than what is shown in the picture, only three studs can fit on my nails (short and natural)</li>
            <li> I even started counting them to see how many there are since a lot of people complained and said there can&#x27;t be 270 in the package.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these really because they&#x27;re too big for my nails.</li>
            <li> When she got the package of these tiny designs ,she was amazed,They were so tiny but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The studs overall are nice, not as small as shown in the picture, I have like average nail length and can only fit about 3 in a diamond shape and 4 close together.</li>
            <li> They were not little like the pictures shows  and we&#x27;re nothing like I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I can only fit about 3 going down the nail like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them a 4 star rating because they are slightly difficult to put on your nails, but other than that they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until recently we tried them and realized how big they really are.</li>
            <li> I did several different declaration on my nails that stick well for days with just clear polish.</li>
            <li> It shipped fairly fast but they are bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Because the bottom is not flat the glue wont hold</li>
            <li> They are not flat on the back</li>
            <li> Did anyone else receive a bag full or blue, red, black and green studs?</li>
            <li> These are really cute, but too hard to get on my nails because they are so small.</li>
            <li> they sat flat.</li>
            <li> these were flat backs</li>
            <li> the studs are all for flat surfaces, and all my nails are rounded surfaces so even with setting them in polish and sealing them in the studs</li>
            <li> I have long natural nails and these studs are a little on the big side</li>
            <li> They are huge and look so weird in the nails.</li>
            <li> i expected different.</li>
            <li> They were a lot larger than I expected</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> They also came mixed up in little baggies and you had to sort them your self.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that they came unassorted in little bags.</li>
            <li> No matter what glue/product you use, these pop off everywhere as they are hollow.</li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> They are hollow.</li>
            <li> they not to big or small</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too big to put a bunch on each nail, but not so small that they&#x27;re a headache to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had other studs stay on, but these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so it might be a little harder to glue them on stuff.</li>
            <li> Although they come in little baggies.</li>
            <li> These little studs aren&#x27;t even like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> not very many in the pack</li>
            <li> Professionals please order a few of these.  </li>
            <li> This keeps them firmly stuck on and they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> Not what daughter expected and very disappointed with product even though that explains cheap price.</li>
            <li> I thought they would have been a lot smaller but ill try and work with them</li>
            <li> but my nails are small</li>
            <li> These usually cost about $15 on jamberry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product, but I personally don&#x27;t like the studs.</li>
            <li> These came in the wrong colors-pink and green instead of silver/gold and they took weeks to arrive!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the picture being advertised is not what is sent.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t follow the shape of my nails which is annoying because my hair gets caught in the corners where it&#x27;s not touching my nail when I run my fingers through my hair or whatever.</li>
            <li> not to bad.</li>
            <li> theyre Almost black just horrible horrible product I will never buy again</li>
            <li> Not impressed and very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I aam disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with</li>
            <li> , you get what you pay for :-(</li>

            <li> Tiny but exactly what I wanted..&lt;br /&gt;I even got some extra ones</li>
            <li> In the pictures they look smaller than this I got are too big.</li>
            <li> i though they would be 3d. they sat flat. not to bad. they are cute i expected different.</li>
            <li> I really like the pieces but wish they would have came a little more orgainzed. They were all in ony tiny plastic packet all mixed together ..</li>
            <li> No matter what glue/product you use, these pop off everywhere as they are hollow. Try attaching with acrylic.</li>
            <li> I realy love how it looks on the Nails it looks with style</li>
            <li> because the don&#x27;t have a back to them</li>
            <li> Received ordered didn&#x27;t get 250 studs, spilled out in when took put of shipping package.  But didn&#x27;t add up to 250 as described.</li>
            <li> I got a shock when I saw the quality of these studs and i  fell inlove with doing nails all over again</li>
            <li> Very nice! These usually cost about $15 on jamberry!</li>
            <li> Good but they are bigger than what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> great product, exact product shown on the picture</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that I got pretty close to the amount promised. The size does say 4mm and they are. So if you are looking for smaller studs these are not them. They are bigger but I like them!</li>
            <li> They were a too big for my nails! I highly recommend if you have longer nails</li>
            <li> Cute!  Professionals please order a few of these.  They are really nice.</li>
            <li> When she got the package of these tiny designs ,she was amazed,They were so tiny but worth the wait.Amazon is a good choice to buy what you need at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> They are bigger than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The studs came in very cute packaging. There is a separate resealable bags for each color which I like very much for storage reasons. The colors are spot on and there is a good amount of each. They are not flimsy and look just as shown. All in all very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Did anyone else receive a bag full or blue, red, black and green studs? Because I did. Not a gold or silver one in the bunch.</li>
            <li> Very small and good fro detailed designs. I can only fit 4 in a row from my cuticle to the end of my nail. They look great when they are on! They come with gold and silver studs.</li>
            <li> I loved it!!!! Lots of compliments and great quality. Buying more of them for sure. Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> The studs look so much smaller in the picture than they really are. I could only fit 3 on my nails (which aren&#x27;t really that short), and they fell off so easily. I even started to use super glue after I had to apply them for a third time, and they STILL fell off. They look cute for a day, but only a day.</li>
            <li> Looks great with the colors i have and more now that the summer is coming ! I need to look great at all times..</li>
            <li> iM SATiSFiED WiLL DEFiNiTELY ORDER MORE... I LOVE iT... AND iT STAYS ON... GREAT PRiCE... AND iT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Pretty good comes in the variety as stated but it too forever to arive.these are also quite small. I was under the impression these were flat backs but they are not. They are hollow.</li>
            <li> They were a lot bigger than the picture...</li>
            <li> Only got like 45 pieces. Both colors combined. I think the owner needs to learn basic math....</li>
            <li> They were a lot larger than I expected and therefore I can only place one on each nail. They do not look anything like the picture. I aam disappointed.</li>
            <li> A bit larger than anticipated.</li>
            <li> These are really cute ill say that and they looked great on my nails but the thing about these is that if you wash or use ur hands alot throughout the day they fade pretty quickly and they turn into silver instead of it being gold but other than that SUPER CUTE! :)</li>
            <li> It shipped fairly fast but they are bigger than I expected. The person in the picture must have massive finger nails. I can only fit about 3 going down the nail like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Really? I ordered these studs THREE MONTHS AGO. Oh, but are they here yet? No! Not at all like I wanted the things that I paid for. I better either be getting these studs soon, or I better get my money back, and I will NOT be ordering from this company EVER again.</li>
            <li> Received closer to 30 pieces than 270. Not what daughter expected and very disappointed with product even though that explains cheap price.</li>
            <li> studs are soooo big totally not the size it shows in the picture. I can probably put on like one and that&#x27;s it.  would not buy again</li>
            <li> The studs are a little bigger than I anticipated however, they are great!</li>
            <li> Studs looked beautiful with my nails.</li>
            <li> Good, came in a plastic bag of all silver and one gold. Only had about 60 studs. But it was cheap so can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li> Just as described. Just get a good glue or they will fall out.</li>
            <li> I bought these since I do my own nails every week and these hold up very well. They stay on my nail all week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product @the stones are so big I don&#x27;t buy@ this again</li>
            <li> they are bigger than what is shown in the picture, only three studs can fit on my nails (short and natural)</li>
            <li> The squares are way to big for the nail I thought they would have been a lot smaller but ill try and work with them</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, however, it is very decorative and eye appealing.</li>
            <li> These were a trill to work with , you can really makes some wonderful designs on yours are someone else&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my nail girl and I to use. It wasn&#x27;t until recently we tried them and realized how big they really are. The picture makes them seem MUCH smaller and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very accurate. We tried using one at the moon of my nail and they were so big that part of the edges wouldn&#x27;t even be in contact with my nail. Not impressed and very disappointed with this purchase. They also came mixed up in little baggies and you had to sort them your self.</li>
            <li> Packaging could be better and the studs are kind of flimsy, you get what you pay for :-(</li>
            <li> Thought they&#x27;d be a bit smaller for nails, but instead I used them for cellphone cases.</li>
            <li> I love these they are a little smaller than I thought they looked in the picture but my nails are small so they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The description says 270 studs and I didn&#x27;t get anywhere close to 270 studs. I feel like I got ripped off.</li>
            <li> Great Lil studs.... very cute</li>
            <li> Come smaller then U would expect and in two colors silver and gold. But they R supper cute and easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these studs 4 stars because they only came with about 100 studs, not 270. Still the price is decent and the studs seems to be good quality. Makes for super cute manis with little effort!</li>
            <li> OK So I recall reading a review that stated these were bigger than shown and I have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll serve the purpose I bought them for still, however if you want the result shown in the image unless you have very large nails they won&#x27;t look as good as shown as they will appear out of proportion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute. BUT. I didn&#x27;t get 270 pieces, they were mostly silver studs, not half gold, half silver. Yes, they arrived very early, but I wish they would&#x27;ve given me the 270 I ordered, but at this price, I&#x27;ll settle. The studs overall are nice, not as small as shown in the picture, I have like average nail length and can only fit about 3 in a diamond shape and 4 close together. For the price, you get a pretty okay product.</li>
            <li> Bought these and many other designs for my teenager. She is very much into nail designs and being creative with natural nails. She loves them all.</li>
            <li> When I saw &amp;#34;a pack of 270&amp;#34; I thought I would be getting 270 studs. Instead I got half that many. But the quality is ok so that makes me feel a little better.</li>
            <li> not very many in the pack</li>
            <li> I love it. It arrived quickly to me and I love the way it looks on my nails easy to use as well as easy to remove. I just doesn&#x27;t seem like 270 studs but im satisfied because of course I didnt count them.</li>
            <li> The girls love them..........teenagers are pros at making the coolest designs and these are perfect for their creations!!!!!!!! Just didn&#x27;t buy enough!</li>
            <li> These are fun and apply easily. However note that they are larger than the image so no way you can use as many as they show it would cover your entire nail.</li>
            <li> These came in the wrong colors-pink and green instead of silver/gold and they took weeks to arrive! 270 seems like a lot but it&#x27;s a tiny bag! Haven&#x27;t counted but doubt it&#x27;s even 100 pieces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them a 4 star rating because they are slightly difficult to put on your nails, but other than that they are pretty good. They came earlier than expected so that was cool!</li>
            <li> I got my order within 2 weeks. Which I&#x27;m pretty happy about seeing how I&#x27;m still waiting on orders I made a week before this one. Fast delivery. Good quality. I have long natural nails and these studs are a little on the big side so I can only get away with using one stud on my nail rather than line them up. But still the quality is good and they look nice. Idk if I received 270 but I don&#x27;t feel like sitting and counting one by one. It looks about right to me. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would probably reorder once I start running out.</li>
            <li> I ordered these studs about a month ago, they did take a little more than the time said to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are a nice small size. They would be better if they were curved because personally my nails aren&#x27;t flat. They came on both gold &amp; silver as pictured. I didn&#x27;t bother to count, they were only a few but great for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Love love love them can&#x27;t wait to do my nails they not to big or small they are perfect wish I would&#x27;ve ordered more</li>
            <li> True to the desription and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are really cute, but too hard to get on my nails because they are so small.</li>
            <li> IM STILL WAITING FOR THEM AND ITS BEING ALREDY LIKE FIVE MONTHS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I did get these... lol, I&#x27;ll have to check!</li>
            <li> These studs are a really nice size to work with. They&#x27;re too big to put a bunch on each nail, but not so small that they&#x27;re a headache to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used clear polish and a dotting tool to pick them up and place them on my nails the first time I used them and that worked out really well. But then I bought wax pencil tools that are meant for picking up rhinestones and studs and that worked even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Seche Vite topcoat to secure the studs to my nails and paint over the top with two coats of the same. This keeps them firmly stuck on and they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Easy to apply</li>
            <li> Love them and got lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Everyone talks about them being big, but I don&#x27;t see how they are big. They are a good size. Although they come in little baggies.</li>
            <li> The shape that came in were stars, not squares. the quality was what I paid for. I can&#x27;t give it a good rating because it was not the product pictured or described.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These little studs aren&#x27;t even like the picture shows. They are huge and look so weird in the nails. They were not little like the pictures shows  and we&#x27;re nothing like I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Small but perfect for acrylic nails and can be use for other crafting projects also</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my sister for her birthday (I let her pick them out). She said they were just like they are pictured and she really likes them. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother, this is trash and that is where I put it. Because the bottom is not flat the glue wont hold</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product, but I personally don&#x27;t like the studs. I find that they are too big for a nail</li>
            <li> Awsome designs are as described bought them about a year ago and i still have plenty left... takes a while to get in but thats understanble from where they come from.. loved it would purchase from the seller again in the future :-)</li>
            <li> Please do NOT buy these they&#x27;re cheap material instead of gold theyre Almost black just horrible horrible product I will never buy again</li>
            <li> Nice item I will try them out soon. How ever there are not 270 pieces as advertised. I guess they think people won&#x27;t notice the amount</li>
            <li> Love it, they are super cute and easy to apply. I love the look a lot. Definitely would buy more</li>
            <li> love these will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i really like them good size. i still havent use them but cant wait to try them on they are too cute.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t really impress me. I don&#x27;t know if it s because I was expecting them to look like real goldish and out of this world, but they are not bad though and on top of sending you the gold one only they sent you some white ones too, so can actually match them up and create different style. Now is it 270? I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you.</li>
            <li> I really like this studs they r really pretty. Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li> I finally got them.. They are the tiniest cutest creations. I did several different declaration on my nails that stick well for days with just clear polish. The coolest</li>
            <li> Great for anytime of the year, especially Halloween. Thank you</li>
            <li> I ordered these and had to contact them a month later because i didnt get them and i got STARS not studs.</li>
            <li> comes with no where near how much it says it does! it comes in a tiny bag and has about 70 studs in there! if you could find these cheaper do it ! it fits on ur nails so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Looks so cute on nails, awesome</li>
            <li> They are perfect the only problem is that it takes to long to long for shipping but for the product is amazing</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. They look like just the picture. I even started counting them to see how many there are since a lot of people complained and said there can&#x27;t be 270 in the package. I counted to 160 then I gave up there was another pile of pretty much the same amount so there is definitely about 270 in there. They are not flat on the back so it might be a little harder to glue them on stuff.</li>
            <li> Bigger than you&#x27;d expect but still usable</li>
            <li> This product was a perfect new decals I have been looking for my collection.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect in size, not too big not too small and it is has great quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for beginners as well as advanced nail technicians and I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying from the seller again.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is the fault of the studs or of my fingers...the studs are all for flat surfaces, and all my nails are rounded surfaces so even with setting them in polish and sealing them in the studs had raised edges that got caught and tore right off. They didn&#x27;t make it a full hour before they were all gone. They aren&#x27;t flexible and don&#x27;t bend so don&#x27;t count on that either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these really because they&#x27;re too big for my nails. My nails are pretty long and decently sized too. I think these are just too big. They also don&#x27;t follow the shape of my nails which is annoying because my hair gets caught in the corners where it&#x27;s not touching my nail when I run my fingers through my hair or whatever. They also came off easily. I have had other studs stay on, but these don&#x27;t. I know they were cheap but still money is money</li>
            <li> Recommend to deal with it</li>
            <li> This design looks gorgeous. Unfortunately the picture being advertised is not what is sent. The size is bigger. I can fit barely 4 on my nails at the length displayed. Would look much better smaller. And not as easy to come off.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and are good quality. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that they came unassorted in little bags.</li>
