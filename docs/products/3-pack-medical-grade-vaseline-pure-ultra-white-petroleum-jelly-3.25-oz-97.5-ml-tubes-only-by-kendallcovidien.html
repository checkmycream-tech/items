            <li>Wish these had a flip-top cap, but this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>but the vaseline itself is still really good</li>
            <li>OK!</li>
            <li>My favorite place to shop!</li>
            <li>Perfect for that application or the first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality-</li>
            <li>The tubes are really handy and one can squeeze out just the amount needed.  </li>
            <li>To any kind of lubricants.</li>
            <li>Nice to squeeze when needing for diaper change.</li>
            <li>The vaseline tubes are really nice...</li>
            <li>Take your own just in case the dentist doesn&#x27;t have any.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Awesome high grade vaseline!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to squeeze out of the tube without getting it on my fingers.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it appears to be a very fine product.</li>
            <li>great, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love the tube,</li>
            <li>If the hospital can trust it (considering people love to sue over anything), so can I.</li>
            <li>well packaged, what more is there to say.  </li>
            <li>love this product to apply to my baby&#x27;s diaper area.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Nice smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>The texture of the vaseline seems better than what I get at stores as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t field tested this yet, so more to come.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that we found this on Amazon as it is the same stuff that we used at the hospital.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my skin around a wound when i apply the dressings.  </li>
            <li>We ordered a whole bunch and it works great.</li>
            <li>used it for my son&#x27;s circ until the pediatrician said A&amp;D is better, FYI A&amp;D is better at diaper rash then Desitin as well.</li>
            <li>No complaints:).</li>
            <li>Safe.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it for her</li>
            <li>so u might use more product</li>
            <li>We like tubes over tubs because they&#x27;re more sanitary.</li>
            <li>Squeezing it from the tube is more sanitary anyways.</li>
            <li>This medical grade petroleum jelly is wonderful for use on your skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love this.</li>
            <li>I just really appreciate a good product that is worth themoney, and also honest and sincere customer service people, as I do a lot of online shopping.</li>
            <li>The tube squeezes out product easily.</li>
            <li>Easy spreadable and seals well.</li>
            <li>The consistency makes this extremely easy to apply (have tried Walgreen &amp; Target brand</li>
            <li>Works great for baby &amp; easy to squeeze out the very last bit.</li>
            <li>Great deal compared to buying name brand in store,  most 2.5oz go for $4 for a single bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I echo other reviewers that a flip cap would make this the perfect product, but the fact that it comes in a tube is good enough for me since it&#x27;s easily portable and easy to apply to my baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference when it&#x27;s used on the corner of your lips when having dental work done.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight but holds a lot inside</li>
            <li>Rite Aid brand is good but those tubes are much smaller and cost more.)</li>
            <li>I had to change bandages 2 times a day and use a goodly amount of vaseline to keep it soft.</li>
            <li>I use large quantities of Vaseline as a moisturizer for my eczema, and I&#x27;ll get more for the money with good old fashioned Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Very refined vaseline, light weight, and the tube is more hygienic than a jar.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because the nurses applied them to each clean diaper before putting on the diaper for my baby.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste very good, and I&#x27;m a little hesitant to put it into my car&#x27;s gas tank.  </li>
            <li>Instead I got three tubes full of a greasy goop.</li>
            <li>I was having to use a lot and really plaster on the bargain brands, using three times more for adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>This is such nice, smooth Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve come back MANY times for more.</li>
            <li>And this works better than normal Vaseline</li>
            <li>Super soft &amp; easy to spread.</li>
            <li>We just apply this liberally to the whole diaper area and it makes it a lot easier to clean his poop off of the diaper area because it just slides right off.</li>
            <li>it comes out of the tube much more easily, is softer, and allows you to completely empty the tube without struggle.</li>
            <li>and I like the white a lot better than the off clear stuff that most stores carry.</li>
            <li>Tough to find, easy to love, would be better with flip top caps for quick, sudden urgent uses... ummmm.</li>
            <li>I wish it was attached to the tube and popped open, since it is useful to be able to do things with one hand when changing a diaper...</li>
            <li>is the same stuff they use at the hospital, and for good reason; it&#x27;s high quality and high quantity-per-bottle.</li>
            <li>You will get exactly what is described.  </li>
            <li>exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Exactly as one would expect out of tubes of petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>this vaseline is soft and comes out as a smooth and creamy paste(better than all the Vaselines I have tried for my baby, and I have tried a lot of them!)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Said it was the first time in 21 years</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>There are some lumps in the first tube we ordered.  </li>
            <li>its so easy to squeeze out just enough.  </li>
            <li>You get about double what you&#x27;d normally get in a store-bought vaseline tube, and the vaseline is the perfect mixture (not too hard, not</li>
            <li>one of the tubes always spews out an oily liquid before the actual vaseline comes out, I&#x27;ve tried storing it upright so that the oily part mixes, but it still happens with that one tube, oyher than that it&#x27;s just regular vaseline, nothing special, I just like tube products because it feels more sanitary rather than sticking my fingers in a jar each time.</li>
            <li>I have been buying the cheap tubs of generic vaseline.  </li>
            <li>This product is so much easier to use than Vaseline in a tub.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This was very affordable, and a lot of product is in this 3-pack.</li>
            <li>It also does not seem to trap in as much heat as the Vaseline brand.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really what can be reviewed about vaseline?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>) Tube makes it very sanitary to apply the Vaseline on the baby&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly appreciated how the seller took the time to regard my concern.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for under eyes too!</li>
            <li>I bought one-packs of these tubes of petroleum jelly in the past, but just found this convenient (and much more economical) three pack.</li>
            <li>great texture, and a little bit goes a long way, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I actually looked this up, and it IS true, that Kendall is part of Covidien now.</li>
            <li>These are better than the typical vaseline tubes you buy in the store because the gel is &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and easier to spread.</li>
            <li>Decent size for diaper bag and travel.</li>
            <li>This brand is just slightly more expensive than the tubes at Target per ounce, but this product is better...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for skin care.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to filling up the car and enjoying a few PB&amp;J sandwiches when this arrived.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recommended the Pure Vaseline and I must say it really helps, Especially when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li>but I found that other brands fliptops will fit on this tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this for the diaper of my new born baby.</li>
            <li>And very natural with no fragrances.</li>
            <li>This formulation is noticeably higher quality than drugstore and Walmart brands - it melts and absorbs more quickly with less of a thick greasy film.</li>
            <li>It is slightly lighter, both in color and texture, than the good old fashioned Vaseline, however, it is not worth the additional cost for me.</li>
            <li>My kid&#x27;s butt was clear as a bell after using this.</li>
            <li>Considerably cheaper than heading to the drug store nearby.</li>
            <li>My son is now 7 mos old and (knock on wood) has never had a diaper rash yet.</li>
            <li>And she has been 16 months old and never had a diaper rash.</li>
            <li>This is the same brand the hospitals use on babies so we continued use with our daughter and never had rash problems the whole duration of use of it.</li>
            <li>Much softer than regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li>So far we have been using the Vaseline and my baby (almost 3 months) has not had diaper rash.</li>
            <li>My baby this far did not get a rash and his skin in the area is always soft :</li>
            <li>husband had skin cancers surgically removed and was given this type Petroleum Jelly to use to keep the area soft and promote healing.  </li>
            <li>It is smoother than the regular Vaseline and really works for cracked lips.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these vaseline tubes, and no I am not being paid to write this review or related to the seller or the company in any way.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery as expected because I&#x27;ve never had any issues with Amazon&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li>They are big enough to stay with you for a long time and the quality is good just like an ordinary vaseline.</li>
            <li>this amount should last forever as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>So everything in the inside of the tubes is still exactly the same and the tubes look the same too (just different wording and design on the outside).</li>
            <li>She sannot find it other thn at a medical supply  store---but very very pricey</li>
            <li>Smoother and cheaper than CVS brand or Vaseline brand tubes that are available in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother and a little more expensive than target brand.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>The pediatrician recommended vaseline over the other rash creams (Desitin, Butt Paste, A&amp;D), and in general, it works really well.</li>
            <li>Used for first month and half.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com on the other hand, there&#x27;s so much to be said</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;ll be surprised how long they last!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My heels dry and crack, causing considerable discomfort.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and less sticky than the junk in the store.  </li>

            <li> We just apply this liberally to the whole diaper area and it makes it a lot easier to clean his poop off of the diaper area because it just slides right off.</li>
            <li> it comes out of the tube much more easily, is softer, and allows you to completely empty the tube without struggle.</li>
            <li> and I like the white a lot better than the off clear stuff that most stores carry.</li>
            <li> Tough to find, easy to love, would be better with flip top caps for quick, sudden urgent uses... ummmm.</li>
            <li> I wish it was attached to the tube and popped open, since it is useful to be able to do things with one hand when changing a diaper...</li>
            <li> is the same stuff they use at the hospital, and for good reason; it&#x27;s high quality and high quantity-per-bottle.</li>
            <li> You will get exactly what is described.  </li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Exactly as one would expect out of tubes of petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> this vaseline is soft and comes out as a smooth and creamy paste(better than all the Vaselines I have tried for my baby, and I have tried a lot of them!)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Said it was the first time in 21 years</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> There are some lumps in the first tube we ordered.  </li>
            <li> its so easy to squeeze out just enough.  </li>
            <li> You get about double what you&#x27;d normally get in a store-bought vaseline tube, and the vaseline is the perfect mixture (not too hard, not</li>
            <li> one of the tubes always spews out an oily liquid before the actual vaseline comes out, I&#x27;ve tried storing it upright so that the oily part mixes, but it still happens with that one tube, oyher than that it&#x27;s just regular vaseline, nothing special, I just like tube products because it feels more sanitary rather than sticking my fingers in a jar each time.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the cheap tubs of generic vaseline.  </li>
            <li> This product is so much easier to use than Vaseline in a tub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was very affordable, and a lot of product is in this 3-pack.</li>
            <li> It also does not seem to trap in as much heat as the Vaseline brand.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really what can be reviewed about vaseline?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ) Tube makes it very sanitary to apply the Vaseline on the baby&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly appreciated how the seller took the time to regard my concern.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for under eyes too!</li>
            <li> I bought one-packs of these tubes of petroleum jelly in the past, but just found this convenient (and much more economical) three pack.</li>
            <li> great texture, and a little bit goes a long way, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually looked this up, and it IS true, that Kendall is part of Covidien now.</li>
            <li> These are better than the typical vaseline tubes you buy in the store because the gel is &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Decent size for diaper bag and travel.</li>
            <li> This brand is just slightly more expensive than the tubes at Target per ounce, but this product is better...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for skin care.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to filling up the car and enjoying a few PB&amp;J sandwiches when this arrived.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended the Pure Vaseline and I must say it really helps, Especially when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li> but I found that other brands fliptops will fit on this tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for the diaper of my new born baby.</li>
            <li> And very natural with no fragrances.</li>
            <li> This formulation is noticeably higher quality than drugstore and Walmart brands - it melts and absorbs more quickly with less of a thick greasy film.</li>
            <li> It is slightly lighter, both in color and texture, than the good old fashioned Vaseline, however, it is not worth the additional cost for me.</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s butt was clear as a bell after using this.</li>
            <li> Considerably cheaper than heading to the drug store nearby.</li>
            <li> My son is now 7 mos old and (knock on wood) has never had a diaper rash yet.</li>
            <li> And she has been 16 months old and never had a diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This is the same brand the hospitals use on babies so we continued use with our daughter and never had rash problems the whole duration of use of it.</li>
            <li> Much softer than regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li> So far we have been using the Vaseline and my baby (almost 3 months) has not had diaper rash.</li>
            <li> My baby this far did not get a rash and his skin in the area is always soft :</li>
            <li> husband had skin cancers surgically removed and was given this type Petroleum Jelly to use to keep the area soft and promote healing.  </li>
            <li> It is smoother than the regular Vaseline and really works for cracked lips.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these vaseline tubes, and no I am not being paid to write this review or related to the seller or the company in any way.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery as expected because I&#x27;ve never had any issues with Amazon&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li> They are big enough to stay with you for a long time and the quality is good just like an ordinary vaseline.</li>
            <li> this amount should last forever as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> So everything in the inside of the tubes is still exactly the same and the tubes look the same too (just different wording and design on the outside).</li>
            <li> She sannot find it other thn at a medical supply  store---but very very pricey</li>
            <li> Smoother and cheaper than CVS brand or Vaseline brand tubes that are available in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother and a little more expensive than target brand.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The pediatrician recommended vaseline over the other rash creams (Desitin, Butt Paste, A&amp;D), and in general, it works really well.</li>
            <li> Used for first month and half.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com on the other hand, there&#x27;s so much to be said</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;ll be surprised how long they last!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My heels dry and crack, causing considerable discomfort.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and less sticky than the junk in the store.  </li>
            <li> No more digging my fingers into a tub then having to wipe off my whole hand and under my nail just to remove my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I first thought that these were the wrong tubes when I received them and complained about them, however, the seller personally called me and assured me that these are the exact same ones as Kendall and</li>
            <li> They are screw on lids, as opposed to what you buy in stores that have pop tops (way less likely to pop open in your pack).</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase as long as my baby is in diapers!</li>
            <li> My skin was getting dry</li>
            <li> Thick, high quality Vaseline</li>
            <li> They can be carried without worrying about leakage (or less likely so, anyway).</li>
            <li> product compared to others does seem less dense and the has a bigger opening</li>
            <li> The active contents are the same as other leading brands.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have reviewed this product before, but not sure if it was for a different seller?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was also having a hard time finding these tubes in the stores, they only sold it in jars</li>
            <li> (haha sorry for being gross).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It takes so much less.  </li>
            <li> everytime I dig into the tub because it makes a mess</li>
            <li> the nurses there provided us with (just plain vaseline).</li>
            <li> But I hate having to clean under my finger nails</li>
            <li> these have a screw on lid, and can be inconvenient to screw open and close during the diaper change.. and if the lid gets lost then it makes the tube laying around unsanitary...</li>
            <li> and they are too thick. ..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My heels dry and crack, causing considerable discomfort. My doctor recommended the Pure Vaseline and I must say it really helps, Especially when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li> When a baby boy is circumcised this stuff cannot be used enough! Great baby gift for the expecting mom!</li>
            <li> Saw these in hospital room, so ordered when got home. Used for first month and half. Now using A+D and Aquaphor on a regular basis as my son started getting rashes.</li>
            <li> OK! What can one say about Vaseline? Amazon.com on the other hand, there&#x27;s so much to be said and it is all great! My favorite place to shop!</li>
            <li> The is a perfect petroleum jelly.  I love the tube, its so easy to squeeze out just enough.  I have been buying the cheap tubs of generic vaseline.  This is a quality product.  I am only going to buy Coviden from now on.  It takes so much less.  I was having to use a lot and really plaster on the bargain brands, using three times more for adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s butt was clear as a bell after using this.</li>
            <li> After considering the price and the ease of use, decided to give this 5 stars. Considerably cheaper than heading to the drug store nearby.</li>
            <li> Great price.  This is the same item the hospital used on our baby.  If the hospital can trust it (considering people love to sue over anything), so can I.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It is Vaseline.  Great product, well packaged, what more is there to say.  You will get exactly what is described.  If you need some Medical Grade Vaseline buy it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Good for what I use it for</li>
            <li> We use this as a baby diaper cream. And this works better than normal Vaseline</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this product before, but not sure if it was for a different seller?&lt;br /&gt;I love this product to apply to my baby&#x27;s diaper area.&lt;br /&gt;When he was in the hospital at birth, this is the diaper cream the nurses there provided us with (just plain vaseline). We googled it to try to find bigger tubes. My son is now 7 mos old and (knock on wood) has never had a diaper rash yet. We just apply this liberally to the whole diaper area and it makes it a lot easier to clean his poop off of the diaper area because it just slides right off. (haha sorry for being gross).&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent, affordable diaper ointment. And very natural with no fragrances.</li>
            <li> This product is so much easier to use than Vaseline in a tub.  No more digging my fingers into a tub then having to wipe off my whole hand and under my nail just to remove my eye makeup.  Nice smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> They are big enough to stay with you for a long time and the quality is good just like an ordinary vaseline.</li>
            <li> Super soft &amp; easy to spread. Works great for baby &amp; easy to squeeze out the very last bit. Great value</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I was looking forward to filling up the car and enjoying a few PB&amp;J sandwiches when this arrived.  Instead I got three tubes full of a greasy goop. It doesn&#x27;t taste very good, and I&#x27;m a little hesitant to put it into my car&#x27;s gas tank.  Otherwise, it appears to be a very fine product.</li>
            <li> I bought these specifically for the way the lid closes. They are screw on lids, as opposed to what you buy in stores that have pop tops (way less likely to pop open in your pack). They can be carried without worrying about leakage (or less likely so, anyway). The texture of the vaseline seems better than what I get at stores as well. I intend to carry this in my 1st aid kit for backpacking. It will be carried in a plastic bag in case it leaks. I haven&#x27;t field tested this yet, so more to come.</li>
            <li> Smoother and cheaper than CVS brand or Vaseline brand tubes that are available in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother and a little more expensive than target brand.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fliptop but I found that other brands fliptops will fit on this tube.</li>
            <li> Found this to be a great deal for the price.  I was also having a hard time finding these tubes in the stores, they only sold it in jars and I do prefer the tubes.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Perfect for what we needed.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this brand</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job! I am glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> The tubes are really handy and one can squeeze out just the amount needed.  Good control, I guess, is what I&#x27;m trying to get to.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that we found this on Amazon as it is the same stuff that we used at the hospital.  I echo other reviewers that a flip cap would make this the perfect product, but the fact that it comes in a tube is good enough for me since it&#x27;s easily portable and easy to apply to my baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vaseline since the baby was born. And she has been 16 months old and never had a diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any reviews for this use.... I&#x27;m very &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;. To any kind of lubricants. This stuff is GREAT. For everything. No issues. Anywhere. :) It beats any petroleum jellies on the shelf.</li>
            <li> As a dermatologist, this is the only thing that goes on my baby&#x27;s skin. I highly recommend for skin care.</li>
            <li> This is such nice, smooth Vaseline.  I use it mostly on my skin around a wound when i apply the dressings.  My skin was getting dry and I didn&#x27;t want to use a regular lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for several months and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> This is a great, sanitary dispenser for Vaseline. This was very affordable, and a lot of product is in this 3-pack. The tube squeezes out product easily. Definitely a must have for your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Thick, high quality Vaseline</li>
            <li> one of the tubes always spews out an oily liquid before the actual vaseline comes out, I&#x27;ve tried storing it upright so that the oily part mixes, but it still happens with that one tube, oyher than that it&#x27;s just regular vaseline, nothing special, I just like tube products because it feels more sanitary rather than sticking my fingers in a jar each time.</li>
            <li> This is the price you can get for petroleum jelly.  We ordered this twice after our sons circumcision and had to apply gigantic amounts (per the doctor) after each diaper change.  These are the same tubes we were given at the office and goes on a lot easier than the jars.</li>
            <li> and is perfect for that usage.  Easy spreadable and seals well. It also does not seem to trap in as much heat as the Vaseline brand.  We ordered a whole bunch and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is  great value for top-quality stuff.  But note that you&#x27;ll have a screw cap to deal with, not a flip cap.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if it annoys you, then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Kendall white petroleum and received a different brand. I used this specific(Kendall) one in the hospital and loved it, this brand still works but not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Price and quality were great. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for the diaper of my new born baby. The package looks different from this photo, but this is the same one as the hospital that I delivered was using.</li>
            <li> Exactly as one would expect out of tubes of petroleum jelly.  I used them to make fire starters (tinder) by squirting some into a cotton ball.  Perfect for that application or the first aid kit.</li>
            <li> This is the same brand the hospitals use on babies so we continued use with our daughter and never had rash problems the whole duration of use of it.</li>
            <li> This was the same brand used in the NICU. They are 3.5 oz which was great instead of the 1 oz from  the hospital. Nice to squeeze when needing for diaper change. Especially for circumcision care.</li>
            <li> this amount should last forever as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> This is the same brand we were given at the hospital. The consistency makes this extremely easy to apply (have tried Walgreen &amp; Target brand and they are too thick. ..Rite Aid brand is good but those tubes are much smaller and cost more.) Will continue to purchase as long as my baby is in diapers! I only wish it had a fliptop.</li>
            <li> This formulation is noticeably higher quality than drugstore and Walmart brands - it melts and absorbs more quickly with less of a thick greasy film.</li>
            <li> got for emergency kit , haven&#x27;t tried but price is good</li>
            <li> Really what can be reviewed about vaseline?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for my son&#x27;s circ until the pediatrician said A&amp;D is better, FYI A&amp;D is better at diaper rash then Desitin as well.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that I can squeeze the vaseline out from cap, rather than put my fingers in a jar of vaseline.</li>
            <li> Wish these had a flip-top cap, but this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just what I was looking for. No complaints:).</li>
            <li> Much softer than regular Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Very refined vaseline, light weight, and the tube is more hygienic than a jar.  I use it on my hands and neck every night.</li>
            <li> We have been using it for our NB. Excellent product. Safe. Recommended in hospital and we apply it every day in the baby.</li>
            <li> These are better than the typical vaseline tubes you buy in the store because the gel is &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and easier to spread. On a newborn, 3 tubes has lasted me about 2 months. Just now ordered more :-D</li>
            <li> great texture, and a little bit goes a long way, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for for a friend that has Sjorgens and uses this all the time. She sannot find it other thn at a medical supply  store---but very very pricey So glad I found it for her</li>
            <li> Way cheaper then buying individual tubes at a local pharmacy. The active contents are the same as other leading brands.</li>
            <li> The vaseline tubes are really nice... these are the ones used in the hospitals as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Tube makes it very sanitary to apply the Vaseline on the baby&lt;br /&gt;2) Amazing quality- this vaseline is soft and comes out as a smooth and creamy paste(better than all the Vaselines I have tried for my baby, and I have tried a lot of them!)&lt;br /&gt;3) Decent size for diaper bag and travel. It is light weight but holds a lot inside (you&#x27;ll be surprised how long they last!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) The only thing I wish was different was the cap... I wish it was attached to the tube and popped open, since it is useful to be able to do things with one hand when changing a diaper... these have a screw on lid, and can be inconvenient to screw open and close during the diaper change.. and if the lid gets lost then it makes the tube laying around unsanitary... but the vaseline itself is still really good so I would still get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to add, the customer service is amazing! The packaging has changed and they will update that soon, as told by the seller. when I ordered these, I did not know that the packaging changed (the brand on the tubes is now covidien instead of Kendall) however, Kendall is part of Covidien. So everything in the inside of the tubes is still exactly the same and the tubes look the same too (just different wording and design on the outside). I first thought that these were the wrong tubes when I received them and complained about them, however, the seller personally called me and assured me that these are the exact same ones as Kendall and the reason the outside design looks different. I actually looked this up, and it IS true, that Kendall is part of Covidien now. I highly appreciated how the seller took the time to regard my concern. Highly recommend these vaseline tubes, and no I am not being paid to write this review or related to the seller or the company in any way. I just really appreciate a good product that is worth themoney, and also honest and sincere customer service people, as I do a lot of online shopping.</li>
            <li> Took it to my dentist because he didn&#x27;t have any!  Said it was the first time in 21 years he&#x27;s had a patient bring him Vaseline.  Makes a huge difference when it&#x27;s used on the corner of your lips when having dental work done.  Take your own just in case the dentist doesn&#x27;t have any.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought one-packs of these tubes of petroleum jelly in the past, but just found this convenient (and much more economical) three pack. You get about double what you&#x27;d normally get in a store-bought vaseline tube, and the vaseline is the perfect mixture (not too hard, not too goopy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same stuff they use at the hospital, and for good reason; it&#x27;s high quality and high quantity-per-bottle. We use this for many things, including helping our baby&#x27;s poor chapped skin, healing chapped lips, and preventing a squirrel from climbing our bird feeder pole!</li>
            <li> Great deal compared to buying name brand in store,  most 2.5oz go for $4 for a single bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product compared to others does seem less dense and the has a bigger opening so u might use more product then a 2.5oz one bit still given the cost and 3, 3.5oz tubes makes it a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the nurses applied them to each clean diaper before putting on the diaper for my baby. They said it can prevent diaper rash. So far we have been using the Vaseline and my baby (almost 3 months) has not had diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Very easy to squeeze out of the tube without getting it on my fingers. Use to put on baby&#x27;s butt when changing the diaper.</li>
            <li> great, fast delivery! thanks!</li>
            <li> Does the job and I like the white a lot better than the off clear stuff that most stores carry.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I use these as a lubricant for rubber products (rings and washers) as well as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Awesome high grade vaseline!  Much smoother and less sticky than the junk in the store.  Highly recommend for under eyes too!</li>
            <li> I use it upon each diaper change. My baby this far did not get a rash and his skin in the area is always soft :-D.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brand because it was recommended at the hospital and I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li> There are some lumps in the first tube we ordered.  We have purchased this before with no problems.</li>
            <li> Please change the picture because the product I received is different.  I wanted to buy something like in the picture (&#x27;cause I&#x27;ve used them before),but got something different.  However, the product I received is white petroleum jelly.  Very fast delivery as expected because I&#x27;ve never had any issues with Amazon&#x27;s delivery.</li>
            <li> We use this to prevent diaper rash on our twins. The pediatrician recommended vaseline over the other rash creams (Desitin, Butt Paste, A&amp;D), and in general, it works really well. We like tubes over tubs because they&#x27;re more sanitary. This brand is just slightly more expensive than the tubes at Target per ounce, but this product is better... it comes out of the tube much more easily, is softer, and allows you to completely empty the tube without struggle. We&#x27;ve come back MANY times for more.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find tubes of vaseline, I use it every night on my face. But I hate having to clean under my finger nails everytime I dig into the tub because it makes a mess &amp; I read on my kindle every night so the last thing I need is grease on my fingertips to transfer onto the kindle screen. Even my husband likes not having to dig into the tub. Squeezing it from the tube is more sanitary anyways.</li>
            <li> Tough to find, easy to love, would be better with flip top caps for quick, sudden urgent uses... ummmm. Maybe that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> This medical grade petroleum jelly is wonderful for use on your skin.  Has a soothing healing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had skin cancers surgically removed and was given this type Petroleum Jelly to use to keep the area soft and promote healing.  It worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It is slightly lighter, both in color and texture, than the good old fashioned Vaseline, however, it is not worth the additional cost for me. I use large quantities of Vaseline as a moisturizer for my eczema, and I&#x27;ll get more for the money with good old fashioned Vaseline.</li>
            <li> My husband had a cancer removed from his arm. I had to change bandages 2 times a day and use a goodly amount of vaseline to keep it soft. This really worked well and was runny or messy. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this. It is smoother than the regular Vaseline and really works for cracked lips.</li>
