            <li>The product is great, but I should have checked the quantity.</li>
            <li>This stuff is GREAT.</li>
            <li>and she is happy as happy can be.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be good for people who travel, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love this sealant!</li>
            <li>Please get more!</li>
            <li>Great price, fast service!</li>
            <li>interesting.</li>
            <li>This PoliGrip works better on holding bottom dentures than others.  </li>
            <li>Should of read ad better.</li>
            <li>You will love the feel, oh and taste.</li>
            <li>Lock and seal is okay.</li>
            <li>good deal right?  </li>
            <li>I really cant give a good review</li>
            <li>These are the trial packs, not the full size product!  </li>
            <li>Full size in stores at well under $5!</li>
            <li>Product as described - quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Both this item and the item below, i.e. the strips, are adequate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but not worth the price people are asking for it now.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what a got!  </li>
            <li>Keeps my partial bridge nice and secure.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read it right.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this &amp;#34;for partials&amp;#34; formulation seems to hold better and longer than the standard Poligrip....</li>
            <li>I will repurchase at a better price and then review the actual product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The cost for these .75 oz tubes $7.33 is way to much money,I purchased 22 oz tube for $5.99 in the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am really disapointed.</li>
            <li>Should be able to give less than one star.</li>
            <li>I believe this might very well be the first time I&#x27;ve ever left a ONE STAR review on Amazon...</li>
            <li>I prefer this since the nozzle is small and I am able to locate the contents in the areas needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to handle small tubes.</li>
            <li>I found it works best for me by putting cold water in my mouth and rinse as I bite down to seal.</li>
            <li>It is high price for the Travel size, which I think should be stated on the discription next to the .075 oz.  </li>
            <li>This product is impossible to find, and I was so happy when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy like the regular sealants.</li>
            <li>Too little product for too much money.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My dentist recommended this product and i works really well; however,  I am having a hard time finding it in stores which carry Polygrip products  </li>
            <li> The product is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> You will have all day security that your partial are in place and</li>
            <li> But there are other products that may hold and seal longer.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed  very.</li>
            <li> I have referred Amazon to a few of my friends in reference to ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Before I was just using a product for false teeth and is was not sticky enough to keep them in place all day.</li>
            <li> Small for price</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot find it in local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a lot slower than usual.</li>
            <li> Tubes are small.</li>
            <li> Way small.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize that .75 oz was the small travel size tube</li>
            <li> I mean it, &amp;#34;go bite an apple&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY poor deal.</li>
            <li> TWO TRAVEL SIZE tubes of product for $11.00 which a price beyond ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> sorry I purchased it</li>
            <li> It is borderless and tasteless.</li>
            <li> I overpaid horribly considering the size of the tube.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not impressed  very. Small for price</li>
            <li> I love this sealant! Unfortunately I cannot find it in local stores anymore. It holds my partials in place all day. even when I chew gum! It&#x27;s not messy like the regular sealants. Please get more!</li>
            <li> These are the trial packs, not the full size product!  Since they have been discontinued, the price keeps going up and up...like buying GOLD!!  It&#x27;s a great product, but not worth the price people are asking for it now.</li>
            <li> The cost for these .75 oz tubes $7.33 is way to much money,I purchased 22 oz tube for $5.99 in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service!</li>
            <li> The product is great, but I should have checked the quantity. These tubes are tiny. They&#x27;d be good for people who travel, but I don&#x27;t. This product is impossible to find, and I was so happy when I saw it on Amazon. I overpaid horribly considering the size of the tube.</li>
            <li> Before I was just using a product for false teeth and is was not sticky enough to keep them in place all day. This stuff is GREAT. It works all day. has no taste or sliminess. I found it works best for me by putting cold water in my mouth and rinse as I bite down to seal. I hope they keep this on the market.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as expected. The shipping was a lot slower than usual. Kinda started wondering if it was ever gonna get here, but finally got it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I wish there was a &amp;#34;remover mouthwash&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Keeps my partial bridge nice and secure.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds like a vice!  In fact, this &amp;#34;for partials&amp;#34; formulation seems to hold better and longer than the standard Poligrip.... interesting.</li>
            <li> This PoliGrip works better on holding bottom dentures than others.  Easy to handle small tubes.</li>
            <li> It is high price for the Travel size, which I think should be stated on the discription next to the .075 oz.  I am really disapointed.</li>
            <li> Should be able to give less than one star. Beware that this is 2 travel size tubes. EXTREMELY poor deal. Full size in stores at well under $5!</li>
            <li> Too little product for too much money.</li>
            <li> Product as described - quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Should of read ad better. Tubes are small. Way small.</li>
            <li> Yes! I ordered it for my Aunt and she is happy as happy can be. I have referred Amazon to a few of my friends in reference to ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Both this item and the item below, i.e. the strips, are adequate.  I prefer this since the nozzle is small and I am able to locate the contents in the areas needed.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not find that this item and the item below lasts the length of time advertised.  It seems to be necessary for me to apply these items after every meal.</li>
            <li> Always works well. Wonderful product</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and i works really well; however,  I am having a hard time finding it in stores which carry Polygrip products  My dentist gave me two packages to start out, but I guess I will have to order online for anymore of this product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only place I can find the partials poligrip and i&#x27;m thankful.</li>
            <li> I believe this might very well be the first time I&#x27;ve ever left a ONE STAR review on Amazon...but this is definitely a \\&quot;BUYER BEWARE\\&quot; product, and deserves a one star.  I ordered this thinking I was buying two regular size tubes of adhesive for $11.00...good deal right?  NOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that .75 oz was the small travel size tube and that&#x27;s exactly what a got!  TWO TRAVEL SIZE tubes of product for $11.00 which a price beyond ridiculous!  I truly don&#x27;t know how the product works and can&#x27;t give a review to that as I&#x27;m returning the wayyyyyyyyyyyy over-priced items!  I will repurchase at a better price and then review the actual product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> sorry I purchased it but I have not used it. I really cant give a good review or I shouldnt even put a review.</li>
            <li> Packaging, product .........all very good</li>
            <li> The items were as advertised.  I didn&#x27;t read it right.  My fault.</li>
            <li> Good product. The adhesive holds longer and stronger. It is borderless and tasteless. You will have all day security that your partial are in place and when I say this I mean it, &amp;#34;go bite an apple&amp;#34;. You will love the feel, oh and taste.</li>
            <li> Lock and seal is okay. But there are other products that may hold and seal longer.  Keep trying until you find out what works for you. This helped me at one time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wish it was not out of production.  Something about Zink.</li>
