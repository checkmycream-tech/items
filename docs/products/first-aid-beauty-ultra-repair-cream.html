            <li>very very good for sensitive skin prone to rashes and ecxema..</li>
            <li>Feels okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking into purchasing more products from this line.</li>
            <li>It is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Glad it worked so well on others, but for me, it is not a re-order unless some miracle happens.</li>
            <li>I wrote a more lengthy review of the FAB Oatmeal Mask</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and adsorbed into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Not all the times, but more times than not.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I mostly like to use it on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>I have dermatitis that is more severe in the winter</li>
            <li>The price was better on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also love using it on my hands.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>This lotion is nice and rich.</li>
            <li>I even stopped by a Sephora in Seattle and asked for the best hydrating item to fix the dry skin</li>
            <li>Excellent for my dry chapped hands!  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff - pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your living environment clean, or take something to keep your allergies in check.smell), they seem to be working.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your living environment clean, or take something to keep your allergies in check.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use perfumy or strong smelling creams</li>
            <li>I have the full size of this product &amp; just love it</li>
            <li>The eye cream has fabulous reviews on Sephora.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>This leaves a slight tingly clean feeling and is a perfect thickness.</li>
            <li>I have 47-year old combination skin in good condition.</li>
            <li>Sexy, right?</li>
            <li>Love First Aid Beauty products.</li>
            <li>Great to have on hand all year long.</li>
            <li>This is a non-greasy lotion that absorbs easily, softens beautifully and has no harsh scent (for those of us with sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>It works great on dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>works great for my dry winter skin</li>
            <li>Very light scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I ordered the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream on a whim and honestly did not expect too much from it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many bottles or jars of 1/3 used (if that much) cream/moisturizer/lotion I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This is excellent face lotion for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You do have to reapply after each hand washing which is why we burn through this so quickly.</li>
            <li>Although my doctor has prescribed steroid creams which over time can cause other issues, I need something else that is safe and effective.  </li>
            <li>When I feel the flare-up first coming on, I used a dab of this cream and my skin was calm by morning and the crisis (and pain) was averted!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, works fast to soften and moisturize dry parched skin.</li>
            <li>Ever since I have begun using this cream, my skin has stayed a lot smoother and seems to actually have healed (amazing</li>
            <li>so it will calm redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li>I like this kind smaller one for I</li>
            <li>I rarely have a skin issue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great bargain at such a low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how my skin will react to it in the long-term, but thus far (in spite of the pad&#x27;s strong herbal smell), they seem to be working.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>When this first came on the market I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more like a body lotion than facial cream</li>
            <li>When I first got it (and did not know its limitations)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for that difficult time of month, will order again.</li>
            <li>My only reason for 4 Stars is the price per ounce and that you can&#x27;t get more than 2 ounces in a tube.</li>
            <li>Seems to have more natural ingredients than many other creams.</li>
            <li>There is no better cream on the market as good as First Aid Beauty.</li>
            <li>Love this cream but for my face it seems a little too rich.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any kind of special skin problem, only my elbows are extremely dry and the skin is like a scrub brush.  </li>
            <li>i liked it at first, but after a few days i started to break out from it, plus it just didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as it claims.</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce the redness from my acne wash.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>has really turned my skin around.</li>
            <li>have also started using a free sample of the FAB Facial Radiance Pads.</li>
            <li>but it turns out it is really just an all-around cream that can be used all over your body.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out, hydrates very well.</li>
            <li>but dunno if any better than other skin products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it worked for other people.</li>
            <li>Let me put it this way - my hands looked like the belonged to a woman 30 years older than I really am.</li>
            <li>For those with obvious skin problems, I would defer to those reviews addressing specific concerns - Most of them seem very favorable.</li>
            <li>This is my new fav handcream!  </li>
            <li>The skin more or less got an &amp;#34;antique oil painting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it just a little more sparingly.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m not going out into the cold wind and just staying at home, or for the night, it is sufficient and feels very good</li>
            <li>No complaint there.  </li>
            <li>I tried SO many things, mostly natural products, when I finally gave in and started to look for a commercial</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have pretty much the same results.  </li>
            <li>Normal hand lotions will break out my face if I touch it while sleeping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, it&#x27;s creamy and low in fragrance and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>My skin is SUPER dry.  </li>
            <li>I love that this cream helps subside the dry patches around my nose, it&#x27;s really helpful especially for this allergy season, overall</li>
            <li>I have gone to multiple doctors, and none have been able to offer a solution that worked, other than the hydrocortisone cream/ointment.</li>
            <li>Funny - I thought this was a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial moisturizers that are much more expensive, and prefer this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and rich without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rough, ultra-dry, hard and cracking skin is much, much smoother now, and best of all this effect is not just temporary (as in &#x27;for a few hours after application&#x27;).</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on my fingers and over the years have tried a wide range of creams and ointments.</li>
            <li>Glad I got the smaller container should last a long time.</li>
            <li>First aid detox eye roller was recommended on the Dr Oz show because it helps WRINKLES not dark circles because it has an ingredient in it on his \\&quot;SHORT</li>
            <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t have the money to shell out for the large jar, the two ounce bottle lasts over a month with twice daily usage.</li>
            <li>I have been using this less than a week and am seeing a significant difference in dryness on my face.</li>
            <li>so when I say sensitive</li>
            <li>Completely broke me out</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eczema and cystic acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>really, really like this cream and have already ordered the larger size.</li>
            <li>so sensitive skin will like this as well.</li>
            <li>Even now that I&#x27;m off Accutane my skin is just too sensitive for this stuff.</li>
            <li>i have Photorejuvenation Surgery several years ago, and my skin was damage by the ray, left some red spots on my face, after using this product, i can tell there is a big improve, making me look more natural.</li>
            <li>But after having used it now several times daily for a number of weeks I am very positively surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have a couple of elbows that could use some help ;-}&lt;br /&gt;After I use this for a little while and if it continues to be as effective as it is now, I will try some of their other products.  </li>
            <li>Smells slightly of plastic, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I am constantly washing my hands at work and my skin gets super dry, like lizard skin.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how quickly this repaired my dry skin - literally all the flaky patches are gone and I only applied it on my face overnight.</li>
            <li>I saw this stuff on a home shopping network, apparently they have sales twice a year on it with big oversized tubs, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li>It really feels like a miracle, after struggling with eczema for so long.</li>
            <li>This face cream is very soothing for dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing healing cream, I will buy bigger size definitely!</li>
            <li>Non irritating and simple moisturizer good for my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>- no other cream has achieved that before, including CeraVe).</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it on my face and hands, but intend to do my legs and feet also.  </li>
            <li>For the first few days of using it, my skin still felt a little itchy and red, though I think this was an effect of getting off the hydrocortisone cream (which seems to have addictive affects), but after that, my skin has drastically reduced in redness and rawness, lost its itchiness, and has become smooth, soft, and resilient (as opposed to the fragile, papery feeling it had with hydrocortisone creams).</li>
            <li>Now this is not a problem anymore and what was once hard and callused is now smooth and almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and it is always so dry.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry itch skin.</li>
            <li>it stings a little at first</li>
            <li>it is very simple, not moisturizing enough for east coast winters.. but definitely soothing and calming for my sensitive allery-prone skin..</li>
            <li>and it immediately fixed the dry skin area on my face.</li>
            <li>My hands get really dry, especially in the winter, always trying to find something that makes them soft and not feel like paper.  </li>

            <li> The price was better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also love using it on my hands.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and rich.</li>
            <li> I even stopped by a Sephora in Seattle and asked for the best hydrating item to fix the dry skin</li>
            <li> Excellent for my dry chapped hands!  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff - pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep your living environment clean, or take something to keep your allergies in check.smell), they seem to be working.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep your living environment clean, or take something to keep your allergies in check.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use perfumy or strong smelling creams</li>
            <li> I have the full size of this product &amp; just love it</li>
            <li> The eye cream has fabulous reviews on Sephora.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> This leaves a slight tingly clean feeling and is a perfect thickness.</li>
            <li> I have 47-year old combination skin in good condition.</li>
            <li> Sexy, right?</li>
            <li> Love First Aid Beauty products.</li>
            <li> Great to have on hand all year long.</li>
            <li> This is a non-greasy lotion that absorbs easily, softens beautifully and has no harsh scent (for those of us with sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> It works great on dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> works great for my dry winter skin</li>
            <li> Very light scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I ordered the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream on a whim and honestly did not expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many bottles or jars of 1/3 used (if that much) cream/moisturizer/lotion I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This is excellent face lotion for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You do have to reapply after each hand washing which is why we burn through this so quickly.</li>
            <li> Although my doctor has prescribed steroid creams which over time can cause other issues, I need something else that is safe and effective.  </li>
            <li> When I feel the flare-up first coming on, I used a dab of this cream and my skin was calm by morning and the crisis (and pain) was averted!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, works fast to soften and moisturize dry parched skin.</li>
            <li> Ever since I have begun using this cream, my skin has stayed a lot smoother and seems to actually have healed (amazing</li>
            <li> so it will calm redness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> I like this kind smaller one for I</li>
            <li> I rarely have a skin issue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great bargain at such a low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how my skin will react to it in the long-term, but thus far (in spite of the pad&#x27;s strong herbal smell), they seem to be working.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> When this first came on the market I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more like a body lotion than facial cream</li>
            <li> When I first got it (and did not know its limitations)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for that difficult time of month, will order again.</li>
            <li> My only reason for 4 Stars is the price per ounce and that you can&#x27;t get more than 2 ounces in a tube.</li>
            <li> Seems to have more natural ingredients than many other creams.</li>
            <li> There is no better cream on the market as good as First Aid Beauty.</li>
            <li> Love this cream but for my face it seems a little too rich.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any kind of special skin problem, only my elbows are extremely dry and the skin is like a scrub brush.  </li>
            <li> i liked it at first, but after a few days i started to break out from it, plus it just didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as it claims.</li>
            <li> It really helps reduce the redness from my acne wash.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> has really turned my skin around.</li>
            <li> have also started using a free sample of the FAB Facial Radiance Pads.</li>
            <li> but it turns out it is really just an all-around cream that can be used all over your body.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> but dunno if any better than other skin products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it worked for other people.</li>
            <li> Let me put it this way - my hands looked like the belonged to a woman 30 years older than I really am.</li>
            <li> For those with obvious skin problems, I would defer to those reviews addressing specific concerns - Most of them seem very favorable.</li>
            <li> This is my new fav handcream!  </li>
            <li> The skin more or less got an &amp;#34;antique oil painting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a decent lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it just a little more sparingly.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m not going out into the cold wind and just staying at home, or for the night, it is sufficient and feels very good</li>
            <li> No complaint there.  </li>
            <li> I tried SO many things, mostly natural products, when I finally gave in and started to look for a commercial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have pretty much the same results.  </li>
            <li> Normal hand lotions will break out my face if I touch it while sleeping.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, it&#x27;s creamy and low in fragrance and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER dry.  </li>
            <li> I love that this cream helps subside the dry patches around my nose, it&#x27;s really helpful especially for this allergy season, overall</li>
            <li> I have gone to multiple doctors, and none have been able to offer a solution that worked, other than the hydrocortisone cream/ointment.</li>
            <li> Funny - I thought this was a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial moisturizers that are much more expensive, and prefer this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, and rich without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rough, ultra-dry, hard and cracking skin is much, much smoother now, and best of all this effect is not just temporary (as in &#x27;for a few hours after application&#x27;).</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my fingers and over the years have tried a wide range of creams and ointments.</li>
            <li> Glad I got the smaller container should last a long time.</li>
            <li> First aid detox eye roller was recommended on the Dr Oz show because it helps WRINKLES not dark circles because it has an ingredient in it on his \\&quot;SHORT</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t have the money to shell out for the large jar, the two ounce bottle lasts over a month with twice daily usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this less than a week and am seeing a significant difference in dryness on my face.</li>
            <li> so when I say sensitive</li>
            <li> Completely broke me out</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eczema and cystic acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> really, really like this cream and have already ordered the larger size.</li>
            <li> so sensitive skin will like this as well.</li>
            <li> Even now that I&#x27;m off Accutane my skin is just too sensitive for this stuff.</li>
            <li> i have Photorejuvenation Surgery several years ago, and my skin was damage by the ray, left some red spots on my face, after using this product, i can tell there is a big improve, making me look more natural.</li>
            <li> But after having used it now several times daily for a number of weeks I am very positively surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have a couple of elbows that could use some help ;-}&lt;br /&gt;After I use this for a little while and if it continues to be as effective as it is now, I will try some of their other products.  </li>
            <li> Smells slightly of plastic, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands at work and my skin gets super dry, like lizard skin.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how quickly this repaired my dry skin - literally all the flaky patches are gone and I only applied it on my face overnight.</li>
            <li> I saw this stuff on a home shopping network, apparently they have sales twice a year on it with big oversized tubs, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li> It really feels like a miracle, after struggling with eczema for so long.</li>
            <li> This face cream is very soothing for dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing healing cream, I will buy bigger size definitely!</li>
            <li> Non irritating and simple moisturizer good for my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> - no other cream has achieved that before, including CeraVe).</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it on my face and hands, but intend to do my legs and feet also.  </li>
            <li> For the first few days of using it, my skin still felt a little itchy and red, though I think this was an effect of getting off the hydrocortisone cream (which seems to have addictive affects), but after that, my skin has drastically reduced in redness and rawness, lost its itchiness, and has become smooth, soft, and resilient (as opposed to the fragile, papery feeling it had with hydrocortisone creams).</li>
            <li> Now this is not a problem anymore and what was once hard and callused is now smooth and almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and it is always so dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry itch skin.</li>
            <li> it stings a little at first</li>
            <li> it is very simple, not moisturizing enough for east coast winters.. but definitely soothing and calming for my sensitive allery-prone skin..</li>
            <li> and it immediately fixed the dry skin area on my face.</li>
            <li> My hands get really dry, especially in the winter, always trying to find something that makes them soft and not feel like paper.  </li>
            <li> This cream also healed several dry patches that no other lotion had helped at all.</li>
            <li> bought this after considering a few creams, and about two weeks into using First Aid, the dry patch on my face is GONE</li>
            <li> Other things to use in also People Watch Magazine on the DR oz show were a total of the above, MST Miracle Skin Transformer for cover up and dark circles, skin spf protection, covers redness for a foundation and moisturizes, the ZENO HOTSPOT for pimples and blemishes, and Touchback Hair Color Marker can save you money on greys at the hair dresser and is a fast morning fix when needed.</li>
            <li> been using it for about a month and a half and so far NO ROSACEA!  </li>
            <li> Have tried numerous creams for my extremely dry hands and this is the only product that has worked!</li>
            <li> This also can provide instant, soothing relief to dry skin thats itching.</li>
            <li> seems to halt itching for a few and leaves the skin VERY soft.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this is any more expensive than other drugstore moisturizers</li>
            <li> I used to have extremely dry and red hands, and a dry, scaly patch on my face that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> These tended to make my skin flare up and become extremely itchy or swollen, left my skin oily and pimply, or just left my skin dry.</li>
            <li> face is definitely brighter and whiter (less red) after this cream..</li>
            <li> I have a little patch of dry red skin on my face, applied this several times</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone with dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry feet and legs</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed by my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a health problem that makes a person prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is too dry for this cream.  </li>
            <li> If you have slightly dry skin, this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> I use this is on the driest of dry areas of my face and it does help.</li>
            <li> I have had really dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li> Every single time I buy this, I buy the 2oz.</li>
            <li> I visited him last week and his hands were noticeably softer and less cracked.</li>
            <li> the spot was noticeably less red and already looks to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> I put it on like I would any typical face cream and was left with a whitish, chalky complexion.</li>
            <li> and I still have a little patch of dry red skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands from continual washing.  </li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m washing my hands a lot, and I often get very dry cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my husband and I are considering starting a family, I really wanted to stop using the hydrocortisone cream (which is a steroid cream), in case it has any ill effects on the baby during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days, so</li>
            <li> so there is absolutely no &amp;#34;cosmetic elegance&amp;#34; to this product.</li>
            <li> A brand recommended by DR OZ on his show due to an ingredient that works in them that people are missing but actually helps over time.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the past few months and this one, recommended by a friend, seemed to actually do the job.  </li>
            <li> the cold climate really caused my skin to dry out like crazy; particularly around my nose, it was flaking no matter how much exfoliating I did with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I see my few wrinkles far less with this cream than I do with some expensive, high end moisturizers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Some were pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in an environment with a lot of dust, pollen, dander, mold, or other allergens, my skin immediately acts up, regardless of what products I use.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in an environment with a lot of dust, pollen, dander, mold, or other allergens, my skin immediately acts up, regardless of what products I use.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy the 6 oz jar, and would also like to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have some parched skin problem, especially in dry weather.</li>
            <li> It did not leave my face feeling greasy and did not smell odd.</li>
            <li> It clears up flaking and any tight feeling</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and I can put on makeup within a few minutes without worrying about a greasy feel and it seems to make my skin look clearer and have less redness.</li>
            <li> I just received this a few weeks ago and am amazed that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel so soft without feeling any weird residue</li>
            <li> Anyway, after a few applications my hands were miraculous healed.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s plain, but it works),</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get five stars because it has a very slight medical/chemical odor upon application, which fades.</li>
            <li> I was suffering with a really dry, painful face likely due to the change in seasons...</li>
            <li> I was also developing a small psoriasis spot on my wrist and after leaving this cream on it for a few hours</li>
            <li> I have had eczema on my face, neck, arms, and legs for the past 15 years, and have relied heavily on hydrocortisone creams to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with it, if it weren&#x27;t such trouble to return it, I would.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I get a bad case of rosacea and this cream has really helped me get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I bought the small tube to try it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; me, but it seems to have.  </li>
            <li> so I layer it with serum and other creams for those cold dry winters..</li>
            <li> I use it daily after a shower and after cucumber toner, and again at night after a cold water splash cleansing.</li>
            <li> Does not feel oily or too thick.</li>
            <li> That explains the texture - thick but not at all silky.</li>
            <li> I feel less self-conscious, and my hands aren&#x27;t painful from being so dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Anxious to see how over time this helps him!</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Sephora, but saw it on Amazon for $9!</li>
            <li> My hands were red and cracked so painful and tender, probably from the cold weather and dry heat.</li>
            <li> Before that, I could never even rub my eyes because the skin on my knuckles was so bad that it actually injured my eye lids when rubbing.</li>
            <li> Very thick but not oily.</li>
            <li> I mean it!</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night before bed and it decreased the peeling.</li>
            <li> This replaced vitamin E oil for me, which was difficult to apply an felt oily.</li>
            <li> It sounds silly, but this cream is truly transformational.</li>
            <li> and I ended up purchasing expensive products that did not help at all.</li>
            <li> I could hardly apply any makeup over it, and it looked flaky and terrible.</li>
            <li> it was getting so bad</li>
            <li> My grandpa has horribly cracked hands.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Feels okay but dunno if any better than other skin products.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality moisturizer. Non irritating and simple moisturizer good for my sensitive dry skin. I have rosacea and eczema plus dryness so when I say sensitive I mean it! This has helped seal in my more expensive serums (truth serum by ole h.) and I&#x27;m super happy!!!</li>
            <li> I have the full size of this product &amp; just love it so when I was going on vacation I thought this would be the perfect size to take with me &amp; it was.</li>
            <li> Love this cream but for my face it seems a little too rich. Helped out with the rosacea problems I was having and I could see a difference in some acne scarring I have but it did seem to cause me to break out a bit. I&#x27;ll keep using it just a little more sparingly. Glad I got the smaller container should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and rich. It really helps reduce the redness from my acne wash. It&#x27;s a great bargain at such a low price. I recommend it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Was told about this product by my daughter.  It works great on dry flaky skin.  Would recommend it to anyone with dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Have tried numerous creams for my extremely dry hands and this is the only product that has worked!</li>
            <li> Completely broke me out</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this works well! Very thick but not oily. I think it would be good for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> A brand recommended by DR OZ on his show due to an ingredient that works in them that people are missing but actually helps over time. See his web site on stuff. First aid detox eye roller was recommended on the Dr Oz show because it helps WRINKLES not dark circles because it has an ingredient in it on his \\&quot;SHORT CUTS\\&quot; episode last week the ingredient numbs the muscles to help it.  Other things to use in also People Watch Magazine on the DR oz show were a total of the above, MST Miracle Skin Transformer for cover up and dark circles, skin spf protection, covers redness for a foundation and moisturizes, the ZENO HOTSPOT for pimples and blemishes, and Touchback Hair Color Marker can save you money on greys at the hair dresser and is a fast morning fix when needed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many bottles or jars of 1/3 used (if that much) cream/moisturizer/lotion I have purchased. Some were pretty expensive. I used every bit of this and loved it. I can&#x27;t use perfumy or strong smelling creams/lotions b/c of migraines and this did not have that.  I have dry feet and legs and this was very nice to use every night after my bath or shower. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I love that this cream helps subside the dry patches around my nose, it&#x27;s really helpful especially for this allergy season, overall it&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells very good and it helped my hands but I don&#x27;t think is a five star product</li>
            <li> i have Photorejuvenation Surgery several years ago, and my skin was damage by the ray, left some red spots on my face, after using this product, i can tell there is a big improve, making me look more natural.</li>
            <li> This replaced vitamin E oil for me, which was difficult to apply an felt oily. This stuff is great, applies easily, feels great, and has no scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I just received this a few weeks ago and am amazed that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It moisturizes without being greasy or causing breakouts.  So far I have only used it on my face and hands, but intend to do my legs and feet also.  I also have a couple of elbows that could use some help ;-}&lt;br /&gt;After I use this for a little while and if it continues to be as effective as it is now, I will try some of their other products.  Thinking of the eye roller to try next.  This is a really nice product line.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it. It&#x27;s not greasy which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> My grandpa has horribly cracked hands. I bought this for him to repair his hands and he really likes it! I visited him last week and his hands were noticeably softer and less cracked. Anxious to see how over time this helps him!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have, what I call, \\&quot;crunchy elbows\\&quot; and this did nothing for it.  I don&#x27;t have any kind of special skin problem, only my elbows are extremely dry and the skin is like a scrub brush.  I was so hopeful but this didn&#x27;t do it.  Oh well, back to the drawing board.  I have very dry hands from continual washing.  This didn&#x27;t even do anything for that problem either.  The seller did a very good job, though.  No complaint there.  It came to me in timely fashion and was in good condition.  It&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault I didn&#x27;t get results.  Just wanted to give my review.  I&#x27;m glad it worked for other people.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this well over a year ago and it says it can be used on the face so I tried it and loved it. Its not greasy and I see my few wrinkles far less with this cream than I do with some expensive, high end moisturizers I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eczema and cystic acne prone skin. This is the only cream product that doesn&#x27;t break me out. Or the radiance pads counteract whatever in this that may break me out. Also, if you don&#x27;t have the money to shell out for the large jar, the two ounce bottle lasts over a month with twice daily usage. A little goes a long way with this stuff. I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t absorb well if your skin is moist when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love First Aid Beauty products.</li>
            <li> Every single time I buy this, I buy the 2oz. tube... BUT WHO AM I KIDDING? This stuff is great. Making big changes and going all out next purchase with the 32 oz tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really need this stuff this winter -- you saved me~ Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used to have extremely dry and red hands, and a dry, scaly patch on my face that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Let me put it this way - my hands looked like the belonged to a woman 30 years older than I really am. I was embarrassed by my dry skin. I tried SO many things, mostly natural products, when I finally gave in and started to look for a commercial product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after considering a few creams, and about two weeks into using First Aid, the dry patch on my face is GONE and my hands are the smoothest they have ever been. It sounds silly, but this cream is truly transformational. I feel less self-conscious, and my hands aren&#x27;t painful from being so dry anymore. Try it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cream, non-greasy, non-scented.  I&#x27;ve been using it several times a day on the back of my old-lady hands, and it has improved the overall dryness and crepe-y appearance.  But, I suspect if I used a less-expensive product as regularly as I&#x27;m using this (because it is somewhat pricey) I&#x27;d have pretty much the same results.  For those with obvious skin problems, I would defer to those reviews addressing specific concerns - Most of them seem very favorable.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream. I have a health problem that makes a person prone to dry skin. The cream works well wherever I use it. Seems to have more natural ingredients than many other creams.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands at work and my skin gets super dry, like lizard skin. I have tried every hand lotion out there and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I usually buy it at Sephora, but saw it on Amazon for $9! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. It did wonders for my hands in the freezing winter. It&#x27;s not greasy, and you can move on with daily activities immediately after use.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer and a great cooling feeling. Seems to brighten my face and plump my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say it is so good,especially for the price. It is so good for whose skin is not so good. I like this kind smaller one for I have to take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the past few months and this one, recommended by a friend, seemed to actually do the job.  Just order a larger tub to keep using it until the deep cracks on my feet are all healed.</li>
            <li> My skin is too dry for this cream.  If you have slightly dry skin, this will work for you.  I didnt do enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, I tend to buy it in the jar size. It&#x27;s gentle, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I use it on my face and I can put on makeup within a few minutes without worrying about a greasy feel and it seems to make my skin look clearer and have less redness. This cream also healed several dry patches that no other lotion had helped at all. This also can provide instant, soothing relief to dry skin thats itching. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Will be repurchasing!!! Amazing product</li>
            <li> THIS WORKED WONDERS! I recently went on vacation to Washington state (I&#x27;m from Houston) and the cold climate really caused my skin to dry out like crazy; particularly around my nose, it was flaking no matter how much exfoliating I did with my Clarisonic. I even stopped by a Sephora in Seattle and asked for the best hydrating item to fix the dry skin and I ended up purchasing expensive products that did not help at all. Finally, after looking at reviews, I tried this and it immediately fixed the dry skin area on my face. It did not leave my face feeling greasy and did not smell odd.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother...just like any cream you would buy at a drug store, even a no name brand.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my fingers and over the years have tried a wide range of creams and ointments. I ordered the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream on a whim and honestly did not expect too much from it. But after having used it now several times daily for a number of weeks I am very positively surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rough, ultra-dry, hard and cracking skin is much, much smoother now, and best of all this effect is not just temporary (as in &#x27;for a few hours after application&#x27;). Ever since I have begun using this cream, my skin has stayed a lot smoother and seems to actually have healed (amazing - no other cream has achieved that before, including CeraVe). Before that, I could never even rub my eyes because the skin on my knuckles was so bad that it actually injured my eye lids when rubbing. Now this is not a problem anymore and what was once hard and callused is now smooth and almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really like this cream and have already ordered the larger size. I am so grateful that I will not need to use the steroid ointment my dermatologist prescribed. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because my skin would not stop peeling. I live in Texas and it is always so dry. I use this cream every night before bed and it decreased the peeling. I also like to use it on my hands before bed. Normal hand lotions will break out my face if I touch it while sleeping. I&#x27;m looking into purchasing more products from this line. The eye cream has fabulous reviews on Sephora.</li>
            <li> BELIEVE ALL OF THE REVIEWS OF GREATNESS!  I have psoriasis and eczema.  When I feel the flare-up first coming on, I used a dab of this cream and my skin was calm by morning and the crisis (and pain) was averted!  So good!  I bought the small tube to try it out and now I&#x27;ll be going back and purchasing the larger size!</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s a lot of hype around this lotion, but honestly I didn&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I get a bad case of rosacea and this cream has really helped me get it under control.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for about a month and a half and so far NO ROSACEA!  it stings a little at first but it works,  and&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this is a really good cream. i like how it works for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. seems to halt itching for a few and leaves the skin VERY soft.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff - it feels refreshing when I put it on and I think it helps keep the eczema I have under my eyes at bay. Some lotions burn, this one does not.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very light scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> very very good for sensitive skin prone to rashes and ecxema.. face is definitely brighter and whiter (less red) after this cream.. it is very simple, not moisturizing enough for east coast winters.. but definitely soothing and calming for my sensitive allery-prone skin.. so I layer it with serum and other creams for those cold dry winters.. but if I&#x27;m not going out into the cold wind and just staying at home, or for the night, it is sufficient and feels very good</li>
            <li> My hands get really dry, especially in the winter, always trying to find something that makes them soft and not feel like paper.  I saw this stuff on a home shopping network, apparently they have sales twice a year on it with big oversized tubs, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  Saw it on Amazon,and ordered the 2 oz size to try it.  Honestly, it isn&#x27;t any better than anything else I have tried and not as good as  Working Hands. It is just OK.  No feeling of &amp;#34;ahhhhh..&amp;#34; when I apply it and I find I have to apply it again and again.  I have a little patch of dry red skin on my face, applied this several times and I still have a little patch of dry red skin on my face.  Glad it worked so well on others, but for me, it is not a re-order unless some miracle happens.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my dry chapped hands!  This is a non-greasy lotion that absorbs easily, softens beautifully and has no harsh scent (for those of us with sensitive skin).  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel so soft without feeling any weird residue</li>
            <li> I was suffering with a really dry, painful face likely due to the change in seasons...it was getting so bad I could hardly apply any makeup over it, and it looked flaky and terrible. I read about this product on Amazon and picked it up in a pinch at Sephora last night. I am amazed at how quickly this repaired my dry skin - literally all the flaky patches are gone and I only applied it on my face overnight. I was also developing a small psoriasis spot on my wrist and after leaving this cream on it for a few hours the spot was noticeably less red and already looks to be disappearing. Amazing stuff - pricey but totally worth it. I will be buying this regularly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this less than a week and am seeing a significant difference in dryness on my face. Love it! I use it at night and during the day. This leaves a slight tingly clean feeling and is a perfect thickness. Does not feel oily or too thick. Some people were complaining about the price but I don&#x27;t think this is any more expensive than other drugstore moisturizers</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not too light. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It doesn&#x27;t get five stars because it has a very slight medical/chemical odor upon application, which fades. I use this moisturizer at night after washing my face. I use a moisturizer with sunscreen in the morning. Note:  I have 47-year old combination skin in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for sensitive skin that is prone to dermatitis. I wrote a more lengthy review of the FAB Oatmeal Mask so I won&#x27;t wax on and on here. But this is a great product. I use it daily after a shower and after cucumber toner, and again at night after a cold water splash cleansing. My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This is an Excellent product.  It does exactly as advertised. It goes on smooth and adsorbed into the skin nicely. I re Purchased in the larger size. This size is great for pocket book.</li>
            <li> This is a neat lotion. The part of me who loves to buy natural is very happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, it&#x27;s creamy and low in fragrance and the price is right. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is it seems to make my skin red. Not all the times, but more times than not. Because of this, I mostly like to use it on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema on my face, neck, arms, and legs for the past 15 years, and have relied heavily on hydrocortisone creams to keep it under control. Every so often, since I was concerned about the effects of the hydrocortisone on my body, I would try to switch to a &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; lotion from a brand such as Eucerin (including aquaphor), Neosporin, or Aveeno. These tended to make my skin flare up and become extremely itchy or swollen, left my skin oily and pimply, or just left my skin dry. I have gone to multiple doctors, and none have been able to offer a solution that worked, other than the hydrocortisone cream/ointment. Though they did suggest using body oil, I do not like the feeling of oil on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my husband and I are considering starting a family, I really wanted to stop using the hydrocortisone cream (which is a steroid cream), in case it has any ill effects on the baby during pregnancy. After tons of searching, I finally found this repair cream, read the reviews, and thought I would give it a try. For the first few days of using it, my skin still felt a little itchy and red, though I think this was an effect of getting off the hydrocortisone cream (which seems to have addictive affects), but after that, my skin has drastically reduced in redness and rawness, lost its itchiness, and has become smooth, soft, and resilient (as opposed to the fragile, papery feeling it had with hydrocortisone creams). It really feels like a miracle, after struggling with eczema for so long. This product, coupled with vaseline lip therapy for my lips (it&#x27;s plain, but it works), has really turned my skin around. I have now purchased the larger pot of the FAB Ultra Repair Cream, and can&#x27;t be happier with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also started using a free sample of the FAB Facial Radiance Pads. I have only been using it for a few days, so I don&#x27;t know how my skin will react to it in the long-term, but thus far (in spite of the pad&#x27;s strong herbal smell), they seem to be working. I only use one at night, and I wake up with glow-y, silky, moisturized skin (even though I don&#x27;t put on the cream after I use the pad). This is amazing for someone who has dealt with eczema forever, and is used to waking up with flaking, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember, it is also really important to make sure your allergies are under control! If I&#x27;m in an environment with a lot of dust, pollen, dander, mold, or other allergens, my skin immediately acts up, regardless of what products I use. Make sure you keep your living environment clean, or take something to keep your allergies in check.smell), they seem to be working.

            <li> This stuff is great, works fast to soften and moisturize dry parched skin. I use it on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> this stuff is overrated.  i liked it at first, but after a few days i started to break out from it, plus it just didn&#x27;t moisturize as much as it claims.</li>
            <li> I have some parched skin problem, especially in dry weather. The skin more or less got an &amp;#34;antique oil painting&amp;#34; feeling. This cream is very effective for solving that problem. After using just a couple of days, I can already see the results. And the price is very reasonable. I am going to buy the 6 oz jar, and would also like to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  My skin is SUPER dry.  This feels so good!</li>
            <li> This product for me was just there for me. I did not notice a great difference in my skin. May work for others but nothing great occurred for me.</li>
            <li> Hyped. This is a decent lotion. That is all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hand cream upon recommendation from my doctor who uses it before going to bed.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs pretty quickly.  Despite the fact that it says odorless, it does have a subtle eucalyptus/vicks vap-o-rub smell, but it quickly dissipates after it absorbs.  I have dermatitis that is more severe in the winter or if I&#x27;m washing my hands a lot, and I often get very dry cracked skin.  Although my doctor has prescribed steroid creams which over time can cause other issues, I need something else that is safe and effective.  This cream helps a lot with the itching and cracks because it soothes.</li>
            <li> I was plagued with eczema for years and tried everything under the sun both over the counter and prescription.  Nothing worked and it was on my face which led to problems with my self confidence.  When this first came on the market I decided to give it a try and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It works on my face like nothing else has and since I started using it I rarely have a skin issue.  I&#x27;m not sure how it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; me, but it seems to have.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family and anyone that has tried it loves it too.  Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one!</li>
            <li> I bought it based on wonderful reviews, and do not regret it. Very moisturizing healing cream, I will buy bigger size definitely!</li>
            <li> There is no better cream on the market as good as First Aid Beauty. My hands were red and cracked so painful and tender, probably from the cold weather and dry heat. Anyway, after a few applications my hands were miraculous healed. This product is my savior. I keep this tube in my pocketbook at all times.</li>
            <li> I use this is on the driest of dry areas of my face and it does help. It clears up flaking and any tight feeling I get around the super-dry areas on my chin and my cheeks. Funny - I thought this was a facial moisturizer but it turns out it is really just an all-around cream that can be used all over your body. That explains the texture - thick but not at all silky. It&#x27;s much more like a body lotion than facial cream so there is absolutely no &amp;#34;cosmetic elegance&amp;#34; to this product. When I first got it (and did not know its limitations) I put it on like I would any typical face cream and was left with a whitish, chalky complexion. Sexy, right? Haha. Oh well. Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is perfect for spot treatments and areas of irritation anywhere you have them. It has colloidal oatmeal so it will calm redness and itchiness. It is inexpensive and has no scent so sensitive skin will like this as well. Great to have on hand all year long.</li>
            <li> This is excellent face lotion for dry, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s gentle, and rich without being too heavy. I&#x27;ve tried many facial moisturizers that are much more expensive, and prefer this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry itch skin. this stuff is great. Stops the itchiness and does not irritate my skin. I use it as a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with it, if it weren&#x27;t such trouble to return it, I would.</li>
            <li> I have had really dry skin this winter. This product was recommended to me at Sephora. The price was better on Amazon. Little goes a long way. Adds great moisture to my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, it irritated my face. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion! Great for my sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout. I also love using it on my hands. Just a great mosturizer! Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my skin while on Accutane. Didn&#x27;t work for me and in fact burned my skin. Even now that I&#x27;m off Accutane my skin is just too sensitive for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this b/c another reviewer claimed it helped with acne. Well I don&#x27;t know if it has reduced my acne but it definitely helps with the roseacia-like symptoms I get about a week each month. Plus it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s perfect for that difficult time of month, will order again.</li>
            <li> works great for my dry winter skin I went back and ordered the big container will order again. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is my new fav handcream!  Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My only reason for 4 Stars is the price per ounce and that you can&#x27;t get more than 2 ounces in a tube. I also have the 6 ounce jar but am not a fan of getting lotion from a jar. It gets under your nails and also seems unsanitary. If they come up with a 5-ounce tube I&#x27;d happily go up to 5 stars. The product is virtually unscented and isn&#x27;t greasy. You do have to reapply after each hand washing which is why we burn through this so quickly.</li>
            <li> Re-Purchase. LOVE this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t break me out, hydrates very well. Smells slightly of plastic, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I have bought at Sephora.  The packaging is a bit different because some of the wording is in French.  This face cream is very soothing for dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on elbows!</li>
