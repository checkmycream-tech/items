            <li>Pretty interesting watches, lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>Cool watches for my daughters.</li>
            <li>They look cool, but do not keep time.</li>
            <li>These two watches are really very sweet an unusual.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited after reading some really positive reviews</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still a good 1 inch of the straps (half inch on both sides) that I can pull together to make it fit right.</li>
            <li>Stopped working pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>4 stars because they are really pretty.</li>

            <li>but it has a funny smell that won&#x27;t go away</li>

            <li>Arrived fast and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Very fashionable.</li>
            <li>one of the watches looks better than the other.</li>
            <li>It worked very well because there are two snaps for a small and a medium fit -- and the leather smell reminded my granddaughter of her saddle and her pony.  </li>
            <li>Fixed easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recived these veryyy early .</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with a soft band because my joints sometimes hurt.  </li>
            <li>These were a real bargain, however one of the watches is a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in that you cannot tell the hour exactly.</li>
            <li>The watches arrived much sooner than expected and are nicer than the picture.</li>
            <li>One of them was losing time, the other one doesn&#x27;t work at all even with a new battery.</li>

            <li> Crack was most likely due to poor packaging.  </li>
            <li> but the glue will prevent it and your watch will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Beads cheap...took a long time to arrived</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn for long, but seems like it will hold up for a long while.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to get them.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is very long so order with plenty of time.</li>
            <li> stiff did not fit very well</li>
            <li> Fits my wrist well and goes with basically all that I wear due to my skin color and the type of clothes I wear.</li>
            <li> I like the other one.</li>
            <li> The other broke within 3 uses...</li>
            <li> Only received one of the two &amp; the face was cracked pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> but the other did :/</li>
            <li> Want to note for others who want to by it, though, the style is made for people who have small or, I would say, medium sized wrist.</li>
            <li> However, one of my watches minute hands were messed up. :/</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;ll still have at least one.  </li>
            <li> The battery stopped the same day i received it! :(</li>
            <li> I feel stupid because I had NO idea that they actually told time!</li>
            <li> The one with the butterfly was broken but</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this bracelet watch. However only one of them works. Aside from that, this is my second time ordering this item.</li>

            <li> Arrived fast and as advertised.  Made nice Valentine&#x27;s Day gift.</li>

            <li> Cool watches for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Everyone really liked these, they are pretty and a good quality for the money and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Love these watches. Fit great and stylish. Do yourself a favor and put a dab of glue where the leather is banded together. It does come apart but the glue will prevent it and your watch will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the look of these. One of them was losing time, the other one doesn&#x27;t work at all even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here, more than a month. Stopped working pretty quickly. Seems to good to be true because it is.</li>
            <li> Cute watch to wear. Once!! You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> stiff did not fit very well</li>
            <li> The watches arrived much sooner than expected and are nicer than the picture. They fit well and look so cute! Great value compared to the ones in the retail market.</li>
            <li> Good quality Leather...Beads cheap...took a long time to arrived</li>
            <li> Pretty interesting watches, lots of compliments. .. it is a shame you never know what size you will get. ..</li>
            <li> 4 stars because they are really pretty. But one star taken away because I think there should be atleast one more notch to adjust for women who have smaller wrists like me. There&#x27;s still a good 1 inch of the straps (half inch on both sides) that I can pull together to make it fit right. But I like things to be somewhat snug on my wrists so they don&#x27;t twist around.</li>
            <li> Great items for a great price. Clasp that keeps the time piece to the band came open. Fixed easy.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very nice product</li>
            <li> Love these, great gifts</li>
            <li> I love it! Fits my wrist well and goes with basically all that I wear due to my skin color and the type of clothes I wear. Want to note for others who want to by it, though, the style is made for people who have small or, I would say, medium sized wrist. It is about 7&amp;#34; from tip to tip.</li>
            <li> Tiny on wrist and broke immediately. Replacements never came but I got my money back.</li>
            <li> I recived these veryyy early . And aslo i didnt give it a five because on watch battery didnt work but the other did :/</li>
            <li> One of the watches did not work. I like the other one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to give these to my daughter&#x27;s for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, and great watch for both me and my friend.  :)</li>
            <li> I loved these! However, one of my watches minute hands were messed up. :/</li>
            <li> Love love love. I feel stupid because I had NO idea that they actually told time!</li>
            <li> Adorable!  Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that watches were from overseas.  Took a very long time to get them.  However, they are fairly attractive.</li>
            <li> 2nd watch, one of the straps broke out of the package.</li>
            <li> These are so stinkin&#x27; cute. Bought for me and my daughter</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these watches. Got these for my 2 pre-teen granddaughters for Christmas.  I know they will love them.  Very fashionable.</li>
            <li> fantastic set, fantastic price , as advertised.. no weird smells or what have you.. good quality</li>
            <li> The battery stopped the same day i received it! :( one of the watches looks better than the other. It was actually assembled backwards and both have the same charm when one of them was supposed to be a leaf. I was super excited after reading some really positive reviews but I guess I got unlucky this time.</li>
            <li> Perfect gifts for my daughter. Well made and running on time. Really great price. I am VERY happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very cute and brand new.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Haven&#x27;t worn for long, but seems like it will hold up for a long while. Great price. Shipping is very long so order with plenty of time.</li>
            <li> Kind of a cheap feel to it but looks cute and very affordable</li>
            <li> Beautiful well crafted</li>
            <li> These were a real bargain, however one of the watches is a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in that you cannot tell the hour exactly. Otherwise, I am happy.</li>
            <li> These watch bracelets are so cute!  Got one for me and one for my bestie!</li>
            <li> Only received one of the two &amp; the face was cracked pretty badly.  Crack was most likely due to poor packaging.  Really loved the idea but was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice watches, received them timely, gave one as a gift to my sister.  Looks great on my wrist.</li>
            <li> These two watches are really very sweet an unusual.  I was looking for something with a soft band because my joints sometimes hurt.  I saw this and got them and gave one of them to my granddaughter at Christmas.  It worked very well because there are two snaps for a small and a medium fit -- and the leather smell reminded my granddaughter of her saddle and her pony.  This was a very good deal indeed.</li>
            <li> Nice watches and they came before the time!</li>
            <li> Garbage! The one with the butterfly was broken but I figure oh well I&#x27;ll still have at least one.  The other broke within 3 uses... CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! Dont even bother with these...</li>
            <li> fantastic price and value love them</li>
            <li> I love these, but one has too strong an odor.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order again because of that.</li>
            <li> looks like the picture but it has a funny smell that won&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> They look cool, but do not keep time. Can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
