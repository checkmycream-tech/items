            <li>Although it would be nice to clean it throughly with soap and all, I&#x27;ve found that if you rinse it with cold water and wipe it down good (inside and out) with a clean wash cloth after each use, it stays plenty clean.</li>

            <li> Practice a few times with the different size rings until you settle on one.</li>
            <li> So, despite all the alleged pluses of this system, in fact any system, all you are getting is a device that draws blood creating turgidity, and then curtails its return with a ring.  </li>
            <li> One to hold the tube and the other to pump it.</li>
            <li> But if you are average size or bigger this product is WAY to small!  </li>
            <li> One VCD manufacturer is charging $25 per ring, when the cost to manufacture and market is less than a dollar.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and do some &amp;#34;personal prep&amp;#34; and trim the fringe on the carpet before the vacuum sucks it in!</li>

            <li> That was the biggest waste of $200.</li>
            <li> I just wasted $200+ for nothing.</li>
            <li> I tried all the drugs with little or no effect (other than the negative side-effects).</li>
            <li> I was shocked at just how fast this device worked.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with &#x27;John Doe&amp;#34; the Vacurect narrows at the bottom for some reason to about 1 3/4&amp;#34;, although i am average length i am 2&amp;#34; at the base and unless really lubed up takes about 5 min to get the tube off.</li>
            <li> years ago I was provided a Device by a medical plan; twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it took me until two years ago to look deeper into my options for dealing with the ED.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to get it to work.</li>
            <li> The disappointing part was the size of the retention ring I needed to maintain the erection.</li>
            <li> Also the snapping of the tension ring off of the tube and onto the penis is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The worst is that it has a tendency to draw my scrorom and a testicle up into the tube.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 35 years of childhood diabetes finally cought up with my sex life. My wife and I have been married for nearly 10 years now and I had ED before we got married. Unfortunately, it took me until two years ago to look deeper into my options for dealing with the ED. That&#x27;s when all my reasearch on VEDs kept leading me back to the Vacurect. I tried all the drugs with little or no effect (other than the negative side-effects). The Vacurect has changed my life.    I like it&#x27;s single piece design. Mine came with a carrying case, an assortment of various size tension rings, and silicon lubricant for the moving parts of the device. Although it would be nice to clean it throughly with soap and all, I&#x27;ve found that if you rinse it with cold water and wipe it down good (inside and out) with a clean wash cloth after each use, it stays plenty clean. I don&#x27;t use hot soapy water because that breaks down the silicon lubrican which can cause extra wear and damage the plastic and rubber parts/seals.    Vacurect also makes a &#x27;rebuild&#x27; kit containing all the replacement rubber rings, seals and flaps require to fully restore the device to new working condition if you do damage it somehow. My wife did her \\&quot;I&#x27;m going to REALLY clean this thing\\&quot; on it one time and soaked it overnight in bleach and water... well that&#x27;s when I had to purchased the rebuild kit. You can also buy extra tension rings if needed.    In actual use, I&#x27;ve found a few things that seem to work for me. First, if it&#x27;s tugging (trying to draw up your testicles into the tube), you&#x27;re probably over pumping it. Second, the instructions say to pump it 10-15 times. Five work fine for me. I rather have the lower vaccuum and slower hardening effect, than the very quick effect. That seems to &#x27;feel&#x27; much better over time. Third, it instructs you on how to use the suction of the pump to automatically draw your penis into and through the tension rings. That&#x27;s ok, but in the end, doing it manually insures a much better fit. Fourth, a good water base lubricant like [[ASIN:B000CLTYCW Astroglide Personal Lubricant - Water Based, 5 oz.]] (good) or [[ASIN:B00123G9FO Carrageenan Gently Natural Personal Lubricant 4 Oz]] (even better) makes clean up extremely easy, won&#x27;t harm the device, and makes everything much more enjoyable. Lastly, trimming the hair around where the tension ring sits (and adding a dab of waterbased lubricant), makes removing the ring a lot less of an ordeal.    Any complaints? Just one. It takes both hands to operate. One to hold the tube and the other to pump it. Boy, I&#x27;d love to be able to do this with only one hand. Having to remove BOTH hands from what they&#x27;re doing to work with the pump does kind of... you know.    Oh, one very last thing. Shop around. Although it&#x27;s well worth the $[...] listed here, I&#x27;ve seen it for $[...] less, and if you have Medicare, they&#x27;ll cover most of the costs if you fill out the formes and get the proper documentation from your physician.</li>
            <li> Not much for instructions.  we have had difficulty getting it work properly.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with &#x27;John Doe&amp;#34; the Vacurect narrows at the bottom for some reason to about 1 3/4&amp;#34;, although i am average length i am 2&amp;#34; at the base and unless really lubed up takes about 5 min to get the tube off. The largest ring is too small and i have to calm way down to force it off. All in all i would give it 3 stars if you ask me. Maybe ill cut the narrow neck off and get reg vac rings and will like it better. The pump action works great though 2 hands are needed.</li>
            <li> Works good after some training on my part....</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the Vacurect vacuum erection device (VED) is the very best. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been using an Erecaid System Esteem model VED for over three years.  Although it has done the job, it has some shortcommings.  The worst is that it has a tendency to draw my scrorom and a testicle up into the tube.  As the air seal is between the tube opening and the body, pubic hair can be a problem in getting and maintaining this seal.  Also the snapping of the tension ring off of the tube and onto the penis is unpleasant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A magazine advertisement first drew my attention to the Vacurect VED.  The superior feature is the tension ring system.  It seals to the penis shaft, not to the body and so will prevent drawing in scrotum or testicle and pubic hair will not effect its use.  Since it is on the penis from the start, the snapping of a ring from tube to penis is bypassed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An additional good point is that the nuisance of loading the the ring onto the tube is eliminated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Erecaid does have some features missing on the Vacurest.  It does not have a vacuum release valve.  The tube and the pump are one assembly so that the tube can not be cleaned with hot soapy water as can the Erecaid.  There are no length markings, but these are easily added with a permanent marker pen.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to get it to work. Grossly overpriced</li>
            <li> Overpriced and not functional.</li>
            <li> Buy the best first. This is it. I bought the Pos-T-Vac on Amazon. It works, but is not as easy to use as the Vacurect. The VA supplied the Encore after I bought the Pos-T-Vac on my own and requested they supply the Vacurect. The Encore works, but is harder to use than the Pos-T-Vac and is not even close to the Vacurect. The Vacurect is more money, but worth it. None of the objections I&#x27;ve seen here are valid, except size. If you&#x27;re bigger than 1 3/4 X 8 inches, try something else. If not, get this one. Take you time, read the directions closely and you will be pleased with the results. You don&#x27;t need a button to release the vacuum, use your finger to press on the tension ring and it will release immediately. Practice a few times with the different size rings until you settle on one. Keep that ring on the unit at all times. When you&#x27;re ready, lube, pump, break the seal and your ready to go. Only thing easier is to be young again. The side effects of the pills were a deal breaker for me. This is the best I have found for my age (74) and circumstances (Vietnam, Agent Orange, Prostate Cancer, proton therapy to cure cancer, ED after 5 years).</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly the best thing since sliced bread. It is quite easy to use and works every time. The tension ring can be a bit difficult to remove after, but being able to have sex again is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this because of health issues.  He has Peyronies.  The item once purchased is non-refundable.  We did not know until we read the instructions when we got the item that it&#x27;s not recommended with people with Peyronies.  My husband was in pain the only time he used it.  That was the biggest waste of $200.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be intimidating, so it hasn&#x27;t been used. Since there is a no-return policy (for obvious reasons) it now sits on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several such devices, this is the best  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like the o rings. No flexibility in opening.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this product, the quality of my sex life has significantly improved!!! Erections are much firmer and last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  But if you are average size or bigger this product is WAY to small!  I just wasted $200+ for nothing.</li>
            <li> The Vacurect Device appealed to me because of its \\&quot;unique\\&quot; compact, ergonomic, and portable design. I found it, however, to be fragile in use.  The dual parts \\&quot;fell-apart.\\&quot; I, though, do not regret trying it - I regret that it and I are not compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I was provided a Device by a medical plan; twice as expensive. It provided superior results, but I did not adapt easily to the \\&quot;tourniquet\\&quot; hypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience does not prove the Device to be generally ineffective - it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Others might try it and get very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> This manufacturer advertises a one piece system.  It obviously is not.  All VTD require a pump, lubricating gel, and most of all, the tension rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the only reason why there is a distinction between the over the counter &amp; prescription models is essentially the price.  Medicare allows $525 for vacuum therapy devices, but won&#x27;t pay unless medically prescribed.  So OTC is obviously the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, all VCD&#x27;s work on the same principal:  engorge the penis by mechanically drawing blood into the spongy tissue, and then blocking the blood drawn into the penis with a rubber-like ring.  So, despite all the alleged pluses of this system, in fact any system, all you are getting is a device that draws blood creating turgidity, and then curtails its return with a ring.  So more money will net you a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the tension rings, especially the smaller ones, tear when stretched.  So, consider the cost of replacement.  Each manufacturer produces a ring that is unique.  I have decided to chuck my total system for one that has reasonably priced rings.  One VCD manufacturer is charging $25 per ring, when the cost to manufacture and market is less than a dollar.  All manufacturers are in it for the cash.  So don&#x27;t be lulled into the belief that any one of them is interested in your well being.  It&#x27;s your wallet that they are after.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at just how fast this device worked. One pump and Wow! A couple more and I was sold. The disappointing part was the size of the retention ring I needed to maintain the erection. All kidding aside, well, I wasn&#x27;t kidding just then but OK from here on I&#x27;m not kidding. This pump is powerful. I had a battery powered version I bought from an adult store and it &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; but was a joke compared to this pump! It is incredible! I am not a young guy and not into manscaping, but, if you have any hair near this thing it&#x27;s gonna hurt! Do yourself a favor and do some &amp;#34;personal prep&amp;#34; and trim the fringe on the carpet before the vacuum sucks it in!</li>
