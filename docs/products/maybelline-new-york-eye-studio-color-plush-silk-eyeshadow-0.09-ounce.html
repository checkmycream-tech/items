            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased the Spirited Seas, the first color is a little bit powdery (base), the second one is a little bit frosted and metallic (light blue), and the other two are dark and silky. It depends on how you apply them, I like how they turned out on my lids. They also have a subtle shimmer on them (which I really like)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use much but they are good.</li>
            <li> love the colors.  Such nice quality make-up.  Would definitely purchase again.  In fact I have in other colors.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> These eye shadow sets are a bit on the pricey side in stores so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a discounted price! The colors are great with my eye color, I&#x27;m excited that I own it!</li>
            <li> Bold colors that work nicely together. Goes on easy and stays on. I got it on special for $3 on Amazon so that&#x27;s always a plus</li>
            <li> Love it! I get tons of complements when I wear this eye shadow.  Would so buy it again. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this pallet. You can&#x27;t beat the price! I should have ordered several &amp; probably will soon.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the color or wear is too dull appears like dollar store make up prefer l oreal eye shadow better</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, and am so glad I did! The colors are great! I use the brown tones every day, and the blue tones when I want some color.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and I really couldn&#x27;t beat the price !  It was FREE :) Got it in a product advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;Its a quality product and was shipped very well to protect against damage.</li>
            <li> Great colors and good quality!</li>
            <li> A little sparkle in these shadows make them perfect alone or with liner</li>
            <li> These are true Maybelline. You know in advance what you will be getting. Quality and smooth color, enhancing your eyes!</li>
            <li> lovely colors-great price</li>
            <li> Loved how my eyes.lightt weightc. Didn&#x27;t cause eye irritation that it can happen with some eye shadows. Liked the color choices.</li>
            <li> Love this Eyeshadow, I love this color because my eyes a blue. It goes on so easy. I would recommend this to my best friends, It&#x27;s Great!!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.  In stores they run from $7.00 - $10+ so it was a bargain and it came perfectly. I would recommend</li>
            <li> this was not worth the money spent</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors that go on smoothly. The color palette coordinates with the majority of my clothes and are also great colors for my skin tone. Have already recommended this to friends.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mean to buy two of the same color. Ugh. I will second one as a gift for birthday or for no reason</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price was great and fast shipping.  I am very pleased with the colors and the way they apply.</li>
            <li> Lowest price I have seen. Top quality product. I love the colors. Big fan of mayballine. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a small pallette but was priced just right and I could not pass it up.  I would not have purchased it otherwise at the regular price because each of the colors are a lot smaller than an individual size.  The color blend is soft and pretty for blue eyed gals like me.</li>
            <li> I am always happy to see great deals and this was one of those..I don&#x27;t wear lots of cosmetics,so this deal was a great price and love the colors. Thanks</li>
            <li> This color pallet makes my eyes looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Love it...wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a good decision because it gives your eyes a dreamy look---with pazzaz (sp?) but you know what I mean!  I love the drawing on the back so you know how to get that look!!  I&#x27;ve always been a Maybelline girl, but I&#x27;ve used MAC, Yves Saint Laurent, Mary Kay, Avon, some Cover Girl and others like Your Best Friend!  These though &amp; the 24hr Tattoo Shadow can&#x27;t be beat!!  Buy them and have fun everybody!!</li>
