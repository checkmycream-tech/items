            <li>:) Im happy with this oil and THIS IS THE ONE!</li>
            <li>Packaging could have been better but the product itself was great!</li>
            <li>I believe the oil was still authentic because it did a wonderful job in smoothing my hair, but there must be some packaging problem that the oil dribbled out from the bottle after I used it for two weeks.</li>

            <li>This product feels so nice in my hair!</li>

            <li>If hubby notices, then it&#x27;s got to be good :-P</li>
            <li>In fact I have been given a couple of compliments on the healthy look of my hair, then I realized that the macadamia line is very very good.</li>
            <li>so this was great, and the shine and healthy look of my hair is great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the spray version of this one and it is not as good, it seems to be dilute.</li>
            <li>The product itself was good as always</li>
            <li>Trust me it is good.</li>
            <li>its really good</li>

            <li>Macadamia Oil Healing Oil is wonderful for dry hair and to create a wonderful shine - but just use a drop</li>

            <li>This is an amazing product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>its amazing i had to do a review on it :</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked it smells nice and keeps my hair monistrized</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much product when I use this after washing my hair and that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>This product wasnn&#x27;t as effective and</li>
            <li>It smells so good, but it feels even better in my hair.</li>
            <li>have to honestly say that this is heavier than Morccan Oil .</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes my hair look really nice and touchable.</li>
            <li>kind of earthy hippyish smell...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Ulta for a lot more money and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a delicious men&#x27;s cologne and it makes my hair super smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the scent is very strong and nauseating.</li>
            <li>The price here was much better than at Ulta, though I still love that store!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too better than argon oil.</li>
            <li>That said, a dime or pea size would leave soft, beautifully delicious smelling hair.</li>
            <li>This by far one of the best oils that I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product - if you have damaged color treated hair give this a try it did wonders for me!</li>

            <li>My hair has lost it shine from too many processes.</li>
            <li>I will be geting more when i run out!!I</li>
            <li>My hair falls just below the top of my shoulders</li>
            <li>And the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It  arrived cracked but it was easily replaced.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s silkiness and doesn&#x27;t matt as easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong for me</li>
            <li>The smell is really really strong tho.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, not oily, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING, first of all.</li>
            <li>I have been VERY pleased with how much healthier my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my girlfriend, who owns her own salon.</li>
            <li>Excellent product without weighing your hair down,</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin as well as my hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair,</li>
            <li>The delivery of the product was fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair and this does wonders for the texture.  </li>
            <li>Product works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Love the product, makes your hair so smooth and silky, easy to comb and gives fresh look.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner for hair in hard water conditions and good for your hands too after you run the oil through your damp hair.  </li>
            <li>Also it was fast shipping and much cheaper than in the stores , great buy</li>
            <li>It does smooth my hair, but given a choice of a better-smelling, easier to remove product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it doesn&#x27;t linger or clash with my perfume, according to others.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fragrance free and smells like indian incense.  </li>
            <li>Will stick with the Enjoy line of hair care.</li>
            <li>and it really gives it nice volume when styling.</li>
            <li>The oil helps my hair to feel so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I had to get a bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the way it instantly makes my hair look like the healthiest hair on the planet (which is isn&#x27;t), so I will continue to use this treatment forever!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and make my hair very silky.</li>
            <li>Fanstastic and makes my hair smooth and takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li>The emphasis on light.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, shiney and easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I wish it was odor free...</li>
            <li>I use this oil combined with the deep repair masque, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>This was such a great deal.</li>
            <li>I use this together with the Macadamia hair masque, fantastic.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>so it has been nice to have the oil to protect my hair as well as make it lay straight all day.</li>
            <li>when I opened it, that familiar scent confirmed it was the correct product.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes extremelyyyy well while leaving a light, clean, fragrant scent.</li>

            <li>I was excited to like this product</li>
            <li>It makes my hair bouncy and full, smooth without being fly-away, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best if you comb through your hair, and it really makes your hair soft and very shiny.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>These produce it make my hair so soft and look very  healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my original bottle, but am running out so purchased this one.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s great for those dry and splitting ends</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and this oil smells amazing and makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always told how soft and healthy my hair is!  </li>
            <li>I have not yet received the replacement (should be any day), but they were very prompt and professional and very nice.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this large size.</li>
            <li>I used it right when I got it from the mail man!</li>
            <li>This oil has a thicker consistency than normal oil and has a very strong musky smell.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly but it was lighter in color than the one I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li>I cant truely describe the smell but its tropical and nutty to me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the oil and my hair dries so much faster when I use it.</li>
            <li>Love and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Also loved shampoo/conditioner, &amp; deep masque!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very shiny and fuller, plus it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need too much, pretty strong product.</li>
            <li>Super helpful in climates with</li>
            <li>I super like all the line of Macadamia.</li>
            <li>and I love how healthy it is since starting the use of the oil about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>Another one we told about who is older and bedridden was glad that it cured his bedsores.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest around the middle or tips of your hair but not you roots because it&#x27;ll give it a greasy look but at the bottom it looks more like a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I do think I prefer the spray container better only because you can use the oil more sparingly.</li>
            <li>Leave my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>Now I live in a Macadamia world!!!!</li>
            <li>It comes with a unique smell along with its properties of making your hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of natural oils for hair, this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>This stuff is good - helps tame the frizz, keeps my hair looking healthy without looking oily.  </li>
            <li>Macadamia oil deep repair mask is great too, but this oil treatment is the key ingredient to to healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is thicker than most other oils (coconut, agave, olive).</li>
            <li>Its smells great and has made my hair shiny while taking the frizz down.</li>
            <li>great oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it leaves my hair very soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>originally got the oil as a sample and have been buying it consistently ever since.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it though!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Healing Oil Treatment: a therapeutic oil perfect for all hair types and is especially beneficial to dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, especially for a dry, colored hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, soft, NEVER oily, and super healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday styling oil -</li>

            <li>It is worth the money.</li>

            <li>It has restored her hair to a more natural look.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice deep &amp; musky scent to it.</li>
            <li>I own a hair salon, so someone had left a sample of this product, which I used when I bathed and groomed my fuzzy Afghan Hound.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh, just how I like it.</li>
            <li>This product always makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I see the difference it have help me a lot i Can Say that is Worth</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel, but it makes my face breakout if it gets near my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it in every way.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my hairdresser and has been well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>No more frizzies, I have beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>My stylist warned me to watch out for &amp;#34;imposters&amp;#34; but this one was in the right bottle (pay attention to the detail in the picture) and was sealed and</li>
            <li>My hair products shipped right away.  </li>
            <li>Can be used on damp or dry hair, which I love!</li>
            <li>When I put this in my naturally curly hair and let it air dry it does make my hair shiny, but it does not do that great of a job controlling frizz.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, smells great, and helps my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li>Now it is soft and easy to manage, so</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair, it works fine so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty straight but with this product I HAVE CURL AND WAVE for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li>Smells great and super thick and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I used smaller bottle before, which helped my hair better.</li>
            <li>After my second use, I received compliments on how healthy my hair is...</li>
            <li>Use too much and you WILL have greasy looking hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past year and love it (and it smells fantastic!)  </li>
            <li>and it moisturizes without any visible oiliness, and leaves my hair soft, silkier, shinier and, free of frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff not only speeds up my drying time, but it helps keep my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>you may not even need a whole pump.!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of hair oils, but they all leave my hair looking greasy, yuck!  </li>
            <li>my first purchase was at cvs</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be tempted to go over bores with it but a pea sized amount is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all, and this one&#x27;s a keeper!  </li>
            <li>I was first tipped off when I opened the pump</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t close like the first one I had.</li>
            <li>makes my hair look shiny and smooth and soft...</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a present, but both my mother and sister love this product.  </li>
            <li>But so much cheaper to order from Amazon!</li>
            <li>I also use it as a hot oil treatment once a month.</li>
            <li>and I actually like it better than Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>I would describe my hair strands as being fine/medium and the density of my hair as &#x27;thick&#x27;; when I apply this product to my hair ends, it looks great</li>
            <li>I first got a sample of this from my hair salon</li>
            <li>Glides on easily and when used as additive to conditioners and other products, rinses out easily as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you have relaxed hair then give this a try, but would probably work way better if you get your hair relaxed and flat ironed first.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for my long, dry hair.</li>
            <li>A small amount suffices and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and silky, totally not oily as other kind.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Easy to use it , but next time when you shipping , should need instruction book with it .</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts a little less than I would like, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product I will continue buying again and again.</li>
            <li>This thing helps to keep my hair looking, feeling, and actually being great WITHOUT weighing my hair down</li>
            <li>One large pump leaves my hair a bit greasy, which I like, and my hair is almost to my waist.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and frizzy and this serum is fantastic, leaves my hair soft, easy to styling, removes the frizzy and remains my hair very soft until the next wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been highlighting my hair blonde for years (14 years to be exact) and decided to go more towards my natural color for awhile</li>
            <li>Secondly, it meets the criteria of being easy to dispense, fast to apply and seems to shorten drying time in the morning.</li>
            <li>But by the second day, it was just fine.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, a bottle should last you months!</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend to anyone needing dry hair repair!</li>
            <li>So much so that I ordered this large pump bottle of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>A little pricy but adds a nice shine and manageability to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I was buying it at a Beauty store... for WAY too much.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting much from this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get greasy unless you use way too much, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up.  </li>
            <li>it tames your frizz for the WHOLE day.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I dont really have any split ends and my hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but your hair feels incredibly smooth after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li>I even mix this product with a hair mask to really condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I could not use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>The product worked well, but it is not the real branded product.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>My hair has gone berserk with menopause (doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be curly or straight, or god help us:</li>
            <li>Very Helpfull for my hair stop losing .</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t the real macadamia oil.</li>
            <li>Do it after you wash your hair, and use a spare amount, rubbing in open palms and fingers, then lightly coat hair.  </li>
            <li>From that time on his grooming has become so much easier and his fur keeps</li>
            <li>Really repairs your hair and puts my frizzy hair at ease</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this</li>
            <li>I my hair has been bleach a lot very week and damage</li>
            <li>Even when you try to just pump it gently I get too much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This has an nice earthy smell, I notice it when I put it in, but after a few minutes, I don&#x27;t notice it at all.  </li>
            <li>It keep my hair so soft the frizz is gone!!!</li>
            <li>Usual price is $40 a bottle so less than $20 was great!</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and have very curly aka frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>It feels less dry and very healthy!</li>
            <li>It is great for all types of hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It has a moderate fragrance that is a bit sweet at first, but luckily the fragrance dissipates away after a short time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down one bit.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, and doesnt weight down your hair only nourishes it!!  </li>
            <li>I have very long , fine wavy hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good oil, but I will keep searching for one that smells a little different.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>Even though this thing is supposed to revive dry hair, I think it&#x27;s too light to do that for my hair since it&#x27;s relaxed.</li>
            <li>This vendor however, took a legitimate looking bottle and filled it with some clear off white oooz.</li>
            <li>I would love to try their rejuvenating shampoo as well and the conditioner, but if you&#x27;re thinking of buying something from this line definitely get this Healing Oil and the Deep repair mask.</li>
            <li>I have been searching my entire life going through many different products that just did not do the trick quite like</li>
            <li>only and 2 use my hairs feel different much better</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it a better review as the deep repair mask in this line is terrific.  </li>
            <li>Aside from using it as a styling and finishing product, a couple squirts of this Macadamia Healing Oil into some [[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask]] will leave my hair silky smooth, soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>high humidity cause</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the others I bought from this company through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would also highly recommend their tub if conditioner .</li>
            <li>I grew up with straight hair that suddenly curled after the birth of my son, it&#x27;s oily at the roots and dry at the ends with a lovely Bozo</li>
            <li>I find it just as good as Morrocan Oil which is nice because it is less expensive.  </li>
            <li>Living in the desert, my scalp has a tendancy to get very dry, but this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also bought the little container of this product to be able to travel with it</li>
            <li>but it is so popular it is hard to get your hands on any.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about buying this product at first but had seen so many good reviews on Youtube and read them here on Amazon that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much, just apply to ends...really smoothes and makes my hair look so soft.</li>
            <li>Offers intense nourishment, smoothing and a long-lasting, tangle-free, frizz-free finish for hair that is ultra-smooth, manageable and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be absorbing this product completely after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I normally put one pump of this after I wash my hair in the mornings and</li>
            <li>It is a thick oil, so it is best if you use small quantities until desired results.</li>
            <li>One thing to note is that my hair seems to have become more straight than it usually it after using the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair gloss/ serum, they were either too heavy, greasy or didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>ok, not sure i will really use it</li>
            <li>The smell is very different (this one has a strong musk smell), and the texture and color are also different.</li>
            <li>, cool dry my hair with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, thin hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>My hair is full, loose and flowy.</li>
            <li>I found a product I cannot live without.</li>
            <li>My hair feel very soft and nourished after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It is now soft, shiny and the frizz are gone!</li>
            <li>My hair looks so soft and nourished!</li>
            <li>which can be a problem for me) and it makes it soft!  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>I checked to make sure it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li>I have also tried several that have funny smells.  </li>
            <li>The scent is different and I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This helps to soften, smooth out and nourish my naughty locks.  </li>
            <li>Exact same product and quality that I get from my hair salon.</li>
            <li>After just one use of this product my hair was so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a smooth look without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in my hair with less breakage.</li>
            <li>I blow dry and use about 5 drops worth to finish a glossy sheen look.</li>
            <li>I have fine, colour-damaged hair, and using one pump smooths the frizz and brings out the curls a little.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for very thick dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this prouct both night and day at an amount equaling 1 1/2 full pumps or in other words, a dollar coin and a quarter coin.</li>
            <li>Steroids would clear it up for a while</li>
            <li>Then I decided to get biger size, this one smells kinda same, but I dont see much improvement of my hair.</li>
            <li>Just received this last week and this really works.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair from years of coloring and daily heat styling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it&#x27;s nearly transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on long-term effects, though, because I started using it at the same time I gave up heat</li>
            <li>but if you are sensitive to scents, you will not care for it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is chemical treated with perm and frequent color treatments.</li>
            <li>Even my friends had noticed and asked what I&#x27;ve done to my soft hair.</li>
            <li>and I really feel it makes a big difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>It keeps them stright and soft all day.</li>
            <li>cons: pricey, too much will make hair oily, pump should be adjusted to a smaller pump rate</li>
            <li>it leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>I gave up on it early.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they were very prompt to not only apologize but to see if I wanted a refund or a replacement bottle.  </li>
            <li>I really wish 0-star ratings were possible.</li>
            <li>* Provides natural UV protection</li>
            <li>it make your hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>IM A NATURAL HAIR GAL AND MY HAIR LOVES</li>
            <li>It is one of two products I&#x27;ve ever found that will make the driest , hardest snarls just melt away into silky, soft hair....</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and look soft, shine and health.</li>
            <li>I had to pour it into an old container with a working pump.</li>
            <li>I have color  in my hair and this product keeps my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>so I can wear it natural.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>leaves your hairs so soft, shiny and silkie.</li>
            <li>its not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair look greasy if you go more than a day without washing your hair, at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li>I especially like the pump that is on it because I don&#x27;t have to guess how much I am pouring in my hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, smells great and only requires a small amount to smooth out my dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li>This is a mostly natural product that works well on my hair before I flat iron it straight.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this from my stylist, who got me hooked on it, only to find out at my very next appt that it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of its high price, we have purchased this product multiple times.</li>
            <li>first tries it as a sample</li>
            <li>If I use it when my hair is dry and damaged it won&#x27;t work, it just dissolves too much into my hair.</li>
            <li>only slight negative for me is the scent - I don&#x27;t much like foodie scents, and this stuff smells kind of like candy or something.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;d definitely recommend everyone to try it at least once :)</li>
            <li>If you have coarse or thick hair , you will love to use this anytime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have thick italian hair and have tried everything to make it look better...</li>
            <li>For reference, I have thick, coarse, curly hair that frizzes on the top.</li>
            <li>Love this product and highly recommend it for women with long thick hair!</li>
            <li>I have a youtube channel where i talk about curly hair in general (hairr) and i use this as a finishing styling product..</li>
            <li>I use this product daily on the ends and it keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have the Deep repair mask and this so far</li>
            <li>The flat iron does not damage your hair with this - silky soft!</li>
            <li>Both naturally curely with irish friz.</li>
            <li>this oil instantly makes my hair soft smoothe with shine to it.</li>
            <li>The product I received is different than the ones I purchased directly at Marcadamia Oil.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to put too much on.</li>
            <li>This oil is surprisingly thick, but light weight on the hair...</li>
            <li>Can be a little tricky to use just the right amount to avoid getting greasy hair.</li>
            <li>First oil that did not weigh down my hair and make oily.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, dull, frizzy and loves puffing out but after using this, my hair is totally transformed!</li>
            <li>I laso use other products in this line that I absolutely</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a second bottle in the near future.</li>
            <li>My hair is very wild, dry, and curly.</li>
            <li>Other products are to heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product price is high, but it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li>I have fine highlighted hair &amp; I use a dime sized drop of this oil before I blow dry it &amp; it cuts my blow dry time almost in half</li>
            <li>have oily hair and as long as you don&#x27;t put this near your roots, the amount of shine it adds is amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very thick, curly hair that easily expands with heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>With the Macadamia Oil , one large pump is probably heavier than the average person who is not going surfing later, would want in their hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, long and wavy, it tends to get frizzy and dry in the ends, this makes it look healthy without making it sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>I use about a half of a pump while my hair is wet to protect from heat/styling, and then will sometimes add another 1/4 pump to my dry hair to smooth out anything else after styling as well as to add shine... and will also add to the ends to &#x27;reconstruct&#x27; from any heat styling.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that my hair would be greasy, but you only need a small amount and it is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>She has super thick hair</li>
            <li>You can only use a tiny amount of this stuff so its hard to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c african american hair and this is the only thing that keeps the frizzies away when I flat iron!!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and even helps it to dry faster!  </li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair looks a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, unruly wavy/curlyish hair in my middle age.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and frizzy, but using this product helps to smooth it and it protects my hair from the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it smells good and helps tame my long thick corse hair!!!!!</li>
            <li>I use this pretty regularly and a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> My hair was a lot smoother and looked so nice!</li>
            <li> :) Im happy with this oil and THIS IS THE ONE!</li>
            <li> Packaging could have been better but the product itself was great!</li>
            <li> I believe the oil was still authentic because it did a wonderful job in smoothing my hair, but there must be some packaging problem that the oil dribbled out from the bottle after I used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> My sister uses this product and says that it&#x27;s remarkable.</li>
            <li> This product feels so nice in my hair!</li>
            <li> Best price, arrived packaged safely and securely-quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair oil and it smells very nice also.</li>
            <li> If hubby notices, then it&#x27;s got to be good :-P</li>
            <li> In fact I have been given a couple of compliments on the healthy look of my hair, then I realized that the macadamia line is very very good.</li>
            <li> so this was great, and the shine and healthy look of my hair is great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the spray version of this one and it is not as good, it seems to be dilute.</li>
            <li> The product itself was good as always</li>
            <li> Trust me it is good.</li>
            <li> its really good</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me a sample size of this oil and absolutely loved it for my hair.</li>
            <li> Always have loved this product</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> but rather it maintains the moisture &amp; good look, so</li>

            <li> This oil is great, I love the consistency of it.</li>
            <li> Works great on Hispanic hair:)</li>
            <li> Macadamia Oil Healing Oil is wonderful for dry hair and to create a wonderful shine - but just use a drop</li>
            <li> However, found that I was able to purchase it from this vendor thru Amazon at a much better price than what I had been paying!!</li>

            <li> I have used this product for over a year and love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> This stuff has made an amazing difference.  </li>
            <li> Amazing it helps your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is amazing after I used the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for a wash n go</li>
            <li> I put mousse or gel in my hair and then a touch of Macadamia Oil healing Oil, and my hair feels and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> its amazing i had to do a review on it :</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked it smells nice and keeps my hair monistrized</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much product when I use this after washing my hair and that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> This product wasnn&#x27;t as effective and</li>
            <li> It smells so good, but it feels even better in my hair.</li>
            <li> have to honestly say that this is heavier than Morccan Oil .</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my hair look really nice and touchable.</li>
            <li> kind of earthy hippyish smell...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta for a lot more money and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a delicious men&#x27;s cologne and it makes my hair super smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the scent is very strong and nauseating.</li>
            <li> The price here was much better than at Ulta, though I still love that store!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too better than argon oil.</li>
            <li> That said, a dime or pea size would leave soft, beautifully delicious smelling hair.</li>

            <li> smells amazing too if you like an earthy sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as effective and doesn&#x27;t have the same great scent.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my curls very soft and it smells great...</li>
            <li> It makes your hair very soft, easy to comb through and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> It is MAGICAL in how smooth it makes my hair</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more…….. very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this oil leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true!)</li>
            <li> First of all the bottle is gorgeous and heavy duty glass with a beautiful pump!</li>
            <li> It  arrived cracked but it was easily replaced.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s silkiness and doesn&#x27;t matt as easily.</li>

            <li> It makes my hair so soft, not oily, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING, first of all.</li>
            <li> I have been VERY pleased with how much healthier my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my girlfriend, who owns her own salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product without weighing your hair down,</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin as well as my hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair,</li>
            <li> The delivery of the product was fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair and this does wonders for the texture.  </li>
            <li> Product works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, makes your hair so smooth and silky, easy to comb and gives fresh look.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for hair in hard water conditions and good for your hands too after you run the oil through your damp hair.  </li>
            <li> Also it was fast shipping and much cheaper than in the stores , great buy</li>
            <li> It does smooth my hair, but given a choice of a better-smelling, easier to remove product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it doesn&#x27;t linger or clash with my perfume, according to others.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fragrance free and smells like indian incense.  </li>
            <li> Will stick with the Enjoy line of hair care.</li>
            <li> and it really gives it nice volume when styling.</li>
            <li> The oil helps my hair to feel so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much I had to get a bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the way it instantly makes my hair look like the healthiest hair on the planet (which is isn&#x27;t), so I will continue to use this treatment forever!  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and make my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> Fanstastic and makes my hair smooth and takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li> The emphasis on light.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth, shiney and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I wish it was odor free...</li>
            <li> I use this oil combined with the deep repair masque, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I use this together with the Macadamia hair masque, fantastic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>

            <li> I was excited to like this product</li>
            <li> It makes my hair bouncy and full, smooth without being fly-away, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best if you comb through your hair, and it really makes your hair soft and very shiny.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> These produce it make my hair so soft and look very  healthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my original bottle, but am running out so purchased this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and lasts soooo long!</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell and it really makes my hair look healthy, shiny</li>

            <li> Great treatment for dry ends.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for those dry and splitting ends</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and this oil smells amazing and makes your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always told how soft and healthy my hair is!  </li>
            <li> I have not yet received the replacement (should be any day), but they were very prompt and professional and very nice.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found this large size.</li>
            <li> I used it right when I got it from the mail man!</li>
            <li> This oil has a thicker consistency than normal oil and has a very strong musky smell.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly but it was lighter in color than the one I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li> I cant truely describe the smell but its tropical and nutty to me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the oil and my hair dries so much faster when I use it.</li>
            <li> Love and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Also loved shampoo/conditioner, &amp; deep masque!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very shiny and fuller, plus it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need too much, pretty strong product.</li>
            <li> Super helpful in climates with</li>
            <li> I super like all the line of Macadamia.</li>
            <li> and I love how healthy it is since starting the use of the oil about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> Another one we told about who is older and bedridden was glad that it cured his bedsores.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest around the middle or tips of your hair but not you roots because it&#x27;ll give it a greasy look but at the bottom it looks more like a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I do think I prefer the spray container better only because you can use the oil more sparingly.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> Now I live in a Macadamia world!!!!</li>
            <li> It comes with a unique smell along with its properties of making your hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of natural oils for hair, this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> This stuff is good - helps tame the frizz, keeps my hair looking healthy without looking oily.  </li>
            <li> Macadamia oil deep repair mask is great too, but this oil treatment is the key ingredient to to healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is thicker than most other oils (coconut, agave, olive).</li>
            <li> Its smells great and has made my hair shiny while taking the frizz down.</li>
            <li> great oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it leaves my hair very soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> originally got the oil as a sample and have been buying it consistently ever since.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it though!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Healing Oil Treatment: a therapeutic oil perfect for all hair types and is especially beneficial to dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, especially for a dry, colored hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, soft, NEVER oily, and super healthy looking.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday styling oil -</li>
            <li> I really like how light the oil is...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, soft, hydrated, and it looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair care product...</li>
            <li> It has restored her hair to a more natural look.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice deep &amp; musky scent to it.</li>
            <li> I own a hair salon, so someone had left a sample of this product, which I used when I bathed and groomed my fuzzy Afghan Hound.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh, just how I like it.</li>
            <li> This product always makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I see the difference it have help me a lot i Can Say that is Worth</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel, but it makes my face breakout if it gets near my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it in every way.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my hairdresser and has been well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> No more frizzies, I have beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> My stylist warned me to watch out for &amp;#34;imposters&amp;#34; but this one was in the right bottle (pay attention to the detail in the picture) and was sealed and</li>
            <li> My hair products shipped right away.  </li>
            <li> Can be used on damp or dry hair, which I love!</li>
            <li> When I put this in my naturally curly hair and let it air dry it does make my hair shiny, but it does not do that great of a job controlling frizz.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, smells great, and helps my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> Now it is soft and easy to manage, so</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair, it works fine so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty straight but with this product I HAVE CURL AND WAVE for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li> Smells great and super thick and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I used smaller bottle before, which helped my hair better.</li>
            <li> After my second use, I received compliments on how healthy my hair is...</li>
            <li> Use too much and you WILL have greasy looking hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past year and love it (and it smells fantastic!)  </li>
            <li> and it moisturizes without any visible oiliness, and leaves my hair soft, silkier, shinier and, free of frizz and fly-aways.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff not only speeds up my drying time, but it helps keep my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> you may not even need a whole pump.!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of hair oils, but they all leave my hair looking greasy, yuck!  </li>
            <li> my first purchase was at cvs</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be tempted to go over bores with it but a pea sized amount is more than enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all, and this one&#x27;s a keeper!  </li>
            <li> I was first tipped off when I opened the pump</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t close like the first one I had.</li>
            <li> makes my hair look shiny and smooth and soft...</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a present, but both my mother and sister love this product.  </li>
            <li> But so much cheaper to order from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I also use it as a hot oil treatment once a month.</li>
            <li> and I actually like it better than Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I would describe my hair strands as being fine/medium and the density of my hair as &#x27;thick&#x27;; when I apply this product to my hair ends, it looks great</li>
            <li> I first got a sample of this from my hair salon</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and when used as additive to conditioners and other products, rinses out easily as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you have relaxed hair then give this a try, but would probably work way better if you get your hair relaxed and flat ironed first.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my long, dry hair.</li>
            <li> A small amount suffices and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and silky, totally not oily as other kind.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Easy to use it , but next time when you shipping , should need instruction book with it .</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a little less than I would like, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product I will continue buying again and again.</li>
            <li> This thing helps to keep my hair looking, feeling, and actually being great WITHOUT weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> One large pump leaves my hair a bit greasy, which I like, and my hair is almost to my waist.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and frizzy and this serum is fantastic, leaves my hair soft, easy to styling, removes the frizzy and remains my hair very soft until the next wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been highlighting my hair blonde for years (14 years to be exact) and decided to go more towards my natural color for awhile</li>
            <li> Secondly, it meets the criteria of being easy to dispense, fast to apply and seems to shorten drying time in the morning.</li>
            <li> But by the second day, it was just fine.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, a bottle should last you months!</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend to anyone needing dry hair repair!</li>
            <li> So much so that I ordered this large pump bottle of the stuff.  </li>
            <li> A little pricy but adds a nice shine and manageability to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was buying it at a Beauty store... for WAY too much.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get greasy unless you use way too much, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up.  </li>
            <li> it tames your frizz for the WHOLE day.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I dont really have any split ends and my hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but your hair feels incredibly smooth after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> I even mix this product with a hair mask to really condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I could not use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> The product worked well, but it is not the real branded product.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> My hair has gone berserk with menopause (doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be curly or straight, or god help us:</li>
            <li> Very Helpfull for my hair stop losing .</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t the real macadamia oil.</li>
            <li> Do it after you wash your hair, and use a spare amount, rubbing in open palms and fingers, then lightly coat hair.  </li>
            <li> From that time on his grooming has become so much easier and his fur keeps</li>
            <li> Really repairs your hair and puts my frizzy hair at ease</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this</li>
            <li> I my hair has been bleach a lot very week and damage</li>
            <li> Even when you try to just pump it gently I get too much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This has an nice earthy smell, I notice it when I put it in, but after a few minutes, I don&#x27;t notice it at all.  </li>
            <li> It keep my hair so soft the frizz is gone!!!</li>
            <li> Usual price is $40 a bottle so less than $20 was great!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have very curly aka frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> It feels less dry and very healthy!</li>
            <li> It is great for all types of hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has a moderate fragrance that is a bit sweet at first, but luckily the fragrance dissipates away after a short time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down one bit.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and doesnt weight down your hair only nourishes it!!  </li>
            <li> I have very long , fine wavy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good oil, but I will keep searching for one that smells a little different.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> Even though this thing is supposed to revive dry hair, I think it&#x27;s too light to do that for my hair since it&#x27;s relaxed.</li>
            <li> This vendor however, took a legitimate looking bottle and filled it with some clear off white oooz.</li>
            <li> I would love to try their rejuvenating shampoo as well and the conditioner, but if you&#x27;re thinking of buying something from this line definitely get this Healing Oil and the Deep repair mask.</li>
            <li> I have been searching my entire life going through many different products that just did not do the trick quite like</li>
            <li> only and 2 use my hairs feel different much better</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a better review as the deep repair mask in this line is terrific.  </li>
            <li> Aside from using it as a styling and finishing product, a couple squirts of this Macadamia Healing Oil into some [[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask]] will leave my hair silky smooth, soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> high humidity cause</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the others I bought from this company through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would also highly recommend their tub if conditioner .</li>
            <li> I grew up with straight hair that suddenly curled after the birth of my son, it&#x27;s oily at the roots and dry at the ends with a lovely Bozo</li>
            <li> I find it just as good as Morrocan Oil which is nice because it is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Living in the desert, my scalp has a tendancy to get very dry, but this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also bought the little container of this product to be able to travel with it</li>
            <li> but it is so popular it is hard to get your hands on any.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this product at first but had seen so many good reviews on Youtube and read them here on Amazon that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much, just apply to ends...really smoothes and makes my hair look so soft.</li>
            <li> Offers intense nourishment, smoothing and a long-lasting, tangle-free, frizz-free finish for hair that is ultra-smooth, manageable and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be absorbing this product completely after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I normally put one pump of this after I wash my hair in the mornings and</li>
            <li> It is a thick oil, so it is best if you use small quantities until desired results.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that my hair seems to have become more straight than it usually it after using the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair gloss/ serum, they were either too heavy, greasy or didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> ok, not sure i will really use it</li>
            <li> The smell is very different (this one has a strong musk smell), and the texture and color are also different.</li>
            <li> , cool dry my hair with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> My hair is full, loose and flowy.</li>
            <li> I found a product I cannot live without.</li>
            <li> My hair feel very soft and nourished after using this product.  </li>
            <li> It is now soft, shiny and the frizz are gone!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so soft and nourished!</li>
            <li> which can be a problem for me) and it makes it soft!  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> I checked to make sure it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li> I have also tried several that have funny smells.  </li>
            <li> The scent is different and I didn&#x27;t like it at first.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This helps to soften, smooth out and nourish my naughty locks.  </li>
            <li> Exact same product and quality that I get from my hair salon.</li>
            <li> After just one use of this product my hair was so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a smooth look without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference in my hair with less breakage.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and use about 5 drops worth to finish a glossy sheen look.</li>
            <li> I have fine, colour-damaged hair, and using one pump smooths the frizz and brings out the curls a little.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for very thick dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this prouct both night and day at an amount equaling 1 1/2 full pumps or in other words, a dollar coin and a quarter coin.</li>
            <li> Steroids would clear it up for a while</li>
            <li> Then I decided to get biger size, this one smells kinda same, but I dont see much improvement of my hair.</li>
            <li> Just received this last week and this really works.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from years of coloring and daily heat styling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it&#x27;s nearly transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on long-term effects, though, because I started using it at the same time I gave up heat</li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive to scents, you will not care for it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is chemical treated with perm and frequent color treatments.</li>
            <li> Even my friends had noticed and asked what I&#x27;ve done to my soft hair.</li>
            <li> and I really feel it makes a big difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> It keeps them stright and soft all day.</li>
            <li> cons: pricey, too much will make hair oily, pump should be adjusted to a smaller pump rate</li>
            <li> it leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I gave up on it early.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they were very prompt to not only apologize but to see if I wanted a refund or a replacement bottle.  </li>
            <li> I really wish 0-star ratings were possible.</li>
            <li> * Provides natural UV protection</li>
            <li> it make your hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> IM A NATURAL HAIR GAL AND MY HAIR LOVES</li>
            <li> It is one of two products I&#x27;ve ever found that will make the driest , hardest snarls just melt away into silky, soft hair....</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and look soft, shine and health.</li>
            <li> I had to pour it into an old container with a working pump.</li>
            <li> I have color  in my hair and this product keeps my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> so I can wear it natural.</li>
            <li> It makes it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> leaves your hairs so soft, shiny and silkie.</li>
            <li> its not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair look greasy if you go more than a day without washing your hair, at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I especially like the pump that is on it because I don&#x27;t have to guess how much I am pouring in my hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, smells great and only requires a small amount to smooth out my dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> This is a mostly natural product that works well on my hair before I flat iron it straight.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this from my stylist, who got me hooked on it, only to find out at my very next appt that it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of its high price, we have purchased this product multiple times.</li>
            <li> first tries it as a sample</li>
            <li> If I use it when my hair is dry and damaged it won&#x27;t work, it just dissolves too much into my hair.</li>
            <li> only slight negative for me is the scent - I don&#x27;t much like foodie scents, and this stuff smells kind of like candy or something.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;d definitely recommend everyone to try it at least once :)</li>
            <li> If you have coarse or thick hair , you will love to use this anytime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have thick italian hair and have tried everything to make it look better...</li>
            <li> For reference, I have thick, coarse, curly hair that frizzes on the top.</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it for women with long thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have a youtube channel where i talk about curly hair in general (hairr) and i use this as a finishing styling product..</li>
            <li> I use this product daily on the ends and it keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have the Deep repair mask and this so far</li>
            <li> The flat iron does not damage your hair with this - silky soft!</li>
            <li> Both naturally curely with irish friz.</li>
            <li> this oil instantly makes my hair soft smoothe with shine to it.</li>
            <li> The product I received is different than the ones I purchased directly at Marcadamia Oil.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to put too much on.</li>
            <li> This oil is surprisingly thick, but light weight on the hair...</li>
            <li> Can be a little tricky to use just the right amount to avoid getting greasy hair.</li>
            <li> First oil that did not weigh down my hair and make oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, dull, frizzy and loves puffing out but after using this, my hair is totally transformed!</li>
            <li> I laso use other products in this line that I absolutely</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a second bottle in the near future.</li>
            <li> My hair is very wild, dry, and curly.</li>
            <li> Other products are to heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product price is high, but it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have fine highlighted hair &amp; I use a dime sized drop of this oil before I blow dry it &amp; it cuts my blow dry time almost in half</li>
            <li> have oily hair and as long as you don&#x27;t put this near your roots, the amount of shine it adds is amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair that easily expands with heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> With the Macadamia Oil , one large pump is probably heavier than the average person who is not going surfing later, would want in their hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, long and wavy, it tends to get frizzy and dry in the ends, this makes it look healthy without making it sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I use about a half of a pump while my hair is wet to protect from heat/styling, and then will sometimes add another 1/4 pump to my dry hair to smooth out anything else after styling as well as to add shine... and will also add to the ends to &#x27;reconstruct&#x27; from any heat styling.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that my hair would be greasy, but you only need a small amount and it is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> She has super thick hair</li>
            <li> You can only use a tiny amount of this stuff so its hard to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c african american hair and this is the only thing that keeps the frizzies away when I flat iron!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and even helps it to dry faster!  </li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair looks a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, unruly wavy/curlyish hair in my middle age.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and frizzy, but using this product helps to smooth it and it protects my hair from the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it smells good and helps tame my long thick corse hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this pretty regularly and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> If applied like so when hair is still wet, the hair will dry and look greasy/get oiler a lot faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li> Especially protectful to have this product on my hair when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I apply just a little to my wet hair and it looks fresh when dry.</li>
            <li> , then flat iron...</li>
            <li> This bottle has been lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I get my hair relaxed/ or get it washed and flat ironed and then a day passes</li>
            <li> and i use a flat iron and</li>
            <li> After flat ironing or curling my hair, I rub a nickel sized amount on my hands and massage it into the ends of my hair and it makes my hair look healthier.  </li>
            <li> One pump is enough to coat my long hair.</li>
            <li> This product calms my hair down and makes it sooooo soft.  </li>
            <li> and it still has that freshly flat ironed look!</li>
            <li> maybe half a pump of their leave in conditioner to keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I also apply a tiny amount after my hair is dry during the day if it needs a moisture and shine boost.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that has a dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li> I only use this when my hair is wet/damp -- when I put it on my dry hair it makes it greasy.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with my dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have thick hair on the coarse side which has always been resistant to holding a curl or wave and does just what it wants to do.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and needed to go get relaxed and flat ironed, but I hadn&#x27;t gone to the salon as yet.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and looked damaged from color and the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I end up with a greasy scalp if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily so this will add to that a little, but I only see it the following day.</li>
            <li> , my stylist was shocked that my hair was in such good condition from being blonde for so long (as she calls it: usually gets destroyed).  </li>
            <li> Use it on wet hair only.</li>
            <li> women will give you all the &amp;#34;attention&amp;#34; you want all night and day long.</li>
            <li> It also had 0 effect after multiple tries.</li>
            <li> Lasts so long because you just need to use a dab.  </li>
            <li> I used it with other products for a long time and now I use only this product.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair is not nearly as dry, my hair drying time is cut in half since I have long hair</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll definitely be trying the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> This product actually absorbs into your hair, unlike other oils that just seem to be a temporary shine.</li>
            <li> As my hair is dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I used to have to blow dry</li>
            <li> I apply a dab of this after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> Ends the dry look and fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry or damaged hair, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Also allows the hair to dry quicker for some reason.</li>
            <li> Also, bought it for my mother who has extremely dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dry thinning fly-away hair</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much on dry hair or it&#x27;ll make your hair look oily, as you&#x27;d expect from a product that&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li> The normal price for this stuff is at least $40.  </li>
            <li> Also, because the oil is lighter I don&#x27;t think it turns your hair red the way that the dark moroccan oil can.</li>
            <li> For myself, I apply starting about an inch away from the roots going down to the tips.</li>
            <li> The one thing I must rave about though is that today is day 4 of using this oil at the amount described above (2 X a day) and my hair is NOT GREASY nor OILY neither weighed down.</li>
            <li> For my curly hair, I use this as soon as I  wash my hair: after washing, squeeze &amp; shake dry (Don&#x27;t use towels!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, dried out from daily straightening and drying, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle of this Macadamia Oil Healing oil Treatment and didn&#x27;t give much of expectation but after a few use on my damp hair.</li>
            <li> you can use this on dry, damp or wet hair.</li>
            <li> Put on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair that gets very dry and brittle on the ends.  </li>
            <li> The second was a mess...</li>
            <li> I have extra long, thick, extra curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin wavy hair (and I have a friend that uses this who has really thick and very dry curly hair)</li>
            <li> The bottle was open a little and some of the product got all over everything inside the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thinner in consistency and feels different on my hair too.</li>
            <li> but I only paid little over $19 for it here&lt;</li>
            <li> I use this to define my curls, especially in humid weather when it can get a bit frizzy or in cold weather when my hair becomes a little more limp.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure how long this will last</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have had this oil before and the smell was different</li>
            <li> Your hair just sucks in the oil and leaves the hair feeling so soft and lusterous.  </li>
            <li> I use when my hair is wet (about a nickel size amount) and run my fingers through.</li>
            <li> The product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Put a dime size on your palm and apply to wet hair, then style.  </li>
            <li> I use it while my hair is still wet to help seal in Moisture.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally curly, wavy and thick.</li>
            <li> just beware if you are pale blonde.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I share this with my sister in law because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have thin blonde hair but a large thick amount and this oil</li>
            <li> My hair is rather short, so I need very little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for going on a year now and do not use any other oil.</li>
            <li> but careful!</li>
            <li> So i used this a lot in Hawaii when i was on vacation to help manage the frizz due to humidity, and let me tell ya...</li>
            <li> This person has suffered with extreme problems on his feet since his exposure to Agent Orange.  </li>
            <li> I received man order quicker then expected!</li>
            <li> They rough up your hair shaft!), apply the oil &amp; do something else for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> my hair is rough and tangled after the shower this is a miracle!</li>
            <li> Thank God I only straighten my hair once every 6 months, so this product should last me at least 2 years!</li>
            <li> I have used this hair product longer than any other because it works.  </li>
            <li> it lasts a long time as only a very small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed and will come to love this stuff as I have.</li>
            <li> when I used up the small bottle, I got this big one.  </li>
            <li> #34;thick of a consistency&amp;#34; as my other product from the salon.  </li>
            <li> Just a little on the ends when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> A friend recommended that I buy macadamia oil for my hair because it has become a little dry and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; looking while I am in school and stressed.</li>
            <li> I have very, very thick white blonde (dyed) hair.</li>
            <li> the bottle was almost half empty....</li>
            <li> Washing my hair every other day, this bottle will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> After numerous hair colors and corrections to follow, my hair was breaking off, dry and dull!  </li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon for much less than it cost at other retailers.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pump.  </li>
            <li> small amount goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Use when wet to avoid looking/greasy when applied dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried putting oil in my hair before for fear of having my hair weigh down</li>
            <li> and they would like weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or leave grease on my hand.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make my hair look greasy either.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Compared to other, quality oil treatments, this one stands out!  </li>
            <li> I rub it into damp hair, dry hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li> Just use it from about half way down your hair, not on scalp or your scalp will look oily.</li>
            <li> I could tell the products leaked some, but only a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> So I looked online and literally got it for half the price.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dismayed that with the slight packaging change there also seems to be a formula change as well.</li>
            <li> then I add a half pump of the healing oil just to my ends.</li>
            <li> and I typically use 3/4 of one pump.</li>
            <li> I am Latina and have thick dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> i know a lot us dark girls have that problem!</li>
            <li> My hair always needs a little TLC.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dull (no shine at all), breaks off, and is very dry.</li>
            <li> you know how dry your hair can get in the summer - fret no more!  </li>
            <li> The real stuff is amaizng, this seller sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now and it is a must whenever I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> My scrunchie has slipped quite a few times</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday because my hair gets so greasy if I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> The Macadamia Oil is something I discovered a few years ago with my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than argan/morroccan oil which I find  too heavy for my wavy-curly 3b/c hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Macadamia oil for a few years.</li>
            <li> my woman been giving me the goods everyday because she cant stop smelling and rubbing my hair...</li>
            <li> My husband had trouble with his hands breaking out, even to the point of bleeding, and nothing would cure it.  </li>
            <li> not only do they offer the lowest prices for name brand procucts, but they stand behind what they sell.</li>
            <li> This soaks in so well that I can leave it in for a couple of days and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money as it made my hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed since I am spending the money only to use half the bottle, since the other half was leaking and became dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the pump dispenser makes it messy for travel, but you could put a small amount into a travel bottle.</li>
            <li> hair: brunette, long, thin, wavy/frizzy.  </li>
            <li> not pleased with product at all.</li>
            <li> I have hair just past the shoulders and use 2 pumps in damp hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what it was</li>
            <li> Apply a small amount to damp hair just before blow drying.</li>
            <li> works for my thick hair with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> So I will put some in the small travel size bottle I have.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use tons of hair gel, conditioner, creams, and all frizz control products you can imagine to get it in to place, but this oil has repaired my hair like you have no idea.</li>
            <li> Does not make hair greasy or limp at all!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that the shipping cost almost as much as the product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about cutting the drying time down, but it actually does take less time when you have the product in your hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I don&#x27;t have to feel guilty for indulging in this product!</li>
            <li> It gives body and shine to dull hair.  </li>
            <li> I hardly have to do anything to it now</li>
            <li> It helps to add shine to dull hair.</li>
            <li> Lolz sounds confusing, but</li>
            <li> A thick fragrant oil to coat flyaways.</li>
            <li> but I was not very happy at all with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products but get only mediocre results due to the bad condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle I purchased from Amazon it was just as described</li>
            <li> I basically wanted something that can bring some life back into my hair as I was getting quite frustrated.</li>
            <li> but it was just not good quality.</li>
            <li> Would definately recommend this to anyone who has frizzy, lifeless and dull hair!</li>
            <li> I hardly style my hair without it!</li>
            <li> Hardly any fly-away frizzies!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, but it was so expensive I quit using it.  </li>
            <li> I rub some on for touch ups between grooming and even the tough spots remain matt free!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help that the company sent me a bottle with a broken pump and didn&#x27;t offer to replace it when I reported it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten all my friends addicted.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m crazy about the smell, and it seems hard to remove from my hair, even when I use a shampoo that is supposed to remove product residue.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> I am giving it one star because it is fake.</li>
            <li> I used Moroccan oil and was skeptical about using something else.</li>
            <li> I found this too oily for thinner hair, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in 4 months and I could probably still go on without cutting it because of this oil!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair would be so angry if they stop selling it!</li>
            <li> I have always had bad experiences with putting oils and silicones in my hair because they would make it look dirty and greasy</li>
            <li> maybe she&#x27;s allergic to some of the content or maybe the product is just bad</li>
            <li> Just impossible!  </li>
            <li> I have curley hair, and without any product it looks horrible...</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m crazy about the smell, and it seems hard to remove from my hair, even when I use a shampoo that is supposed to remove product residue. It didn&#x27;t help that the company sent me a bottle with a broken pump and didn&#x27;t offer to replace it when I reported it.  It does smooth my hair, but given a choice of a better-smelling, easier to remove product, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product without weighing your hair down, like it&#x27;s competitors.</li>
            <li> I have fine highlighted hair &amp; I use a dime sized drop of this oil before I blow dry it &amp; it cuts my blow dry time almost in half &amp; it makes my hair feel like silk!!!!  I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it.  I also use the masque from the same line once a week &amp; their detangle brushes.  I love this companies products!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife bought the mask repair and had to get this as well.  Now I live in a Macadamia world!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  I was buying it at a Beauty store... for WAY too much.  So I looked online and literally got it for half the price.  It makes your hair very soft, easy to comb through and smelling great.  It also does NOT make your hair look or feel greasy.  I only wish they sold it in larger sizes!</li>
            <li> wonderful product.  use it on my hair and sometimes even put on my arms and hand.  great fragrance.</li>
            <li> This oil is one of the best ones I have ever tried.  It has wonderful moisturizing ability.  Always, always worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! My hair is very thick and frizzy, but using this product helps to smooth it and it protects my hair from the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle in 6 months and I&#x27;m dismayed that with the slight packaging change there also seems to be a formula change as well. It&#x27;s just not as effective and doesn&#x27;t have the same great scent. So regrettably I won&#x27;t risk another purchase.</li>
            <li> been using this for about 6 months now.  you don&#x27;t need much, just apply to ends...really smoothes and makes my hair look so soft.</li>
            <li> I used smaller bottle before, which helped my hair better. As my hair is dry and damaged. Then I decided to get biger size, this one smells kinda same, but I dont see much improvement of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair that gets very dry and brittle on the ends.  I use this product daily on the ends and it keeps my hair soft and shiny. I have seen a huge difference in my hair with less breakage.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have ever used on my hair!  Makes my hair so soft and even helps it to dry faster!  Just use it from about half way down your hair, not on scalp or your scalp will look oily.</li>
            <li> I use this to define my curls, especially in humid weather when it can get a bit frizzy or in cold weather when my hair becomes a little more limp.  The smell is divine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great price.</li>
            <li> Just received this last week and this really works. I have never used any hair treatment in my life and recently decided to purchase this based on reviews. My hair is long, dried out from daily straightening and drying, and frizzy. I basically wanted something that can bring some life back into my hair as I was getting quite frustrated. After only one use (I mixed some of the oil into my conditioner), I immediately noticed the difference. My hair was a lot smoother and looked so nice! After my second use, I received compliments on how healthy my hair is... THIS NEVER HAPPENS! I, of course, recommended this to anyone who ask how I got my hair so healthy.   Basically, buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it! This stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair.  My aunt told me to try it &amp; I did.  It is MAGICAL in how smooth it makes my hair</li>
            <li> After numerous hair colors and corrections to follow, my hair was breaking off, dry and dull!  This stuff has made an amazing difference.  I used to have to blow dry, then flat iron...now I can get away with just blow drying.  Worth a try!  You will be happy with the result.  A little goes a long way.  Use too much and you WILL have greasy looking hair!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from this product. I have very damaged hair from years of coloring and daily heat styling. It&#x27;s dull (no shine at all), breaks off, and is very dry. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products but get only mediocre results due to the bad condition of my hair. This product, however, is amazing!! I&#x27;ve used it twice, and it&#x27;s nearly transformed my hair. It&#x27;s shiny, soft, hydrated, and it looks so healthy. I will be recommending this to all my hair-abusing friends, and stocking up for myself. And I&#x27;ll definitely be trying the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (sparingly) for a while now, sometimes substituting olive oil or coconut oil depending on the weather.  This is a great everyday styling oil - I have fine, colour-damaged hair, and using one pump smooths the frizz and brings out the curls a little.  I&#x27;ll use two pumps before a braid, but only if I&#x27;m going to wash it the next day.  It doesn&#x27;t get greasy unless you use way too much, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up.  I can&#x27;t really comment on long-term effects, though, because I started using it at the same time I gave up heat styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight negative for me is the scent - I don&#x27;t much like foodie scents, and this stuff smells kind of like candy or something.  Fortunately it doesn&#x27;t linger or clash with my perfume, according to others.  Also, the pump dispenser makes it messy for travel, but you could put a small amount into a travel bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past year and love it (and it smells fantastic!)  However, found that I was able to purchase it from this vendor thru Amazon at a much better price than what I had been paying!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE macadamia oil! This vendor however, took a legitimate looking bottle and filled it with some clear off white oooz. doesnt look or smell like macadamia. The lid camed taped shut, but there was still product all over the box. I will never try to save a buck again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried putting oil in my hair before for fear of having my hair weigh down and I am so pleased to say that this oil did not do that! This oil has a thicker consistency than normal oil and has a very strong musky smell. My hair is fine, dull, frizzy and loves puffing out but after using this, my hair is totally transformed! It is now soft, shiny and the frizz are gone! Super helpful in climates with high humidity cause it tames your frizz for the WHOLE day. I normally put one pump of this after I wash my hair in the mornings and maybe half a pump of their leave in conditioner to keep my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;m so in love with this product that I&#x27;ve already bought another to stock up on it cause my country does not sell this. Would definately recommend this to anyone who has frizzy, lifeless and dull hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my long, dry hair. After washing &amp; conditioning my hair, I apply the leave-in cream then I add a half pump of the healing oil just to my ends. My hair looks so soft and nourished! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell! It&#x27;s great for the hair. I definitely  recommend buying</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it leaves my hair very soft and nourished. It is a thick oil, so it is best if you use small quantities until desired results. I have tried the spray version of this one and it is not as good, it seems to be dilute. I have used this for a few years now and it is a must whenever I wash my hair. My hair is thick, long and wavy, it tends to get frizzy and dry in the ends, this makes it look healthy without making it sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this product at first but had seen so many good reviews on Youtube and read them here on Amazon that I decided to give it a try. This oil is amazing! It is very light and smells delicious. I have always had bad experiences with putting oils and silicones in my hair because they would make it look dirty and greasy and they would like weigh it down. Not the case at all with this oil. Now I use this oil to revive my hair. I love it! I laso use other products in this line that I absolutely love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have TYPE 3B curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 2-3 times. it&#x27;s not fragrance free and smells like indian incense.  fyi: i have indian hair  one application allowed for a silky-smooth (yes sounds very commercial like but it&#x27;s true!) texture. My scrunchie has slipped quite a few times haha. One thing to note is that my hair seems to have become more straight than it usually it after using the product.  i&#x27;m not sure how long this will last but price is definitely a big factor but i&#x27;d definitely recommend everyone to try it at least once :)</li>
            <li> I have 2C - 3A hair. I apply a dab of this after I towel dry my hair and it moisturizes without any visible oiliness, and leaves my hair soft, silkier, shinier and, free of frizz and fly-aways. It has a moderate fragrance that is a bit sweet at first, but luckily the fragrance dissipates away after a short time.  I also apply a tiny amount after my hair is dry during the day if it needs a moisture and shine boost.  This bottle has been lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle was open a little and some of the product got all over everything inside the box. Not impressed. The product itself was good as always but I was not very happy at all with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair overly greasy looking (which can be a problem for me) and it makes it soft!  The scent is great but if you are sensitive to scents, you will not care for it.  I first purchased this from my stylist, who got me hooked on it, only to find out at my very next appt that it was discontinued.  My stylist warned me to watch out for &amp;#34;imposters&amp;#34; but this one was in the right bottle (pay attention to the detail in the picture) and was sealed and when I opened it, that familiar scent confirmed it was the correct product.</li>
            <li> You just need a dime to quarter size amount of this serum depending on your hair length.  It gives body and shine to dull hair.  Ends the dry look and fly-aways.  A must have for me now.  Especially protectful to have this product on my hair when I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is chemical treated with perm and frequent color treatments. My hair has lost it shine from too many processes. I&#x27;ve tried many hair gloss/ serum, they were either too heavy, greasy or didn&#x27;t do anything. I got a small bottle of this Macadamia Oil Healing oil Treatment and didn&#x27;t give much of expectation but after a few use on my damp hair. My hair looks resilient and bouncy. It didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or leave grease on my hand. Even my friends had noticed and asked what I&#x27;ve done to my soft hair. I&#x27;m def. stick with this products and will never change. I brought a big bottle and wish it comes in a larger one! :) Im happy with this oil and THIS IS THE ONE!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything it claimed to do.  ended up throwing it out.  not pleased with product at all.</li>
            <li> I super like all the line of Macadamia. I have the Deep repair mask and this so far and it made my hair super soft and shiny. I wash my hair everyday because my hair gets so greasy if I don&#x27;t but this oil doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, i can skip a day without washing my hair now. I would love to try their rejuvenating shampoo as well and the conditioner, but if you&#x27;re thinking of buying something from this line definitely get this Healing Oil and the Deep repair mask. Must-have!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!!! MUST BUY!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thin blonde hair but a large thick amount and this oil I use when my hair is wet (about a nickel size amount) and run my fingers through. I blow dry and use about 5 drops worth to finish a glossy sheen look. My hair is so soft and smooth and I love how healthy it is since starting the use of the oil about 3 months ago. I dont really have any split ends and my hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality to pamper your hair</li>
            <li> This did wonders to my hair!!! I will be geting more when i run out!!I wouldnt put it on the roots though bc it will make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> I ADORE this product. My hair dresser uses it on my hair and it retails for almost double what the prices are on Amazon. Not only does it smell amazing, but your hair feels incredibly smooth after it&#x27;s dried.  I was skeptical about cutting the drying time down, but it actually does take less time when you have the product in your hair. My hair falls just below the top of my shoulders and I typically use 3/4 of one pump. If you use too much your hair looks a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this - your hair dries faster and smoother! The flat iron does not damage your hair with this - silky soft!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! My hair has never felt so soft! I use this product everyday. I even mix this product with a hair mask to really condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Best product for controlling frizz- doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily!</li>
            <li> I put this product in my curly hair before I straighten it and it adds shine and leaves my hair smelling great.  When I put this in my naturally curly hair and let it air dry it does make my hair shiny, but it does not do that great of a job controlling frizz.  I do need to use a mousse or gel when using this product in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The Macadamia Oil is something I discovered a few years ago with my hair stylist. Living in the desert, my scalp has a tendancy to get very dry, but this oil is fantastic. It keeps the moisture I need in my scalp and does wonders for my hair as well. I look for split ends and don&#x27;t see any. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that has a dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! My hair has never been shinier or softer. And the scent is fantastic! I was worried that my hair would be greasy, but you only need a small amount and it is completely absorbed. I highly recommend this product and the others I bought from this company through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have very, very thick white blonde (dyed) hair. This stuff not only speeds up my drying time, but it helps keep my hair feeling healthy. I hardly style my hair without it!</li>
            <li> I used it right when I got it from the mail man! I immediately felt and saw a difference. This product actually absorbs into your hair, unlike other oils that just seem to be a temporary shine. Can be used on damp or dry hair, which I love!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling great. I use it daily on my ends to minimize breakage and dryness plus all over for shine.  It&#x27;s lighter than argan/morroccan oil which I find  too heavy for my wavy-curly 3b/c hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product! Just a little on the ends when my hair is dry and I really feel it makes a big difference in my hair! It feels less dry and very healthy! No issues with the shipper/seller either. Overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li> My cousin loves this oil and told me about it.  I found it here at Amazon a lot cheaper then what she paid at the regular store.  I ordered it based on her recommendation.  I was not impressed with it.  I saw her yesterday and gave it to her.  She was very happy.  I guess its not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair and as long as you don&#x27;t put this near your roots, the amount of shine it adds is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this for quite a bit more at Ulta and in my opinion, the product is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: brunette, long, thin, wavy/frizzy.  I only use this when my hair is wet/damp -- when I put it on my dry hair it makes it greasy.</li>
            <li> This oil is surprisingly thick, but light weight on the hair...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for going on a year now and do not use any other oil. It moisturizes extremelyyyy well while leaving a light, clean, fragrant scent.</li>
            <li> It  arrived cracked but it was easily replaced.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I think it made my hair friz, did not prevent it at all. Will stick with the Enjoy line of hair care.</li>
            <li> IL make my hair butter</li>
            <li> I have been to my hair stylist a couple of times and noticed that she uses a range of macadamia hair products. In fact I have been given a couple of compliments on the healthy look of my hair, then I realized that the macadamia line is very very good. I see a more healthier, stronger and manageable hair since using this product. So I decided to purchase the macadamia oil to use at home. Trust me it is good.</li>
            <li> Amazing it helps your hair. I&#x27;m in love with it.  It helped with my damaged hair and made it shiny.</li>
            <li> I used a couple other types of oils and this one seems to hydrate the best and leaves hair smelling awesome!  I noticed my hair is not nearly as dry, my hair drying time is cut in half since I have long hair so this was great, and the shine and healthy look of my hair is great.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Macadamia oil for a few years. This bottle of oil smells different than the others I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s a little thinner in consistency and feels different on my hair too. I checked to make sure it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and it&#x27;s the same bottle but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same product-.Maybe they changed their formula?</li>
            <li> I have curley hair, and without any product it looks horrible... this stuff makes my curls very soft and it smells great... I use it when my hair is damp and I also use it in my bangs when I want to strighten them... It keeps them stright and soft all day. It does not make them oily at all! I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked it smells nice and keeps my hair monistrized</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an oil for your hair GET THIS! It smells amazing, feels great, and actually makes your hair look and feel healthy.  Best place to buy it is amazon.  The normal price for this stuff is at least $40.  Definitely will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Worth the hype! Smells great and super thick and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this oil. Is it the best? No, but it is wonderful for the ends for your hair. The smell is nice too better than argon oil. My only complaint is that I have had this oil before and the smell was different it was a lot better and I would be able to smell it on my hair all day. I would buy this again because I do not get greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much better than moroccan oil. It works just as well and I think it&#x27;s a little cheaper. Also, because the oil is lighter I don&#x27;t think it turns your hair red the way that the dark moroccan oil can.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of natural oils for hair, this is by far my favorite! It makes my hair so soft, not oily, and smells amazing! This is the third bottle I have bought. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! First of all the bottle is gorgeous and heavy duty glass with a beautiful pump! but careful! a little goes a long way you may not even need a whole pump.! you can use this on dry, damp or wet hair. i use it on all of the above. So i used this a lot in Hawaii when i was on vacation to help manage the frizz due to humidity, and let me tell ya...IT WORKED. Not only that but it smells amazing! I cant truely describe the smell but its tropical and nutty to me. pros: combats frizz,leaves hair shiny regardless of when you put it in, can be mixed into shampoos and conditioners for extra healing, definitely heals the look of damaged hair. cons: pricey, too much will make hair oily, pump should be adjusted to a smaller pump rate</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair oil.  I have extremely fine hair, only one or two pumps is enough.  I have tried many different kinds of hair oils, but they all leave my hair looking greasy, yuck!  I have also tried several that have funny smells.  This has an nice earthy smell, I notice it when I put it in, but after a few minutes, I don&#x27;t notice it at all.  Use it on wet hair only.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivery.</li>
            <li> very good. My hair feels great when using this product. and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My husband and daughter have the same hair. Both naturally curely with irish friz. This helps their frizzies. Makes their hair more manageable.,</li>
            <li> Macadamia oil deep repair mask is great too, but this oil treatment is the key ingredient to to healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the smell and it really makes my hair look healthy, shiny and it really gives it nice volume when styling. I don&#x27;t have to use as much product when I use this after washing my hair and that&#x27;s awesome. I share this with my sister in law because a little goes a long way. She has super thick hair and it even works great for her! She just has to use more of it with her hair being a lot longer and thicker than mine.</li>
            <li> awesome, just like promised! I  love this stuff and it&#x27;s 1/2  the price here than in the stores.  I&#x27;ll be back</li>
            <li> This oil is terrific. I have very thick, curly hair that easily expands with heat and humidity. This helps greatly with the frizz. A small amount suffices and it smells really good. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I love the smell of the oil and my hair dries so much faster when I use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter. Price was great! Product came quickly but it was lighter in color than the one I&#x27;m familiar with. Question whether it was authentic. Was disappointed that the shipping cost almost as much as the product. If I had known I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered. Ended up not being the good deal that I thought it would be! Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I inherited this oil from my wife who thought it smelled to manly for her. I has become my beard oil and it works great. The smell is wonderful and it makes my beard shine and help to keep me from looking like a frizz ball.</li>
            <li> Im a guy...and this oil instantly makes my hair soft smoothe with shine to it. every since i started this...my woman been giving me the goods everyday because she cant stop smelling and rubbing my hair...i recommend this for guys.....trust me..women will give you all the &amp;#34;attention&amp;#34; you want all night and day long. just because of your hair.</li>
            <li> I do not even bother to heat it up!  The oil helps my hair to feel so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This has cured skin problems that NOTHING else would.  My husband had trouble with his hands breaking out, even to the point of bleeding, and nothing would cure it.  Steroids would clear it up for a while but it always returned.  Same for his brother who had skin problems on his arms.  An acquaintance who heard about it tried it with the same result.  This person has suffered with extreme problems on his feet since his exposure to Agent Orange.  Another one we told about who is older and bedridden was glad that it cured his bedsores.  Everyone is pleased!</li>
            <li> if you have dry or damaged hair, this is for you. makes my hair super soft. i will only purchase from this vendor. not only do they offer the lowest prices for name brand procucts, but they stand behind what they sell.</li>
            <li> Packaging could have been better but the product itself was great! Totally love the way it makes hair shiny and lustrous.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its smells great and has made my hair shiny while taking the frizz down. Worth the $$</li>
            <li> This product wasnn&#x27;t as effective and the bottle was almost half empty....nothing like the salon bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this oil my first purchase was at cvs and then I found it cheaper online and I&#x27;m avsolutely in love it leaves hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I bought this from Red Carpet Distributor. The product I received is different than the ones I purchased directly at Marcadamia Oil. The smell is very different (this one has a strong musk smell), and the texture and color are also different. This is definitely a generic product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a couple of years now, I just learnt that its a mixture macademia oil and argan oil. its really good it makes my hair manageable and shiny. I love it</li>
            <li> You can only use a tiny amount of this stuff so its hard to get full coverage. It has a funky almost rotten smell. I could not use the whole bottle. I gave up on it early. I was excited to like this product but it was just not good quality.</li>
            <li> I received man order quicker then expected!</li>
            <li> I love this oil and found it cheaper on amazon :)&lt;br /&gt;I first tries it as a sample and I liked it so much I had to get a bottle</li>
            <li> Very happy to find it cheaper on Amazon.  I have used this product in the past, but it was so expensive I quit using it.  Great for hair and smells excellent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! The only recommendation I have it to NOT apply this product near/at your roots. If applied like so when hair is still wet, the hair will dry and look greasy/get oiler a lot faster than it normally would. Other than that, no complaints! This product leaves my hair super smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon because the price was better than the store. The color and fragrance is not the same as the ones that I have used before. The product worked well, but it is not the real branded product. I am giving it one star because it is fake.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great treatment for dry ends. It works like a treatment not just a cosmetic oil you put on your hair</li>
            <li> if you have frizzy or curly hair this product&lt;br /&gt;is great! You&#x27;ll be tempted to go over bores with it but a pea sized amount is more than enough. I would suggest around the middle or tips of your hair but not you roots because it&#x27;ll give it a greasy look but at the bottom it looks more like a healthy shine. smells amazing too if you like an earthy sweet smell.</li>
            <li> My wife had rash after using this product maybe she&#x27;s allergic to some of the content or maybe the product is just bad</li>
            <li> This is a good hair oil and it smells very nice also. My hair was destroyed by Regis salon and it took a lot of conditioners and oils to keep it looking half way decent with a straigtening iron before I could cut the damage off without shaving it bald.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for sometime and I really like the way it makes my hair feel and it&#x27;s looks so shinny</li>
            <li> I have thick hair on the coarse side which has always been resistant to holding a curl or wave and does just what it wants to do.  My hair is pretty straight but with this product I HAVE CURL AND WAVE for the first time in my life!  I hardly have to do anything to it now and I love it.  The smell is practically nonexistent and should not be of concern.  I have hair just past the shoulders and use 2 pumps in damp hair.  No oily feeling or look at all and it absorbs quickly.  Also allows the hair to dry quicker for some reason.</li>
            <li> A course, I&#x27;m a YouTube user and I saw a lot of people saying the deep repair mask and the healing oil does a wonderful job! I had to try out the products and let me say I don&#x27;t have spilt ends! I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in 4 months and I could probably still go on without cutting it because of this oil!&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend this product to anyone. It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Other products are to heavy for my fine hair.  This soaks in so well that I can leave it in for a couple of days and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or messy. Great healing properties as well!  My hair has gone berserk with menopause (doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be curly or straight, or god help us: brillo pad) this stuff WORKS!  It gives definition and even encourages some wave and curl!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have bought it over and over again.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me a sample size of this oil and absolutely loved it for my hair. However, I started noticing a difference in my hands. Very good for dry skin as well as my hair. So glad I found this large size.</li>
            <li> Always have loved this product</li>
            <li> you know how dry your hair can get in the summer - fret no more!  this is a great product</li>
            <li> I always use this in my hair. It smells so good, but it feels even better in my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> The oil I ordered did not have the same texture not color as the oil bought from the salon. It seemed quite different. The oil could have changed, but I preferred the last bottle I bought from the salon over this one. The delivery of the product was fine. The product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Makes my frizzies go away and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is amazing after I used the product</li>
            <li> Very Helpfull for my hair stop losing . Easy to use it , but next time when you shipping , should need instruction book with it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried them all, and this one&#x27;s a keeper!  I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this product!  Compared to other, quality oil treatments, this one stands out!  Some have mentioned they don&#x27;t like the scent but I have no problem with it.  Whenever I use this product, my hair feels and looks like a hair model (no joke)!  It makes my hair bouncy and full, smooth without being fly-away, and manageable.  I&#x27;m happy with the way it instantly makes my hair look like the healthiest hair on the planet (which is isn&#x27;t), so I will continue to use this treatment forever!  Love and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> So rejuvenating!!!! Smells good. Not greasy!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair care product... Sells for upwards of $70 elsewhere but I only paid little over $19 for it here&lt;br /&gt;If you want soft hair that doesn&#x27;t frizz, isn&#x27;t oily after treating and requires minimal effort, this is a product for you.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair so I have to treat my hair a lot and this oil smells amazing and makes your hair very soft. I definitely recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil for my and my daughters hair.  When I received my original order of 2 bottles, 1 bottle was perfectly in tack.  The second bottle had opened just enough and oil had leaked inside and all over the box.  I contacted the company and they were very prompt to not only apologize but to see if I wanted a refund or a replacement bottle.  I have not yet received the replacement (should be any day), but they were very prompt and professional and very nice.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The scent is different and I didn&#x27;t like it at first. But by the second day, it was just fine. It&#x27;s a good oil, but I will keep searching for one that smells a little different.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong for me</li>
            <li> My hair feel very soft and nourished after using this product.  Also, bought it for my mother who has extremely dry and damaged hair.  It has restored her hair to a more natural look.</li>
            <li> This oil is great, I love the consistency of it. It&#x27;s amazing for a wash n go and before I blow out my hair</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I found another brand of Argan oil that is way better! It&#x27;s [[ASIN:B001U9M2EW Agadir  Argan Oil Treatment, 4-Ounce]] and it&#x27;s amazing!! It absorbs way better than Macadamia and I just love it! Try them both and see what you like but Agadir I feel is easier to spread in my hair and I just like it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the travel pack with the 1 ounce version of this to test it out. My hair was dry and needed to go get relaxed and flat ironed, but I hadn&#x27;t gone to the salon as yet. Even though this thing is supposed to revive dry hair, I think it&#x27;s too light to do that for my hair since it&#x27;s relaxed. If I use it when my hair is dry and damaged it won&#x27;t work, it just dissolves too much into my hair. It doesn&#x27;t work to \\&quot;bring back\\&quot; my hair like it&#x27;s purpose, but rather it maintains the moisture &amp; good look, so I get my hair relaxed/ or get it washed and flat ironed and then a day passes and then I&#x27;d use the oil for like 3 days in a row after, and after that my hair keeps moisturized and I won&#x27;t have to apply it until maybe 2 days after or until after I wash it. Lolz sounds confusing, but yeah, &amp; oh it smells great too, it has a nice deep &amp; musky scent to it. This thing helps to keep my hair looking, feeling, and actually being great WITHOUT weighing my hair down -cuz i know a lot us dark girls have that problem! But my hair can still move and all and it still has that freshly flat ironed look! So if you have relaxed hair then give this a try, but would probably work way better if you get your hair relaxed and flat ironed first. This has been a God send for me :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product three times. The first time was great! The second was a mess... I believe the oil was still authentic because it did a wonderful job in smoothing my hair, but there must be some packaging problem that the oil dribbled out from the bottle after I used it for two weeks. I thought maybe that was just a one-time issue so I bought them again. Same problem! I am really disappointed since I am spending the money only to use half the bottle, since the other half was leaking and became dry.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product - if you have damaged color treated hair give this a try it did wonders for me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells amazing, and make my hair very silky. I have tried so many hair oils but this in one of my favs!</li>
            <li> I really wish 0-star ratings were possible. Anyway, the scent is very strong and nauseating. It also had 0 effect after multiple tries. What else is there to say except that it doesn&#x27;t do its job?</li>
            <li> When I used this product,I loved it. You have to be careful not to put too much on. I think it&#x27;s best if you comb through your hair, and it really makes your hair soft and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Love it, couldn&#x27;t do my hair without it! It gives my hair a smooth look without weighing it down. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so silky after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healing Oil Treatment: a therapeutic oil perfect for all hair types and is especially beneficial to dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Offers intense nourishment, smoothing and a long-lasting, tangle-free, frizz-free finish for hair that is ultra-smooth, manageable and shiny&lt;br /&gt;* Instantly absorbs into the hair for a lightweight, non-greasy feel&lt;br /&gt;* Shown to extend the life of color treatments by reducing fading&lt;br /&gt;* Provides natural UV protection&lt;br /&gt;* Reduces drying time by 40-50 percent</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend! Use when wet to avoid looking/greasy when applied dried. Don&#x27;t need too much, pretty strong product. Also loved shampoo/conditioner, &amp; deep masque!</li>
            <li> My sister uses this product and says that it&#x27;s remarkable. Regardless of its high price, we have purchased this product multiple times. It comes with a unique smell along with its properties of making your hair very smooth and soft. This product price is high, but it&#x27;s money well spent. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  And it smells wonderful!  I have fine, curly hair and this does wonders for the texture.  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and looked damaged from color and the flat iron.  This product repaired my hair and it looks healthy and not greasy, just silky. Put a dime size on your palm and apply to wet hair, then style.  It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was but it wasn&#x27;t the real macadamia oil. I was first tipped off when I opened the pump and it didn&#x27;t close like the first one I had. But I figured it was a product change. Then When I used it the smell was completely different, as was the color and consistancy. The real stuff is amaizng, this seller sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I purchase this item for my daughter for christmas she love it,  it smell really good it make your hair feel soft and manageable.  oso fare so good</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Smells great!  Lasts so long because you just need to use a dab.  Fanstastic and makes my hair smooth and takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; it arrived in a timely manner.  I do think I prefer the spray container better only because you can use the oil more sparingly. This is a great product for skin &amp; hair (protecting your hair from heat damage before styling).</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for hair in hard water conditions and good for your hands too after you run the oil through your damp hair.  Do it after you wash your hair, and use a spare amount, rubbing in open palms and fingers, then lightly coat hair.  The emphasis on light.  Any excess is good for your hands too.  Since I started using this, I have no need for conditioner which just clogs up everything.</li>
            <li> The best hair treatment oil around, it make the hair silky smooth and so shinny people want to know what I used on my hair.</li>
            <li> IM A NATURAL HAIR GAL AND MY HAIR LOVES THIS OIL.IT ABSORBS GREAT NO GREASY AFTER FEELING .PACKAGING WAS GOOD AS WELL</li>
            <li> I use this pretty regularly and a little goes a long way.  it&#x27;s great for those dry and splitting ends</li>
            <li> I have extra long, thick, extra curly hair. I have been searching my entire life going through many different products that just did not do the trick quite like this does. This Macadamia Oil Healing Oil Treatment, about 10-14 pumps for my hair length, run through the strands. For myself, I apply starting about an inch away from the roots going down to the tips. The Macadamia Oil Healing Oil makes it shiny, smell good, and allows the curls to form ringlet, perfect curls. I Love This Product &amp; I Love My Hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very long , fine wavy hair and I am in the ocean all the time . I just love the smell and how it makes ,y hair feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to honestly say that this is heavier than Morccan Oil . I love Moroccan Oil and that is what I would use to go out shopping or to dinner. With the Macadamia Oil , one large pump is probably heavier than the average person who is not going surfing later, would want in their hair. That said, a dime or pea size would leave soft, beautifully delicious smelling hair. One large pump leaves my hair a bit greasy, which I like, and my hair is almost to my waist. The smell is simply Devine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend their tub if conditioner . It is one of two products I&#x27;ve ever found that will make the driest , hardest snarls just melt away into silky, soft hair....and it smells delicious as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally got the oil as a sample and have been buying it consistently ever since. If you have coarse or thick hair , you will love to use this anytime. If you have fine hair, a bottle should last you months!</li>
            <li> Love love love - can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product. Makes my hair soft, smells great, and helps my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> This is $60 or more at salons or stores and I got it for $18. It&#x27;s great and lasts soooo long!</li>
            <li> i thought the product was in great condition, and it all went well. thank you very much. i will probably repurchase</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve 2 years to use it. This product help my hair a lot. My hair is curly and look soft, shine and health. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> ok, not sure i will really use it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!!  But my bottle pump didn&#x27;t work.  I had to pour it into an old container with a working pump.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used a tiny bit on my hair and gave me a sample.  I like to rub it on my hands as well.  Nice.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is great...i used about a dime size and I have short hair...thats a bit frizzy and i use a flat iron and this stuff makes my hair look really nice and touchable. i does have a musky smell but i love it...kind of earthy hippyish smell...</li>
            <li> I have color  in my hair and this product keeps my hair shiny and soft. It is great for all types of hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have dry thinning fly-away hair and I find the macadamia oil is a great styling treatment.  Apply a small amount to damp hair just before blow drying. Hair dries quicker and will not appear or feel oily.  I have chin length hair and only use about 1/4 tsp. Washing my hair every other day, this bottle will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> Macadamia Oil Healing Oil is wonderful for dry hair and to create a wonderful shine - but just use a drop</li>
            <li> Wow! This is a great hair treatment that really delivers! I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! It leaves my hair looking healthy &amp; shiny but not at all greasy. Also has a very pleasant fragrance. Found it on Amazon for much less than it cost at other retailers.</li>
            <li> I own a hair salon, so someone had left a sample of this product, which I used when I bathed and groomed my fuzzy Afghan Hound. From that time on his grooming has become so much easier and his fur keeps it&#x27;s silkiness and doesn&#x27;t matt as easily. So much so that I ordered this large pump bottle of the stuff.  I can now go about 5-6 weeks between shampoos instead of 2-3 weeks because the fuzz is gone and the texture has actually changed. I rub some on for touch ups between grooming and even the tough spots remain matt free!&lt;br /&gt;Oh...and it&#x27;s good for my hair too!</li>
            <li> i loooooovvvveeeee this product!!!!  makes my hair look shiny and smooth and soft...&lt;br /&gt;i have thick italian hair and have tried everything to make it look better...&lt;br /&gt;this did it!!!  i would buy a gallon of it if i could!!! :)</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair, it works fine so far. The smell is really really strong tho.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my girlfriend, who owns her own salon. She said customers love this oil but it is so popular it is hard to get your hands on any. I tried Amazon, found it and ordered it. Then I told her to just order it on Amazon vs. trying to get some through her product rep.  It smells AMAZING, first of all. I have naturally curly hair and I color probably every 3 weeks. My hair always needs a little TLC. I use this daily now, just a tiny bit.  I put mousse or gel in my hair and then a touch of Macadamia Oil healing Oil, and my hair feels and looks amazing.  It&#x27;s a must ~ have!</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail hair product! Really repairs your hair and puts my frizzy hair at ease so I can wear it natural. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This oil works great on my curly hair. It smells nice and is thicker than most other oils (coconut, agave, olive). For my curly hair, I use this as soon as I  wash my hair: after washing, squeeze &amp; shake dry (Don&#x27;t use towels! They rough up your hair shaft!), apply the oil &amp; do something else for 5 minutes. Then, I come back and low, cool dry my hair with a diffuser. Cue shiny, bouncy curls. For reference, I have thick, coarse, curly hair that frizzes on the top. Between washings, I use a tiny dot, rub between my hands, then reshape my curls with the oil on my hands.</li>
            <li> This oil have multiple uses for body and hair. The scent is subtle I purchased from Amazon it was just as described</li>
            <li> wonderful product.....my hair is naturally curly, wavy and thick. I use this product after blow drying and straightening it. It makes it soft and silky. Cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and frizzy and this serum is fantastic, leaves my hair soft, easy to styling, removes the frizzy and remains my hair very soft until the next wash. Leave my hair super shiny. I am very happy with Macademia brand also the mask to use after shampoo is great. I love this products.</li>
            <li> I can truly feel the difference when I use it. My daughters and I love this oil. leaves your hairs so soft, shiny and silkie.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for hair, or skin, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a present, but both my mother and sister love this product.  The seller was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Starting using this product from my hair dresser! But so much cheaper to order from Amazon! Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for very thick dry hair.  It leaves lots of moisture and makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel terrific! I would never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I try to make sure I always have some on hand.  It makes my hair smooth, shiney and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist and Im so glad she did. Leaves my hair smelling great and reduces my blowdrying time. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my daughter - she loves it -- the best in all oil hair treatments found.</li>
            <li> Love the product, makes your hair so smooth and silky, easy to comb and gives fresh look. Your hair is rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I bought it once from ulta and felt in love with it. The only difference is the price. Ulta have it for $39.99 before taxes. I&#x27;m very happy I got this deal.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I put it on the ends of my hair and on my scalp every night before I go to sleep. It has definitely helped with my dry scalp and I see an improvement in my hair. I also use it as a hot oil treatment once a month.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this product on Maui and was thrilled I could buy it here. It&#x27;s thick, smells great and only requires a small amount to smooth out my dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more…….. very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps to detangle my hair very nicely.  A little goes a long way.  I find it just as good as Morrocan Oil which is nice because it is less expensive.  I found a product I cannot live without.</li>
            <li> Totally love it. I am very impressed by the way it is packed and its quality is absolutely perfect. Makes my hair smooth and silky, totally not oily as other kind. The smell is fresh, just how I like it.</li>
            <li> works for my thick hair with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The scent is great and it has made wonders for my hair.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this treatment.</li>
            <li> My neighbor let me try a bit of her supply of this oil and I was hooked!!  After flat ironing or curling my hair, I rub a nickel sized amount on my hands and massage it into the ends of my hair and it makes my hair look healthier.  It doesn&#x27;t make my split ends disappear or anything so don&#x27;t expect a miracle!  Just a great product to reduce the frizziness!!!</li>
            <li> This is a mostly natural product that works well on my hair before I flat iron it straight.  Can be a little tricky to use just the right amount to avoid getting greasy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Works great on Hispanic hair:)</li>
            <li> Best hair oil ever! my hair is rough and tangled after the shower this is a miracle! i love it and use it after blowdrying my hair. Also it was fast shipping and much cheaper than in the stores , great buy</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  I color my hair and it has gotten coarser and frizzier with age.  This product calms my hair down and makes it sooooo soft.  My hairdresser gave me the tip of applying it before I color (diy) to help condition my hair and make it easier to comb the color through.  It also makes it easier to get the color off the skin around the hair line.  A little goes a long way, so I don&#x27;t have to feel guilty for indulging in this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works great for all hair types! I have fine thin wavy hair (and I have a friend that uses this who has really thick and very dry curly hair) and we both adore this Macadamia hair oil :-)  I use about a half of a pump while my hair is wet to protect from heat/styling, and then will sometimes add another 1/4 pump to my dry hair to smooth out anything else after styling as well as to add shine... and will also add to the ends to &#x27;reconstruct&#x27; from any heat styling.  Finally, everytime I go to get my hair cut I&#x27;m always told how soft and healthy my hair is!  I&#x27;ve been highlighting my hair blonde for years (14 years to be exact) and decided to go more towards my natural color for awhile, my stylist was shocked that my hair was in such good condition from being blonde for so long (as she calls it: usually gets destroyed).  This serum has helped my overall hair health as well as definitely helped to repair years of damage.  I love having healthy hair :-) Added bonus: hubby loves how my hair feels, smells, and looks.  If hubby notices, then it&#x27;s got to be good :-P</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, unruly wavy/curlyish hair in my middle age.  Just impossible!  This helps to soften, smooth out and nourish my naughty locks.  I wish it was odor free...it does smell like a woman&#x27;s perfume, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  It is light and absorbs quickly.  My hair would be so angry if they stop selling it!</li>
            <li> I love this product . I have lots of complements a bout my hair. I apply only from the middle of my hair to the tips. It keep my hair so soft the frizz is gone!!! I also use flawless from the same brand. I absolutely recommend it. Amazon have and excellent price.</li>
            <li> This by far one of the best oils that I have ever come across. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down one bit.</li>
            <li> I used Moroccan oil and was skeptical about using something else. Worked perfectly and I actually like it better than Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it every time I wash my hair. I used it with other products for a long time and now I use only this product.  It leaves my hair silky and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon in August and finally got an opportunity to use this product in my 3b/3c hair this week- I straightened my hair after 6 months. I would never use this on my non-straightened hair cause I would use 1/4 of the bottle each time! I really do love how it smells and feels in my hair but I find that the effects does not last throughout the day. My hair seems to be absorbing this product completely after a couple of hours. I would describe my hair strands as being fine/medium and the density of my hair as &#x27;thick&#x27;; when I apply this product to my hair ends, it looks great but then the sheen is gone after a short while. I&#x27;ve been applying this prouct both night and day at an amount equaling 1 1/2 full pumps or in other words, a dollar coin and a quarter coin. The one thing I must rave about though is that today is day 4 of using this oil at the amount described above (2 X a day) and my hair is NOT GREASY nor OILY neither weighed down. My hair is full, loose and flowy. Thank God I only straighten my hair once every 6 months, so this product should last me at least 2 years!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for my hair.  It leaves it really smooth and frizzy hair gets tamed!!</li>
            <li> I have used this hair product longer than any other because it works.  Secondly, it meets the criteria of being easy to dispense, fast to apply and seems to shorten drying time in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product always makes my hair feel so soft and healthy. I wont buy anything else for my hair ever.</li>
            <li> Stuff is like magic for damaged hair. Detangles kid&#x27;s hair like a dream, too.</li>
            <li> This product feels so nice in my hair!</li>
            <li> These produce it make my hair so soft and look very  healthy I am in love with the oil I really recommend this only and 2 use my hairs feel different much better</li>
            <li> great product. it lasts a long time as only a very small amount is needed. love the fragrance. would recommend</li>
            <li> I my hair has been bleach a lot very week and damage and I been washing my hair and using this product for 3 weeks now and I see the difference it have help me a lot i Can Say that is Worth it I Looooveee this Oild Healing Treatment ❤️❤️❤️👌🏻💯</li>
            <li> I grew up with straight hair that suddenly curled after the birth of my son, it&#x27;s oily at the roots and dry at the ends with a lovely Bozo The Clown look when it decides to frizz.  Some products that I have used have left my hair with all of the body of overcooked spaghetti.  This stuff is good - helps tame the frizz, keeps my hair looking healthy without looking oily.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c african american hair and this is the only thing that keeps the frizzies away when I flat iron!!</li>
            <li> I like this oil.  It keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  a little bit goes a long way. Been told that it can color your hair but I didn&#x27;t notice it...just beware if you are pale blonde.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta for a lot more money and loved it.  First oil that did not weigh down my hair and make oily. Then I tried another macadamia oil that was cheaper.  Waste of money as it made my hair feel oily.  This product is the best.  My only complaint is the pump.  My hair is rather short, so I need very little.  Even when you try to just pump it gently I get too much.  So I will put some in the small travel size bottle I have. I love the smell of this oil.  The price here was much better than at Ulta, though I still love that store!</li>
            <li> My hair products shipped right away.  I put in an order with PaylessBeauty at the same time as my order with eKitron, and my order with eKitron arrived before my PaylessBeauty order was even SHIPPED. I could tell the products leaked some, but only a very small amount.  Very very happy with PRICE and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Macadamia Oil Healing Oil treatment for about 8 months and it&#x27;s wonderful!! I add a pump or two to my conditioner, comb thru &amp; sit under the dryer for 15min. Once that&#x27;s rinsed out, I add another pump or two to my leave-in conditioner before roller setting my hair. I&#x27;m still on my original bottle, but am running out so purchased this one. Best price, arrived packaged safely and securely-quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, especially for a dry, colored hair. It makes my hair very shiny and fuller, plus it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I did not care for the smell.  Product works fine.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this oil leaves my hair. I rub it into damp hair, dry hair and style as usual. Sometimes that means using heating tools or air drying and it helps define my waves. It also helps protect my hair from heat damage. Just don&#x27;t use too much on dry hair or it&#x27;ll make your hair look oily, as you&#x27;d expect from a product that&#x27;s an oil. I also bought the little container of this product to be able to travel with it and I refill it with the larger bottle. One bottle lasts a little less than I would like, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product I will continue buying again and again.</li>
            <li> Macadamia products are awesome! My hair is very wild, dry, and curly. I usually have to use tons of hair gel, conditioner, creams, and all frizz control products you can imagine to get it in to place, but this oil has repaired my hair like you have no idea. my hair looks natural-wavy and it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy. I use this oil combined with the deep repair masque, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Exact same product and quality that I get from my hair salon. Love that the bottle is glass. Also, they now sale this at Target... for $18 MORE than what it cost online. Bonus!</li>
            <li> Very smooth &amp; silky feeling. I use it on my skin also. Great product.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but adds a nice shine and manageability to your hair.  Put on wet or dry hair.  Nice scent.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I found this too oily for thinner hair, unfortunately.  I wish I could give it a better review as the deep repair mask in this line is terrific.  It does what I thought this might in terms of shine and condition.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair smell and feel great. I would purchase again. This was such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my hair feel, but it makes my face breakout if it gets near my skin.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry hair.  Adds moisture and makes hair feel silky!!! Love it and would recommend to anyone needing dry hair repair! Does not make hair greasy or limp at all!</li>
            <li> I have a youtube channel where i talk about curly hair in general (hairr) and i use this as a finishing styling product..its amazing i had to do a review on it : CurlsandBeauty ByAndrea</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it smells good and helps tame my long thick corse hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> great oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> this is not a oily feeling product.  Your hair just sucks in the oil and leaves the hair feeling so soft and lusterous.  I love it</li>
            <li> I use this together with the Macadamia hair masque, fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this product and highly recommend it for women with long thick hair!</li>
            <li> I really like how light the oil is...its not heavy at all. I plan to purchase a second bottle in the near future.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.  A thick fragrant oil to coat flyaways. One pump is enough to coat my long hair.</li>
            <li> I love the Macadamia Oil Healing Oil Treatment. I use it while my hair is still wet to help seal in Moisture. It helps to add shine to dull hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin hair that has a mind of its own. After just one use of this product my hair was so soft and silky! Hardly any fly-away frizzies! It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make my hair look greasy either. And the scent is phenomenal! This product has officially replaced Moroccan oil in my book :)</li>
            <li> Best Oil treatment for your hair!!  Smells so good, and doesnt weight down your hair only nourishes it!!  Also great for skin hydraton as well!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite serums! Smells like a delicious men&#x27;s cologne and it makes my hair super smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I am Latina and have thick dry frizzy hair.  Aside from using it as a styling and finishing product, a couple squirts of this Macadamia Healing Oil into some [[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask]] will leave my hair silky smooth, soft and manageable.  Besides the great effects it does to your hair, it also leaves your hair smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount goes a long ways.  Glides on easily and when used as additive to conditioners and other products, rinses out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed and will come to love this stuff as I have.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. It&#x27;s the only I use and I&#x27;ve gotten all my friends addicted. Great for men and women with any type of hair!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but I have a lot of it. I&#x27;ve been growing it out, and the ends were always looking frizzy, even after a cut. This changed everything. It&#x27;s seriously amazing. About a dime sized amount worked into the ends of my hair after I wash it (about twice a week), and my hair is transformed. It&#x27;s shiny, soft, NEVER oily, and super healthy looking. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. It&#x27;s totally worth it in every way.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. A friend recommended that I buy macadamia oil for my hair because it has become a little dry and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; looking while I am in school and stressed. I have been VERY pleased with how much healthier my hair looks. I apply just a little to my wet hair and it looks fresh when dry. I have also been straightening my hair a lot so it has been nice to have the oil to protect my hair as well as make it lay straight all day. It will make your hair look greasy if you go more than a day without washing your hair, at least for me anyway. I end up with a greasy scalp if I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily so this will add to that a little, but I only see it the following day. Highly recommend it though!!! And it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and love it!  If ones wants hair with a great shine and more control, this is the product for you.  It was recommended by my hairdresser and has been well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Love this!  smells good. Feels good on skin and hair</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have very curly aka frizzy hair! My hair dresser started using this when I would get my hair cut/colored and it is amazing. No more frizzies, I have beautiful curls. Usual price is $40 a bottle so less than $20 was great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very wonderful</li>
            <li> I first got a sample of this from my hair salon and I absolutely loved it. It smells great and it makes my hair nice and soft. I just buy it from here because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me a tiny bottle of this just so I could try it.  It has made such a difference with my hair that I color and also get perms.  Now it is soft and easy to manage, so when I used up the small bottle, I got this big one.  I especially like the pump that is on it because I don&#x27;t have to guess how much I am pouring in my hand.</li>
            <li> i like it and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I was currently using this product and purchasing it from my stylist.  But they decided to discontinue and I loved this product.  So I looked to Amazon.  Arrived in a short period of time.  Works well, but my only concern is that is doesn&#x27;t seem to be as &amp;#34;thick of a consistency&amp;#34; as my other product from the salon.  But having said that, it still does the job.</li>
