            <li>and now it is great.</li>
            <li>very nice but plastic rings do not hold glasses well</li>
            <li>These are very handy, well priced, and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>Good for sporty stuff.</li>
            <li>Is good.</li>
            <li>These are good for keeping glasses handy around your neck</li>
            <li>the right price &amp; came very quickly in perfect condition.....works for almost any type of sun or sports glasses.....</li>
            <li>Better than I hoped!</li>
            <li>they are nice quality cord to put your glasses on.</li>
            <li>Works well on reading glasses - nicely adjustable.</li>
            <li>these bands come in handy as I do not need to wear my readers all the time, as of yet anyway.</li>
            <li>The ropes are strong and reliable but the holders at the end doesn&#x27;t have a good grip.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem very strong, and it doesn&#x27;t grip well once it&#x27;s in place.  </li>
            <li>Quality of the product fair for the price on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>The straps are nice but the rubber band end should be upgraded to better material so they hold tighter - OK for kids glasses.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Kids love them.  </li>
            <li>but I feel more secured when walking with my glasses hanging around my neck</li>
            <li>The price was good however and worth it for one pair I have.</li>
            <li>but ok to pinch hit for your kids</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the tape to hold the rubber loop in place worked OK, if you don&#x27;t mind having tape on your glasses.</li>
            <li>The connections to glasses WOULD BE BETTER IMPROVED.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Pretty good material.</li>
            <li>My oakleys have a rubber earpiece that seems to catch the loops pretty good.</li>
            <li>At this price, you really can&#x27;t expect it to be any good.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight and colorful.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve lost too many pairs of glasses without them - and I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for straps that quickly</li>
            <li>Really easy to use and keeps my protective eye wear in place.</li>
            <li>the plastic adjuster is easy to press.</li>
            <li>Though delivered just fine.</li>
            <li>They seem to fit</li>
            <li>Two stars because the product is almost free</li>
            <li>Ordered a different neck strap that works great.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and scratches my neck</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work so well with smooth plastic, but they work.</li>
            <li>and I like the color variety available.  </li>
            <li>as expected, looks great, and strong.</li>
            <li>If you are better at not ruining product than I am this product will work well for you but for me, I am thankful it is not expensive</li>
            <li>but when I am about to sweat, jogging, road bike and the gym, I take the rope off right away but lost the metal piece because it slides off rather easily when soaked.</li>
            <li>These are handy to have around for the busy person who doesn&#x27;t have time to chase after their glasses.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the writing on them, they are good for big necked people like me.</li>
            <li>These holders look nice but won&#x27;t stay secure, are too short and broke in about a month of use.</li>
            <li>Works great with a little tweak.  </li>
            <li>Fit very well</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a different type cord to see if I have better success.</li>
            <li>the rubber loops at the end seem stretchy enough to fit over most  earpieces, but strong enough when pulled.</li>
            <li>Found that most of these slipped right off until I did the following...</li>
            <li>The cord itself is nice, but the metal spring to adjust to tighten onto the stems is loose.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal for a decent product.</li>
            <li>The strap is well made but not the most essential part which is supposed to keep your glasses on the lanyard!</li>
            <li>Place the first loop around handle, twist it 2-3 times, then place the loop closer to the string around</li>
            <li>They loosen up and the first one with the wire wrapped tightener already broke.</li>
            <li>fell apart first time i tryed to use them</li>
            <li>I bought for protection against losing good sunglasses and don&#x27;t feel I can trust because loops don&#x27;t really hold tight.</li>
            <li>I have light weight metal reading glasses that weigh only 2 ounces.</li>
            <li>I had to use a pair of players to tighten the metal part, and I don&#x27;t think you really are supposed to do that,</li>
            <li>If your hat size is larger that 6 1/4 these are not going to fit.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive so thus 3 star.</li>
            <li>Very functional straps.</li>
            <li>I have a regular size head and when attached to my shades, they fit over my head fine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very short more like for a kid than an adult</li>
            <li>So I removed the whole rubber thing and was able to slide the end hole of the cord onto my glasses, better, but not ideal.</li>
            <li>At first they were slipping off of my &amp;#34;cheaters&amp;#34; but then I saw that you can tighten them up with the high quality metal on the high quality rubber bands that fit on the temples.</li>
            <li>I took a pair of pliers to the metal ring and gently squeezed it a little tighter so that it hugs the rubber band better.</li>
            <li>The contemporary technics allow producers to create STICKY ENDS.</li>
            <li>decent straps.</li>
            <li>My sunglasses have really skinny temples and these straps weren&#x27;t little enough to hold my glasses safely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to say if you have sunglasses with earpices that taper down to the end or are just barrow smooth plastic</li>
            <li>Not super sturdy but fine for a 6year old t-ball player.</li>
            <li>They go down and grip right at the joint, and really stay on.</li>
            <li>Keeps my spouses glasses on his face since he can&#x27;t sit up straight do to having ALS and his muscles in his back and abdomen have atrophied</li>
            <li>These kept slipping right off the glasses arms.</li>
            <li>Not able to move freely with them either.  </li>
            <li>you really need wide glass ends for them to hold.</li>
            <li>Too short - not nearly long enough</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not able to move freely with them either.  </li>
            <li> you really need wide glass ends for them to hold.</li>
            <li> Too short - not nearly long enough</li>
            <li> Again, it the stem piece that rests behind your ear is wider than the rest of your stem, significantly so, it may hold for you.</li>
            <li> Overall lanyard length is a bit short if you move the loops up to compensate for the slipping.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the metal spring to adjust and tighten onto the stems is loose.</li>
            <li> Once you lose the metal ring to secure your glasses to the rope, It is useless.</li>
            <li> My first impression of these neck strap eyeglass cords was negative because they kept slipping off my glasses.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long they will,last</li>
            <li> Adjustable plastic clip on the back keeps them tight if you have a smaller neck.</li>
            <li> Other than having to move on to the next, the neck strap works well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they will be too loose.</li>
            <li> The holders slides back and forth as well as they just fell down.</li>
            <li> but I will need to use them for a short time since I have ordered &amp; used the same product from other companies &amp; it seems that the rubber attachment that attaches to the glasses always seem to break soon after use (2 to 3 weeks) with little to no abuse or anything of that nature.</li>
            <li> The adjustable plastic loops meant to meant to hold the glasses did not stay tight enough,  and my glasses slipped off.</li>
            <li> These really do not work.</li>
            <li> It does not really hold your glasses when biking.</li>
            <li> Not much you can do.</li>
            <li> not much else to say.</li>
            <li> the part that hooks onto glasses stretched out and did not hold the glasses they would just fall off 1 the black one is still hangin in after a week</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, and the three sunglass holders cost less than a single &amp;#34;Croakies&amp;#34; holder.</li>
            <li> There Is a round black disk at the end that will make it smaller.</li>
            <li> the other two codes I will use for my glasses and sunglasses.</li>
            <li> The bad is that the small adjustable metal clamps to tighten the hold to the earpieces are too loose and easily pull away from the earpiece.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> That means MY stems are very narrow, so the loose rubber piece would have come off by itself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not secure, unless the end of the stems on your glasses are chunkier than the rest of your stems.</li>
            <li> do not fit well and strap slips from the glasses</li>
            <li> Even my 13 years old son thinks that he can replace your lousy connections with something</li>
            <li> These connect to the glasses by means of a small black rubber loop.  </li>
            <li> The strips can be less thick - #1.</li>
            <li> I ended up trying to use a small pliers and squeeze them shut, it cut the rubber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> The loops will NOT stay tight on your glasses, so it is absolutely ridiculous that they stamp &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; all over the lanyards.  </li>
            <li> Eyeglass cord holder DID NOT effectively hold the onto temple of glasses.</li>
            <li> If you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Rubber holding ends are too weak.</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> Not happy with them.</li>
            <li> All 3 have already broken on me!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality 1 came almost ripped you can see about to snap</li>
            <li> The product is truly a bad joke.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate having to modify things to make them do what they should have been designed for.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s glasses - great! A lot of people said they were kid sized, so it&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Too short - not nearly long enough</li>
            <li> two of the three straps broke when i tried to use them.  oh well.</li>
            <li> These really do not work. The sunglasses disconnect from the strap and fall to the ground. Save your money. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> Keeps my spouses glasses on his face since he can&#x27;t sit up straight do to having ALS and his muscles in his back and abdomen have atrophied so he sits leaning over.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting/</li>
            <li> They seem to fit okay but I will need to use them for a short time since I have ordered &amp; used the same product from other companies &amp; it seems that the rubber attachment that attaches to the glasses always seem to break soon after use (2 to 3 weeks) with little to no abuse or anything of that nature.</li>
            <li> Good value.  Kids love them.  Not super sturdy but fine for a 6year old t-ball player.</li>
            <li> very nice but plastic rings do not hold glasses well</li>
            <li> These holders look nice but won&#x27;t stay secure, are too short and broke in about a month of use.</li>
            <li> they are nice quality cord to put your glasses on. I use them for my moms hearing aids. they arrived on time. the other two codes I will use for my glasses and sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Rubber holding ends are too weak.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! They do not hold onto your eyeglasses no matter how snuggly you push the metal ring closer to the plastic loop. I have light weight metal reading glasses that weigh only 2 ounces. The strap is well made but not the most essential part which is supposed to keep your glasses on the lanyard!</li>
            <li> Works great with a little tweak.  Found that most of these slipped right off until I did the following... Place the first loop around handle, twist it 2-3 times, then place the loop closer to the string around handle... Now it never falls off.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have to tweak it.</li>
            <li> Eyeglass cord holder DID NOT effectively hold the onto temple of glasses. Spring tension fell off and I could not find it. Poor design.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality 1 came almost ripped you can see about to snap I bought for protection against losing good sunglasses and don&#x27;t feel I can trust because loops don&#x27;t really hold tight.</li>
            <li> Way too short for anyone but children. Find another longer lanyard even for children.</li>
            <li> as expected, looks great, and strong. The only problem is the metal spring to adjust and tighten onto the stems is loose. I had to use a pair of players to tighten the metal part, and I don&#x27;t think you really are supposed to do that, but I feel more secured when walking with my glasses hanging around my neck</li>
            <li> Very short more like for a kid than an adult</li>
            <li> the part that hooks onto glasses stretched out and did not hold the glasses they would just fall off 1 the black one is still hangin in after a week</li>
            <li> These kept slipping right off the glasses arms. I took a pair of pliers to the metal ring and gently squeezed it a little tighter so that it hugs the rubber band better. Now they work great. I hate having to modify things to make them do what they should have been designed for.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It does not really hold your glasses when biking.</li>
            <li> These are very handy, well priced, and sturdy.  If you catch your glasses on something, they will just slide off and not break.  Good for sporty stuff.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some trick. But the glasses do not stay on. Don&#x27;t buy. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Though delivered just fine.</li>
            <li> I found the length short and the metal tabs on the end do not hold the eye glass stems well. They loosen up and the first one with the wire wrapped tightener already broke. Still looking for a replacement product.</li>
            <li> I use prescription sunglasses when I ride and I always use granny straps - I&#x27;ve lost too many pairs of glasses without them - and I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for straps that quickly failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are well made and at a great price.</li>
            <li> they seem to fall apart.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want those rubber tips on the ends because it catches in my hair, these don&#x27;t have them. There Is a round black disk at the end that will make it smaller. I don&#x27;t need smaller, I need bigger so I  smashed it with a hammer and now it is great. It still could be longer but for the money wonderful. Just got them so I don&#x27;t know how long they will,last</li>
            <li> At this price, you really can&#x27;t expect it to be any good.  The loops will NOT stay tight on your glasses, so it is absolutely ridiculous that they stamp &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; all over the lanyards.  If you were to participate in any sport, you&#x27;d find your eyeglasses crashing to the ground.  The product is truly a bad joke.  Two stars because the product is almost free; you get what you pay for.  Want something that works?  Try the Peeper-Keepers.</li>
            <li> The adjustable plastic loops meant to meant to hold the glasses did not stay tight enough,  and my glasses slipped off. When I tried to tighten the loops, the plastic broke.</li>
            <li> The ropes are strong and reliable but the holders at the end doesn&#x27;t have a good grip. The holders slides back and forth as well as they just fell down.</li>
            <li> Once you lose the metal ring to secure your glasses to the rope, It is useless. For me who doesn&#x27;t wear the rope all the time but when I am about to sweat, jogging, road bike and the gym, I take the rope off right away but lost the metal piece because it slides off rather easily when soaked. Other than having to move on to the next, the neck strap works well. If you are better at not ruining product than I am this product will work well for you but for me, I am thankful it is not expensive</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use.  Too short for both myself and husband.  Not able to move freely with them either.  Not happy with them.</li>
            <li> The straps are nice but the rubber band end should be upgraded to better material so they hold tighter - OK for kids glasses.</li>
            <li> I did not like these.  I&#x27;d return them, but one broke. The figure 8 that hold the ear piece slips &amp; you can&#x27;t get it to stay in place.  Ordered a different neck strap that works great.</li>
            <li> disappointed. Cheaply made and scratches my neck</li>
            <li> Not secure, unless the end of the stems on your glasses are chunkier than the rest of your stems. If you know what I mean. The cord itself is nice, but the metal spring to adjust to tighten onto the stems is loose. I ended up trying to use a small pliers and squeeze them shut, it cut the rubber. So I removed the whole rubber thing and was able to slide the end hole of the cord onto my glasses, better, but not ideal. That means MY stems are very narrow, so the loose rubber piece would have come off by itself. Again, it the stem piece that rests behind your ear is wider than the rest of your stem, significantly so, it may hold for you. Otherwise, not recommended.</li>
            <li> These are handy to have around for the busy person who doesn&#x27;t have time to chase after their glasses. No fuss &amp; no muss.</li>
            <li> Better than I hoped! If you don&#x27;t mind the writing on them, they are good for big necked people like me. At first they were slipping off of my &amp;#34;cheaters&amp;#34; but then I saw that you can tighten them up with the high quality metal on the high quality rubber bands that fit on the temples. Adjustable plastic clip on the back keeps them tight if you have a smaller neck.</li>
            <li> Thes are grat for regular glasses with metal to plastic. They go down and grip right at the joint, and really stay on. Don&#x27;t work so well with smooth plastic, but they work. Just not as well. I LOVE THESE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My first impression of these neck strap eyeglass cords was negative because they kept slipping off my glasses.  I plan to purchase a different type cord to see if I have better success.</li>
            <li> Works well on reading glasses - nicely adjustable.</li>
            <li> Is good. Fit very well</li>
            <li> The product should read for children or youths not intended for adults. If your hat size is larger that 6 1/4 these are not going to fit. Quality of the product fair for the price on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> My sunglasses have really skinny temples and these straps weren&#x27;t little enough to hold my glasses safely.  I had to get some others.</li>
            <li> All 3 have already broken on me!</li>
            <li> you really need wide glass ends for them to hold. Otherwise they will be too loose. The price was good however and worth it for one pair I have.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, and the three sunglass holders cost less than a single &amp;#34;Croakies&amp;#34; holder. The bad is that the small adjustable metal clamps to tighten the hold to the earpieces are too loose and easily pull away from the earpiece. I &amp;#34;solved&amp;#34; this problem by tightening the clamp and placing a daub of silicone &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; to hold it in place. It sort of works.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and keeps my protective eye wear in place.</li>
            <li> These are good for keeping glasses handy around your neck and I like the color variety available.  Would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive so thus 3 star. I&#x27;m not sure how well made- but ok to pinch hit for your kids etc. I&#x27;d personally buy bands that float- these do not.</li>
            <li> The neck strap supposed to work whit sport glasses. I have an Oakley sunglasses and the strap do not fit well and strap slips from the glasses</li>
            <li> Will not hold my glasses</li>
            <li> These connect to the glasses by means of a small black rubber loop.  It doesn&#x27;t seem very strong, and it doesn&#x27;t grip well once it&#x27;s in place.  I put a piece of tape around the point where the rubber loop connects to the glasses.  Otherwise, the glasses would slip out of the loop.  They just don&#x27;t grip well enough.  The next thing I&#x27;m going to try is using tape to attach each end of the retainer to the glasses using tape and bypass the rubber loop completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the tape to hold the rubber loop in place worked OK, if you don&#x27;t mind having tape on your glasses.</li>
            <li> Do not hold onto any pair of glasses.</li>
            <li> Not much you can do. The strips can be less thick - #1. The connections to glasses WOULD BE BETTER IMPROVED. The contemporary technics allow producers to create STICKY ENDS. Even my 13 years old son thinks that he can replace your lousy connections with something gum-alike.&lt;br /&gt;With the same price, you might even SAVE money with it, I talk to the salesmen.</li>
            <li> Do not maintain tightness on template.</li>
            <li> Very functional straps. Now my wife always knows where her glasses are.</li>
            <li> They are way too short and won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> decent straps. Pretty good material. the plastic adjuster is easy to press. the rubber loops at the end seem stretchy enough to fit over most  earpieces, but strong enough when pulled. I&#x27;m going to say if you have sunglasses with earpices that taper down to the end or are just barrow smooth plastic these may not be your best bet. My oakleys have a rubber earpiece that seems to catch the loops pretty good. I have a regular size head and when attached to my shades, they fit over my head fine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so there you have it. Basic eyeglass/sunglass straps. not much else to say. Not a bad deal for a decent product.</li>
            <li> the right price &amp; came very quickly in perfect condition.....works for almost any type of sun or sports glasses.....can&#x27;t complain at all...</li>
            <li> The straps do not stay on the glasses, they continually slide off.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works well for nomal use like walking with eyeglasses hanging, but for sports I won&#x27;t use as the ends slip off. Wish there was a wy to tighten them</li>
            <li> Nice weight and colorful.</li>
            <li> Works great! Its adjutable.</li>
            <li> It works okay but the rubber loop grips tend to slide back after a while even when tightened. Overall lanyard length is a bit short if you move the loops up to compensate for the slipping.</li>
            <li> fell apart first time i tryed to use them</li>
            <li> these bands come in handy as I do not need to wear my readers all the time, as of yet anyway.</li>
