            <li>Cheap acrylic powders</li>
            <li>I ordered it on July 29th and received it July 31, talk about fast service! !!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to do my nails</li>
            <li>the bottles are so smaill and not even full</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy but disapointed in shipping was looking forward to using ainll the cool powders.</li>
            <li>It was replaced quickly and sell answered emails within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The set itself is adequate for beginner practice.</li>
            <li>Seller was great, everything that was shown was in the box, the acrylic lifts easily and is hard to work with.  </li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied..worst quality ever!!</li>
            <li>I loved this product, only problem is on the color acrylic no matter how much acrylic liquid I would get out the brush</li>
            <li>I got my on time and did my first full set.</li>
            <li>what color the tips are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and will be ordered more to practice different designs so that my high quality acrylics and/or Uv gels will not be wasted.</li>
            <li>Some of the acrylic was dusted over things but the price was right for all you get.</li>
            <li>The acrylic has a false bottom, it was only filled halfway, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great either, so that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>my package was complete and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>First off it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions</li>
            <li>I Spoke to the seller and found out the color of the tips can not be changed unless you are willing to order from their store in China....</li>
            <li>The only thing you would need is to invest in some more acrylic powder....</li>
            <li>Thank you so much ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected and I love that</li>
            <li>but I expected better quality seeing that it was a US seller.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold to brush no matter how much liquid you use.</li>
            <li>but I opend it to try it out but very dissapointed</li>
            <li>the product does not work very well</li>
            <li>Im very unsatisfied  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work besides making my real nail bleed.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I recently got into doing acrylics, I was so excited when I got this</li>
            <li>I ordered it the 28th just got it yesterday, the only thing I liked was how fast shipping was, other then that I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE CLEAR!!</li>
            <li>The acrylic is cheap but that was expected.</li>
            <li>The acrylic didn&#x27;t go on smooth &amp; it kept slipping off the brushes.</li>
            <li>But the white and pink work fine.</li>
            <li>The clear acrylic is not usable.</li>
            <li>I opened my package today and was very pissed thier was no nail file, my white and clear acrylic was everywhere</li>
            <li>I think the clear is really old or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m far from a professional nail tech but with practice using kits these....one day hopefully(lol)</li>
            <li>I just got the item today, my problem is the color of the nail tips they are clear when the description says natural.</li>
            <li>the liquid acyrilic wasnt even half full.</li>
            <li>Other than that love all the other goodies.</li>
            <li>I always paid $80 to get my nails done at a salon because I don&#x27;t like french tip and always got the whole nail in a solid color of acrylic instead of opting for paint.</li>
            <li>too tough to smooth onto nails...</li>

            <li> so all i have is the pink powder.</li>
            <li> The brushes being pointed tip make it harder to use correctly, but I knew they were like that.</li>
            <li> Everything came that&#x27;s on the picture and arrived sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is difficult to use because it drys very fast</li>
            <li> Other than that....</li>
            <li> The fake nails was clear not white which I didnt like.</li>

            <li> but I had a missing item.</li>
            <li> Everything that was in the picture came in BUT the tips stated it was NATURAL but mines are CLEAR and I hate that.</li>
            <li> the nail was to small to even practice on it.</li>
            <li> they are too small to practice with acrylic...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this seller, I really don&#x27;t like the color tips I received.</li>
            <li> they are no good</li>
            <li> Nothing spilled or broken.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> half of the stuff was missing and the powder was terrible</li>
            <li> there is a lot of different stuff for your money but the quality is absolutely horrible</li>
            <li> (random selection)...</li>
            <li> ill become</li>

    <ol>
            <li> the acrylic power and acrylic liquid suck they are no good the rest is okay</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied..worst quality ever!!</li>
            <li> Ordered on Monday, got it today (Thursday) and everything was there! Perfect! Thank you so much ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Some of the acrylic was dusted over things but the price was right for all you get. Got this set to play around with and practice</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected and I love that but I expected better quality seeing that it was a US seller. Everything that was in the picture came in BUT the tips stated it was NATURAL but mines are CLEAR and I hate that. The cuticle oil says its OPI in the picture and it&#x27;s a different brand, and one of the powders is missing from in the package. I&#x27;m disappointed with this seller, I really don&#x27;t like the color tips I received.</li>
            <li> Did my own nails as soon as I received the package. The clear acrylic is not usable. But the white and pink work fine. I think the clear is really old or something. It doesn&#x27;t hold to brush no matter how much liquid you use. Other than that....great deal.</li>
            <li> Great exactly what I ordered Thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter is enjoying this product. She loves manicuring so she is having a field day with this.</li>
            <li> My glitter spilt because it was no tightened and it was all thrown in the box not neat. Thats not the a big deal though. I was doing my grandmas nails and she kept on saying how it was burning her and even I felt it burning me occasionally. Mine arrived missing several products too.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, only problem is on the color acrylic no matter how much acrylic liquid I would get out the brush it would still run to the bottom of containers</li>
            <li> there is a lot of different stuff for your money but the quality is absolutely horrible im very disappointed was thinking of returning it but I opend it to try it out but very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Just received my nail kit and everything came good great packaging and everything look nice great deal EVER!</li>
            <li> This came on time and all the items were there. Nothing spilled or broken. Can&#x27;t wait to start using it!</li>
            <li> the product does not work very well</li>
            <li> Im very unsatisfied  with my purchase. I opened my package today and was very pissed thier was no nail file, my white and clear acrylic was everywhere so all i have is the pink powder. the liquid acyrilic wasnt even half full. My niece birthday is Saturday shes having a sleep over now i cant do everyones nail  the bottles are so smaill and not even full so the pink will only be enough for three girl. Im very disappointed in this purchase</li>
            <li> I ordered it the 28th just got it yesterday, the only thing I liked was how fast shipping was, other then that I didn&#x27;t like it. First off it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions so how are you supposed to learn or do anything, sencond the 2 nail practicing things they weren&#x27;t even good the nail was to small to even practice on it. some of the glitter and stuff was all over the place. When I did my nails I took them off because it made my nail bleed and i wanted to get it off cause it didn&#x27;t even work. The fake nails was clear not white which I didnt like. I was so excited to do my nails but it didn&#x27;t really work besides making my real nail bleed.</li>
            <li> .the products it&#x27;s good ..but is too little</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set. EVERYTHING WAS AS PICTURED. I ordered it on July 29th and received it July 31, talk about fast service! !! But just as mentioned in many others review......sadly it DOES NOT COME WITH NATURAL OR WHITE TIPS......THEY ARE CLEAR!! (Which wasnt a bother to me). I Spoke to the seller and found out the color of the tips can not be changed unless you are willing to order from their store in China....And lastly the cuticle oil may not be.. (mines wasn&#x27;t)... O.P.I brand cuticle oil..(random selection)... soooo heads up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness the picture should be changed so there&#x27;s no doubt what color the tips are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and will be ordered more to practice different designs so that my high quality acrylics and/or Uv gels will not be wasted. I&#x27;m far from a professional nail tech but with practice using kits these....one day hopefully(lol)... ill become one!&lt;br /&gt;*My pic may look like I&#x27;m an expert.......NO MA&#x27;AM.....PRACTICE. ..PRACTICE ...PRACTICE!!! And I still have a LONG WAY TO GO! *</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time but I had a missing item. It was replaced quickly and sell answered emails within 24 hours. The set itself is adequate for beginner practice. I personally do not like the quality on my nails.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it! my package was complete and shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I got my on time and did my first full set. The acrylic is cheap but that was expected. The brushes being pointed tip make it harder to use correctly, but I knew they were like that. Over all it is worth the price and a great starter/practicing kit. If you want to learn how to put on acrylics then this is for you.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is difficult to use because it drys very fast</li>
            <li> Cheap acrylic powders n liquid....too tough to smooth onto nails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful deal for a person wanting to learn how to do their nails! I always paid $80 to get my nails done at a salon because I don&#x27;t like french tip and always got the whole nail in a solid color of acrylic instead of opting for paint. THIS SAVED ME SO MUCH MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it comes with everything you would need to start learning! The only thing you would need is to invest in some more acrylic powder.... it comes with the 3 containers but its just enough to do one hand in one of the colors.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible I hated it half of the stuff was missing and the powder was terrible so was the acrylic liquid I would never recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Love this kit.  Lots of fun!!</li>
            <li> Everything came that&#x27;s on the picture and arrived sooner then expected. Acrylic isn&#x27;t that good but everything else is good</li>
            <li> Everything was in the bag.  Only thing is the bag was busted and glitter was on everything.</li>
            <li> The powders were all over in the box as well as the acyrlic powder...Everything else was great besides the nails are clear not like the ones in pic. Overall a good buy but disapointed in shipping was looking forward to using ainll the cool powders.</li>
            <li> I had problem with the acrilyc and the monomer. Poor quality. The rest of the things was perfect.</li>
            <li> Would Definetly Purchase Again. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I just got the item today, my problem is the color of the nail tips they are clear when the description says natural. The nail glue is very cheap it doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> Seller was great, everything that was shown was in the box, the acrylic lifts easily and is hard to work with.  Other than that love all the other goodies.</li>
            <li> I recently got into doing acrylics, I was so excited when I got this (although some things were spilled.) I love everything except the acrylic powder. I was so disappointed with the container &amp; quality. The acrylic didn&#x27;t go on smooth &amp; it kept slipping off the brushes. The acrylic has a false bottom, it was only filled halfway, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great either, so that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Wish it came with more acrylic powder but it&#x27;s no big deal. Came in two days and everything was there! I would definitely order again if needes</li>
            <li> This product is not the best of quality. The acrylic is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Love my products,&lt;br /&gt;A bit disappointed with the practice fingers...they are too small to practice with acrylic...</li>
