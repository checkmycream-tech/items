            <li>Good unit.</li>
            <li>Good product and delivered on time</li>
            <li>Love these clippers!    </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Worked the first time and did an excellent job.</li>
            <li>These clippers are amazing with one modification.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite amazing.</li>
            <li>We bought some kid size swimming ear plugs that kind of mold to the ear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s nice about this</li>
            <li>This whole set is perfect to me.</li>
            <li>I bought this clipper to make it easier and cleaner to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>I ran warm tap water over the hose and they popped out, unclogging the hose.  </li>
            <li>If you are a guy, then you know what it means to cut your own hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the new set twice already and am very happy with performance.  </li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for many years.  </li>
            <li>Easily pays for itself in saved trips to barber!</li>
            <li>The clippers operated very smooth and quit.</li>
            <li>This is a great value considering we cut our kids hair so much.</li>
            <li>I find a source for a better hose, I&#x27;ll update my review to include it&#x27;s source.</li>
            <li>This works better than i could imagine.</li>
            <li>thing that would be better, would be if the clipper was cordless.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have so many sets of Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product now but will update more after more use.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I love them for the most part</li>
            <li>This thing is magic.</li>
            <li>Use it every week, it&#x27;s better than the flow bee.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FOR MY DOG</li>
            <li>You would be better off with the Panasonic</li>
            <li>For the purpose i bought it for, I love it.  </li>
            <li>would like to add one more comment.</li>
            <li>The hair gets everywhere, and you find it on you for days afterwards no matter how many showers you take.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product .</li>
            <li>I LOVE this clipper.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>You might have to plan out where things work best for you a little, but these clippers are great and absolutely NO MESS!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Also my husband and I cut our hair once or twice a month ourselves and it would be nice not to have to clean up a bunch of hair every time.</li>
            <li>Great cut, no hair on the floor, but unfortunately very loud.</li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t have to clean up the hair!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easy it is to use..</li>
            <li>Easy Find Lid Rectangle 24-Cup Food Storage Container]]</li>
            <li>I had to reinforce the hose with duct tape so that it wasn&#x27;t so easily</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The included hose hooks up securely to the wand without need for duct tape.</li>
            <li>hose is about as cheap as could be made and still be called a hose.  </li>
            <li>The clipper works very well, would rate 5 stars on its own.  </li>
            <li>There are 2&amp;#34; adapters available</li>
            <li>This wahl clipper is unequaled in quality, fit and function.</li>
            <li>and it was no where near as good as this system that has the vaccum hose custom fitted to the clipper and attached.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are nice and heavy, well built and do a great job.</li>
            <li>The vacuum captures most of the hair fairly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that I could drive over this clipper</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li>Truly worth the expense, and then some!</li>
            <li>I use to be battle to cut my 5 yr old son&#x27;s hair, getting the hair in his face- not any more :-)</li>
            <li>It works well, the cut was clean and there were no hairs around.</li>
            <li>Saves lots of time on clean up.</li>
            <li>I had the very first Wahl &amp;#34;vaccum adapter kit&amp;#34; which would technically fit on any clipper made by Wahl.  </li>
            <li>At first I had to find a vacuum connection that fit the connection to the clipper, but once I did it worked great.</li>
            <li>If you cut hair you will love this setup, smart idea</li>
            <li>Cuts perfectly and sucks almost all the hair away.</li>
            <li>Work good enough I suppose.</li>
            <li>We were very happy to find that Wahl is once again making this grade of clipper and the ones which we have received have the exact same feel, fit, form, and function as the ones of old.  </li>
            <li>It even thanked me for doing such a good job.  </li>
            <li>Wonder full</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product, I&#x27;m saying when you buy this, don&#x27;t be surprised when you find you&#x27;ll also have to buy a new and better quality hose from some material supply shop to make it pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>It provides an adequate number of guards, a taper adjustment, and makes clean-up a cinch.</li>
            <li>these would be perfect if it had a built-in vacuum instead of having to lug your vacuum cleaner into the bathroom with you to clip your hair.</li>
            <li>Hose is flimsy and bends easy but used a good tip from a previous purchaser...</li>
            <li>This makes the hair trimming a little noise but the clean up and the more effective at trimming hair.</li>
            <li>The hose attachment actually doesn&#x27;t fit quite right on my dyson ball vaccuum, but I was able to secure it</li>
            <li>The clipper is great, but somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a slap in the face to customer&#x27;s when then send it out with such a garbage hose</li>
            <li>I have always cut my boys&#x27; hair at home, but this clipper does a much more professional job.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth</li>
            <li>I can even give a quick haircut before we go somewhere if I need to without having to have the bathtub ready - just clip and go!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right</li>
            <li>and I knew right then that I had found the product I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Still recommend as it is right now.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the actual clipper is great.</li>
            <li>Hair cuts used to be a drama filled experience with my son who is VERY sensitive to the hair falling across is face and neck.</li>
            <li>The hose is incredibly flimsy, so when hooked to my Dyson vacuum it is literally crushed by the sucking power!  </li>
            <li>But at least you&#x27;ll have a vaccum cleaner handy to clean those up at the end!</li>
            <li>It paid for itself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves these!</li>
            <li>Mine was kinked when I got it and collapsed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>so I would still consider it a worthwhile purchase if this was the only problem.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>I too had kinks in the hose, however if you run it under hot tap water the hose will resume</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time I thought the clippers were not working.</li>
            <li>I got this mainly because my son is super sensitive about hair falling on him during hair cuts and it causes huge drama every time we cut hair.</li>
            <li>When it breaks, I will replace it with a higher quality hose - probably silicone.</li>
            <li>If you like you hair short (just under 2&amp;#34;) it well replaces Flowbee, so it&#x27;s a better buy.</li>
            <li>Love the vacuum attachment.  </li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this vacuum clipper.  </li>
            <li>for $80, the vacuum attachment should have been a lot better.</li>
            <li>Great product, with good features and accessories, however the vacuum hose is very thin and has a tendency to kink and collapse while using it.</li>
            <li>Absolutley no mess to clean up afterward.</li>
            <li>Once I used it a few times, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>The clippers and vacuum attachment are easy to use.</li>
            <li>With this, there was barely any hair in the bathroom sink, and clean up was a breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the hose is absolute junk.</li>
            <li>The clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li>Now I shower and get ready and cut my hair with my work clothes on and hit the door.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very high-quality clipper.</li>
            <li>The clippers work very well.</li>
            <li>REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you keep the hose straight when using the clippers you won&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li>the fact is that if they had used thicker material the weight of the thing would be too much.</li>
            <li>this is not a comment i make very often but in this case i am.</li>
            <li>I opened the box, and a massive amount of light followed by a cloud of glitter and puppies poured out</li>
            <li>You could say that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, the adapter into the vacuum hose doesn&#x27;t fit very well at all.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this model contained an internal vacuum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a Eureka Mighty Mite vacuum and it works very well with this.</li>
            <li>the vacuum attachment doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hair (I have a very powerful cannister vacuum) because a few stray ones fly up away from the suction area.  </li>
            <li>so I did, well yesterday was my first day using my new wahl clipper</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not giving this product much as you will be looking for a new hose (why even buy at this point).  </li>
            <li>and my blades needed to be sharpen or replace, having  classic oster 76</li>
            <li>You can tell they are high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>The clipper itself is of high quality.  </li>
            <li>This makes it so much better, no clean up afterwards and no itchy hair all over.  </li>
            <li>No issues so far, except for the hose that collapsed one time when used at certain angles.  </li>
            <li>Just a little better hose that could handle a little more flexibility with the needed strength</li>
            <li>these are in daily use at a barber shop, they perform the duties as well as higher priced clippers, well done!</li>
            <li>The clippers are a little more bulkier than the regular clippers but the trade off is worth it, I just wished I would of bought this sooner</li>
            <li>My old set served us very well</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to have my boys actually sit still and not panic from falling hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, I dont have to worry that I need to take a shower after cutting my hair because the vacuum takes good care of leaving no hairs.</li>
            <li>Fast, no mess hair cut.  </li>
            <li>We would normally end up just trapping him in his old high chair and just going for it</li>
            <li>because when you continually store this somewhere most of the time it will be rolled in a circle shape and sometimes very tightly.  </li>
            <li>It also take a little longer to setup the work area and put away if you cut at home but that too is ok because of the lack of hair all over the place, you can even cut your hair in the bathroom or kitchen if you want, no mess, with your shirt on.</li>
            <li>I believe the plastic the hose is made out of the bare minimum quality - that&#x27;s giving it too much credit - there&#x27;s no quality.  </li>
            <li>Over the past 10 of which we have not been able to find suitable stand in for those clippers which forced us into the used resale clippers.  </li>
            <li>I wish the vacuum parts were made of higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Gave myself my first crew cut and the vacuum sucked up all of my cut hair.</li>
            <li>If you hook it up to a shop-vac or anything with a bunch of suction like a central vacuum, you will have a clean trimmed head.</li>
            <li>I received this new unit yesterday and when I opened it, I could see the hose was kinked nearly shut on both ends.  </li>
            <li>but I think with a little practice it will be fine.</li>
            <li>First I was excited to start using my new clipper because my old one was giving me hard time already</li>
            <li>No mess!</li>
            <li>NO MESS!</li>
            <li>I supposed my next project is to mount a canister vacuum under my bathroom sink, run the hose up though the wall with a quick connect and on/off</li>
            <li>It works fine for people too, but makes trimming around ears and such a bit harder</li>
            <li>I used the Wahl Senior Vacuum clipper, it attached easily to my stand up vacuum cleaner (standard attachment)..</li>
            <li>I changed mine out with an old CPAP hose I had around the house.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 6.5 feet tall.</li>
            <li>I suggest to professional barber&lt;</li>
            <li>These clippers were so loud I had to put earplugs in.</li>
            <li>Overall, the clippers cut amazingly fast, and they don&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>The first one is somewhat minor:  </li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>okay using the included thick rubberband</li>
            <li>The position of the vacuum opening allows every tiny bit of hair to get sucked up; even huge clumps if your buzzing a big mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to shower, cut my hair, shower again and then try to clean up the mess the hair clippings made.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is about the hose it comes with being linked to the point that it collapsed when I started the vacumn other than that works great.</li>
            <li>We actually have two vacuums and it didn&#x27;t fit into the hose at all on one and the other I had to jam in there.</li>
            <li>no mess on me or the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>so you have no mess.</li>
            <li>The setup leaves no mess.</li>
            <li>We sat my boy down and had to get use to the idea that the vaccum had to be on at the same time as the clippers (he is not a big fan of the vaccum either:).  </li>
            <li>A haircut that used to take ten minutes plus ten more for cleanup is half that now.  </li>
            <li>, I wrestled a bear down and shaved that hairy monster right there.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been a professional barber for over 25 years and always has used the Wahl professional grade vacuum clippers.  </li>
            <li>I cut my hair furiously, and was shocked to find no mess, and what a great job it did.  </li>
            <li>In theory a great idea, but with the loud clippers and vacuum going it is quite unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I have an old Wahl clipper with a vacuum hose attachment.</li>
            <li>The hose is so flimsy that it doesn&#x27;t bare the weight of my vacuum&#x27;s hose when attached to it.  </li>
            <li>other issue with the vacuum connection is that the connector is really a one-size fits one-size, meaning it does not adjust to attach to multiple types of vacuums.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than our previous attempts without the vacuum.</li>
            <li>Not only does it eliminate the mess of haircuts, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li>In effect, it cuts off the airflow and there is no vacuum.  </li>

            <li> Nevertheless, this is a very good set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> The suction on these are great, and the clippers themselves are probably the best ones we&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Wahl products &amp; have always wanted a vaccum system!</li>
            <li> He was totally fine with it!!!  </li>
            <li> The clippers are great, the hose is a throw away.</li>

            <li> This works so amazing!</li>
            <li> I actually am very impressed with the &amp;#34;Lion&amp;#34; look my cats ended up with :)</li>
            <li> Clippers work good.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good clipper.</li>
            <li> Good unit.</li>
            <li> Good product and delivered on time</li>
            <li> Love these clippers!    </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Worked the first time and did an excellent job.</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing with one modification.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite amazing.</li>
            <li> We bought some kid size swimming ear plugs that kind of mold to the ear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s nice about this</li>
            <li> This whole set is perfect to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to make it easier and cleaner to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> I ran warm tap water over the hose and they popped out, unclogging the hose.  </li>
            <li> If you are a guy, then you know what it means to cut your own hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used the new set twice already and am very happy with performance.  </li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for many years.  </li>
            <li> Easily pays for itself in saved trips to barber!</li>
            <li> The clippers operated very smooth and quit.</li>
            <li> This is a great value considering we cut our kids hair so much.</li>
            <li> I find a source for a better hose, I&#x27;ll update my review to include it&#x27;s source.</li>
            <li> This works better than i could imagine.</li>
            <li> thing that would be better, would be if the clipper was cordless.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have so many sets of Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product now but will update more after more use.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I love them for the most part</li>
            <li> This thing is magic.</li>
            <li> Use it every week, it&#x27;s better than the flow bee.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FOR MY DOG</li>
            <li> You would be better off with the Panasonic</li>
            <li> For the purpose i bought it for, I love it.  </li>
            <li> would like to add one more comment.</li>
            <li> The hair gets everywhere, and you find it on you for days afterwards no matter how many showers you take.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product .</li>
            <li> I LOVE this clipper.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> You might have to plan out where things work best for you a little, but these clippers are great and absolutely NO MESS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Also my husband and I cut our hair once or twice a month ourselves and it would be nice not to have to clean up a bunch of hair every time.</li>
            <li> Great cut, no hair on the floor, but unfortunately very loud.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t have to clean up the hair!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easy it is to use..</li>
            <li> Easy Find Lid Rectangle 24-Cup Food Storage Container]]</li>
            <li> I had to reinforce the hose with duct tape so that it wasn&#x27;t so easily</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The included hose hooks up securely to the wand without need for duct tape.</li>
            <li> hose is about as cheap as could be made and still be called a hose.  </li>
            <li> The clipper works very well, would rate 5 stars on its own.  </li>
            <li> There are 2&amp;#34; adapters available</li>
            <li> This wahl clipper is unequaled in quality, fit and function.</li>
            <li> and it was no where near as good as this system that has the vaccum hose custom fitted to the clipper and attached.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are nice and heavy, well built and do a great job.</li>
            <li> The vacuum captures most of the hair fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that I could drive over this clipper</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> Truly worth the expense, and then some!</li>
            <li> I use to be battle to cut my 5 yr old son&#x27;s hair, getting the hair in his face- not any more :-)</li>
            <li> It works well, the cut was clean and there were no hairs around.</li>
            <li> Saves lots of time on clean up.</li>
            <li> I had the very first Wahl &amp;#34;vaccum adapter kit&amp;#34; which would technically fit on any clipper made by Wahl.  </li>
            <li> At first I had to find a vacuum connection that fit the connection to the clipper, but once I did it worked great.</li>
            <li> If you cut hair you will love this setup, smart idea</li>
            <li> Cuts perfectly and sucks almost all the hair away.</li>
            <li> Work good enough I suppose.</li>
            <li> We were very happy to find that Wahl is once again making this grade of clipper and the ones which we have received have the exact same feel, fit, form, and function as the ones of old.  </li>
            <li> It even thanked me for doing such a good job.  </li>
            <li> Wonder full</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product, I&#x27;m saying when you buy this, don&#x27;t be surprised when you find you&#x27;ll also have to buy a new and better quality hose from some material supply shop to make it pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> It provides an adequate number of guards, a taper adjustment, and makes clean-up a cinch.</li>
            <li> these would be perfect if it had a built-in vacuum instead of having to lug your vacuum cleaner into the bathroom with you to clip your hair.</li>
            <li> Hose is flimsy and bends easy but used a good tip from a previous purchaser...</li>
            <li> This makes the hair trimming a little noise but the clean up and the more effective at trimming hair.</li>
            <li> The hose attachment actually doesn&#x27;t fit quite right on my dyson ball vaccuum, but I was able to secure it</li>
            <li> The clipper is great, but somewhat heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a slap in the face to customer&#x27;s when then send it out with such a garbage hose</li>
            <li> I have always cut my boys&#x27; hair at home, but this clipper does a much more professional job.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth</li>
            <li> I can even give a quick haircut before we go somewhere if I need to without having to have the bathtub ready - just clip and go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right</li>
            <li> and I knew right then that I had found the product I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Still recommend as it is right now.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the actual clipper is great.</li>
            <li> Hair cuts used to be a drama filled experience with my son who is VERY sensitive to the hair falling across is face and neck.</li>
            <li> The hose is incredibly flimsy, so when hooked to my Dyson vacuum it is literally crushed by the sucking power!  </li>
            <li> But at least you&#x27;ll have a vaccum cleaner handy to clean those up at the end!</li>
            <li> It paid for itself the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves these!</li>
            <li> Mine was kinked when I got it and collapsed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> so I would still consider it a worthwhile purchase if this was the only problem.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> I too had kinks in the hose, however if you run it under hot tap water the hose will resume</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time I thought the clippers were not working.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly because my son is super sensitive about hair falling on him during hair cuts and it causes huge drama every time we cut hair.</li>
            <li> When it breaks, I will replace it with a higher quality hose - probably silicone.</li>
            <li> If you like you hair short (just under 2&amp;#34;) it well replaces Flowbee, so it&#x27;s a better buy.</li>
            <li> Love the vacuum attachment.  </li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this vacuum clipper.  </li>
            <li> for $80, the vacuum attachment should have been a lot better.</li>
            <li> Great product, with good features and accessories, however the vacuum hose is very thin and has a tendency to kink and collapse while using it.</li>
            <li> Absolutley no mess to clean up afterward.</li>
            <li> Once I used it a few times, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The clippers and vacuum attachment are easy to use.</li>
            <li> With this, there was barely any hair in the bathroom sink, and clean up was a breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the hose is absolute junk.</li>
            <li> The clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li> Now I shower and get ready and cut my hair with my work clothes on and hit the door.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very high-quality clipper.</li>
            <li> The clippers work very well.</li>
            <li> REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you keep the hose straight when using the clippers you won&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li> the fact is that if they had used thicker material the weight of the thing would be too much.</li>
            <li> this is not a comment i make very often but in this case i am.</li>
            <li> I opened the box, and a massive amount of light followed by a cloud of glitter and puppies poured out</li>
            <li> You could say that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, the adapter into the vacuum hose doesn&#x27;t fit very well at all.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if this model contained an internal vacuum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a Eureka Mighty Mite vacuum and it works very well with this.</li>
            <li> the vacuum attachment doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hair (I have a very powerful cannister vacuum) because a few stray ones fly up away from the suction area.  </li>
            <li> so I did, well yesterday was my first day using my new wahl clipper</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not giving this product much as you will be looking for a new hose (why even buy at this point).  </li>
            <li> and my blades needed to be sharpen or replace, having  classic oster 76</li>
            <li> You can tell they are high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> The clipper itself is of high quality.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so much better, no clean up afterwards and no itchy hair all over.  </li>
            <li> No issues so far, except for the hose that collapsed one time when used at certain angles.  </li>
            <li> Just a little better hose that could handle a little more flexibility with the needed strength</li>
            <li> these are in daily use at a barber shop, they perform the duties as well as higher priced clippers, well done!</li>
            <li> The clippers are a little more bulkier than the regular clippers but the trade off is worth it, I just wished I would of bought this sooner</li>
            <li> My old set served us very well</li>
            <li> Worth every penny to have my boys actually sit still and not panic from falling hair.</li>
            <li> I love it, I dont have to worry that I need to take a shower after cutting my hair because the vacuum takes good care of leaving no hairs.</li>
            <li> Fast, no mess hair cut.  </li>
            <li> We would normally end up just trapping him in his old high chair and just going for it</li>
            <li> because when you continually store this somewhere most of the time it will be rolled in a circle shape and sometimes very tightly.  </li>
            <li> It also take a little longer to setup the work area and put away if you cut at home but that too is ok because of the lack of hair all over the place, you can even cut your hair in the bathroom or kitchen if you want, no mess, with your shirt on.</li>
            <li> I believe the plastic the hose is made out of the bare minimum quality - that&#x27;s giving it too much credit - there&#x27;s no quality.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 10 of which we have not been able to find suitable stand in for those clippers which forced us into the used resale clippers.  </li>
            <li> I wish the vacuum parts were made of higher quality.  </li>
            <li> Gave myself my first crew cut and the vacuum sucked up all of my cut hair.</li>
            <li> If you hook it up to a shop-vac or anything with a bunch of suction like a central vacuum, you will have a clean trimmed head.</li>
            <li> I received this new unit yesterday and when I opened it, I could see the hose was kinked nearly shut on both ends.  </li>
            <li> but I think with a little practice it will be fine.</li>
            <li> First I was excited to start using my new clipper because my old one was giving me hard time already</li>
            <li> No mess!</li>
            <li> NO MESS!</li>
            <li> I supposed my next project is to mount a canister vacuum under my bathroom sink, run the hose up though the wall with a quick connect and on/off</li>
            <li> It works fine for people too, but makes trimming around ears and such a bit harder</li>
            <li> I used the Wahl Senior Vacuum clipper, it attached easily to my stand up vacuum cleaner (standard attachment)..</li>
            <li> I changed mine out with an old CPAP hose I had around the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 6.5 feet tall.</li>
            <li> I suggest to professional barber&lt;</li>
            <li> These clippers were so loud I had to put earplugs in.</li>
            <li> Overall, the clippers cut amazingly fast, and they don&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> The first one is somewhat minor:  </li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> okay using the included thick rubberband</li>
            <li> The position of the vacuum opening allows every tiny bit of hair to get sucked up; even huge clumps if your buzzing a big mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to shower, cut my hair, shower again and then try to clean up the mess the hair clippings made.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is about the hose it comes with being linked to the point that it collapsed when I started the vacumn other than that works great.</li>
            <li> We actually have two vacuums and it didn&#x27;t fit into the hose at all on one and the other I had to jam in there.</li>
            <li> no mess on me or the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> so you have no mess.</li>
            <li> The setup leaves no mess.</li>
            <li> We sat my boy down and had to get use to the idea that the vaccum had to be on at the same time as the clippers (he is not a big fan of the vaccum either:).  </li>
            <li> A haircut that used to take ten minutes plus ten more for cleanup is half that now.  </li>
            <li> , I wrestled a bear down and shaved that hairy monster right there.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been a professional barber for over 25 years and always has used the Wahl professional grade vacuum clippers.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair furiously, and was shocked to find no mess, and what a great job it did.  </li>
            <li> In theory a great idea, but with the loud clippers and vacuum going it is quite unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have an old Wahl clipper with a vacuum hose attachment.</li>
            <li> The hose is so flimsy that it doesn&#x27;t bare the weight of my vacuum&#x27;s hose when attached to it.  </li>
            <li> other issue with the vacuum connection is that the connector is really a one-size fits one-size, meaning it does not adjust to attach to multiple types of vacuums.  </li>
            <li> So much easier than our previous attempts without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Not only does it eliminate the mess of haircuts, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> In effect, it cuts off the airflow and there is no vacuum.  </li>
            <li> Some have complained about the flimsy vacuum hose but as long as you store the hose nicely loose and without pressure they will be fine.</li>
            <li> They are a bit bulky with the vacuum attachment, but overall it does  the job.  </li>
            <li> Does not connect to my Miele vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li> I hook the clipper to a hoover windtunnel upright by connecting one of the vacuum wands to the vacuum&#x27;s air intake.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use the vacuum away feature if you don&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li> As of vacuum attachment it fits to my eureka 71b.</li>
            <li> You might not like the noise of the sweeper or vacuum but for the finished cut I can put up with that</li>
            <li> , you could also get a longer hose for the vacuum and move it someplace else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl Vacuum Clipper for about a year</li>
            <li> The hose to attach it to a vacuum is a 1 star.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum cleaner was the noisy part of this operation.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this item to anyone everything you need is in the box except the vacuum of course.</li>
            <li> If their response is satisfactory, I will update and revise my review--however, I don&#x27;t see what they could do other than replace the hose, and if the new one is just as flimsy, I don&#x27;t expect it to last long.  </li>
            <li> It does vaccum most of the hair clippings, but I was disappointed there were still a few light clippings on the ground.</li>
            <li> complaint is that one of the plastic clips that holds on the vacuum duct broke off during the first use, but I just put some tape on it.</li>
            <li> so I just kept cutting, but it pulled more often as I was finishing  my my haircut, when I finally got done, my client&#x27;s head was bleeding in different part of it</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s long enough and doesn&#x27;t kink and block flow.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum attachment gets ALL of the hair as long as you don&#x27;t rush.</li>
            <li> With this clipper system, I can do a haircut in less that 5 minutes with no crying.</li>
            <li> Being tethered to a vacuum cleaner can be challenging sometimes while cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a second one &amp; could not find any other product that included the hose attachment for a vacuum.</li>
            <li> The only other issue was the vacuum hose was kinked on delivery.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m careful not to bend the new one too sharply, it doesn&#x27;t kink, so I upgraded my rating to four stars, but I still think the hose is flimsy compared to the rest of this clipper which is built extremely well.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to use at first because of the extra weight and attachment.</li>
            <li> Tried the other product from haircut-pro which is filmsy and will not last long.</li>
            <li> Wish I had it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> is that you get some decent clippers (vibration type, not motor driven) that have the hair sucker thing built on.  </li>
            <li> and I used to have to use the vacuum house in one hand and the clippers in the other.</li>
            <li> The next day, I noticed a little spot that I missed and asked him if he would come over and let me \\&quot;touch up his hair cut\\&quot;, he walked over, we turned on the vac and the clipper, touched him up, and off he went without missing a beat (normally that little spot would have had to wait until next weeks</li>
            <li> His fur is hard to cut with a normal clipper b/c it just folds over as you are trying to cut it.  </li>
            <li> If I turn the clippers upside down, the weight of the vacuum&#x27;s hose on the flimsy hose causes the flimsy hose to kink and block air flow</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate for cutting , smoothing, cleaning also convenient because of v9000 motor.</li>
            <li> when I cut my son&#x27;s hair from a super shaggy long mop to 1/8 inch buzzcut he had almost zero hair fall on him, and in doing a regular trim there&#x27;s really no need to even take a shower after cutting.</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint is that it is a little heavy, because it is built like a tank, real metal body.  </li>
            <li> We trim him and there is little to no hair left in the floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed barber and now use this Clipper 5 days a week in my shop, plastic rattles a little until you turn on the vacuum.</li>
            <li> - this is the whole idea behind this clipper too.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;specially for military hair cut; it works well.</li>
            <li> The hose is so flimsy, does not fit in my vacuum intake.  </li>
            <li> Having the vacuum attachment saves a lot of mess!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the hose that connects to the vacuum is quite flimsy (probably to keep the weight down).</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I agree with 90% of all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair clipper set to replace the similar Wahl set I had used on my three boys and husband for the past twenty years.  </li>
            <li> of the other reviewers said they use a 24 cup rubbermaid container model 7J76</li>
            <li> The other problem is the hose.  </li>
            <li> A small vacuum seems to overpower the hose and collapse it on itself.  </li>
            <li> Adjustable cutting head lets you get real close or add a blade guard and back it out to 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li> It lifts the hair enough that you get a nicer even cut and sucks it away</li>
            <li> returned - not useful - also received used</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the vacuum attachment is a bit shoddy for the price.  </li>
            <li> The motor on these clippers didn&#x27;t bog down at all.</li>
            <li> I can set up, cut my hair and stow away in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> it has multiple blades and it gets expensive thinking changing my clipper to wahl will be low maintenance</li>
            <li> Two problems, one slight, one a deal-breaker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to cut my hair at without a mess and now I can.</li>
            <li> Will save on grooming plus my little girls will always look the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Blair Royal</li>
            <li> Just takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> The hose does come a little kinked.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky when trimming around my ears and hair line</li>
            <li> I do agree with (will d.), the hose is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> These make cutting his hair so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty product.</li>
            <li> Works just as you would think it should, has a heavy duty cast aluminum body.  </li>
            <li> I emailed Wahl about this a few hours ago.  </li>
            <li> I was using them a few minutes after taking it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty without heat build up.</li>
            <li> I shave my head about every week, and HATE having to clean up the hair.  </li>
            <li> No more messy.</li>
            <li> It kinks with very little movement of clippers.</li>
            <li> It is so flimsy that it causes multiple kinks resulting in it to be absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> Some small pieces do escape being sucked up</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cost difference will likely be nil when I incorporate the cost of a functional hose</li>
            <li> The clippers will just function like ordinary clippers if you want to go that</li>
            <li> The construction is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> three year old would freak out if he got little pieces of hair on his neck or on his face which always seem to happen:(  </li>
            <li> have always bogged down a little when cutting.</li>
            <li> and I thought he just had one thick peice of hair</li>
            <li> So, no more cleaning up hair from everywhere, just clip and go for us!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic unit is much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> They are loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for cutting my hair and my sons.</li>
            <li> It arrived kinked and is a weak spot for collasp.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the ridiculously weak hose, I would rate this clipper four stars.  </li>
            <li> I use to dread all the mess &amp; clean-up when it came time to cutting my husbands hair.  </li>
            <li> So you end up pulling on tufts of fur and cutting it little bits of a time.  </li>
            <li> I downgraded 1 star for the poor quality of the air hose.</li>
            <li> This clipper sucks the fur up at the blades and makes cutting his fur a breeze.  </li>
            <li> No more hair in their eyes!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry I did.</li>
            <li> I thought the problem was solved, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have to have my wife hold the hose while I&#x27;m cutting my hair or my sons</li>
            <li> so I keep cutting</li>
            <li> The hose is disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I felt really bad</li>
            <li> Shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The clipper is awesome but the hose is absolute junk. It is so flimsy that it causes multiple kinks resulting in it to be absolutely useless. The hose was the reason I purchased this kit and I&#x27;m sorry I did. I have to have my wife hold the hose while I&#x27;m cutting my hair or my sons hair so that there is still suction. Also, the adapter into the vacuum hose doesn&#x27;t fit very well at all. We actually have two vacuums and it didn&#x27;t fit into the hose at all on one and the other I had to jam in there. The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the actual clipper is great.</li>
            <li> The hose is so flimsy, does not fit in my vacuum intake.  It was not a size fits all.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. I use to be battle to cut my 5 yr old son&#x27;s hair, getting the hair in his face- not any more :-)</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome!  Nothing to sweep up after my haircut....nothing!  I supposed my next project is to mount a canister vacuum under my bathroom sink, run the hose up though the wall with a quick connect and on/off switch!haha</li>
            <li> I agree with 90% of all the other reviews. The clippers are great, the hose is a throw away. It kinks with very little movement of clippers. I changed mine out with an old CPAP hose I had around the house. They cost about $20 to $30 at the CPAP Shop online. I can set up, cut my hair and stow away in less than 10 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t even drive to the barber shop in that time. Not to mention I save 10 bucks a pop. Love these clippers!    But I have to admit, I do miss the gossip at the barbershop!</li>
            <li> Excellent product...my Dad loves it!!</li>
            <li> Does not connect to my Miele vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li> I love it, I dont have to worry that I need to take a shower after cutting my hair because the vacuum takes good care of leaving no hairs.</li>
            <li> I believe the plastic the hose is made out of the bare minimum quality - that&#x27;s giving it too much credit - there&#x27;s no quality.  A small vacuum seems to overpower the hose and collapse it on itself.  Concept and design were there, the materials are not so I&#x27;m not giving this product much as you will be looking for a new hose (why even buy at this point).  Just a little better hose that could handle a little more flexibility with the needed strength and I&#x27;d have been in the four to five star ratings.  It&#x27;s kind of a slap in the face to customer&#x27;s when then send it out with such a garbage hose - this is the whole idea behind this clipper too.  Shocking.</li>
            <li> Cuts perfectly and sucks almost all the hair away. Some small pieces do escape being sucked up so they is a tiny bit of clean-up to do, but otherwise it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> Clippers work good. Hose will not stay on and with a Dyson it can suck shut. Work good enough I suppose.</li>
            <li> Item works as advertised.  No issues so far, except for the hose that collapsed one time when used at certain angles.  Would be a 5 star product if hose issue is resolved.</li>
            <li> I hook the clipper to a hoover windtunnel upright by connecting one of the vacuum wands to the vacuum&#x27;s air intake. The included hose hooks up securely to the wand without need for duct tape. The hose does not kink.The vacuum captures most of the hair fairly well.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for many years.  This is a well built clipper and I did not have the problems with the hose that some have had but that being said it is the hose is the cheapest thing on it. It works great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and the shipping. Would definitely buy again. I&#x27;m a licensed barber and now use this Clipper 5 days a week in my shop, plastic rattles a little until you turn on the vacuum. Will be ordering another so I have a backup</li>
            <li> Best thing purchased since sliced bread.  This makes the hair trimming a little noise but the clean up and the more effective at trimming hair.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. You can tell they are high quality and you get what you pay for... these would be perfect if it had a built-in vacuum instead of having to lug your vacuum cleaner into the bathroom with you to clip your hair. If you only have one outlet in your bathroom, you will have issues with this set.</li>
            <li> The clippers work very well.  They are a bit bulky with the vacuum attachment, but overall it does  the job.  It would be nice if this model contained an internal vacuum.  Being tethered to a vacuum cleaner can be challenging sometimes while cutting hair.  Nevertheless, this is a very good set of clippers.  It provides an adequate number of guards, a taper adjustment, and makes clean-up a cinch.</li>
            <li> I had the very first Wahl &amp;#34;vaccum adapter kit&amp;#34; which would technically fit on any clipper made by Wahl.  I had it for 20 years and it was no where near as good as this system that has the vaccum hose custom fitted to the clipper and attached.  The hose needs to be flemsy (don&#x27;t know if I spelled that correct).... because when you continually store this somewhere most of the time it will be rolled in a circle shape and sometimes very tightly.  This is a great value considering we cut our kids hair so much.</li>
            <li> Hooray! No more hair in their eyes!!! Worth every penny to have my boys actually sit still and not panic from falling hair. We bought some kid size swimming ear plugs that kind of mold to the ear. My boys put in the ear plugs, pick out a lollipop, and stand/sit still for their cuts. So much easier than our previous attempts without the vacuum. Easily pays for itself in saved trips to barber!</li>
            <li> No suction power with spacers. Hose kinks constantly.</li>
            <li> This. is. a. life. changer!  If you use clippers with any regularity, do yourself the favor and get this.  I used to shower, cut my hair, shower again and then try to clean up the mess the hair clippings made.  Now I shower and get ready and cut my hair with my work clothes on and hit the door. no mess on me or the bathroom.  great product.</li>
            <li> It does vaccum most of the hair clippings, but I was disappointed there were still a few light clippings on the ground. But at least you&#x27;ll have a vaccum cleaner handy to clean those up at the end!</li>
            <li> If you hook it up to a shop-vac or anything with a bunch of suction like a central vacuum, you will have a clean trimmed head. The position of the vacuum opening allows every tiny bit of hair to get sucked up; even huge clumps if your buzzing a big mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that one of the plastic clips that holds on the vacuum duct broke off during the first use, but I just put some tape on it.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product, I&#x27;m saying when you buy this, don&#x27;t be surprised when you find you&#x27;ll also have to buy a new and better quality hose from some material supply shop to make it pleasant to use.  McMaster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose is about as cheap as could be made and still be called a hose.  When I bought this, it was $75 while flowbees and such were just north of $100.  Unfortunately, the cost difference will likely be nil when I incorporate the cost of a functional hose that&#x27;s long enough and doesn&#x27;t kink and block flow.  I&#x27;m nearly 6.5 feet tall. The hose is so flimsy that it doesn&#x27;t bare the weight of my vacuum&#x27;s hose when attached to it.  If I turn the clippers upside down, the weight of the vacuum&#x27;s hose on the flimsy hose causes the flimsy hose to kink and block air flow entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s nice about this is that you get some decent clippers (vibration type, not motor driven) that have the hair sucker thing built on.  You don&#x27;t need to use the vacuum away feature if you don&#x27;t want to.  The clippers will just function like ordinary clippers if you want to go that route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I find a source for a better hose, I&#x27;ll update my review to include it&#x27;s source.</li>
            <li> First I was excited to start using my new clipper because my old one was giving me hard time already and my blades needed to be sharpen or replace, having  classic oster 76 it has multiple blades and it gets expensive thinking changing my clipper to wahl will be low maintenance so I did, well yesterday was my first day using my new wahl clipper and I was doing my 2nd or 3rd haircut my blade started to pull couple of hair from the root, my client didn&#x27;t care and I thought he just had one thick peice of hair so I keep cutting but every couple of stroke it will do the same but I was in the middle of a hair cut so I just kept cutting, but it pulled more often as I was finishing  my my haircut, when I finally got done, my client&#x27;s head was bleeding in different part of it and I felt really bad and I ended up not charging my client.</li>
            <li> This whole set is perfect to me. It is easy to operate for cutting , smoothing, cleaning also convenient because of v9000 motor. I suggest to professional barber&lt;br /&gt;specially for military hair cut; it works well.</li>
            <li> This works better than i could imagine. Will save on grooming plus my little girls will always look the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Blair Royal</li>
            <li> Last time I went to PetSmart they charged me $60 per cat and I had to get their shots updated (thats another $150). I used the Wahl Senior Vacuum clipper, it attached easily to my stand up vacuum cleaner (standard attachment).. My cats did not freak out because we were home and I was grooming them. No mess! No trip to the groomers!  Love it!  It paid for itself the first time I used it. I was amazed at how easy it is to use.. I actually am very impressed with the &amp;#34;Lion&amp;#34; look my cats ended up with :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair clipper set to replace the similar Wahl set I had used on my three boys and husband for the past twenty years.  My old set served us very well (replaced the clipper head twice).  I have used the new set twice already and am very happy with performance.  Having the vacuum attachment saves a lot of mess!</li>
            <li> This is a Great clipper!  The only minor complaint is that it is a little heavy, because it is built like a tank, real metal body.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that I could drive over this clipper and it would still work.  Love the vacuum attachment.  Fast, no mess hair cut.  I miss my barber, but I&#x27;m saving $15-20 a month and my hair is always trimmed up like it should be.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product. Gets the job done. Tried the other product from haircut-pro which is filmsy and will not last long. As of vacuum attachment it fits to my eureka 71b.</li>
            <li> These clippers are nice and heavy, well built and do a great job. The vacuum attachment gets ALL of the hair as long as you don&#x27;t rush. Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this vacuum clipper.  Not only does it eliminate the mess of haircuts, but it works really well.  I have always cut my boys&#x27; hair at home, but this clipper does a much more professional job.  A haircut that used to take ten minutes plus ten more for cleanup is half that now.  And my boys appreciate not having itchy hair all over them!  I can even give a quick haircut before we go somewhere if I need to without having to have the bathtub ready - just clip and go!</li>
            <li> My wife has been a professional barber for over 25 years and always has used the Wahl professional grade vacuum clippers.  Over the past 10 of which we have not been able to find suitable stand in for those clippers which forced us into the used resale clippers.  We were very happy to find that Wahl is once again making this grade of clipper and the ones which we have received have the exact same feel, fit, form, and function as the ones of old.  Great job Wahl!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My three year old would freak out if he got little pieces of hair on his neck or on his face which always seem to happen:(  We would normally end up just trapping him in his old high chair and just going for it tears and all:(  Anyway, I ordered this to see if it would do what I thought it would, and I am so happy that I did.  We sat my boy down and had to get use to the idea that the vaccum had to be on at the same time as the clippers (he is not a big fan of the vaccum either:).  But we did a couple of passes without a smock or cloth around his neck and not a hair went anywhere but the vac!!!!  He was totally fine with it!!!  The next day, I noticed a little spot that I missed and asked him if he would come over and let me \\&quot;touch up his hair cut\\&quot;, he walked over, we turned on the vac and the clipper, touched him up, and off he went without missing a beat (normally that little spot would have had to wait until next weeks haircut:)&lt;br /&gt;In the reviews, a couple of people mentioned the vaccum tube section colapsing on itself or kinking, I did not have any of that happen to me.  The kit comes with 5 or 6 of these \\&quot;rubberband-ish stays\\&quot; and if you put them over the vaccum tube and the power cord and march them out about every 6 to 8 inches from the clipper, you should not have any problem either.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that would be better, would be if the clipper was cordless.  This way you only would have the vaccum hose to worry about and not vaccum and power plug.  You might have to plan out where things work best for you a little, but these clippers are great and absolutely NO MESS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These clippers were so loud I had to put earplugs in. They are loud and annoying.</li>
            <li> It works well, the cut was clean and there were no hairs around. After a week I took them out to cut my hair again and the clippers didn&#x27;t work anymore. The motor worked, but the jaws did not move at all.</li>
            <li> Great product. Saves lots of time on clean up. Hose is flimsy and bends easy but used a good tip from a previous purchaser... Use the included bands to attach hose and electric cord together. I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received this this morning and cut my wife&#x27;s hair and mine. If you cut hair you will love this setup, smart idea and it works great. It lifts the hair enough that you get a nicer even cut and sucks it away so you have no mess. You might not like the noise of the sweeper or vacuum but for the finished cut I can put up with that, you could also get a longer hose for the vacuum and move it someplace else. The clippers are a little more bulkier than the regular clippers but the trade off is worth it, I just wished I would of bought this sooner so I didn&#x27;t have so many sets of Wahl clippers. It also take a little longer to setup the work area and put away if you cut at home but that too is ok because of the lack of hair all over the place, you can even cut your hair in the bathroom or kitchen if you want, no mess, with your shirt on. I recommend this product now but will update more after more use. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other reviewers said they use a 24 cup rubbermaid container model 7J76 [[ASIN:B000WEKLJE Rubbermaid 7J76 Easy Find Lid Rectangle 24-Cup Food Storage Container]] I am going to order one of these for storage of the hose and clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl Vacuum Clipper for about a year and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. At first I had to find a vacuum connection that fit the connection to the clipper, but once I did it worked great. We&#x27;ve saved a ton of money between the 3 guys in our family. Heavy duty product.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves these! We cut his hair every 2 weeks and I used to have to use the vacuum house in one hand and the clippers in the other. These make cutting his hair so much easier and faster. The suction on these are great, and the clippers themselves are probably the best ones we&#x27;ve ever owned. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great clippers. The hose is kinda bulky though. Just takes a little getting used to. I love them for the most part</li>
            <li> We bought this thing for our dog that we shave. This thing is magic. We trim him and there is little to no hair left in the floor.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for cutting my hair and my sons. Keep the hair off the floor. Keeps the air off me and my kids. Very high-quality clipper. I wish the vacuum parts were made of higher quality.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good clipper.</li>
            <li> Use it every week, it&#x27;s better than the flow bee.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FOR MY DOG</li>
            <li> The hose is disappointing. It arrived kinked and is a weak spot for collasp. The clippers work very well.</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing with one modification. The hose does come a little kinked. I used some electrical tape and rubber tape to pressure on the kink and hold the hose open. Overall, the clippers cut amazingly fast, and they don&#x27;t heat up. The construction is very heavy duty. The setup leaves no mess. I&#x27;m using a Eureka Mighty Mite vacuum and it works very well with this.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Good unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to make it easier and cleaner to cut my own hair.  The clipper works very well, would rate 5 stars on its own.  The hose to attach it to a vacuum is a 1 star.  It is made of extremely thin and cheap plastic.  Mine was kinked when I got it and collapsed the first time I used it.  Had to cut the kinked section out and re-attach the hose ends to get it to work.  So now it works well but the hose is 2 feet shorter.</li>
            <li> You would be better off with the Panasonic ER224S.  I could not get the various plastic clippers to stay on the unit.  The unit is bulky and noisy.  The Panasonic unit is much less expensive.  You adjust the clipper length by turning a dial.  Worked the first time and did an excellent job.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I ever own. No more messy. I will recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product, with good features and accessories, however the vacuum hose is very thin and has a tendency to kink and collapse while using it. I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works just as you would think it should, has a heavy duty cast aluminum body.  My only complaint is about the hose it comes with being linked to the point that it collapsed when I started the vacumn other than that works great.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to use at first because of the extra weight and attachment. Once I used it a few times, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> The clippers themselves work REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the vacuum attachment is a bit shoddy for the price.  The hose is incredibly flimsy, so when hooked to my Dyson vacuum it is literally crushed by the sucking power!  In effect, it cuts off the airflow and there is no vacuum.  I had to reinforce the hose with duct tape so that it wasn&#x27;t so easily bendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue with the vacuum connection is that the connector is really a one-size fits one-size, meaning it does not adjust to attach to multiple types of vacuums.  I had to fashion a &amp;#34;coupler&amp;#34; piece out of some plastic I had around the house in order for it to attach to my vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these adjustments, this contraption was truly awesome.  I shave my head about every week, and HATE having to clean up the hair.  With this, there was barely any hair in the bathroom sink, and clean up was a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for $80, the vacuum attachment should have been a lot better.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase abd service</li>
            <li> Two problems, one slight, one a deal-breaker.  This clipper is excellent except for two things.  The first one is somewhat minor:  the vacuum attachment doesn&#x27;t suck in all the hair (I have a very powerful cannister vacuum) because a few stray ones fly up away from the suction area.  However it catches 99% of them so I would still consider it a worthwhile purchase if this was the only problem.  Sadly, it&#x27;s not.  The other problem is the hose.  I received this new unit yesterday and when I opened it, I could see the hose was kinked nearly shut on both ends.  I tried to pop out the indentations, but they would immediately re-form.  I ran warm tap water over the hose and they popped out, unclogging the hose.  I thought the problem was solved, but I was wrong.  The kinked areas were un-kinked but remained weaker than the rest of the hose.  After using the clipper for about ten minutes, one of the formerly-kinked areas collapsed, closing off the hose and stopping the air flow.  I emailed Wahl about this a few hours ago.  If their response is satisfactory, I will update and revise my review--however, I don&#x27;t see what they could do other than replace the hose, and if the new one is just as flimsy, I don&#x27;t expect it to last long.  If it weren&#x27;t for the ridiculously weak hose, I would rate this clipper four stars.  EDIT:  They replaced the hose and if I&#x27;m careful not to bend the new one too sharply, it doesn&#x27;t kink, so I upgraded my rating to four stars, but I still think the hose is flimsy compared to the rest of this clipper which is built extremely well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with grooming our labradoodle.  His fur is hard to cut with a normal clipper b/c it just folds over as you are trying to cut it.  So you end up pulling on tufts of fur and cutting it little bits of a time.  This clipper sucks the fur up at the blades and makes cutting his fur a breeze.  It works fine for people too, but makes trimming around ears and such a bit harder and it&#x27;s not as maneuverable as a clipper w/o the hose.  The clipper itself is of high quality.  For the purpose i bought it for, I love it.  Saves me a ton of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where I was up to now works great. Takes me 5 min a boy. With my robo took me 20 minutes. Unreal</li>
            <li> I have an old Wahl clipper with a vacuum hose attachment. I wanted a second one &amp; could not find any other product that included the hose attachment for a vacuum. This one works great &amp; I don&#x27;t have to clean up the hair!</li>
            <li> It is awesome for buzzing my four year-old&#x27;s head.  He doesn&#x27;t cry anymore!</li>
            <li> I too had kinks in the hose, however if you run it under hot tap water the hose will resume it&#x27;s original shape. When I used it for the first time I thought the clippers were not working. I have course hair and any clippers I&#x27;ve ever used have always bogged down a little when cutting. The motor on these clippers didn&#x27;t bog down at all. The clippers operated very smooth and quit. The vacuum cleaner was the noisy part of this operation. Absolutley no mess to clean up afterward. It is a little bulky when trimming around my ears and hair line but I think with a little practice it will be fine. Storing these clippers with the hose attached can be a challenge. I&#x27;m using a 24 cup rubbermaid container model 7J76. It works great. The hose fits in the container without kinking. It&#x27;s just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add one more comment. I do agree with (will d.), the hose is a little flimsy. If I could have given it 4.5 stars I would have. If Wahl would upgrade the hose it would be a solid 5 stars. If you keep the hose straight when using the clippers you won&#x27;t have any problem. Just watch for twists, loops and kinks and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this earlier. Some have complained about the flimsy vacuum hose but as long as you store the hose nicely loose and without pressure they will be fine. the fact is that if they had used thicker material the weight of the thing would be too much. this is a well balanced instrument and perfectly engineered. this is not a comment i make very often but in this case i am.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! NO MESS! Great quality all around.</li>
            <li> This clipper is a blessing.  I use to dread all the mess &amp; clean-up when it came time to cutting my husbands hair.  Never need to time the hair cut with shower time for him.  never any hair on me, him, or the floor anymore.  Truly worth the expense, and then some!</li>
            <li> If you are a guy, then you know what it means to cut your own hair.  The hair gets everywhere, and you find it on you for days afterwards no matter how many showers you take.  Then one day I found a box on my porch, and that all changed.  I opened the box, and a massive amount of light followed by a cloud of glitter and puppies poured out and I knew right then that I had found the product I was looking for.  I cut my hair furiously, and was shocked to find no mess, and what a great job it did.  I proceeded to cut everything it would cut.  The dog&#x27;s hair, the carpet, I wrestled a bear down and shaved that hairy monster right there.  It even thanked me for doing such a good job.  You could say that I really like this product.  You should definitely buy one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to cut my hair at without a mess and now I can. The clippers and vacuum attachment are easy to use. I was using them a few minutes after taking it out of the box. Would recommend this item to anyone everything you need is in the box except the vacuum of course.</li>
            <li> Cuz its awesome! I&#x27;ve always loved the Wahl products &amp; have always wanted a vaccum system! It was a great price!</li>
            <li> I got this mainly because my son is super sensitive about hair falling on him during hair cuts and it causes huge drama every time we cut hair. Also my husband and I cut our hair once or twice a month ourselves and it would be nice not to have to clean up a bunch of hair every time. This works so amazing! I was surprised when I cut my son&#x27;s hair from a super shaggy long mop to 1/8 inch buzzcut he had almost zero hair fall on him, and in doing a regular trim there&#x27;s really no need to even take a shower after cutting. It&#x27;s quite amazing. The hose attachment actually doesn&#x27;t fit quite right on my dyson ball vaccuum, but I was able to secure it okay using the included thick rubberband and the suction seems to be quite sufficient. So, no more cleaning up hair from everywhere, just clip and go for us!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product . Gave myself my first crew cut and the vacuum sucked up all of my cut hair. Wonder full</li>
            <li> Really great clipper. Heavy duty without heat build up. Rating would be 5 stars except for hose. It&#x27;s flimsy and collapse &#x27; s on itself when you have any bend on it. Improve the hose and it&#x27;s a great buy. Still recommend as it is right now.</li>
            <li> Great cut, no hair on the floor, but unfortunately very loud. The only other issue was the vacuum hose was kinked on delivery. In theory a great idea, but with the loud clippers and vacuum going it is quite unpleasant. We will just use these for use at home not for any customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time.</li>
            <li> Good product and delivered on time</li>
            <li> Hubby likes home barber shop!  This makes it so much better, no clean up afterwards and no itchy hair all over.  Happy faces with this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this clipper. Hair cuts used to be a drama filled experience with my son who is VERY sensitive to the hair falling across is face and neck. With this clipper system, I can do a haircut in less that 5 minutes with no crying. My only complaint is that the hose that connects to the vacuum is quite flimsy (probably to keep the weight down). When it breaks, I will replace it with a higher quality hose - probably silicone. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made!</li>
            <li> these are in daily use at a barber shop, they perform the duties as well as higher priced clippers, well done!</li>
            <li> The clipper is great, but somewhat heavy. I downgraded 1 star for the poor quality of the air hose. If you like you hair short (just under 2&amp;#34;) it well replaces Flowbee, so it&#x27;s a better buy. There are 2&amp;#34; adapters available but I haven&#x27;t got them.</li>
            <li> Adjustable cutting head lets you get real close or add a blade guard and back it out to 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  What a wonderful clipper.  Don&#x27;t have dog hair floating all over the place.  Wish I had it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> returned - not useful - also received used</li>
            <li> This wahl clipper is unequaled in quality, fit and function. I would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend.</li>
