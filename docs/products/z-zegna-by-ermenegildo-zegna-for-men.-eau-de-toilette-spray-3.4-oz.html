            <li> This was my first fragrance purchase online. I was pleased with the exceptional value which was much lower than the local department stores and the efficiency in delivery. I would definitely order from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> Local stores here don&#x27;t have this Zegna in stock, I was very excited to find it and at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend at his request.  This cent is sexy and drives me crazy when he wears it, so giving it to him was a win win for me.  The deal was great, too.  He has bought this cent for much more than what it goes for on Amazon.  They sell this on other websites, but sometimes they tamper with the bottle.  Not on Amazon!  It is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Great masculine cologne. Not to strong a scent but will linger all day even after u think its gone (people would comment on it when i couldn&#x27;t smell it on myself) I spray it on almost everyday cuz it is that good. Have yet to get tired of it. I found it by accident almost when i went to the mall and was just sampling different smells to pass the time. When I came across this one, I was blown away. Literally both guys and girls regularly compliment and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. And my girlfriend esp. loves it. She compliments me every time. Next time you go to the mall look/ask for this and tell me I&#x27;m not right. Also, didn&#x27;t have any irritants mentioned from the previous reviewer. Perfectly satisfied with this product. In fact, I bought the gift set that came along. I&#x27;ve had this cologne for 1+ year.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for 7years now. I love it. I highly recommend if you a business man with style</li>
            <li> My husband has been buying Zegna for a few years always at Macy&#x27;s and recently they stopped selling it. So the only place we could find it is here. Our experience with the seller was great. Fast shipping and true legit product. We will be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> This product goes for almost twice its value retail.  I was out shopping for a friend and he wanted cologne for Christmas but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $75 on it. Did I mention it smells amazing?    It came to my door in less than four days! I cannot wait to give it to him.    I will most assuredly use Amazon for all of my online holiday purchases!</li>
            <li> Crisp, clean scent, and a little on the stronger side. It reminds me of the scent of shaving cream, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.     I worry that it slightly irritates my nose/eyes though, right after I put it on. I think my body has adapted, but new users might go through something similar.</li>
            <li> It is good by not my favorite. It does last but not for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Smells like panties dropping everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this original &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34; for quite some time!  This was offered at a great price and in its original cello!  (that is very important to me).  This scent drives my girlfriend CRAZY!  Smells much better after it sets a while and mixes with your body oils.  I receive many compliments from the ladies.  Again, the actual bottle packaging was just like buying from a department store, and the shipping container was just as awesome.  This is a class act vendor and will surely use them in the future.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Not too strong but very masculine. Get a lot of compliments on this. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as expected</li>
            <li> I totally love this cologne hope it never dissapears like so many other good ones!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfum, Why is so hard to find this beauty? My girlfriend just loved, much more then the tommy</li>
            <li> Simply the best!  Used the same one for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is difficult to find in stores now.&lt;br /&gt;I always get positive comments from women.  They want to know the name&lt;br /&gt;so they can buy it for their husbands.</li>
            <li> Great cologne. Love the scent</li>
