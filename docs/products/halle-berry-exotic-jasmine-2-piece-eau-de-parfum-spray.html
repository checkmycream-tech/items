            <li>And also a great gift for someone.</li>
            <li>I found this at Kohl&#x27;s and fell in love!!</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of jasmine on a warm summer day, this is the perfect perfume!!</li>
            <li>This is a really good smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling I must get more, my body wash is gone!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM ALL!  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing ....</li>
            <li>originally saw this fragrance at Kohl&#x27;s (at a higher price), tried it there and instantly LOVED the scent!</li>
            <li>I love Halle Berry perfume.</li>
            <li>I really love them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is long wearing and in my OPINION it is Halle&#x27;s BEST scent by</li>
            <li>This has one of the best Jasmine floral scents I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It smells good though and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, several people has told me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s downright aggravating to love a scent and to have it wear off so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m real picky about my perfumes, and each one of Halle Berry&#x27;s perfumes fit all the facets of my own uniqueness and character.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to see this for sale on Amazon</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>It is also not too sweet like some fragrances</li>
            <li>This is a good trial or starter, or gift size, but once you try it and like it you will want to go larger.</li>
            <li>It is a very gentle aroma, so if you are looking for a strong smell, this probably won&#x27;t be your scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a light &amp; fresh scent that smells very \\&quot;pretty &amp; girly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>All of her previous perfumes smell great</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how others could say it&#x27;s long lasting..... not on its best day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad.</li>
            <li>Very nice &amp; subtle I love jasmine scents &amp;</li>
            <li>It really does have a scent of Jasmine, yet it smells really clean and pretty!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, but the scent lasts for ten minutes if you&#x27;re lucky.  </li>
            <li>I would like to start by saying that many celebrity fragrances are too strong for me due to severe allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you like Clinique Happy or Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue, then you&#x27;ll love this fragrance too (at least I do)!</li>
            <li>fragrance is one that would be appropriate for ALL age groups, although for a lot of older women (50 up), it may not be intense enough, since it is light and flowery.</li>
            <li>My hubby absolutely loves this scent on me!</li>
            <li>I got closer for xmas for 2012 and smelled like raid roach spray the same person this year got me the exotic jasmine halle</li>
            <li>her first one.</li>
            <li>But would buy this perfume again in a large size of course.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome but to me the fragrence didn&#x27;t last too long as most other purfumes I had in the past.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for this particular name scent ever since my store had it as a test for a perfume/cologne gift display for the holidays.  </li>
            <li>Was not very happy with the size but not anyone&#x27;s fault but my own as I didn&#x27;t really read the caption indicating the ounces.  </li>
            <li>my new go to fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.very subtle yet sexy.only problem is the scent does not last long at all maybe an hour or two if you are lucky</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like Jasmine, and fragrance lasts only a very short time.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely fragrance, but I found it to be rather weak as it didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  </li>

            <li> Smells really nice, several people has told me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> I found this at Kohl&#x27;s and fell in love!! I was excited to see this for sale on Amazon so I bought it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like it did in the store. Maybe it was a bad/old batch? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m going to try it again and see but I may return it.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying that many celebrity fragrances are too strong for me due to severe allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I originally saw this fragrance at Kohl&#x27;s (at a higher price), tried it there and instantly LOVED the scent!

I am 33 and think it is PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;It is long wearing and in my OPINION it is Halle&#x27;s BEST scent by far!&lt;br /&gt;I bought my set here on Amazon at a great deal! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but the scent lasts for ten minutes if you&#x27;re lucky.  It&#x27;s downright aggravating to love a scent and to have it wear off so quickly.

            <li> I got closer for xmas for 2012 and smelled like raid roach spray the same person this year got me the exotic jasmine halle and I was told it smelled like bleach. All of her previous perfumes smell great and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice &amp; subtle I love jasmine scents &amp; this is great I bought it for a gift &amp; decided to keep for myself i deserve it  lol</li>
            <li> Smells amazing ....this is the best scent</li>
            <li> This is a really good smelling perfume. This is a good trial or starter, or gift size, but once you try it and like it you will want to go larger.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this particular name scent ever since my store had it as a test for a perfume/cologne gift display for the holidays.  Every time I went by it - which was once or twice a day - I would spray it &amp; walk through it.  Was not very happy with the size but not anyone&#x27;s fault but my own as I didn&#x27;t really read the caption indicating the ounces.  And, thought the tube was body lotion, not shower gel.  But would buy this perfume again in a large size of course.</li>
            <li> what little scent you got did not last wont buy again.</li>
            <li> The price is right! And Amazon always delivers. Thank you Halle! I have a feeling I must get more, my body wash is gone!</li>
            <li> The best. I love Halle Berry perfume. Try them all. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. And also a great gift for someone.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome but to me the fragrence didn&#x27;t last too long as most other purfumes I had in the past. It smells good though and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely fragrance, but I found it to be rather weak as it didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like it but not as well as reveal n her first one. Came quicky  thank u</li>
            <li> my new go to fragrance. Settle but lasts all day</li>
            <li> This has one of the best Jasmine floral scents I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.  It is a very gentle aroma, so if you are looking for a strong smell, this probably won&#x27;t be your scent.  If you love the smell of jasmine on a warm summer day, this is the perfect perfume!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like Jasmine, and fragrance lasts only a very short time.  Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> I have now purchased all of Halle&#x27;s fragrances, and guess what?!  I LOVE THEM ALL!  Each one I can see wearing at different events, and around different people.  I&#x27;m real picky about my perfumes, and each one of Halle Berry&#x27;s perfumes fit all the facets of my own uniqueness and character.  I really love them all.</li>
