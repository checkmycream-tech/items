            <li>/&gt;It lasts quite awhile, I&#x27;ve always had to add more through out the day..</li>
            <li>mostly because of the humid weather, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I would encourage everyone that I know to try this #covergirl product! :)</li>

            <li>However, after going on vacation and gaining some more color to my skin, I found that the color looked a lot better with a tanner complexion.  </li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using this product from Influenster&#x27;s IDoVoxBox.  </li>
            <li>I received this lipstick for free from influenster to test and review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*tested OVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own</li>
            <li>I did receive this for free through Influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>This new line of lipsticks from Covergirl comes in a beautiful array of colors.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have in the stash for special occasions..</li>
            <li>the coverage is pretty good...</li>
            <li>The color is super cute and it goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>I got this as a tester for free and my opinions are original and my own.</li>
            <li>My lips are very full</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got to try it for free from my Influenster IDoVoxBox, because it&#x27;s not something I would buy on my own.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and felt moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It feels sticky, not moisturizing, and I had to rub my lips together a million times to get it to spread easily.</li>
            <li>Even on the lips, the texture is smooth, gliding on easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I tested this for free through Influenster.</li>
            <li>but I received this product for review (free) from #influenster</li>
            <li>Overall I think that this is a great product</li>
            <li>I received this product compliments of #Influenster for free, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It glides on so smooth, it didn&#x27;t tug my lips at all.</li>
            <li>My lips are also darker - a mauve color - and for women with lighter colored lips, the coverage may also be significantly better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to try it out for FREE thanks to Influenster.</li>
            <li>I have very full lips and could not get a rich, consistent application of the product.  </li>
            <li>When i apply it, it goes on very smooth and has kept my lips very hydrated.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it i applied it bright and early in the morning</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look even and provide full coverage.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even wear it a full hour because I did not like the way it looked.</li>
            <li>It also seems to have a slightly sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Even if the color had been okay, I would have had to add gloss on top because it comes out relatively matte.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful everyday colour.</li>
            <li>Straight of the tube, on my hand, it feels oh so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love the classy look of this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a darker red.</li>
            <li>Other than that overall a great product!</li>
            <li>This color isn&#x27;t right for my skin tone, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>so it pretty much wins for me in any</li>
            <li>I thought this was a very nice shade of pink and was surprised by the pigmentation of it.</li>
            <li>but I have to wear  it with a liner because I have pretty pigmented lips and chocolate skin.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I was not a fan of the color.  </li>
            <li>so I am very particular about even thorough coverage.  </li>
            <li>The shade wasn&#x27;t flattering on me at all, so I had to layer different glosses over top in order to tone it down and make it look okay.</li>
            <li>Phantom pink is especially pretty.  </li>
            <li>I really like how pigmented my lipstick is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing for your lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I tried this lipstick in Phantom Pink and I love the color</li>
            <li>â€“ really creamy pinks never seem to do well on my lip texture.</li>
            <li>It was very shear and not longwear at all.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Overall I really liked my covergirl lipstick and cant wait to buy some in different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have both brighter and lighter lipsticks from other brands that blend well, whereas this color just felt like it was sitting on top of my lips.</li>
            <li>It he light pink looked great on my skin especially with a little lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I do think this product would be suitable for women that have small or thin lips as the application challenge and coverage challenge I experienced wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
            <li>and I initially thought it was a little bright</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I received a color I wouldn&#x27;t typically buy.</li>
            <li>It is a neutral pink that is soft and would flatter most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>It wears on average 4-6 hours without need for a touch up unless you have been eating and drinking more than normal.</li>
            <li>The shade that I received, Phantom Pink, looked pretty in the stick, but as soon as you put it on it looks like heavy clown makeup or something ridiculously bright that Nicki Minaj would wear.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>However, the lipstick went on kind of hard and waxy and didn&#x27;t blend with my lips at all.</li>
            <li>The lipstick glided on smoothly and lasted longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>This lipstick was lighter than what I normally wear.  </li>
            <li>It is a very pretty shade of pink and it kept my lips very moist and it stayed on for hours even after lots drinking and talking.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and makes my lips feel moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I am a brown skin girl, not to light and not to dark.</li>
            <li>I did not have to apply as many times as I usually do with my lipsticks</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty pink that I was looking forward to rocking all summer.</li>
            <li>I have to apply it multiple times, but that all depends on how much you&#x27;re drinking, talking, etc.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a slightly deeper or shinier pink but the color was not horrible.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the color too much but did find the lipstick moisturizing and lasting several hours unless your eating/ drinking....</li>
            <li>This lipstick did not leave my lips feeling dry like most brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Lasting power is average, itâ€™s mostly gone after Iâ€™ve had a meal but does leave behind a mild, even stain.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it felt but the color was all wrong for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>a dusty rose/tea rose pink.</li>

            <li> This new line of lipsticks from Covergirl comes in a beautiful array of colors.  Phantom pink is especially pretty.  It is a neutral pink that is soft and would flatter most skin tones.  I found application to be challenging with this product.  I have very full lips and could not get a rich, consistent application of the product.  It didn&#x27;t look even and provide full coverage.  This was disappointing as the color was so pretty.  My lips are very full so I am very particular about even thorough coverage.  I do think this product would be suitable for women that have small or thin lips as the application challenge and coverage challenge I experienced wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  My lips are also darker - a mauve color - and for women with lighter colored lips, the coverage may also be significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a sample at no cost but this review is entirely my opinion and not influenced by any other parties.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a very nice shade of pink and was surprised by the pigmentation of it. It wasn&#x27;t the holy grail shade for my skin tone, but it still complimented it well enough! It did have great staying power. I would try different shades of this! Overall, I felt this was a solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster, and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Really good color. I love the classy look of this lipstick. A little drying but not that bad. I received this for free, but reviews are my own.</li>
            <li> Creamy, all day color! Loved the look and feel of This lip color! A must try! I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> This lipstick was lighter than what I normally wear.  I have brown skin, so I like reds, fuschias, etc. I applied very little and I actually loved the look.  I think if I would have applied more, it would have looked pasty.  So, with this tube I definitely think less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this for free through Influenster.</li>
            <li> I am a brown skin girl, not to light and not to dark. This color look horrible on me. I will not be wearing this color lipstick anymore. Maybe if I apply a lip liner with it it will look better but never alone. It was easy to apply and felt moisturizing. I didn&#x27;t even wear it a full hour because I did not like the way it looked. I review this product for free and it is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I received my CoverGirl Outlast Longwear Lipstick in my #iDoVoxBox. I really like how pigmented my lipstick is. It&#x27;s not quiet the shade of lipstick that i would usually pick out but i really liked it. When i apply it, it goes on very smooth and has kept my lips very hydrated. It last as long as any other lipstick would of course if you eat or drink something. You will need to reapply. Overall I really liked my covergirl lipstick and cant wait to buy some in different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclamer * I tested my CoverGirl Outlast Longwear Lipstick products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> received this in my #idovoxbox from influenster...the coverage is pretty good...didn&#x27;t like the color too much but did find the lipstick moisturizing and lasting several hours unless your eating/ drinking....i would try other colors.</li>
            <li> This shade is perfect for the summer. I love how it looks with my tan skin. I did not have to apply as many times as I usually do with my lipsticks so that was a plus. Happy that I receieved this complimentary for testing purposes via Influenster but this is all my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Cute Color! This product is a neutral color that will work for any skin tone. My complexion is caramel color and I initially thought it was a little bright but once you add the perfect lip liner this lipstick is very cute. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing for your lips.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of makeup but I received this product for review (free) from #influenster but all opinions are my own.  I&#x27;m glad I received a color I wouldn&#x27;t typically buy. It he light pink looked great on my skin especially with a little lip gloss. Like I said, I won&#x27;t wear it often but it&#x27;s nice to have in the stash for special occasions..</li>
            <li> This is a good lipstick. To me it seems like a mix of a lipstick with a moisturizing lip balm. The lipstick has a nice creamy texture, goes on smoothly, and has great pigmentation/color. The lipstick is long-lasting but I did have to reapply after eating and/or drinking. It also seems to have a slightly sweet scent. Overall I think that this is a great product and I plan on trying some of the other shades. I received a complimentary sample from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this product. Luckily I got to try it for free from my Influenster IDoVoxBox, because it&#x27;s not something I would buy on my own. This is my personal opinion of the product. The shade that I received, Phantom Pink, looked pretty in the stick, but as soon as you put it on it looks like heavy clown makeup or something ridiculously bright that Nicki Minaj would wear. The shade wasn&#x27;t flattering on me at all, so I had to layer different glosses over top in order to tone it down and make it look okay. Even if the color had been okay, I would have had to add gloss on top because it comes out relatively matte. The application itself is terrible as well. It goes on heavy and does not apply evenly at all. It feels sticky, not moisturizing, and I had to rub my lips together a million times to get it to spread easily. This definitely isn&#x27;t something I would wear or try again, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful everyday colour. It wears on average 4-6 hours without need for a touch up unless you have been eating and drinking more than normal. I would say the colour is a cross between a carnation pink and a dusty rose/tea rose pink. It looks great on by itself  but I have to wear  it with a liner because I have pretty pigmented lips and chocolate skin. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love it but I do like it and it&#x27;s matte so it pretty much wins for me in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer - I received this product to try out and review. All opinions are my own and is not influenced by the company or brand.</li>
            <li> When I saw the color of the Outlast Longwear Lipstick that I received, I fell in love with it. I imagined a shimmer type of pink. The lipstick glided on smoothly and lasted longer than I expected. I was able to eat and drink and still maintain a good bit of color on my lips. I was a little disappointed in the color. It is a very pale pink, almost chalky looking. I would have preferred a slightly deeper or shinier pink but the color was not horrible. Just not what I expected. I tested COVERGIRL Outlast Longwear Lipstick for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this as a tester for free and my opinions are original and my own. I was pleasantly pleased with the quality of lipstick. It feels like a Chapstick on. It&#x27;s not sticky and is very moisturizing. However the colors aren&#x27;t my favorite. Other than that overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of #Influenster for free, but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was never much of a lipstick person, but I never knew what shade was me, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Since I received this shade of lipstick, I have worn it so much.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts quite awhile, I&#x27;ve always had to add more through out the day.. mostly because of the humid weather, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I would encourage everyone that I know to try this #covergirl product! :)</li>
            <li> I tried this lipstick in Phantom Pink and I love the color and it&#x27;s highly pigmented. However, it doesn&#x27;t last long or apply evenly. It also feels grainy on my lips, and the lipstick migrates. I tested this product for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t work out so well for me. Perhaps itâ€™s a shade/texture combination issue  â€“ really creamy pinks never seem to do well on my lip texture. Straight of the tube, on my hand, it feels oh so comfortable. Even on the lips, the texture is smooth, gliding on easily. Unfortunately, the finish is patchy on my lips. Lasting power is average, itâ€™s mostly gone after Iâ€™ve had a meal but does leave behind a mild, even stain.  I received the lipstick complimentary but the thoughts and opinions expressed are my own honest opinions.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;  I tried this product from the I DO VOXBOX and i did not like it. It came with the cap from the lipstick broken and lipstick was everywhere. Other than that, the lipstick did not hold well. It was very shear and not longwear at all. The color did not transfer well on the lips either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tested MY COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty pink that I was looking forward to rocking all summer. However, the lipstick went on kind of hard and waxy and didn&#x27;t blend with my lips at all. I have both brighter and lighter lipsticks from other brands that blend well, whereas this color just felt like it was sitting on top of my lips. Since it wasn&#x27;t flattering I didn&#x27;t not wear it out of the house and cannot speak to its long lasting capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This covergirl lip color is bomb. I was able to try it out for FREE thanks to Influenster. It is a very pretty shade of pink and it kept my lips very moist and it stayed on for hours even after lots drinking and talking. A girls must have.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I was not a fan of the color.  However, after going on vacation and gaining some more color to my skin, I found that the color looked a lot better with a tanner complexion.  I used the color in the morning with a chapstick under it.  It looked very nice!  However, it did not stay on as long as I think it is perceived to.  I do like the feel and the color.  It looks very natural and makes my lips feel moisturized.  I have really enjoyed using this product from Influenster&#x27;s IDoVoxBox.  I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! It&#x27;s perfect for the summer or when you want to do a smokey eye look. I received this gem from Influenster in the I Do Voxbox. I&#x27;ve been very happy since! I have to apply it multiple times, but that all depends on how much you&#x27;re drinking, talking, etc. I used it for a party and received great compliments! Love that it hydrates, I don&#x27;t have to apply chapstick before applying it!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is very moisturizing. It glides on so smooth, it didn&#x27;t tug my lips at all. This color isn&#x27;t right for my skin tone, but I like it a lot. I received this lipstick for free from influenster to test and review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this in the &amp;#34;i Do&amp;#34; voxbox to review. I liked the way it felt but the color was all wrong for my skin tone. I would have liked a darker red. If I can catch this in my color I would purchase it. I couldn&#x27;t find a darker color they all seemed bright. If the colors they offer are &amp;#34;your&amp;#34; colors then I say go for it!&lt;br /&gt;*tested OVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own**</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this product. The first time I used it i applied it bright and early in the morning around 7am by 1pm it was still in place. The color is super cute and it goes on very easily. This lipstick did not leave my lips feeling dry like most brands I have used in the past. I did receive this for free through Influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
