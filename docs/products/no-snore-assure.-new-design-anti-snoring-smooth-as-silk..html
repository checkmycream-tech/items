    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These work great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of inserts and these are the best.</li>
            <li>For me, the smallest size was the best choice; however, having those things inside my nostrils wake me up continuously (maybe every 20 minutes) until I just take them out.</li>
            <li>Works well and give a good night sleep for the neighbor in bed.</li>
            <li>Have to say, I haven&#x27;t been thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>Much more effective than the nose strips.</li>
            <li>these didn&#x27;t work for me, but i am very glad that they were available for purchase as an option to try.  </li>
            <li>These are better.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a surgical type stent would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li>: okay, so these don&#x27;t stop me from snoring, but i began snoring even with the pressure of the cpap machine and started using these with the cpap.  </li>
            <li>but these are better.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned condensation with this product, and I do feel that my nose feels more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; while using this product.  </li>
            <li>so I can breathe and sleep better.  </li>
            <li>OK, this could work for you.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is one of the more helpful to me.  </li>
            <li>If my nose isn&#x27;t too stopped up, this does a nice job of opening my airway, which is important to staying asleep.  </li>
            <li>Two stars because it does not hurt and I was able to sleep with it on with no issues (for me anyway).</li>
            <li>Threadbare ok unit slips out easily.</li>
            <li>good product fast shipping</li>
            <li>but the product is well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>these r so comfortable.</li>
            <li>oh and i like the idea of multiple sizes and the price is great</li>
            <li>Great totally worked!!</li>
            <li>they are fairly comfortable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>realized my septum is deviated, so am also trying to use them to realign the septum, because they kind of hold that cartilage straight inside the nose.  </li>
            <li>I had to decide which fit better-2 nights</li>
            <li>It is comfortable though.</li>
            <li>I think they are well worth the money at $16.99 (sh &amp; H included) for what they do for your health!</li>
            <li>but I got used to it really quick.  </li>
            <li>I woke up refreshed and alert for the first time in five years!  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have multiple sizes but results are so so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than those that only sends you 1 that suppose to fit all (a lie).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was using breathe right which worked well</li>
            <li>Some people might find this particular item comfortable, but I do not and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Simple and elegant solution to my night panics.</li>
            <li>They should hold up for several months and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>It is made of latex and smells and feels exactly like rubber bands.</li>
            <li>First, it never stopped my snoring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using the product at this point.  </li>
            <li>I really did not expect these to work as well as they do.  </li>
            <li>My wife says the snoring is much imporved</li>
            <li>Very usable amd plable.</li>
            <li>Gentle in nasal passages and stay in during sleep.  </li>
            <li>i think it really depends on the cause of your snoring.  </li>
            <li>they really helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>i really like this product now and am going to buy another set.</li>
            <li>The cylindrical shape of my old Snorepin is much more comfortable, with the smaller diameter side being inserted quite easily deep into the nose.  </li>
            <li>They are cheaply made but who cares as long as they work.</li>
            <li>More or less collapses after it&#x27;s put in your nose.</li>
            <li>The added floppiness of the two larger nosepieces renders them almost ineffective at being able to hold the nostrils open to the desired degree to aid breathing and/or stop snoring.  </li>
            <li>The larger ones are much better than the other assorted sizes they give you.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using such an item and they do the job by stopping the snoring.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the length of the device is too short so more than half the time I use the product it falls out of my nose.  </li>
            <li>The do have different sizes which is great, i just tend to be uncomfortable with even the smallest size.</li>
            <li>when using them with the cpap, there is air pressure while these are holding my nose straight, and i see a big difference in the balance of my nose, and my breathing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t experience additional moisture with my old Snorepin that has a caged design.  </li>
            <li>The product is soft but I would not describe then as silk (need to change description).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem to be too soft.  </li>
            <li>These had minimal success.  </li>
            <li>Not sure  if its working, when im in a good sleeo they fall out evn after cuttin them down, they arent bothersome, and they are bulky</li>
            <li>The only down side is ( I am new to using these) if your nose is running it isn&#x27;t as comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I found that the larger ones that is wider than your nose will hold likely stay in place as oppose to the exact nose size.</li>
            <li>The two smaller sizes included in the package are easy enough to maneuver into the nose due to the added firmness associated with the smaller circumference of the nosepiece.  </li>
            <li>went back to using the nasal ventalators I bought at the local drugstore - very rigid and uncomfortable at first, but now I have gotten used to them and they are working!</li>

            <li> went back to using the nasal ventalators I bought at the local drugstore - very rigid and uncomfortable at first, but now I have gotten used to them and they are working!</li>
            <li> It works fine... a little uncomfortable at first, but keeps my nose open.  </li>
            <li> mine comes from the relaxing of tissue somewhere up higher in the nose, at least 1/2-inch above where these end.  </li>
            <li> They were too soft to hold my nostrils open, and condensation would build up and drip down from my nose.</li>
            <li> The two larger nosepieces in the set are floppier due to the larger circumference, thereby making them more difficult to maneuver into the nose.  </li>
            <li> The result of using them (for me) was a very dry throat.</li>
            <li> Tube does not really encourage the opening of the airway.</li>
            <li> Even with continual readjustment (not very sanitary) to keep in place, there was no change to my snoring.</li>
            <li> and you really do not notice them when wearing them.  </li>
            <li> instead my nostrils closed up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the even, tube-like shape of this product and found it difficult to insert comfortably high enough up into my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> the other product i used was plastic like material and it rubbed the inside of my nose til it was too sore to insert the product.</li>
            <li> so i can breath better :(</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying them especially due to the affordability and multiple times they can be used.</li>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;home remedy&amp;#34; type products like this lately.  </li>
            <li> I feel them going in it just feels odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pain but it a slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have very small nostrils so these are pretty uncomfortable to me.</li>
            <li> Not real effective.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The device was not comfortable and did not work.</li>
            <li> This products didn&#x27;t work for me, just waste money.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Not a great side effect (dry throat -&amp;#62; sore throat).</li>
            <li> I use the small and med.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t suffer from overheating at night like usual.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, no more paying for nose strips and having to wash off that residue.</li>
            <li> I hate breathe right strips as they strip the skin from my nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked, but this did work for cutting down on my snoring and it&#x27;s relatively comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 1 star because at least it is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> Not only is it very uncomfortable to put in and sleep with, but it slips out during the night, getting lost in the sheets.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s too late to return, but this was an uncomfortable waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is a little weird putting these up your nose</li>
            <li> A bit uncomfortable and not real effective!</li>
            <li> I was tired of having my nose strips take off a layer of skin every time I used one.  </li>
            <li> Could not even wear it for 20 minutes before it became too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Sorry, does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable in your noise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful but it did work</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like having size options!</li>
            <li> good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> This worked for me.  It does fall out but it is definitely worth trying.  My hubbie and I get to stay in the same bed for now!!</li>
            <li> I was tired of having my nose strips take off a layer of skin every time I used one.  These are better.  My nose did not run and they stayed in place throughout the night.  The larger ones are much better than the other assorted sizes they give you.</li>
            <li> Tube does not really encourage the opening of the airway. More or less collapses after it&#x27;s put in your nose.</li>
            <li> I have very small nostrils so these are pretty uncomfortable to me. I feel them going in it just feels odd. It&#x27;s not a pain but it a slight discomfort. Some nights I cannot bring myself to use them because I have to force them in my nostrils. All of that being said, they do work. I did not snore at all when they were in. I feel them opening my passage ways but I also feel like you hear me breathing when I put them in. The do have different sizes which is great, i just tend to be uncomfortable with even the smallest size.</li>
            <li> Bought to help with sleep apnea and allergy related congestion.  These had minimal success.  Perhaps a surgical type stent would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li> Threadbare ok unit slips out easily. I use the small and med.</li>
            <li> these r so comfortable. the other product i used was plastic like material and it rubbed the inside of my nose til it was too sore to insert the product. these i can wear with no rubbing and sometimes i forget i have them in my nose. and they work like they say they are suppose to. keeps my air passages open. oh and i like the idea of multiple sizes and the price is great</li>
            <li> Not sure  if its working, when im in a good sleeo they fall out evn after cuttin them down, they arent bothersome, and they are bulky</li>
            <li> These work great!  I didn&#x27;t suffer from overheating at night like usual.  I got up fewer times to go to the restroom.  I woke up refreshed and alert for the first time in five years!  I think they are well worth the money at $16.99 (sh &amp; H included) for what they do for your health!</li>
            <li> Now I can breath at night.</li>
            <li> They do open the airway, but slip out by the time you wake up.</li>
            <li> It hurts when i use it and it dont work for me i think i need surgery so i can breath better :(</li>
            <li> The device was not comfortable and did not work.</li>
            <li> A bit uncomfortable and not real effective!</li>
            <li> Works somewhat. Not real effective. Nice to have multiple sizes but results are so so.</li>
            <li> No Snore Assure does work. It takes some getting use to the feel and they sometimes come out in the middle of the night. I bought them because of my deviated septum which it seems to help. I would recommend trying them especially due to the affordability and multiple times they can be used. Much more effective than the nose strips.</li>
            <li> I really did not expect these to work as well as they do.  Simple and elegant solution to my night panics.</li>
            <li> It works fine... a little uncomfortable at first, but keeps my nose open.  My wife says the snoring is much imporved</li>
            <li> Works well and give a good night sleep for the neighbor in bed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with my snoring. It&#x27;s also very uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Very usable amd plable. Gentle in nasal passages and stay in during sleep.  Recommend them to those with COPD symptoms</li>
            <li> It is a little weird putting these up your nose but I got used to it really quick.  The only down side is ( I am new to using these) if your nose is running it isn&#x27;t as comfortable.  On the plus side, no more paying for nose strips and having to wash off that residue.</li>
            <li> This products didn&#x27;t work for me, just waste money. Thank You. Zakir</li>
            <li> I used this product as instructed, and tried several of the included sizes, only to hear that there has been no change in my snoring over the entire time I&#x27;ve been using the product. Now it&#x27;s too late to return, but this was an uncomfortable waste of my money. Not only is it very uncomfortable to put in and sleep with, but it slips out during the night, getting lost in the sheets. Even with continual readjustment (not very sanitary) to keep in place, there was no change to my snoring. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked, but this did work for cutting down on my snoring and it&#x27;s relatively comfortable.  I don&#x27;t notice it after a minute or so.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Great totally worked!!</li>
            <li> It helps with my snoring and my wife tells me she can notice the difference</li>
            <li> None of the sizes would stay in my nose, even after trimming them. They were too soft to hold my nostrils open, and condensation would build up and drip down from my nose. Could not even wear it for 20 minutes before it became too uncomfortable to wear. A shame, guess I&#x27;ll have to stick with the nose strips.</li>
            <li> these didn&#x27;t work for me, but i am very glad that they were available for purchase as an option to try.  i think it really depends on the cause of your snoring.  mine comes from the relaxing of tissue somewhere up higher in the nose, at least 1/2-inch above where these end.  but the product is well made and easy to use.  they are fairly comfortable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: okay, so these don&#x27;t stop me from snoring, but i began snoring even with the pressure of the cpap machine and started using these with the cpap.  they really helped a lot.  realized my septum is deviated, so am also trying to use them to realign the septum, because they kind of hold that cartilage straight inside the nose.  they have helped in that regard as well.  when using them with the cpap, there is air pressure while these are holding my nose straight, and i see a big difference in the balance of my nose, and my breathing.  i really like this product now and am going to buy another set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of inserts and these are the best. I was using breathe right which worked well but these are better. They are cheaply made but who cares as long as they work. They should hold up for several months and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> After trial and error. I found that the larger ones that is wider than your nose will hold likely stay in place as oppose to the exact nose size. Otherwise they slip out in the middle of the night. You also need to trim them to the length of your nostrils.  It is made of latex and smells and feels exactly like rubber bands. This is NOT silicone as the ad states, but rubber. This is why I gave it 4 stars, however it does what it states.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my father</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because one of my Snorepins broke, and I wanted to try a similar product for comparison purposes.  I don&#x27;t like the even, tube-like shape of this product and found it difficult to insert comfortably high enough up into my nostrils.  The cylindrical shape of my old Snorepin is much more comfortable, with the smaller diameter side being inserted quite easily deep into the nose.  I don&#x27;t like the somewhat flimsy texture of this product.  The two smaller sizes included in the package are easy enough to maneuver into the nose due to the added firmness associated with the smaller circumference of the nosepiece.  The two larger nosepieces in the set are floppier due to the larger circumference, thereby making them more difficult to maneuver into the nose.  The added floppiness of the two larger nosepieces renders them almost ineffective at being able to hold the nostrils open to the desired degree to aid breathing and/or stop snoring.  Another reviewer mentioned condensation with this product, and I do feel that my nose feels more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; while using this product.  I don&#x27;t experience additional moisture with my old Snorepin that has a caged design.  Regarding snoring, I find that this product, the Snorepin, and similar products don&#x27;t help my snoring at all, but they do aid in keeping my nostrils open so I can breathe and sleep better.  Some people might find this particular item comfortable, but I do not and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, there were a total of 4 in the package.  I had to decide which fit better-2 nights did it for me.  They work well and you really do not notice them when wearing them.  I beats what I had to wear before by 100%.  The product is soft but I would not describe then as silk (need to change description).  It&#x27;s better than those that only sends you 1 that suppose to fit all (a lie).  This is my first time using such an item and they do the job by stopping the snoring.</li>
            <li> OK, this could work for you. It&#x27;s certainly worth a try. For me, the smallest size was the best choice; however, having those things inside my nostrils wake me up continuously (maybe every 20 minutes) until I just take them out. The result of using them (for me) was a very dry throat. Not a great side effect (dry throat -&amp;#62; sore throat).</li>
            <li> Could not make it stay in place.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would do the trick and provide some relief for my wife. It did not. In fact, she thought my snoring was actually louder with it.</li>
            <li> I gave this 1 star because at least it is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;These did not work for me.  I tried the various sizes that came in the pack, but still didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be too soft.  That is, they would almost &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cave in&amp;#34; when I would insert them in my nose.  And since they would &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cave in&amp;#34;, they were ineffective in opening my nostrils...instead my nostrils closed up these tubes!&lt;br /&gt;I went back to using the nasal ventalators I bought at the local drugstore - very rigid and uncomfortable at first, but now I have gotten used to them and they are working!</li>
            <li> I only used it once to test it and it fall off while I was sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;home remedy&amp;#34; type products like this lately.  I would say that this is one of the more helpful to me.  If my nose isn&#x27;t too stopped up, this does a nice job of opening my airway, which is important to staying asleep.  Overall, I would recommend giving this a try if you are having that problem.</li>
            <li> I still snore and they stay in, until you get a runny nose.  I hate breathe right strips as they strip the skin from my nose.  I also snore a lot so, I decided to give the No Snore Assure a try.  First, it never stopped my snoring.  But, it does help my nasal passages stay open.  That is until my nose runs.  Then they follow suit by running out of my nose.  It is comfortable though.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me.  So from what I am told, this did not reduce snoring at all.  Two stars because it does not hurt and I was able to sleep with it on with no issues (for me anyway).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop/limit snoring whatsoever</li>
            <li> This thing actually worked for me.... I was doubtful but it did work</li>
            <li> Sorry, does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable in your noise.  Doesn&#x27;t work for me anyway.  Back to breathe rite strips.</li>
            <li> Have to say, I haven&#x27;t been thrilled with this product.  I have a deviated septum constricting the airflow in one nostril and the smallest of the four No Snore Assure sizes is still too big for my nostril.  Additionally, the length of the device is too short so more than half the time I use the product it falls out of my nose.  I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using the product at this point.  Have to try another product for my condition (sleep apnea).</li>
