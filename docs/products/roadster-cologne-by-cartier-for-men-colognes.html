            <li>100% satisfied</li>
            <li>I love roadster.</li>
            <li>Mint opening is unreal and it just keeps getting better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this cologne.</li>
            <li>Cartier Roadster is a wonderful woody scent, and yet not so popular as to be worn by every other person.  </li>
            <li>In my own opinion, i think the cologne is good for mature men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Company offers a great buying experience; ships promptly.</li>
            <li>I HAVE STRONG ALLERGY  </li>
            <li>STRONG AIRWAY SPASMS.I</li>
            <li>This is simply an old scent, it is putrid to be honest and I own about 50 bottles of designer cologne and can enjoy almost all of them.  </li>
            <li>No problem whatsoever, I have continued to do business with amazon since, I purchased CREED&#x27;s Virgin island water for nearly half the price and got an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>i got it for my husband and is such a great  smell, i cant ride of it.</li>
            <li>Really great for short interactions with others.</li>
            <li>I found it interesting that all of the cologne websites have Roadster listed as oriental and spicy, and I will say the first spray could be viewed as \\&quot;spicy in a strong sort of way\\</li>
            <li>strong and cool perfumes try this one you Will not regret.    </li>
            <li>Very distinct fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very distinct fragrance.</li>

            <li>You will smell unique.  </li>
            <li>Its smells good right away and even better hours later.</li>
            <li>Sexy masculine scent that women love.  </li>
            <li>The top flaps were very cleverly sealed again.  </li>
            <li>I use it very often and surely will buy another after this is gone</li>
            <li>sure you buy from amazon direct which will show up as amazon llc. or sold and shipped by amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;sort of fresh and spicy.</li>
            <li>I made I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely not what I expected, but after some time it mellows out and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>the notes in the fragrance are subdued and not strong.... very pleasant masculine fragrance to be around....</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and the batch code checks up to be a 2013 batch meaning it is fresh juice.</li>
            <li>Okay, When you first spray this it&#x27;s going to knock you upside your head, it&#x27;s that type of cologne, but if you give it a second, maybe to</li>
            <li>But, this is the only one that I love.</li>
            <li>I wont really recommend it to youths like myself..</li>

            <li>I opened the top of the paper board box and the inner flaps had serial/lot numbers that had been cut carefully from the box.  </li>
            <li>at work all the girls and men has a comment to tell him about it.&lt;br /&gt;HE PUTS IT ON EARLY IN THE MORNING AND EVEN AT NIGHT I CAN STILL SMELL IT ON HIM.&lt;br /&gt;ITS</li>

            <li>really like it and has the quality of a much more expensive</li>

            <li> Sexy masculine scent that women love.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Yes it met my expectations. Since this is a discontinued product by Cartier it is nice to know I can still purchase it through Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fragrance to be wore at night. Cartier always makes it right with their sober perfumes. It&#x27;s not a sport cologne as you might expect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume and I like it too much, if you like the official, strong and cool perfumes try this one you Will not regret.    Osama aljohani</li>

            <li> To my untrained nose, Smells like Pine and old man.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not what I expected, but after some time it mellows out and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> ordered roadster by cartier and it was just as I expected, minty and fresh. This is the real deal and the batch code checks up to be a 2013 batch meaning it is fresh juice. No problem whatsoever, I have continued to do business with amazon since, I purchased CREED&#x27;s Virgin island water for nearly half the price and got an excellent product.  All in all make sure you buy from amazon direct which will show up as amazon llc. or sold and shipped by amazon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping along with brand new product!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice fragrance.  It smells sort of spicy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and has the quality of a much more expensive cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sort of fresh and spicy.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s my ultimate favorite at a price you can&#x27;t refuse! Buy it! Would definitely buy again! So good!</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> Another catch&#x27;em scent</li>
            <li> Just the right strength, smells great on (my bf) and lasts all day. Cartier has an untouchable line of perfume/cologne as far as quality goes.</li>
            <li> Ok, so you might think this is an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; fragrance, but I love it and I was tired of spending $100 on it at Nordstrom. It&#x27;s the real deal and a great value.</li>
            <li> Okay, When you first spray this it&#x27;s going to knock you upside your head, it&#x27;s that type of cologne, but if you give it a second, maybe to and you get through that intial \\&quot;shock and awe\\&quot; \\&quot;chemical warfare - Weapons of Mass Destruction phase\\&quot;, It&#x27;s all good! I found it interesting that all of the cologne websites have Roadster listed as oriental and spicy, and I will say the first spray could be viewed as \\&quot;spicy in a strong sort of way\\&quot;  but the smell that sticks with you for hours and hours is the smell of wood. Yes wood! The best smelling wood in the world... A wood you can&#x27;t indentify so you just keep trying to smell it... I even find myself months into it,..trying to figure out what wood it smells like....lol I know, crazy right...Bottom line...I like it, my wife likes it, and it&#x27;s a cologne for awesome manly men between the age 30-40yrs old.</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle, I noticed the plastic wrapper had been tampered with, as if someone had opened the top of the wrapper.  The top flaps were very cleverly sealed again.  I opened the top of the paper board box and the inner flaps had serial/lot numbers that had been cut carefully from the box.  Upon further inspection of the bottle, the lot numbers on the bottle itself had been ground off the glass.  The scent itself is untouched and very good, but the packaging and bottle have been altered.  Cartier Roadster is a wonderful woody scent, and yet not so popular as to be worn by every other person.  You will smell unique.  In regards to the packaging, one should be warned, however.  The tampering with the bottle will make it unsuitable to be a gift.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Cartier scent.  I also use Declaration and Declaration Essence.  Cartier&#x27;s Mathilde Laurent is a genius.  The mint and vetiver combination is a perfect scent.  A little goes a long way and lasts.</li>
            <li> I LIKED AND RECOMENDED THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED AND RECOMENDED THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED AND RECOMENDED THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED AND RECOMENDED THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Very good choice I made I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> The ultimate manly cologne. I shouldn&#x27;t review it because I don&#x27;t want competition. But, this is the only one that I love.</li>
            <li> This is simply an old scent, it is putrid to be honest and I own about 50 bottles of designer cologne and can enjoy almost all of them.  I am not a super-picky fragrance lover, this one is just horrible.</li>
            <li> Probably the best scent developed by the Cartier team for men...............this adds some sport to the spicy blend of hypnotic oils and essences.  Puts the rugged back into masculine colognes.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff. Highly recommended from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the mint in this fragrance after the initial sprays settle, but from what I&#x27;ve read, mint is difficult to capture and hold for long. I&#x27;ve found this to be the case for me. It is a nice fragrance for a couple hours. Really great for short interactions with others. Take the bottle with you should you want to re-apply for longer affect.</li>
            <li> me encanto esta fragancia</li>
            <li> Good job. I was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but Good stuff.  Has a piny woodsy smell.  I wear it round the winter holidays. Smells like Christmas</li>
            <li> Very distinct fragrance. For the price and fast shipment, you can&#x27;t go wrong. 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great... thanks.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell</li>
            <li> This is probably the nicest men lotion I have ever bought.  I use it very often and surely will buy another after this is gone</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it smells horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love roadster. Buy it you wont regret promise. Its smells good right away and even better hours later. Best cologne ive had in awhile.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.............and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve gotta say! But don&#x27;t take my word for it, PICK IT UP!! Mint opening is unreal and it just keeps getting better throughout the day. Long lasting, at least 10-12 hrs on my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife.  Even though designed for men,  My wife finds this to to be very nice for her.  One of her favorites.</li>
            <li> I HAVE STRONG ALLERGY  FROM  THIS PERFUME.....STRONG AIRWAY SPASMS.I NEVER HAD ALLERGIES UNTIL IT BECAME TO USE THIS PERFUME</li>
            <li> 100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here... I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li> Smells a bit different than the smells I am used to, but it doesn&#x27;t offend me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this cologne. One bottle lasted me several months. I think I&#x27;ll stick with Roadster for now.</li>
