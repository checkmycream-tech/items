            <li> No I am not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> This is amazing fragrance.  Cant keep my wife off of me and I love it.</li>
            <li> Opinion(3rd cologne review of 4): good scent, but not the best. I like that isn&#x27;t overbearing. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t grate on your nerves. I like it, but don&#x27;t love it. This is a scent you can try in the sample size if you don&#x27;t want to go all out and buy the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but women love this cologne.  I get compliments on it all the time - even from complete strangers!
