            <li>I have fair ivory skin that is drawn up with a bunch of freckles.</li>

            <li>Does a good job on my skin</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>It spread very easily and had a great smell to it.</li>
            <li>Im very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li>but it truly does work I get so many compliments on my great skin....</li>
            <li>I will say that the product is incredibly moisturizing, goes on as smooth as silk, and made my hands noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Ambi Sikncare fade cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to note</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Nice tube, smells good, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I have way more confidence!</li>
            <li>Roc products are doing a much better job!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finished the first tube of this 2-pack, and I&#x27;m really impressed!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend this to everyone looking for better, healthier skin!</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this product!</li>
            <li>This product does amazing job in fading my pigmentation</li>
            <li>AMAZING</li>
            <li>The best part about this cream is that it works so fast</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait a while so that I can give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This works for a fraction of the price of the prescription kind.</li>
            <li>so your skin will take time to heal on its own.</li>
            <li>so that was a nice surprise)</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>Its great and has really changed my life and the way I feel about my skin!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair (pun intended), I have rather light skin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about this product because the reviews were so good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it exactly as directed-- twice a day, every day-- and have still seen great results.</li>
            <li>I put it on under my night cream though which smells super good</li>
            <li>It does have a kind of strong smell, but I got used to it over time.</li>
            <li>need to write seven more words</li>
            <li>(Rubbing it in works better)</li>
            <li>Ambi Fade Cream is a great product and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>You would probably get better results from bio-oil.</li>
            <li>I did more research and found this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper &amp; works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay over $10 for this.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times, however, this time it does not seem to be working as well.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper if you plan on buying more then one.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that it will fade soon.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t drop a lot of $ on it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll give it a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With being more confident I want to take pictures and go swimming and know that my skin will finally look beautiful!</li>
            <li>I am able to use Ambi concentrated on each spot twice a day without irritation now for 10 days.</li>
            <li>I am usually able to tell if there is irritation with 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>Some of the redness has gone away, so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li>And, I am pleased to say that it worked for me as well.  </li>
            <li>Some of them had been there for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have no problem applying make up over top of it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a month on my arm.</li>
            <li>I had a sexy nice smooth stomach because I had my son.</li>
            <li>Better now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use for about 5-7 more days and then call it.</li>
            <li>The product does as it says, my skin has whitened from the use of it and many of the blemishes I had on my face have faded away.</li>
            <li>I Have searched and searched for this product and way pleased to find it.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product does work for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for scar discolorations, but great on age spots etc.</li>
            <li>I use this product on many areas of my body.</li>
            <li>Its faded sun spots, lightened scars &amp; made them more supple.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s softening and smells ok.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would spend much more because of the scent of it.</li>
            <li>(most products cause either burning, redness or breakouts, this did not do that for me,</li>
            <li>Today marks 2 months of using this product EVERY day and more days than not</li>
            <li>It was really a miracle, the product works great for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product works better on darker skin?</li>
            <li>I feel my skin is softer and more even toned.  </li>
            <li>ok..</li>
            <li>I am HIGHLY satisfied.</li>
            <li>BUY IT! :)</li>
            <li>there is a limit to it, but it is defiantly better than waiting months for it to work.</li>
            <li>I am seeing great results with no negative effects as of yet.</li>
            <li>so many products irritate my skins but so far, this has been great.  </li>
            <li>an okay pleasant cream, does nothing special for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;packaging and pricing are good enough though.&lt;br /&gt;Greetz from Marja</li>
            <li>With Ambi Skincare Fade Cream my age spots are fading beautifully and barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>In the summer, I just put it on more lightly in the T zone to avoid oiliness.</li>
            <li>and I still remember that I got these products with a good deal and really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, right!?!?  </li>
            <li>I asked a Walgreens Cosmetics employee what would be the best fade cream for me (since all the other ones that I have tried, did not work), and she recommended Ambi.  </li>
            <li>but then it disappears very quickly..</li>
            <li>but I wish it didn&#x27;t contain some of the strong chemicals.</li>
            <li>Good product for even tone lighter normal skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snake oil to put it mildly!</li>
            <li>There seems to be a very mild improvement but not enough to write a great review about.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast!!</li>
            <li>But after using it that night before bed, it was love at first sight!</li>
            <li>My skin took a huge hit.</li>
            <li>I think $60 face creams are a rip off, and anything that promises huge results has to be</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t put a huge glob on.</li>
            <li>It also refines my skin to a nice texture and am considering using it as a day and night cream on my whole face because of its texture-refining ability.  </li>
            <li>The two tubes it came with is nice, but is way too much.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It does take longer (it took about 2.5 months to fade my spots as light as I wanted) but now even when I skip a week my spots still are lighter.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall, its a great price and works aeesome</li>
            <li>two bottles arrived and honestly it&#x27;s too much product, but I guess it&#x27;s good to have more than not enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy I found this gem at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of brown spots on my face that are too stubborn to go away, but I am definitely happy with the overall results.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked this great since I was u middle school, 16</li>
            <li>It keeps her skin smooth and even</li>
            <li>If you do this a couple days in a row, it will be 100 times better, so it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li>But it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This would not be a good product for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my third week of using this wonderful product, and I see so much improvement.</li>
            <li>This is quite a nice and effective cream, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Dirt cheap, effective, gentle.</li>
            <li>Good product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It absolutely works!!!</li>
            <li>With a price like this, it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do I love it</li>
            <li>so I was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this cream based on the majority of reviews.  </li>
            <li>It has significantly faded my melasma, and all but disappeared one of my sun spots.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s from the sun</li>
            <li>I originally was going to buy the Proactiv version as I&#x27;m a customer of theirs, but all the reviews for this product (and Proactiv) said to go this route - plus</li>
            <li>I already see significant fading.</li>
            <li>than one month later - my daughters skin is clear and perfect again!  </li>
            <li>Continue to increase my water intake, clean up my diet and continue using Ambi morning and night on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It goes smoothly on the skin, the scent was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>I got milia around my mouth, nose and on my cheeks as well as some bumps/acne on the right side of my face!  </li>
            <li>It will probably work better for spot treatments, but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement there either.</li>
            <li>I find my face gets incredibly oily and will develop a pimple within a few hours after application.</li>
            <li>skin really does look better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>T get the full benefit from this</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is its smell, it did not work for me</li>
            <li>This is good for a hand/face cream only.</li>
            <li>fast arrival, expiration date not for another year and change :) good purchase, will definitely order my needs repeatedly from here</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li>Despite the many awesome reviews this product received both on Amazon &amp; various other websites</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat medicinal smell that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>i bought this product because a lot of people were saying that it was relly good, well this product didnt work for me, i used it for two weeks and didnt get any good results, after two weeks i stopped using it because my face got even worse, my face got irritate, i do not recommend it because it didnt work for me</li>
            <li>Some blotchy areas have faded [not that much] but hey, it&#x27;s only been two weeks lol...</li>
            <li>And I fade scars quickly --but</li>
            <li>This product helped me out tremendously.</li>
            <li>Havent noticed a change quickly.</li>
            <li>The cream quickly irritated my skin and had to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have moderate melasma, but I&#x27;ve never been able to use this product for more than a week.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this Fade Cream to anyone who wants a more even skin tone, or who wants to eliminate acne scars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that if you put some on and leave it on for around an hour without rubbing it in, you can get some pretty quick results!</li>
            <li>I use it all over and when used twice a day and makes a huge improvement pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Im buying a new order now because my acne is way better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45, fair and was prone to acne, dry patchiness, and rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly anti-beauty industry and anti-food industry and these books helped resolve a lot of minor but nagging health issues that I have had for many decades.</li>
            <li>This cream makes you wake up with such soft, beautiful, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I can not believe how well this product worked even in the first week of use!  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is meant to do!</li>
            <li>This stuff is well worth the money</li>
            <li>I stopped using because it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakouts I was getting from it.</li>
            <li>read a number of reviews for similar products on here, and liked the ones for Ambi</li>
            <li>have had much more luck with professional skin treatments for visible evening of my skintone.</li>
            <li>So I noticed a definite uptick in nice compliments probably because it smoothed out the spots on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it is terribly useful for fading that type of mark.</li>
            <li>I had little faith that it would actually be very effective.</li>
            <li>That put me off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally a burbly enthusiastic reviewer but really----this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it right if you want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>In addition I clean my underarm skin with a gentle scrub to help exfoiliate the darker skin.</li>
            <li>I get acne marks and usually this product works great to eliminate them, however, it is not working as well this time.</li>
            <li>I would get the usually menstrual period pimple [lol] but NEVER have I had a breakout like this in my 29 years of life</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cream to correct dark spots.</li>
            <li>It lightened it completely after a week or two but the most significant part is that it brought the scar to complete healing.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy a more expensive brand of fade cream that is very popular right now, and I was looking at it here when I saw a review for Ambi.</li>
            <li>Given the wide variety of skin types, exposure conditions and tolerance for chemicals and additives, I&#x27;m sure there is no product that is universally successful, which would explain the wide range of ratings for this product.</li>
            <li>Just dab a little on the problem area and you should be good.</li>
            <li>Because she is so very fair, every minor skin discoloration always seemed very noticeable on her skin and would take a long time to disappear.  </li>
            <li>With patience, this product works very well!</li>
            <li>It takes some time to work, but if consistently used, it will work.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this first instead.</li>
            <li>Have noticed an overall better appearance to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I started seeing results within the first week of me using this product.</li>
            <li>have now been using this for exactly four weeks now, once a day.</li>
            <li>an pretty she use the cream soap over the years an man it works</li>
            <li>I have to buy more for next year.</li>
            <li>We searched the internet and found out that Proactiv had a fade cream to do away with this exact problem.  </li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>However I read some of the ingredients may be very harmful!  </li>
            <li>But this stuff really worked for me!</li>
            <li>First Review:  5/20/2014</li>
            <li>first started using Ambi about two years ago</li>
            <li>Just make sure you apply enough product on the skin, and care to not have it rubbed off by clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay more next time for a better quality product that will actually show results.</li>
            <li>Its better than the generic fade cream</li>
            <li>My hands are smooth, soft and blemish-free.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>I know it won&#x27;t be first but</li>
            <li>one more month, and finally I could tell it was fading.</li>
            <li>I have used the Ambi for more than 4 years, even before it came to commercial.  </li>
            <li>It also has a distinct &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first week I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I guess, mostly on the left side, probably from driving my car.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see if improvement continues as we get into fall and winter.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that the red areas would have cleared more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did take a while to see the difference, and at first I was worried because I did feel like my skin felt greasy.</li>
            <li>Because I took a picture of my hands when I first started and there&#x27;s nothing different,,,,,,,,I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>smells funny and did nothing for me</li>
            <li>First I used this under my eyes and although I saw results I could not ignore the dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in color in the age spots on my face, though I had hoped they would have faded a bit more than they actually have.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But I tried AMBI first because it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopeful but dubious about the claims, I clung to the positive reviews on this page and ordered  a pack of two for the very reasonable price it was offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also gonna increase my water intake and make sure my pillow cases are clean every night to make sure nothing else is irritating my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many face washes such as Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear and even Proactive.</li>
            <li>The blotches have considerably shrunken in size from the outside-in and have paled significantly.</li>
            <li>Love it; works very well to correct irregular skin tones on face, neck, upper chest, hands and arms.</li>
            <li>It minimized the spots enough that people actually commented that I looked good, or ask what makeup I was using,</li>
            <li>I have no idea what any positive reviewers were talking about.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 1 full tube and have another and will use it, but so far nothing has changed....</li>
            <li>I still give it 3 stars because at $8 for two tubes, it works decently as a maintenance product after my treatments to keep the spots from returning, especially in the summer when I have more sun exposure.</li>
            <li>She said it didn&#x27;t appear to do much in the first weeks but after continuous use, anyone can see how very even her skin tone is.  </li>
            <li>Those results are less spectacular</li>
            <li>know I sound like a commercial, but I really really really believe in this product!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you purchase the Ambi Daily Moisturizer because you NEED a moisturizer whenever you use a fading cream.</li>
            <li>it has noticeably faded two large age spots on my face and is gradually lightening the undereye area.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s skin is sensitive and this product is gentle but does a good job of lightening dark spots.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement to my skin when I used it at all.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t bother me all that much</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice much change.</li>
            <li>so much thank</li>
            <li>I friend of my recommended and it really works for me.</li>
            <li>no noticeable change really, its not offensive smelling though.</li>
            <li>it really clears up my skin</li>
            <li>and it worked REALLY well for me with no issues [no discoloration, no irritation, no breakouts...].  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is still a bit rough, but its WAY better than it was before I started using Ambi again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is really working to lighten up my spots.</li>
            <li>its a  gentle moisturizer and nothing beyond that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Ambi!</li>
            <li>It works really fast as well.</li>
            <li>This is really working for me.</li>
            <li>They really works.  </li>
            <li>If it really does work after 2-3 months</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to do anything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no spring chick and didn&#x27;t really think it would work</li>
            <li>but heck, for the price, I wasn&#x27;t going to lose much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I feel like I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup</li>
            <li>bags under my eyes and it really worked..</li>
            <li>So just imagine how much my stomach stretch.  </li>
            <li>that I really saw what it looked</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>This cream use to really work years ago to remove blemishes and make the skin softer until they changed the product...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the products</li>
            <li>I really like the way this cream works.  </li>
            <li>But I wash my face at night and cleanse it with alcohol and put the amibi in the areas where needed and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>and I could really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Not only has it not made any change at all to the three light age spots on my face, they have gotten darker.  </li>
            <li>I use the Daily Moisturizer and absolutely love it, so I thought I would give the Fade Cream a try to help with some old Acne scars.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that works and cost very little!  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>As many other reviewers mentioned...</li>
            <li>Of course it takes a couple of days to see the differences other than that i love it.</li>
            <li>They will fade over the winter months (not all the way) but come straight back after a full day in the sun regardless of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good product to fade dark spots and upper lip line for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it along with Cetaphil face wash, which is a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Even used in a super tiny dose this is very greasy.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it for a month and my black spots have cleared up so much that Im having to start look closely to detect them and apply more ambi to where it vanishes.</li>
            <li>My 25-year old daughter uses this twice daily on her face, neck and upper chest area, and she has an absolutely amazing complexion now.  </li>
            <li>This cream fades the spots completely over about a 3-4 month period if used consistently.  </li>
            <li>Not really sure if it is working, but it has a nice texture.  </li>
            <li>This product gave me MORE acne, and I bought it to try and get rid of dark marks caused by acne.</li>
            <li>I do see some results of fading of dark spots I have on the sides of my face on my upper cheekbones, but I think I would likely have even better results if I used it more</li>
            <li>None the less, I suggested this to a couple of people and they love it and find that it works well for them.</li>
            <li>At this rate it would take years of use, twice a day, and MAYBE you may be able to notice some slight change.</li>
            <li>Decent price at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li>I like this: recommended by doctor for the 2% of its main ingredient.</li>
            <li>There are much more expensive products out there, but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.</li>
            <li>Only thing that has given me results quickly.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but smell a little funny.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are considering a purchase, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Nadinola, Menderma, Xtreme Brite Gel, High Time Tone Repair, all to no avail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product...</li>
            <li>so high, I bought two.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few products to try and get rid of my very light sun spots/freckles with no results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take discoloration away completely but definitely fades significantly.</li>
            <li>My skin is SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li>Not after one application, of course, but after about a week of continuous use the scars have faded and my complexion is a little more uniform.</li>
            <li>however, I haven&#x27;t been using it more than a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I ditched all of those products and decided to use normal facewash to help with my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The left side was COVERED in blotches with VERY dark circles under eyes and spotted right side and on the top of my hands.</li>
            <li>I am a mildly pale redhead with a bit more than a smattering of freckles.</li>
            <li>Many of the other reviewers used the product for a very brief time before chiming in with their criticism, but I really did give it a lengthy trial.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy that this black splotch that I had for years is finally gone, the product worked but it can take a very long time,</li>
            <li>I went thru acute  liver, kidney and pancreas failure.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smell and it does have a slightly strange smell but it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>The other thing is that the bottles are huge and I got two of them.</li>
            <li>Light pink in color, they were evidence of the trauma her skin has sustained while under hormonal attack!  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t eaten anything new [allergic reaction]</li>
            <li>I am now having to throw away a practically new tube and one that hasn&#x27;t been opened.</li>
            <li>but then my skin becomes very sensitive to everything after that,</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and started getting little brown spots on my face, especially around my eyebrows, and the tops of my hands several years ago.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, and lightens my dark spots</li>
            <li>At the age of 45, I had the hands of a 75 year old!</li>
            <li>Also, the first couple of weeks I kept forgetting to either put it on at night or in the morning, so I wasn&#x27;t using it regularly like I should have.</li>
            <li>can see someone using the product for only 3 or 4 weeks and claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work so that is something to be aware of, you aren&#x27;t going to use this and see results in a week.for only 3 or 4 weeks and claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work so that is something to be aware of, you aren&#x27;t going to use this and see results in a week.</li>
            <li>I really did see my melasma fade significantly after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>It probably took three months before my skin was clear again, with the exception of new acne spots around my period time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to go thru a tube and re-commit to wearing a strong sunscreen everyday and see if that does the trick.</li>
            <li>And it has helped clear up my chronic adult acne, to boot!  </li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks dark spots fade significantly.  </li>
            <li>Or see a dermatologist if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have health insurance that covers such things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for several weeks now, and while my dark spot is not gone yet-it is significantly lighter!</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear before (besides when I was a baby of course)</li>
            <li>The three items combined worked to clear her skin in about 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and the Even &amp; Clear concentrate.</li>
            <li>Even and Clear Tone</li>
            <li>My face is clear and i dont have anymore pimple marks</li>
            <li>Really this stuff is foul, like perfumy, flowery and nearly headache inducing, I finally got used to the scent, but I don&#x27;t know if it would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It will stain clothing, so wear your old T-shirt or else be cautious.</li>
            <li>I have developed age spots on my hands.</li>
            <li>but because my skin is so sensitive even my finger nail would leave marks.</li>
            <li>your natural skin tone is restored, you can discontinue use of the product\\&quot;, without the use of the cream, tyrosinase is no longer inhibited and over time the spots will return.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin, but this does not bother her one bit.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne which leaves brown blotches from wherever I&#x27;ve had breakouts.</li>
            <li>so much where they now only look like freckles!</li>
            <li>Ambi Skincare Fade Cream so far has not worked....</li>
            <li>my spots on my face have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>The spots sprinkling my hands nearly gone.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft to the touch whenever I apply the fade cream.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it arrived early.</li>
            <li>I have some brown spots on the side of my neck and face from tanning too frequently (I haven&#x27;t gone for a couple of years, but for two years I would go 5 times a week for 15 minutes).</li>
            <li>and I was getting increasingly self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>But, even though the price is modest, I bought it, and I will continue to use it in the hope that there is a cumulative effect.</li>
            <li>And, it substantially lightened the ones that it didn&#x27;t completely remove.  </li>
            <li>i got this as just another try before pay for treatment (because i have sensitive</li>
            <li>I can only really call it a rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try natural shea butter instead and hope that works.</li>
            <li>I might need to consult with a professional or use something stronger.</li>
            <li>And it has also faded my old acne scars away too like the description says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As far as fade cream goes, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and so far I do see my age spots fading.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skins</li>
            <li>real downside that seems to be on everyone&#x27;s mind is the possible carcinogens in the stuff.</li>
            <li>I do not see any improvement to my problem so far, using it twice a day for 1 month.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>be careful when you use it that you only put it on the red spots and not all over as I found sometimes my pores get clogged around that area (and therefore more pimples).  </li>
            <li>I used this product faithfully for 3 months, as directed, on an age spot that had developed on my face.  </li>
            <li>if you do it right :) its so cheap, so dont waste your money on Proactiv or anything else equally as expensive.</li>
            <li>It now seems to be watered down and less effective...</li>
            <li>but it is now working better than a very expensive product from a famous maker I tried for 3 months and returned (got my money back!!).  </li>
            <li>However, since it contains hydroquinone I thought it could be useful for getting rid of other scars anywhere except my face, and it does.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it did work and didn&#x27;t mess up my super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had one dark spot on the left side of my face, and one that was a much lighter on the right side of my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, but it just keeps getting better the longer you use it.</li>
            <li>She is pretty obsessive about using it regularly along with using sunscreen, and I think that may be key.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products that promise to fade the dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I have one obvious one, and a bunch of light ones, but now they are all dark!  </li>
            <li>After using the cream daily for many months I saw only a very slight fading of the sun spots of my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, using this in conjunction to eliminating wheat products (\\&quot;Wheat Belly\\&quot;) and using the cleansing and care processes found in the \\&quot;Japanese Skin Revolution\\&quot; has given my skin a new life.</li>
            <li>It may be because I&#x27;ve been taking it slowly or mine are just a bit stubborn, but either way, I&#x27;m planning on continuing for the next two months to see if they will fade any more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product if your skin is very sensitive, i applied this one and woke up with my skin all red and burn.</li>
            <li>had a scar on my knee in Feb. Got the the product and started using it 3 weeks later and its almost faded completely!</li>
            <li>After looking at reviews on Amazon and other sites, this was the first product I tried.</li>
            <li>Yanno us over 50 crowd needs all the help we can get without major surgery</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it is a permanent solution unless I can keep the pigmentation at bay via a strong, daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>And finally, when the outbreak is clear, you have to have a fade cream to fade away the discoloration of the skin damage.  </li>
            <li>This product also has been confirmed to trigger milia problems for me (milia are small deep clogged pores).  </li>
            <li>I may pull this back out of the closet and give it a try--however this product will get no where near my face ever again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks now - it is recommended to apply the cream twice a day, however, with my busy schedule, I only apply it during the night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>Only given it a 3 because too early to tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li>So far, my pigmentation has come back when I quit using it</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really no point of using it to get rid of the old marks if it will just cause new ones to appear.</li>
            <li>After only several weeks of twice daily use...no more sun spots--I mean none.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good as any expensive cream with hydroquinone!</li>
            <li>bottom line is that being a teenager is hard enough without a huge face of pimples.  </li>
            <li>He thought it was new foundation, but I told him I&#x27;m using the same foundation and the only thing I&#x27;m using different is the fade cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 yr old african american woman fyi.</li>
            <li>the dark spots on my feet look exactly the same as they did before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this might be an acceptable risk for someone with localised, large dark areas on their skin, for my (age) spots</li>
            <li>It smells a little funny but nothing noticable.</li>
            <li>It really helped minimize and fade the dark spots.</li>
            <li>After one and a half months of using this cream twice a day, everyday, my fades went from easy to see, to completly invisible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a less than a third of the way through the first tube and will definitely be buying this product forever.</li>
            <li>, dark spots become lighter quickly withen two weeks, but be careful in using it because it contains 2%hydroquinone, this is danger, search for it in google and try to use the product for short time and stop it gradually</li>
            <li>I like that my freckles seems be be less noticiable, but I do not care much for the scent</li>
            <li>I tried using this religiously for about 3 months straight (since all products take time) and saw no result in fading dark spots/acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li>Only have used it 2 and a half weeks didn&#x27;t really see a difference at all.</li>
            <li>This tube is more than enough to last a few months since only a small amount is needed twice a day.</li>

            <li> Im very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> but it truly does work I get so many compliments on my great skin....</li>
            <li> I will say that the product is incredibly moisturizing, goes on as smooth as silk, and made my hands noticeably softer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased to note</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and the price is great.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I have way more confidence!</li>
            <li> Roc products are doing a much better job!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finished the first tube of this 2-pack, and I&#x27;m really impressed!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend this to everyone looking for better, healthier skin!</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this product!</li>
            <li> This product does amazing job in fading my pigmentation</li>
            <li> AMAZING</li>
            <li> The best part about this cream is that it works so fast</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a while so that I can give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This works for a fraction of the price of the prescription kind.</li>
            <li> so your skin will take time to heal on its own.</li>
            <li> so that was a nice surprise)</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Its great and has really changed my life and the way I feel about my skin!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair (pun intended), I have rather light skin.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because the reviews were so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it exactly as directed-- twice a day, every day-- and have still seen great results.</li>
            <li> I put it on under my night cream though which smells super good</li>
            <li> It does have a kind of strong smell, but I got used to it over time.</li>
            <li> need to write seven more words</li>
            <li> (Rubbing it in works better)</li>
            <li> Ambi Fade Cream is a great product and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> You would probably get better results from bio-oil.</li>
            <li> I did more research and found this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper &amp; works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay over $10 for this.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times, however, this time it does not seem to be working as well.</li>
            <li> Its cheaper if you plan on buying more then one.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that it will fade soon.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t drop a lot of $ on it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll give it a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With being more confident I want to take pictures and go swimming and know that my skin will finally look beautiful!</li>
            <li> I am able to use Ambi concentrated on each spot twice a day without irritation now for 10 days.</li>
            <li> I am usually able to tell if there is irritation with 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Some of the redness has gone away, so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> And, I am pleased to say that it worked for me as well.  </li>
            <li> Some of them had been there for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem applying make up over top of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month on my arm.</li>
            <li> I had a sexy nice smooth stomach because I had my son.</li>
            <li> Better now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use for about 5-7 more days and then call it.</li>
            <li> The product does as it says, my skin has whitened from the use of it and many of the blemishes I had on my face have faded away.</li>
            <li> I Have searched and searched for this product and way pleased to find it.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product does work for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for scar discolorations, but great on age spots etc.</li>
            <li> I use this product on many areas of my body.</li>
            <li> Its faded sun spots, lightened scars &amp; made them more supple.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s softening and smells ok.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would spend much more because of the scent of it.</li>
            <li> (most products cause either burning, redness or breakouts, this did not do that for me,</li>
            <li> Today marks 2 months of using this product EVERY day and more days than not</li>
            <li> It was really a miracle, the product works great for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works better on darker skin?</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is softer and more even toned.  </li>
            <li> ok..</li>
            <li> I am HIGHLY satisfied.</li>
            <li> BUY IT! :)</li>
            <li> there is a limit to it, but it is defiantly better than waiting months for it to work.</li>
            <li> I am seeing great results with no negative effects as of yet.</li>
            <li> so many products irritate my skins but so far, this has been great.  </li>
            <li> an okay pleasant cream, does nothing special for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;packaging and pricing are good enough though.&lt;br /&gt;Greetz from Marja</li>
            <li> With Ambi Skincare Fade Cream my age spots are fading beautifully and barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> In the summer, I just put it on more lightly in the T zone to avoid oiliness.</li>
            <li> and I still remember that I got these products with a good deal and really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> , right!?!?  </li>
            <li> I asked a Walgreens Cosmetics employee what would be the best fade cream for me (since all the other ones that I have tried, did not work), and she recommended Ambi.  </li>
            <li> but then it disappears very quickly..</li>
            <li> but I wish it didn&#x27;t contain some of the strong chemicals.</li>
            <li> Good product for even tone lighter normal skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snake oil to put it mildly!</li>
            <li> There seems to be a very mild improvement but not enough to write a great review about.</li>
            <li> I received it very fast!!</li>
            <li> But after using it that night before bed, it was love at first sight!</li>
            <li> My skin took a huge hit.</li>
            <li> I think $60 face creams are a rip off, and anything that promises huge results has to be</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t put a huge glob on.</li>
            <li> It also refines my skin to a nice texture and am considering using it as a day and night cream on my whole face because of its texture-refining ability.  </li>
            <li> The two tubes it came with is nice, but is way too much.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It does take longer (it took about 2.5 months to fade my spots as light as I wanted) but now even when I skip a week my spots still are lighter.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall, its a great price and works aeesome</li>
            <li> two bottles arrived and honestly it&#x27;s too much product, but I guess it&#x27;s good to have more than not enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so happy I found this gem at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of brown spots on my face that are too stubborn to go away, but I am definitely happy with the overall results.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked this great since I was u middle school, 16</li>
            <li> It keeps her skin smooth and even</li>
            <li> If you do this a couple days in a row, it will be 100 times better, so it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li> But it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This would not be a good product for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my third week of using this wonderful product, and I see so much improvement.</li>
            <li> This is quite a nice and effective cream, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Dirt cheap, effective, gentle.</li>
            <li> Good product for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It absolutely works!!!</li>
            <li> With a price like this, it is worth a shot!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do I love it</li>
            <li> so I was pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this cream based on the majority of reviews.  </li>
            <li> It has significantly faded my melasma, and all but disappeared one of my sun spots.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s from the sun</li>
            <li> I originally was going to buy the Proactiv version as I&#x27;m a customer of theirs, but all the reviews for this product (and Proactiv) said to go this route - plus</li>
            <li> I already see significant fading.</li>
            <li> than one month later - my daughters skin is clear and perfect again!  </li>
            <li> Continue to increase my water intake, clean up my diet and continue using Ambi morning and night on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It goes smoothly on the skin, the scent was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> I got milia around my mouth, nose and on my cheeks as well as some bumps/acne on the right side of my face!  </li>
            <li> It will probably work better for spot treatments, but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement there either.</li>
            <li> I find my face gets incredibly oily and will develop a pimple within a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> skin really does look better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> T get the full benefit from this</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is its smell, it did not work for me</li>
            <li> This is good for a hand/face cream only.</li>
            <li> fast arrival, expiration date not for another year and change :) good purchase, will definitely order my needs repeatedly from here</li>
            <li> Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> Despite the many awesome reviews this product received both on Amazon &amp; various other websites</li>
            <li> It has a somewhat medicinal smell that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because a lot of people were saying that it was relly good, well this product didnt work for me, i used it for two weeks and didnt get any good results, after two weeks i stopped using it because my face got even worse, my face got irritate, i do not recommend it because it didnt work for me</li>
            <li> Some blotchy areas have faded [not that much] but hey, it&#x27;s only been two weeks lol...</li>
            <li> And I fade scars quickly --but</li>
            <li> This product helped me out tremendously.</li>
            <li> Havent noticed a change quickly.</li>
            <li> The cream quickly irritated my skin and had to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have moderate melasma, but I&#x27;ve never been able to use this product for more than a week.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this Fade Cream to anyone who wants a more even skin tone, or who wants to eliminate acne scars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that if you put some on and leave it on for around an hour without rubbing it in, you can get some pretty quick results!</li>
            <li> I use it all over and when used twice a day and makes a huge improvement pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Im buying a new order now because my acne is way better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45, fair and was prone to acne, dry patchiness, and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mostly anti-beauty industry and anti-food industry and these books helped resolve a lot of minor but nagging health issues that I have had for many decades.</li>
            <li> This cream makes you wake up with such soft, beautiful, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how well this product worked even in the first week of use!  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is meant to do!</li>
            <li> This stuff is well worth the money</li>
            <li> I stopped using because it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakouts I was getting from it.</li>
            <li> read a number of reviews for similar products on here, and liked the ones for Ambi</li>
            <li> have had much more luck with professional skin treatments for visible evening of my skintone.</li>
            <li> So I noticed a definite uptick in nice compliments probably because it smoothed out the spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it is terribly useful for fading that type of mark.</li>
            <li> I had little faith that it would actually be very effective.</li>
            <li> That put me off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a burbly enthusiastic reviewer but really----this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it right if you want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> In addition I clean my underarm skin with a gentle scrub to help exfoiliate the darker skin.</li>
            <li> I get acne marks and usually this product works great to eliminate them, however, it is not working as well this time.</li>
            <li> I would get the usually menstrual period pimple [lol] but NEVER have I had a breakout like this in my 29 years of life</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cream to correct dark spots.</li>
            <li> It lightened it completely after a week or two but the most significant part is that it brought the scar to complete healing.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a more expensive brand of fade cream that is very popular right now, and I was looking at it here when I saw a review for Ambi.</li>
            <li> Given the wide variety of skin types, exposure conditions and tolerance for chemicals and additives, I&#x27;m sure there is no product that is universally successful, which would explain the wide range of ratings for this product.</li>
            <li> Just dab a little on the problem area and you should be good.</li>
            <li> Because she is so very fair, every minor skin discoloration always seemed very noticeable on her skin and would take a long time to disappear.  </li>
            <li> With patience, this product works very well!</li>
            <li> It takes some time to work, but if consistently used, it will work.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this first instead.</li>
            <li> Have noticed an overall better appearance to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I started seeing results within the first week of me using this product.</li>
            <li> have now been using this for exactly four weeks now, once a day.</li>
            <li> an pretty she use the cream soap over the years an man it works</li>
            <li> I have to buy more for next year.</li>
            <li> We searched the internet and found out that Proactiv had a fade cream to do away with this exact problem.  </li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> However I read some of the ingredients may be very harmful!  </li>
            <li> But this stuff really worked for me!</li>
            <li> First Review:  5/20/2014</li>
            <li> first started using Ambi about two years ago</li>
            <li> Just make sure you apply enough product on the skin, and care to not have it rubbed off by clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pay more next time for a better quality product that will actually show results.</li>
            <li> Its better than the generic fade cream</li>
            <li> My hands are smooth, soft and blemish-free.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> I know it won&#x27;t be first but</li>
            <li> one more month, and finally I could tell it was fading.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ambi for more than 4 years, even before it came to commercial.  </li>
            <li> It also has a distinct &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first week I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I guess, mostly on the left side, probably from driving my car.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see if improvement continues as we get into fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the red areas would have cleared more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take a while to see the difference, and at first I was worried because I did feel like my skin felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Because I took a picture of my hands when I first started and there&#x27;s nothing different,,,,,,,,I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> smells funny and did nothing for me</li>
            <li> First I used this under my eyes and although I saw results I could not ignore the dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in color in the age spots on my face, though I had hoped they would have faded a bit more than they actually have.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But I tried AMBI first because it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopeful but dubious about the claims, I clung to the positive reviews on this page and ordered  a pack of two for the very reasonable price it was offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also gonna increase my water intake and make sure my pillow cases are clean every night to make sure nothing else is irritating my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face washes such as Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear and even Proactive.</li>
            <li> The blotches have considerably shrunken in size from the outside-in and have paled significantly.</li>
            <li> Love it; works very well to correct irregular skin tones on face, neck, upper chest, hands and arms.</li>
            <li> It minimized the spots enough that people actually commented that I looked good, or ask what makeup I was using,</li>
            <li> I have no idea what any positive reviewers were talking about.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 1 full tube and have another and will use it, but so far nothing has changed....</li>
            <li> I still give it 3 stars because at $8 for two tubes, it works decently as a maintenance product after my treatments to keep the spots from returning, especially in the summer when I have more sun exposure.</li>
            <li> She said it didn&#x27;t appear to do much in the first weeks but after continuous use, anyone can see how very even her skin tone is.  </li>
            <li> Those results are less spectacular</li>
            <li> know I sound like a commercial, but I really really really believe in this product!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you purchase the Ambi Daily Moisturizer because you NEED a moisturizer whenever you use a fading cream.</li>
            <li> it has noticeably faded two large age spots on my face and is gradually lightening the undereye area.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is sensitive and this product is gentle but does a good job of lightening dark spots.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement to my skin when I used it at all.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bother me all that much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much change.</li>
            <li> so much thank</li>
            <li> I friend of my recommended and it really works for me.</li>
            <li> no noticeable change really, its not offensive smelling though.</li>
            <li> it really clears up my skin</li>
            <li> and it worked REALLY well for me with no issues [no discoloration, no irritation, no breakouts...].  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin is still a bit rough, but its WAY better than it was before I started using Ambi again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is really working to lighten up my spots.</li>
            <li> its a  gentle moisturizer and nothing beyond that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Ambi!</li>
            <li> It works really fast as well.</li>
            <li> This is really working for me.</li>
            <li> They really works.  </li>
            <li> If it really does work after 2-3 months</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to do anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no spring chick and didn&#x27;t really think it would work</li>
            <li> but heck, for the price, I wasn&#x27;t going to lose much.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I feel like I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup</li>
            <li> bags under my eyes and it really worked..</li>
            <li> So just imagine how much my stomach stretch.  </li>
            <li> that I really saw what it looked</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This cream use to really work years ago to remove blemishes and make the skin softer until they changed the product...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the products</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cream works.  </li>
            <li> But I wash my face at night and cleanse it with alcohol and put the amibi in the areas where needed and it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> and I could really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Not only has it not made any change at all to the three light age spots on my face, they have gotten darker.  </li>
            <li> I use the Daily Moisturizer and absolutely love it, so I thought I would give the Fade Cream a try to help with some old Acne scars.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that works and cost very little!  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers mentioned...</li>
            <li> Of course it takes a couple of days to see the differences other than that i love it.</li>
            <li> They will fade over the winter months (not all the way) but come straight back after a full day in the sun regardless of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good product to fade dark spots and upper lip line for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it along with Cetaphil face wash, which is a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Even used in a super tiny dose this is very greasy.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a month and my black spots have cleared up so much that Im having to start look closely to detect them and apply more ambi to where it vanishes.</li>
            <li> My 25-year old daughter uses this twice daily on her face, neck and upper chest area, and she has an absolutely amazing complexion now.  </li>
            <li> This cream fades the spots completely over about a 3-4 month period if used consistently.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is working, but it has a nice texture.  </li>
            <li> This product gave me MORE acne, and I bought it to try and get rid of dark marks caused by acne.</li>
            <li> I do see some results of fading of dark spots I have on the sides of my face on my upper cheekbones, but I think I would likely have even better results if I used it more</li>
            <li> None the less, I suggested this to a couple of people and they love it and find that it works well for them.</li>
            <li> At this rate it would take years of use, twice a day, and MAYBE you may be able to notice some slight change.</li>
            <li> Decent price at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this: recommended by doctor for the 2% of its main ingredient.</li>
            <li> There are much more expensive products out there, but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.</li>
            <li> Only thing that has given me results quickly.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but smell a little funny.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are considering a purchase, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nadinola, Menderma, Xtreme Brite Gel, High Time Tone Repair, all to no avail.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product...</li>
            <li> so high, I bought two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few products to try and get rid of my very light sun spots/freckles with no results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take discoloration away completely but definitely fades significantly.</li>
            <li> My skin is SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li> Not after one application, of course, but after about a week of continuous use the scars have faded and my complexion is a little more uniform.</li>
            <li> however, I haven&#x27;t been using it more than a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I ditched all of those products and decided to use normal facewash to help with my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The left side was COVERED in blotches with VERY dark circles under eyes and spotted right side and on the top of my hands.</li>
            <li> I am a mildly pale redhead with a bit more than a smattering of freckles.</li>
            <li> Many of the other reviewers used the product for a very brief time before chiming in with their criticism, but I really did give it a lengthy trial.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy that this black splotch that I had for years is finally gone, the product worked but it can take a very long time,</li>
            <li> I went thru acute  liver, kidney and pancreas failure.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smell and it does have a slightly strange smell but it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is that the bottles are huge and I got two of them.</li>
            <li> Light pink in color, they were evidence of the trauma her skin has sustained while under hormonal attack!  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t eaten anything new [allergic reaction]</li>
            <li> I am now having to throw away a practically new tube and one that hasn&#x27;t been opened.</li>
            <li> but then my skin becomes very sensitive to everything after that,</li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and started getting little brown spots on my face, especially around my eyebrows, and the tops of my hands several years ago.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, and lightens my dark spots</li>
            <li> At the age of 45, I had the hands of a 75 year old!</li>
            <li> Also, the first couple of weeks I kept forgetting to either put it on at night or in the morning, so I wasn&#x27;t using it regularly like I should have.</li>
            <li> can see someone using the product for only 3 or 4 weeks and claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work so that is something to be aware of, you aren&#x27;t going to use this and see results in a week.for only 3 or 4 weeks and claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work so that is something to be aware of, you aren&#x27;t going to use this and see results in a week.</li>
            <li> I really did see my melasma fade significantly after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> It probably took three months before my skin was clear again, with the exception of new acne spots around my period time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to go thru a tube and re-commit to wearing a strong sunscreen everyday and see if that does the trick.</li>
            <li> And it has helped clear up my chronic adult acne, to boot!  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks dark spots fade significantly.  </li>
            <li> Or see a dermatologist if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have health insurance that covers such things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for several weeks now, and while my dark spot is not gone yet-it is significantly lighter!</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear before (besides when I was a baby of course)</li>
            <li> The three items combined worked to clear her skin in about 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and the Even &amp; Clear concentrate.</li>
            <li> Even and Clear Tone</li>
            <li> My face is clear and i dont have anymore pimple marks</li>
            <li> Really this stuff is foul, like perfumy, flowery and nearly headache inducing, I finally got used to the scent, but I don&#x27;t know if it would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It will stain clothing, so wear your old T-shirt or else be cautious.</li>
            <li> I have developed age spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> but because my skin is so sensitive even my finger nail would leave marks.</li>
            <li> your natural skin tone is restored, you can discontinue use of the product\\&quot;, without the use of the cream, tyrosinase is no longer inhibited and over time the spots will return.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin, but this does not bother her one bit.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne which leaves brown blotches from wherever I&#x27;ve had breakouts.</li>
            <li> so much where they now only look like freckles!</li>
            <li> Ambi Skincare Fade Cream so far has not worked....</li>
            <li> my spots on my face have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> The spots sprinkling my hands nearly gone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft to the touch whenever I apply the fade cream.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it arrived early.</li>
            <li> I have some brown spots on the side of my neck and face from tanning too frequently (I haven&#x27;t gone for a couple of years, but for two years I would go 5 times a week for 15 minutes).</li>
            <li> and I was getting increasingly self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> But, even though the price is modest, I bought it, and I will continue to use it in the hope that there is a cumulative effect.</li>
            <li> And, it substantially lightened the ones that it didn&#x27;t completely remove.  </li>
            <li> i got this as just another try before pay for treatment (because i have sensitive</li>
            <li> I can only really call it a rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try natural shea butter instead and hope that works.</li>
            <li> I might need to consult with a professional or use something stronger.</li>
            <li> And it has also faded my old acne scars away too like the description says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As far as fade cream goes, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and so far I do see my age spots fading.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skins</li>
            <li> real downside that seems to be on everyone&#x27;s mind is the possible carcinogens in the stuff.</li>
            <li> I do not see any improvement to my problem so far, using it twice a day for 1 month.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> be careful when you use it that you only put it on the red spots and not all over as I found sometimes my pores get clogged around that area (and therefore more pimples).  </li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for 3 months, as directed, on an age spot that had developed on my face.  </li>
            <li> if you do it right :) its so cheap, so dont waste your money on Proactiv or anything else equally as expensive.</li>
            <li> It now seems to be watered down and less effective...</li>
            <li> but it is now working better than a very expensive product from a famous maker I tried for 3 months and returned (got my money back!!).  </li>
            <li> However, since it contains hydroquinone I thought it could be useful for getting rid of other scars anywhere except my face, and it does.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it did work and didn&#x27;t mess up my super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had one dark spot on the left side of my face, and one that was a much lighter on the right side of my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but it just keeps getting better the longer you use it.</li>
            <li> She is pretty obsessive about using it regularly along with using sunscreen, and I think that may be key.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products that promise to fade the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have one obvious one, and a bunch of light ones, but now they are all dark!  </li>
            <li> After using the cream daily for many months I saw only a very slight fading of the sun spots of my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, using this in conjunction to eliminating wheat products (\\&quot;Wheat Belly\\&quot;) and using the cleansing and care processes found in the \\&quot;Japanese Skin Revolution\\&quot; has given my skin a new life.</li>
            <li> It may be because I&#x27;ve been taking it slowly or mine are just a bit stubborn, but either way, I&#x27;m planning on continuing for the next two months to see if they will fade any more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if your skin is very sensitive, i applied this one and woke up with my skin all red and burn.</li>
            <li> had a scar on my knee in Feb. Got the the product and started using it 3 weeks later and its almost faded completely!</li>
            <li> After looking at reviews on Amazon and other sites, this was the first product I tried.</li>
            <li> Yanno us over 50 crowd needs all the help we can get without major surgery</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it is a permanent solution unless I can keep the pigmentation at bay via a strong, daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> And finally, when the outbreak is clear, you have to have a fade cream to fade away the discoloration of the skin damage.  </li>
            <li> This product also has been confirmed to trigger milia problems for me (milia are small deep clogged pores).  </li>
            <li> I may pull this back out of the closet and give it a try--however this product will get no where near my face ever again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks now - it is recommended to apply the cream twice a day, however, with my busy schedule, I only apply it during the night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> Only given it a 3 because too early to tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li> So far, my pigmentation has come back when I quit using it</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no point of using it to get rid of the old marks if it will just cause new ones to appear.</li>
            <li> After only several weeks of twice daily use...no more sun spots--I mean none.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good as any expensive cream with hydroquinone!</li>
            <li> bottom line is that being a teenager is hard enough without a huge face of pimples.  </li>
            <li> He thought it was new foundation, but I told him I&#x27;m using the same foundation and the only thing I&#x27;m using different is the fade cream.</li>

            <li> the dark spots on my feet look exactly the same as they did before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this might be an acceptable risk for someone with localised, large dark areas on their skin, for my (age) spots</li>
            <li> It smells a little funny but nothing noticable.</li>
            <li> It really helped minimize and fade the dark spots.</li>
            <li> After one and a half months of using this cream twice a day, everyday, my fades went from easy to see, to completly invisible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a less than a third of the way through the first tube and will definitely be buying this product forever.</li>
            <li> , dark spots become lighter quickly withen two weeks, but be careful in using it because it contains 2%hydroquinone, this is danger, search for it in google and try to use the product for short time and stop it gradually</li>
            <li> I like that my freckles seems be be less noticiable, but I do not care much for the scent</li>
            <li> I tried using this religiously for about 3 months straight (since all products take time) and saw no result in fading dark spots/acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li> Only have used it 2 and a half weeks didn&#x27;t really see a difference at all.</li>
            <li> This tube is more than enough to last a few months since only a small amount is needed twice a day.</li>
            <li> I love the cream really works for me , I recommend to my friends also, before I tried a expensive creams that  I saw on tv and just waste my money, until I found Ambi .</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction this severe with any other product I&#x27;ve used on my face.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin needing to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 3 weeks so far, only on the dark patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I had brown spots, red acne scars, red rashes with minor wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say I have seen much of a change in the small sunspots on my hands.</li>
            <li> Well, about a year ago, I got really neglectful with the skin on my face and neck [especially after this rough winter we had] and as a result my face looked blotchy, uneven and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin returned to its normal condition within a few days of stopping use.  </li>
            <li> I soon broke out in redness, and hot bumpy skin, even on the small spot on my arm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black, 29 year old</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, and thank God, I didn&#x27;t break out or have any odd skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually if I apply at least 20 minutes before I leave the house, the creme fades away and you can&#x27;t really see much.</li>
            <li> , once I used it at night when I slept with my blinds up and the sun shining on my face with this stuffgave me a big red patch for 2 days so be careful!</li>
            <li> The main thing is to stick with it, it will take a while to see a difference, but all of a sudden you will notice you are using less and less foundation and even venturing out of the house once in a while without it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured I could use this product to clear the redness, and even a few freckles.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no change after several weeks of using.  </li>
            <li> On some, it takes time and other spot not long at all.</li>
            <li> Not fast acting.</li>
            <li> I just buy this to give another try to a long list of creams in hopes that it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve gone to a lot of god-awful dermatologists--they never work for long no matter what</li>
            <li> I used one whole tube over a few months and had only minimal lightening of freckles and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have never been able to use this product for long, so I can not speak to it&#x27;s ability to fade dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a moderate fading of the brown &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; discolored areas,  not much change in the reddish discoloration.  </li>
            <li> She had freckles and would have darker spots for a long time when her skin would heal after a break-out.</li>
            <li> If your skin is not sensitive this may work well for you - just not for me &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> This product really works but seeing results is slow.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter had an awful break-out on her face, and as parent, it was hard to see such a beautiful girl have a sudden change in her complexion.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it fades the surrounding skin as well (like other reviewers have stated) because I am very fair-skinned.</li>
            <li> Red ruddy complexion, red bumps, and little pimples.  </li>
            <li> Like other 4-5 different ones I tried.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it while trying out some other facial cream products.</li>
            <li> Other than that it has NO effect on age spots, red patches, or melasma (brown patches).</li>
            <li> Received the cream well packaged and earlier than expected!  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skintype:  My skin would fall under combination [my T Zone is greasy/oily while everything else is bone dry,</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHERS THAT DO NOT LIVE UP TO THEIR PROMISE.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this does work, but not on every single age spot I have.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots from popped pimples around my chin area and well as some scratches and slight scars about as dark as a brown crayon, my complection is a bit on the yellow side, and after 3 weeks they&#x27;re almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used for several months with no change in dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots result from overproduction of melanin deep under the skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I have darker skin, I found that fading products just don&#x27;t fade my dark marks enough..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the Clinique dark sport serum and a similar one by loreal.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to work (depending on the usage and dark spot) but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I have used different products to fade some freckles and dark spots on my face and none have worked.  </li>
            <li> About 2 weeks after stopping use, everything was back to dark.</li>
            <li> I used Ambi when I was younger but found it was not useful, but this time it is doing what it advertised.</li>
            <li> and I get dark spots on my upper lip from my oral contraception.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face finally feels and looks like the skin on other &amp;#34;weathered&amp;#34; areas of my body!</li>
            <li> However, my skin became very dry and some of the redness went away.</li>
            <li> My face and neck definitely softened and looks less rough.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the formulation I got from this particular seller was no good???</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for people with dark spots!</li>
            <li> So I would dab lemon juice on the spots every single night, exfoliated every other day or so</li>
            <li> but man does this stuff smell bad :)</li>
            <li> My bad - I should have read up more on Hydroquinone-based fading creams before I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I had never used this product before, but I ordered it after I broke out all over my face for some unknown reason...</li>
            <li> My dark spots of lightened, not completely gone away.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be getting harder to find</li>
            <li> It was roughly the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too difficult to put exactly on the dark spots without getting the cream outside of that area.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an unattractive brown spot on my left cheek for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fast and it&#x27;s not something that will work overnight, which is something we are all hoping for on some level, but it gets the job done if you are persistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For it to work though, you should use a q-tip and be careful not to get any on the skin surrounding the discolored area, because then it will bleach the skin around it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used this product a few years ago and only had minimal problems with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale (like the lightest foundation color sold) white girl.</li>
            <li> I am pale so if I have a scar, it is really obvious.</li>
            <li> you should exfoliate your skin every other day too get rid of dead skin as soon as possible and then use lemon juice to lighten the skin.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I was searching for a fade cream to fade my old acne dark spots left behind.</li>
            <li> Now with three months down it&#x27;s almost completely gone and it&#x27;s hard to even see where to apply the creme.</li>
            <li> The product has a slightly perfume-y, chemical smell, not my favorite, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I found that it does fade all kinds of spots on not just your face but other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years, sunspots have been forming along the upper corners of my forehead.</li>
            <li> Even my husband commented the other day.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well</li>
            <li> I still use it to this day, along other Ambi products.  </li>
            <li> My entire face broke out with small pimples everywhere.</li>
            <li> Apply several times a day, everyday, for months.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for the past 6 months, and it actually does work!</li>
            <li> the the other day and a server asked, &amp;#34;What did you do to your skin?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on other issues.</li>
            <li> I know that the active ingredient I should lool for is hydroquinone...</li>
            <li> Not only did this product not work for me, it actually made my dark spots worse.  </li>
            <li> suggest you give this a try if you are fighting dark spots due to birth control.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer specifies not using it past 3 months, the active ingredient is carcinogenic with long term exposure.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone thats had a hard time finding a product that will actually work.</li>
            <li> Not only has my skin seemed to be getting darker where I applied the cream, but within 3-4 hours of application my skin will break out in something like a rash--it&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> Get surgery if you want to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I have already noticed a fading of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> did not fade dark spots on face</li>
            <li> I noticed after one week of application that the dark spots have lightened.</li>
            <li> It does fade dark spots but my skin does tend to break out after using it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my dark spot (on my chicks)</li>
            <li> only complaint for this is the smell.</li>
            <li> smells weird, and I didnt really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> this cream doesn&#x27;t make me brake out and fades dark spots</li>
            <li> I bought this because a reviewer said that she had seen improvement for her dark circles under her eyes because it worked for her.  </li>
            <li> I still have the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation and dark marks on my face...</li>
            <li> I tried the proactive dark spot corrector (went through 2 tubes and did not notice a difference)..</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about this low-dose, gentle product.  </li>
            <li> It sounds weird to say, but it really has changed my life.</li>
            <li> I still have some dark spots and i know they will be gone by the time i am done using it all.</li>
            <li> There is a trick though, what hydroquinone does is prevents pigmentation from advancing (which causes the dark spots) and thus giving the skin time to heal without the added darkness.</li>
            <li> I had lots of dark sun and hormonal spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a way to remove dark spots, have some patience and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune</li>
            <li> The dark spot is not fading as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dark skin.</li>
            <li> My scars have started to fade from a dark brown tone to medium-light brown.</li>
            <li> After at least a month of applying twice daily, I see no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was looking for a dark spot corrector since I have alot of acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for 3 weeks now and have not noticed any difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I almost got a laser treatment for my dark spots and acne scars...</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s just not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> My face is clearing up nicely of dark spots and even the circles around my eyes</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark spots or age spots.</li>
            <li> It works slowly but one will definitely see the difference in a month.  </li>
            <li> I decided I should try to get rid of these, if possible, since they&#x27;re not very attractive</li>
            <li> and the redness has gone way down.  </li>
            <li> I tried a gazillion other creams, this one WORKS !</li>
            <li> It works slightly for dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> So just because it worked for me in less than two months, doesnt mean that it will be the same for everyone else.</li>
            <li> I used ambi on those spots once a day for about two and half weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Ambi for about a month and a half now, and my brown spots have faded 85%.</li>
            <li> this might seem odd, but I also use it to lighten my nipples, labia, and anus-</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I chose to buy this product instead of Proactiv brand.  </li>
            <li> This faded the brown spots on my hands almost immediately and it has slightly faded the ones on my face.  </li>
            <li> Getting rid of the pimples is not that hard, but it is expensive and you have to have a doctor who will prescribe the  right stuff to go along with the Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell too, not strong as described in other reviews.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in here is very strong and the instructions to apply the cream is very bad.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight change after 2 weeks and every week it gets a little less visable.  </li>
            <li> I had a few dark spots on my face from acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark spots on my forehead for about 6 months now after a few stubborn pimples and a tree limb scar for over a year.</li>
            <li> It was a very dark almost black looking patch of skin.</li>
            <li> Last November, I spent the entire month in Southern California and Hawaii and when I came back, my sunspots were the worst they&#x27;ve ever been</li>
            <li> Nadinola (also 2%hydroquinone) seemed work for while but causes red irritation which turns into even worse dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a very very slight change in my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> After makeup failed to cover the dark spots I decided to take action.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star, which says I hate it, but that‚Äôs a bit too strong.  </li>
            <li> a little bit&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> The smell fades away a little while after you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I pit a little on in the morning and night and the age spots have faded&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dark circles have begun to go away - I can notice the difference!  </li>
            <li> I am Hispanic, and my skin is very dark.</li>
            <li> My whole face itched like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Totally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy product and does have a distict smell.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after applying the cream to a few spots on my face, I can say that this works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to address hyperpigmentations left behind from acne.</li>
            <li> It brought some toxins to the surface I hadn&#x27;t realized were trapped in the skin.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my sister who also has a few spots she would like to see gone.</li>
            <li> I applied this to a few select areas on my face and forearms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in hopes of fading a couple of age spots and a few freckles, both of which it&#x27;s supposed to help.  </li>
            <li> But give it a few months.  </li>
            <li> It also smells of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I waited for five months before I revied this product, because all too often we ‚Äúthink‚Äù we see change in a few days, because we want to.  </li>
            <li> Used it before a few years ago and no issues with the product.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my arms for a few days.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> Cleared up blemishes after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I even feel like my few wrinkles on my forehead have gotten</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really acne/pimples; the bumps are hard, small, and round, with no head and not the usual mounded shape of acne.</li>
            <li> The spots have faded down now to what it usually is after the winter but not more that that.</li>
            <li> However this stuff stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> face isn&#x27;t breaking out with bumps/acne and milia as bad as it was when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> I first started using this product when my acne was bad and my skin tone was being ruin.</li>
            <li> The cream is heavy, leaving my normally oily but radiant skin looking awful - ruddy, dull, and with large pores.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen very much results from the cream, if any, and was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had some serious sun spots on my hands due to having grown up in south Florida and working for hours and hours on boats with no protection.</li>
            <li> Just couldn&#x27;t get past the unpleasant odor long enough to see if it works or not.  </li>
            <li> it made my skin bumpy everywhere I used it, little hard bumps, I think it caused tags too though I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> No more pimples!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> unfortunately, she was left with  areas on her face from where the outbreak had been.  </li>
            <li> The thing was: it cost about thirty bucks for a small tube.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why I am now having problems.</li>
            <li> I put some in small jars to keep in purse, coffee table...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical, miracle cream though.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the ingredient that does the job is questionable from a safety stand point.</li>
            <li> I use it myself, but I get lazy or forget to use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I am 32, very pale with premature agespots that are about 7 shades darker than my skin color.  </li>
            <li> WOW, I AM TRYING ALL FAD CREAMS AND THIS ONE IS AS BAD AS ANY I HAVE TRIED.</li>
            <li> However, having used it for about 1 month at least 3 times a week, I can see a noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I thought it would take at least 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> At least this one didn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used Ambi Skincare at least twice a day, every day, and even on the lighter mark it has done nothing.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and not too terribly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have used for at least a month faithfully morning and night and have not seen any fading of skin spots at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow going though.</li>
            <li> My age spots fades slowly...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still with liver failure and dialysis, but this turned my skin around.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad breakout in December and after the pimples went away red pigmentation stayed.  </li>
            <li> Not surprising I went looking for another</li>
            <li> Either way...this product is not good for me.</li>
            <li> [I don&#x27;t want to throw them out, that&#x27;s my hard earned money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months on a couple of dark spots on the base of my neck that are basically friction burns darkening the skin.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with it.</li>
            <li> After looking around here on Amazon, and being overwhelmed by the choices I decided to try Ambi skin care because I was just tired of looking around and reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, my skin texture got worse as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a beauty secret I swear by now.</li>
            <li> my case, I had terrible purple, red acne marks and even across my upper lip :(</li>
            <li> However, like a few other reviewers, I had a horrible reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> a few years ago I had a particularly bad bout of acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive, and VERY EXPENSIVE products and noticed very little change.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say it&#x27;s been upsetting</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought two tubes of it.</li>
            <li> I am THE skeptical consumer when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> It smells weird.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it has done nothing.  </li>
            <li> Looking in the mirror, it was faint.</li>
            <li> have used before some expensive creams order by Dr. and also buy expensive brand from department stores...</li>
            <li> Non irritating, too.!</li>
            <li> so darn sorry that it didn&#x27;t work because my hands realy need to be the help.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> After the reddness cleared, I had these horrifying very dark brown marks kinda circle shaped.</li>
            <li> The spots are very dramatic in the summer even though I use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it has a bad smell, but not so terrible that I wouldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> This product sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I felt so ugly and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> TriLuma worked well and did not cause the unpleasant side effects of Ambi.  </li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive prescriptions to coca butter to lighten the scares.</li>
            <li> I am very sad about this.</li>
            <li> I mean, HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> And it is impossible to use as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> It broke me out really bad.</li>
            <li> I use that product on the really bad blotchy areas...</li>
            <li> It looked really bad, almost like I wasn&#x27;t even making an effort to take care of my skin</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know how bad it looked.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this Ambi.</li>
            <li> My search continues :(</li>
            <li> Perhaps this helped some but cannot see any improvement after 6 weeks of usage. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago, and I am truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> And after time, it has helped prevent my acne like crazy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I had to buy it in a 2 pack.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well as a makeup base.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get a toner or moisturizer if you do plan this use this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Even with my bad eating habits, I NEVER had milia/acne like this before!  </li>
            <li> I hated having bumps on my face</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Does not work and smells horrible!</li>
            <li> I thought why not couldn&#x27;t get any worst.</li>
            <li> Made me break out horribly in almost cystic-type bumps.</li>
            <li> It smells awful, and does not do anything except break your face out!</li>
            <li> the smell gave me terrible headaches, and I had to stop using before saw any results.</li>
            <li> product was FAKE!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Plus, it smells absolutely awful...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Get surgery if you want to remove dark spots. None of these creams work....</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation and I didn&#x27;t see much improvement to my skin when I used it at all.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to write seven more words</li>
            <li> The best part about this cream is that it works so fast it&#x27;s almost too good to be true. (Rubbing it in works better)</li>
            <li> Just couldn&#x27;t get past the unpleasant odor long enough to see if it works or not.  Totally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It fades the spots in three days and smells great. i use this four days tops and the marks go away!! Works</li>
            <li> Worked well for me, no complaints.</li>
            <li> With patience, this product works very well!</li>
            <li> I use this product of scars after surgery.  It takes some time to work, but if consistently used, it will work.  I like it .</li>
            <li> I was searching for a fade cream to fade my old acne dark spots left behind. I was going to buy a more expensive brand of fade cream that is very popular right now, and I was looking at it here when I saw a review for Ambi. I decided to try this first instead. I am so glad I did! It has been about a month now, and I can definitely see improvement. They are not 100% gone, but I also have not used it religiously every day because I forget. However, having used it for about 1 month at least 3 times a week, I can see a noticeable difference and I am very happy with it. I am not sure if it fades the surrounding skin as well (like other reviewers have stated) because I am very fair-skinned. With a price like this, it is worth a shot! Good luck!</li>
            <li> I can notice a difference, within a week I started to see, once the tubes run out.  Im very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 2 weeks and I have already noticed a fading of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it; works very well to correct irregular skin tones on face, neck, upper chest, hands and arms. It has a somewhat medicinal smell that fades quickly. It will stain clothing, so wear your old T-shirt or else be cautious. Price is good.</li>
            <li> did not fade dark spots on face</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me, as described. I put it on religiously and stay away from the sun as indicated, but I still see the age spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ambi Fade Cream for almost a year now.. I wanted to wait a while so that I can give my honest opinion. Ambi Fade Cream is a great product and it&#x27;s very inexpensive. I strongly recommend you purchase the Ambi Daily Moisturizer because you NEED a moisturizer whenever you use a fading cream. Both products work wonders. The tube isn&#x27;t all that big but it obviously has a lot of product because I&#x27;m just on my second bottle and it&#x27;s been almost a year.</li>
            <li> I have been using ambi cream since I heard about it but it truly does work I get so many compliments on my great skin.... I Love You Ambi!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been applying it to the acne scars on my face. I noticed after one week of application that the dark spots have lightened. I use this product in combination with the Ambi Complexion Cleansing Bar</li>
            <li> This stuff made me 2 shades lighter within 10 days!!! I using it forever!</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no change after several weeks of using.  It is now at the landfill.  I have no idea what any positive reviewers were talking about.</li>
            <li> I found that it does fade all kinds of spots on not just your face but other parts of the body. On some, it takes time and other spot not long at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great value. It does fade dark spots but my skin does tend to break out after using it. It is a heavy product and does have a distict smell. This would not be a good product for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great skin lightener... It goes smoothly on the skin, the scent was a bit strong at first but then it disappears very quickly.. I definitely see that results after 4 weeks.. but then my skin becomes very sensitive to everything after that,</li>
            <li> Used this product for SEVERAL MONTHS on one sun spot that I have on my face and on the numerous sun spots that I have on my arms. I saw NO improvement whatsoever!  This product was actually recommended by my dermatologist, but I saw NO improvement!  Maybe the formulation I got from this particular seller was no good???</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before, but I ordered it after I broke out all over my face for some unknown reason...I never break out! Anyway, after applying the cream to a few spots on my face, I can say that this works. I saw the results after only about two weeks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how people say this works..I am 32, very pale with premature agespots that are about 7 shades darker than my skin color.  I have been using product for over a YEAR! NO results what so ever,,no change in color.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to address hyperpigmentations left behind from acne. After two months of use twice a day with religious sunscreen protection my hyperpigmented spots remain. FYI my skin color matches that of Gabrielle Union. I will say that the product is incredibly moisturizing, goes on as smooth as silk, and made my hands noticeably softer. Just wish it would&#x27;ve faded my discolorations.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  Used for several months with no change in dark spots.  I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a while and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my dark spot (on my chicks) I aply it twice a day (as directed) but NOTHING. The only thing fade is what you pay, that&#x27;s it. I bought it because of an article i read in Allure, but I think I will write them and I will let them know that the product didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Does not work and smells horrible! I mean, HORRIBLE! EW! YUCK!</li>
            <li> My dark spots of lightened, not completely gone away.  Took 3 months.  Have noticed an overall better appearance to my skin.  Definitely reccomend.</li>
            <li> I have developed age spots on my hands. I can not believe how well this product worked even in the first week of use!  I am now in my second week and the spots continue to fade. This product is a winner!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. There seems to be a very mild improvement but not enough to write a great review about.</li>
            <li> I have used a tube of this before, did not work, but reviews of it keep popping up on the internet, so decided to buy again, been 2-3 weeks now and again, no difference, but will use the product up.</li>
            <li> I used this on a darkened acne scar. It lightened it completely after a week or two but the most significant part is that it brought the scar to complete healing. It brought some toxins to the surface I hadn&#x27;t realized were trapped in the skin. After they were removed I continued to used the product for a couple of days and it is now the same color as the rest of my skin. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month. I&#x27;ve had bad acne my whole life. I had deep marks that have been there for years, and scars from squeezing bumps. My skin is also very sensitive. I hated having bumps on my face so I would squeeze them to get everything out of them but because my skin is so sensitive even my finger nail would leave marks. I started seeing results within the first week of me using this product. It works a lot faster if you go by the instructions. Use once in the morning and once before bed. My skin has never been this clear before (besides when I was a baby of course) I would recommend this to anyone thats had a hard time finding a product that will actually work. I&#x27;m a 22 yr old african american woman fyi.</li>
            <li> I am a mildly pale redhead with a bit more than a smattering of freckles. Over the past couple of years, sunspots have been forming along the upper corners of my forehead. They will fade over the winter months (not all the way) but come straight back after a full day in the sun regardless of sunscreen. Last November, I spent the entire month in Southern California and Hawaii and when I came back, my sunspots were the worst they&#x27;ve ever been so I started looking for something to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this for exactly four weeks now, once a day. The spots have faded down now to what it usually is after the winter but not more that that. It may be because I&#x27;ve been taking it slowly or mine are just a bit stubborn, but either way, I&#x27;m planning on continuing for the next two months to see if they will fade any more. I&#x27;ll update if it continues to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint for this is the smell. It&#x27;s gross. I put it on under my night cream though which smells super good so it doesn&#x27;t bother me all that much but man does this stuff smell bad :)</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on your skin type. It broke me out really bad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much change.</li>
            <li> see i know that its works my aunt use it an she is so lite an pretty she use the cream soap over the years an man it works i use it an yes it lovvvvve it so much thank u god iam to tone so i wnt to be one hole color so yeah its works</li>
            <li> My bad - I should have read up more on Hydroquinone-based fading creams before I purchased.  Dark spots result from overproduction of melanin deep under the skin.  Hydroquinone fades spots by inhibiting an enzyme (tyrosinase) related to melanin production.  However, contrary to the Amazon manufacturer product description that states \\&quot;Once your natural skin tone is restored, you can discontinue use of the product\\&quot;, without the use of the cream, tyrosinase is no longer inhibited and over time the spots will return.  Because hydroquinone creams carry a risk of actually causing darkening of the skin, the manufacturers recommend to only use them when needed (i.e. when there are visible spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this might be an acceptable risk for someone with localised, large dark areas on their skin, for my (age) spots I think this risk is too great considering that I will need to continue using the product cyclically for life.  If it was a &#x27;one and done&#x27; thing, I would have used it.</li>
            <li> I love the cream really works for me , I recommend to my friends also, before I tried a expensive creams that  I saw on tv and just waste my money, until I found Ambi .</li>
            <li> smells weird, and I didnt really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> had a scar on my knee in Feb. Got the the product and started using it 3 weeks later and its almost faded completely!</li>
            <li> Good product for even tone lighter normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen very much results from the cream, if any, and was a little disappointed.  I would not try that brand the next time.</li>
            <li> this cream doesn&#x27;t make me brake out and fades dark spots</li>
            <li> works very good. I have to buy more for next year. I friend of my recommended and it really works for me.</li>
            <li> I am currently 57 and have brown sun spots on my face which my dermatologist prescribed a 4% Hydroquinone to lighten, and although Ambi contains only 2% the added Alpha hydroxy acid enhances the results.  In just over a week I have noticed the spots are lighter which I did not see with the product prescribed by my doctor.  Great product at a GREAT  price!</li>
            <li> WOW, I AM TRYING ALL FAD CREAMS AND THIS ONE IS AS BAD AS ANY I HAVE TRIED. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. DO NOT BELEIVE ALL COMSUMER PERIODICALS YOU READ. THIS JUST WENT INTO THE FADE CREAM JUNK BUCKET.</li>
            <li> I used this cream on my face and it broke me out. It will probably work better for spot treatments, but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement there either. You would probably get better results from bio-oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a reviewer said that she had seen improvement for her dark circles under her eyes because it worked for her.  It did not work for me.  I still have the dark circles.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter had an awful break-out on her face, and as parent, it was hard to see such a beautiful girl have a sudden change in her complexion.  She had used, and is still using, Proactiv, but for some reason - it just wasn&#x27;t enough.  We took her to the doctor and she was put on oral hormones and prescribed a topical antibiotic cream to apply to face once a day with no stop date.  The three items combined worked to clear her skin in about 6 weeks.  No more pimples!&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, she was left with  areas on her face from where the outbreak had been.  Light pink in color, they were evidence of the trauma her skin has sustained while under hormonal attack!  We searched the internet and found out that Proactiv had a fade cream to do away with this exact problem.  The thing was: it cost about thirty bucks for a small tube.  I did more research and found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopeful but dubious about the claims, I clung to the positive reviews on this page and ordered  a pack of two for the very reasonable price it was offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than one month later - my daughters skin is clear and perfect again!  The Ambi Skincare Face Cream worked!  She still uses Proactiv, the oral hormones, the topical antibiotic ointment (cleocin) and now this fade cream - but her skin is as it should be - so flawless she doesn&#x27;t have to wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that being a teenager is hard enough without a huge face of pimples.  Getting rid of the pimples is not that hard, but it is expensive and you have to have a doctor who will prescribe the  right stuff to go along with the Proactiv.  And finally, when the outbreak is clear, you have to have a fade cream to fade away the discoloration of the skin damage.  This cream works and I recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it.  It does work.  Take some time but will work.  She has sensitive skin, but this does not bother her one bit.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 8 weeks, on my upper lip as I got a tea stain in the sun.  no noticeable change really, its not offensive smelling though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale (like the lightest foundation color sold) white girl. I have adult acne which leaves brown blotches from wherever I&#x27;ve had breakouts. Needless to say it&#x27;s been upsetting Bc it&#x27;s extremely obvious. This stuff works great at fading them, so much where they now only look like freckles! The blotches have considerably shrunken in size from the outside-in and have paled significantly. I use this product once/maybe twice daily when I remember and I saw results, improvement, in a week. This stuff is well worth the money and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It works very well! However I read some of the ingredients may be very harmful!  Not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Ambi Skincare Fade Cream so far has not worked....however, I haven&#x27;t been using it more than a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using and see.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone is different. I have been looking for a good product to fade dark spots and upper lip line for quite awhile. I ran across this at Target. I purchased this and the Even &amp; Clear concentrate. WOW!!! I&#x27;m not kidding. I went thru acute  liver, kidney and pancreas failure. My skin took a huge hit. The left side was COVERED in blotches with VERY dark circles under eyes and spotted right side and on the top of my hands. Some may call them liver spots. I&#x27;m 57yo..no wrinkles, excellent skin until my 7 month hospital stay. This product..I tell you, within a week of using..KID YOU NOT..my spots on my face have nearly disappeared. My lip line..GONE. The spots sprinkling my hands nearly gone. My skin is SO SOFT!! I have never ever written a review on any product. But this stuff really worked for me! I&#x27;m still with liver failure and dialysis, but this turned my skin around. I just purchased the eye cream too. Can&#x27;t wait to see if will further improve my deep purple circles. For the price..GREAT! I&#x27;m going to buy a truckload just in case it isn&#x27;t around!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell that great.  It doesn&#x27;t work well either.  Go &amp; buy some cocoa butter &amp; put it on.  It&#x27;s cheaper &amp; works a lot better.</li>
            <li> The cream works as advertised.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!!! I used it for almost 2 months and saw no visible results.  It must not be made for brown skin tones. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay over $10 for this.  I was so disappointed in this Ambi. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is meant to do!</li>
            <li> it really clears up my skin been using since i was a teenager</li>
            <li> i bought this product because a lot of people were saying that it was relly good, well this product didnt work for me, i used it for two weeks and didnt get any good results, after two weeks i stopped using it because my face got even worse, my face got irritate, i do not recommend it because it didnt work for me, i dont know if it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots from popped pimples around my chin area and well as some scratches and slight scars about as dark as a brown crayon, my complection is a bit on the yellow side, and after 3 weeks they&#x27;re almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make it a part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth and you&#x27;ll see the condition of your skin improve drastically. This works about as well as cocoa, but didn&#x27;t make my skin break out after using on my face.</li>
            <li> This product does amazing job in fading my pigmentation, dark spots become lighter quickly withen two weeks, but be careful in using it because it contains 2%hydroquinone, this is danger, search for it in google and try to use the product for short time and stop it gradually</li>
            <li> Only have used it 2 and a half weeks didn&#x27;t really see a difference at all. Maybe I&#x27;ll keep trying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my third week of using this wonderful product, and I see so much improvement. My brown spots are disappearing. Thank you AMBI people......</li>
            <li> Used this product but it has not worked on my sun spots. I am not happy at all with it. Unfortunately I bought two tubes of it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t rate the overall effectiveness of this fade cream, because I break out everywhere I use it. I find my face gets incredibly oily and will develop a pimple within a few hours after application. My search continues :(</li>
            <li> This is quite a nice and effective cream, especially for the price.  I have fair skin and started getting little brown spots on my face, especially around my eyebrows, and the tops of my hands several years ago.  This cream fades the spots completely over about a 3-4 month period if used consistently.  It also refines my skin to a nice texture and am considering using it as a day and night cream on my whole face because of its texture-refining ability.  It seems to be getting harder to find so I was happy to find it here.  I recommend it and intend to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times, however, this time it does not seem to be working as well. I get acne marks and usually this product works great to eliminate them, however, it is not working as well this time. I will keep using it though and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I am pale so if I have a scar, it is really obvious. I just use this to dot over my scar and keep my scar moist and I notice fading in a week or so. I would say try not to get it on skin you do not want to lighten, because it will lighten quite a bit. None the less, I suggested this to a couple of people and they love it and find that it works well for them.</li>
            <li> was a gift for someone. works well.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a great product!! I have hyperpigmentation and dark marks on my face... Since I have darker skin, I found that fading products just don&#x27;t fade my dark marks enough.. I tried the proactive dark spot corrector (went through 2 tubes and did not notice a difference).. I&#x27;ve also used the Clinique dark sport serum and a similar one by loreal. I know that the active ingredient I should lool for is hydroquinone...(2%) is OTC amount.&lt;br /&gt;This one works great... Have been using it for 2 months and have noticed a difference! And great value for money!!!</li>
            <li> First Review:  5/20/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skintype:  My skin would fall under combination [my T Zone is greasy/oily while everything else is bone dry, lol].  I&#x27;m a black, 29 year old female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using Ambi about two years ago and it worked REALLY well for me with no issues [no discoloration, no irritation, no breakouts...].  Well, about a year ago, I got really neglectful with the skin on my face and neck [especially after this rough winter we had] and as a result my face looked blotchy, uneven and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Ambi used to work for me, I decided to try it out again so I brought this along with the Ambi exfoliating wash and foaming cleanser.  I would alternate between the Ambi Exfoliating Wash and the Ambi Foaming Cleanser, but would always use the Ambi Skincare Fade Cream morning and night.  Also, I got the Ambi Even and Clear Tone Correcting Concentrate.  I use that product on the really bad blotchy areas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:  I did see a difference in my skin.  My face and neck definitely softened and looks less rough.  Some blotchy areas have faded [not that much] but hey, it&#x27;s only been two weeks lol...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  Milia &amp; bumps!  I got milia around my mouth, nose and on my cheeks as well as some bumps/acne on the right side of my face!  Even with my bad eating habits, I NEVER had milia/acne like this before!  I would get the usually menstrual period pimple [lol] but NEVER have I had a breakout like this in my 29 years of life lol.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup and I haven&#x27;t eaten anything new [allergic reaction] so it has to be the Ambi products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Plan:  I&#x27;m gonna continue using this and give it a fair chance.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks so I&#x27;m gonna wait it out and continue using the products [I don&#x27;t want to throw them out, that&#x27;s my hard earned money! lol].  I&#x27;m also gonna increase my water intake and make sure my pillow cases are clean every night to make sure nothing else is irritating my face.  Second reviewcoming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Review - 6/8/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since my last review so here&#x27;s the update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face isn&#x27;t breaking out with bumps/acne and milia as bad as it was when I first started using it.  My skin feels soft to the touch whenever I apply the fade cream.  The texture of my skin is still a bit rough, but its WAY better than it was before I started using Ambi again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan:  Continue to increase my water intake, clean up my diet and continue using Ambi morning and night on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to work (depending on the usage and dark spot) but it definitely works. Buy it in a pack of two. Its cheaper if you plan on buying more then one.</li>
            <li> The cream is really working to lighten up my spots. I was told it was a good product, and I am a believer.</li>
            <li> And I fade scars quickly --but this stuff does not work...at all..I used an entire tube..its a  gentle moisturizer and nothing beyond that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for several weeks now, and while my dark spot is not gone yet-it is significantly lighter! I feel confident that it will fade soon. The two tubes it came with is nice, but is way too much. I gave one to my sister who also has a few spots she would like to see gone. All in all, good product and you get a ton for your money.</li>
            <li> I applied this cream as directed and it t did not work for me. I will not purchase it again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Decent price at the time of purchase. This cream was a bit moisturizing so I was pretty satisfied. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> FInally something that works on my over-darkened armpits! It started to show effect after 3 weeks of treatment. I tried a gazillion other creams, this one WORKS ! Just make sure you apply enough product on the skin, and care to not have it rubbed off by clothes.</li>
            <li> I have severe scaring from under my chin from ingrown hairs. I have tried very expensive prescriptions to coca butter to lighten the scares. Nothing seem to work. I saw the reviews for this product. I thought why not couldn&#x27;t get any worst. I was blown away with the results after a couple of weeks! The scares are almost gone after a month using it twice a day. It spread very easily and had a great smell to it. Doesn&#x27;t smell medicated at all. If you are expecting instant results this product isnt that. But over time you see great results. Has a great price with a bonus tube. I would suggest give it a try if nothing work for you too.</li>
            <li> Despite the many awesome reviews this product received both on Amazon &amp; various other websites (I do my research before ordering any product) this is not for me. Even used in a super tiny dose this is very greasy. Made me break out horribly in almost cystic-type bumps. I tried using this religiously for about 3 months straight (since all products take time) and saw no result in fading dark spots/acne scars on my face. I stopped using because it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakouts I was getting from it. If I was trying to fade a scar elsewhere on my body I may pull this back out of the closet and give it a try--however this product will get no where near my face ever again. I&#x27;ll pay more next time for a better quality product that will actually show results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this cream based on the majority of reviews.  However, like a few other reviewers, I had a horrible reaction to it.  Red ruddy complexion, red bumps, and little pimples.  My whole face itched like crazy.  So glad I didn&#x27;t drop a lot of $ on it or I&#x27;d be looking for a way to return it.  Not everything works for everybody, and this definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.  My skin is sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction this severe with any other product I&#x27;ve used on my face. I don&#x27;t blame the product, sometimes that&#x27;s just how the cookie crumbles.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is working, but it has a nice texture.  can&#x27;t hurt to try</li>
            <li> I am THE skeptical consumer when it comes to beauty products. I think $60 face creams are a rip off, and anything that promises huge results has to be a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got melasma after using hormonal birth control. I saw a dermatologist and went to a fancy skin clinic - both told me I&#x27;d need a series of facials and chemical peels to deal with the problem, at a cost of $2500+! Not surprising I went looking for another option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a number of reviews for similar products on here, and liked the ones for Ambi so I ordered it. Figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I was only out $12. It WORKS WONDERS. I really did see my melasma fade significantly after just a few uses. The only downside is it has a bad smell, but not so terrible that I wouldn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin really does look better than it has in years. Highly recommend Ambi!</li>
            <li> This product helped me out tremendously. I had a few dark spots on my face from acne. I used ambi on those spots once a day for about two and half weeks and I noticed a great difference. It really helped minimize and fade the dark spots. It works really fast as well. Definitely recommend for people with dark spots!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Was a wonderful price and it arrived early.</li>
            <li> This is really working for me. It doesn&#x27;t take discoloration away completely but definitely fades significantly.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, and lightens my dark spots</li>
            <li> I applied this to a few select areas on my face and forearms. I soon broke out in redness, and hot bumpy skin, even on the small spot on my arm! I continued to use the Ambi because I didn&#x27;t make the connection for about a week. I stopped using it and my skin cleared up in a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it fades, but my skin did not like it.</li>
            <li> I have used different products to fade some freckles and dark spots on my face and none have worked.  This works.  I have been using it for about a month. Even my husband commented the other day. He thought it was new foundation, but I told him I&#x27;m using the same foundation and the only thing I&#x27;m using different is the fade cream. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Ambi Sikncare fade cream.</li>
            <li> Not too strong but smell a little funny.  They really works.  see results in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Best fade skin cream  , better than Proactive  starting in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have some brown spots on the side of my neck and face from tanning too frequently (I haven&#x27;t gone for a couple of years, but for two years I would go 5 times a week for 15 minutes). I decided I should try to get rid of these, if possible, since they&#x27;re not very attractive and I was getting increasingly self conscious about it. After looking at reviews on Amazon and other sites, this was the first product I tried. It works great! I haven&#x27;t been able to use it exactly as directed-- twice a day, every day-- and have still seen great results. My fianc√© is really impressed, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Ambi for about a month and a half now, and my brown spots have faded 85%. I&#x27;m a less than a third of the way through the first tube and will definitely be buying this product forever.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference since using this cream. Like other 4-5 different ones I tried. I do not recommend. The only one that worked for me was the Shiseido brightening treatment.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of high-strength prescription fade creams (like Triluma), and had to give them up because they make my face burn and peel.  So I was skeptical about this low-dose, gentle product.  But my God, it actually works!  It has significantly faded my melasma, and all but disappeared one of my sun spots.  And it has helped clear up my chronic adult acne, to boot!  I&#x27;m not generally a burbly enthusiastic reviewer but really----this stuff works.  I used it twice a day, and it took about a month to start seeing results.  Dirt cheap, effective, gentle.</li>
            <li> Yanno us over 50 crowd needs all the help we can get without major surgery, right!?!?  Grab this product.  Its affordable and works wonders on all age spots .. even moles!  oh yeahhhhhhhh.  Im ordering them every two monthis.  Get with the program and get rid of them fugly age spots!</li>
            <li> I like this: recommended by doctor for the 2% of its main ingredient. Its better than the generic fade cream</li>
            <li> I had a waxing mishap &amp; my underarms got peeled skin. After the reddness cleared, I had these horrifying very dark brown marks kinda circle shaped. I bought this in hopes of getting that skin lighter and i have seen improvement in 3 uses 1 week period. In addition I clean my underarm skin with a gentle scrub to help exfoiliate the darker skin. I have also used it on some scars and it has lighted it a bit. I think if I keep using for extended time, I will get the results I want. I like the smell too, not strong as described in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Ambi about 3 weeks, so haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet.  I&#x27;m still hopeful.  I&#x27;m using it in hopes of fading a couple of age spots and a few freckles, both of which it&#x27;s supposed to help.  We&#x27;ll see.....If it really does work after 2-3 months, I&#x27;ll give it a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK...Here&#x27;s an update after using Ambi for about 3 months or so.  It&#x27;s finally beginning to work.  I&#x27;m noticing some definite fading of age spots that I&#x27;ve had for several years.  I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to do anything but it is now working better than a very expensive product from a famous maker I tried for 3 months and returned (got my money back!!).  I&#x27;m no spring chick and didn&#x27;t really think it would work but heck, for the price, I wasn&#x27;t going to lose much.  I&#x27;m very pleased to note it has noticeably faded two large age spots on my face and is gradually lightening the undereye area.  Soooo...my advice is: keep at it.  Apply it faithfully morning and night, pat it in and, I hope, it will work for you, too.  But give it a few months.  This is no instant fix.</li>
            <li> Product starting working within days! I thought it would take at least 1-2 weeks. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month of using. I highly recommend this product if you are considering a purchase, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because the majority of the reviews were favorable, but because of it&#x27;s low price I had little faith that it would actually be very effective. I had some serious sun spots on my hands due to having grown up in south Florida and working for hours and hours on boats with no protection. At the age of 45, I had the hands of a 75 year old! Note the past tense--this stuff really really works! After only several weeks of twice daily use...no more sun spots--I mean none. My hands are smooth, soft and blemish-free. Fantastic product, in my opinion. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have only used it for about a week but it works wonders! I have always had red blemishes on my face and they are quite a bit lighter. I feel like I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup and I have way more confidence! I also used it on a scar that I have on my arm and it has faded so much after only a few uses. I have tried everything to get rid of acne and scars but nothing has seemed to work. This product however is a girl&#x27;s best friend! It sounds weird to say, but it really has changed my life. With being more confident I want to take pictures and go swimming and know that my skin will finally look beautiful!</li>
            <li> This product really works but seeing results is slow. I still have some dark spots and i know they will be gone by the time i am done using it all.</li>
            <li> I like that my freckles seems be be less noticiable, but I do not care much for the scent, it&#x27;s a bit offensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark spots on my forehead for about 6 months now after a few stubborn pimples and a tree limb scar for over a year. I&#x27;ve tried Nadinola, Menderma, Xtreme Brite Gel, High Time Tone Repair, all to no avail. I went to Wal-Mart and got this for $4.97 and used it by way of spot treatment with a Qtip and began to see results within 4 days. This is a good quality hydroquinone that does not irritate my skin. Nadinola (also 2%hydroquinone) seemed work for while but causes red irritation which turns into even worse dark spots. Xtreme Brite and Menderma do not contain hydroquinone and did not cause irritation but seem to have a darkening effect on the face as well. I am able to use Ambi concentrated on each spot twice a day without irritation now for 10 days. I am seeing great results with no negative effects as of yet. I am usually able to tell if there is irritation with 2-3 days. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin needing to remove dark spots. Best product I&#x27;ve used in about 3 years of dealing with face pimples / scars on and off.</li>
            <li> Can not see any difference at all! Perhaps this helped some but cannot see any improvement after 6 weeks of usage. :(</li>
            <li> After using the cream daily for many months I saw only a very slight fading of the sun spots of my face. Many of the other reviewers used the product for a very brief time before chiming in with their criticism, but I really did give it a lengthy trial. I stopped using it while trying out some other facial cream products. I do intend to try again, using it night and day to see if there is any additional improvement. Given the wide variety of skin types, exposure conditions and tolerance for chemicals and additives, I&#x27;m sure there is no product that is universally successful, which would explain the wide range of ratings for this product. But, even though the price is modest, I bought it, and I will continue to use it in the hope that there is a cumulative effect.</li>
            <li> I trusted Ambi products. I use the Daily Moisturizer and absolutely love it, so I thought I would give the Fade Cream a try to help with some old Acne scars. I used it for two days and my face broke out in a red, itchy rash. My face looks like sandpaper everywhere I applied this cream. Now I&#x27;m sitting with Calamine lotion on my face to stop the itching. It also smells of harsh chemicals. I definitely do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have fair ivory skin that is drawn up with a bunch of freckles. When it&#x27;s hot I tend to sweat off my foundation and a good amount of redness can be seen on my face. I figured I could use this product to clear the redness, and even a few freckles. However, my skin became very dry and some of the redness went away. My freckles have stayed the same.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work at all since I didn&#x27;t monitor or take before and after pictures. Some of the redness has gone away, so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my wife and she uses it regularly and it actually works..  I even started using it on a little bit&lt;br /&gt;of bags under my eyes and it really worked..</li>
            <li> There are much more expensive products out there, but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one. You can start to see the results in days. I have two blemishes on my face that have been bugging me, and even after applying this daily for a week, I began to see them fade.</li>
            <li> This works for a fraction of the price of the prescription kind. It does take longer (it took about 2.5 months to fade my spots as light as I wanted) but now even when I skip a week my spots still are lighter.) I&#x27;ve purchased this for family as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good as any expensive cream with hydroquinone! There is a trick though, what hydroquinone does is prevents pigmentation from advancing (which causes the dark spots) and thus giving the skin time to heal without the added darkness. Its not going to help lighten the area so your skin will take time to heal on its own. T get the full benefit from this you should exfoliate your skin every other day too get rid of dead skin as soon as possible and then use lemon juice to lighten the skin.&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I had terrible purple, red acne marks and even across my upper lip :( I had a red mustache. So I would dab lemon juice on the spots every single night, exfoliated every other day or so an I used this fade cream on the spots when the lemon juice dries. It probably took three months before my skin was clear again, with the exception of new acne spots around my period time. You have to use it right if you want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Also, once I used it at night when I slept with my blinds up and the sun shining on my face with this stuffgave me a big red patch for 2 days so be careful! Dont use it if your gonna be in the sun at all!&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, its a great price and works aeesome if you do it right :) its so cheap, so dont waste your money on Proactiv or anything else equally as expensive. This stuff does work I promise!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff after reading the positive reviews. And, I am pleased to say that it worked for me as well.  It does have a kind of strong smell, but I got used to it over time. The smell fades away a little while after you apply it.  I had lots of dark sun and hormonal spots on my face.  Some of them had been there for many years.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it did.  It removed almost all of the spots on my face.  And, it substantially lightened the ones that it didn&#x27;t completely remove.  I use it morning and night.  I have no problem applying make up over top of it. As many other reviewers mentioned...you do have to be patient and use it for quite awhile before you see results.  I was about to give up on it, but I figured I keep using it until the tube was gone.  After about two months I started to see some changes.  It&#x27;s subtle, but it just keeps getting better the longer you use it. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to remove dark spots, have some patience and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot if different fade creams, and like the others, this one doesn&#x27;t work either. At least this one didn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month on my arm. The dark spot is not fading as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love!!!! This product. It work so well on my skin and I&#x27;m dark skin. I had a sexy nice smooth stomach because I had my son. I&#x27;m still trying to get my stomach back. I know it won&#x27;t be first but it way!!!!! Better now. My baby was 9pounds 6oz...and I as 120 before pregancy...So just imagine how much my stomach stretch.  I use to cry every time I look at it but now I have hope. This works great!  It&#x27;s a must buy. I&#x27;m buying it again.</li>
            <li> it made my skin bumpy everywhere I used it, little hard bumps, I think it caused tags too though I&#x27;m not sure. It smells weird. It doesn&#x27;t work well as a makeup base. The damage it caused is noticeable. I do not recommend this product which I bought because I was encouraged  by the great reviews I saw here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks now - it is recommended to apply the cream twice a day, however, with my busy schedule, I only apply it during the night before going to bed.  My scars have started to fade from a dark brown tone to medium-light brown.</li>
            <li> I waited for five months before I revied this product, because all too often we ‚Äúthink‚Äù we see change in a few days, because we want to.  I have been using Ambi Skincare Fade Cream religiously for 5 months now and unfortunately it has done nothing.  I had one dark spot on the left side of my face, and one that was a much lighter on the right side of my face.  I have used Ambi Skincare at least twice a day, every day, and even on the lighter mark it has done nothing.  Maybe under a microscope some change may be visible, but not to the naked eye.  At this rate it would take years of use, twice a day, and MAYBE you may be able to notice some slight change. Maybe!  I gave it one star, which says I hate it, but that‚Äôs a bit too strong.  It just doesn‚Äôt work.  I will continue to use it until the tube is finished, and will evaluate it again, but I would definitely recommended looking into another product.  Or see a dermatologist if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have health insurance that covers such things.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I bought it 4 times and used it daily for 1 year but I saw no results at all.</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic, and my skin is very dark. a few years ago I had a particularly bad bout of acne. On my cheek there was something left that had never happened before. It was a very dark almost black looking patch of skin. It was roughly the size of a quarter. Looking in the mirror, it was faint. It wasn&#x27;t until I saw a photo of myself taken from the side years later that I really saw what it looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was a bit horrified. It looked really bad, almost like I wasn&#x27;t even making an effort to take care of my skin and it was that way for years and I didn&#x27;t know how bad it looked. So after searching the web I found out that it was hyper pigmentation. After looking around here on Amazon, and being overwhelmed by the choices I decided to try Ambi skin care because I was just tired of looking around and reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two bottles arrived and honestly it&#x27;s too much product, but I guess it&#x27;s good to have more than not enough. So bottom line, the stuff worked. It&#x27;s slow going though. Also, the first couple of weeks I kept forgetting to either put it on at night or in the morning, so I wasn&#x27;t using it regularly like I should have. but eventually I got into the routine, apply when I got up, and again at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at about the one month mark, I was about to give up, I couldn&#x27;t really see a difference. one more month, and finally I could tell it was fading. Now with three months down it&#x27;s almost completely gone and it&#x27;s hard to even see where to apply the creme. I&#x27;m going to use for about 5-7 more days and then call it. The product has a slightly perfume-y, chemical smell, not my favorite, but nothing too bad. Usually if I apply at least 20 minutes before I leave the house, the creme fades away and you can&#x27;t really see much. So I&#x27;m happy that this black splotch that I had for years is finally gone, the product worked but it can take a very long time, so be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see someone using the product for only 3 or 4 weeks and claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work so that is something to be aware of, you aren&#x27;t going to use this and see results in a week.for only 3 or 4 weeks and claiming that it doesn&#x27;t work so that is something to be aware of, you aren&#x27;t going to use this and see results in a week.</li>
            <li> Havent noticed a change quickly. Not fast acting.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. After at least a month of applying twice daily, I see no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I think an applicator should come with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is too difficult to put exactly on the dark spots without getting the cream outside of that area.</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully 2xs a day for several weeks and I can&#x27;t say I have seen much of a change in the small sunspots on my hands.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. I have tons of acne scars on my face and this product simply fades them away. Not after one application, of course, but after about a week of continuous use the scars have faded and my complexion is a little more uniform. I use this product at night, and I apply it evenly over my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and thank God, I didn&#x27;t break out or have any odd skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this gem at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is its smell, it did not work for me and I even used it twice daily for months. I am of brown/caramel skin color and did not see not even the slightest change.</li>
            <li> The cream quickly irritated my skin and had to stop using it.  Used it before a few years ago and no issues with the product.  Wondering what is different now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, won&#x27;t be using the product again.</li>
            <li> The product does as it says, my skin has whitened from the use of it and many of the blemishes I had on my face have faded away.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I was looking for a dark spot corrector since I have alot of acne. I didnt want to spend alot of money on an cream so this item was perfect. It works extremely well and I noticed a difference after one week of use. It smells a little funny but nothing noticable. This tube is more than enough to last a few months since only a small amount is needed twice a day. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cream to correct dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ambi for more than 4 years, even before it came to commercial.  I asked a Walgreens Cosmetics employee what would be the best fade cream for me (since all the other ones that I have tried, did not work), and she recommended Ambi.  After one and a half months of using this cream twice a day, everyday, my fades went from easy to see, to completly invisible.  I still use it to this day, along other Ambi products.  Results maybe different from everyone else. So just because it worked for me in less than two months, doesnt mean that it will be the same for everyone else. Results will vary.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago, and I am truly disappointed. My entire face broke out with small pimples everywhere. I felt so ugly and uncomfortable. It smells awful, and does not do anything except break your face out!</li>
            <li> Really happy with the results! I Have searched and searched for this product and way pleased to find it. I received it very fast!!</li>
            <li> I ended up not liking the smell. That put me off pretty quickly. I used it on my arms for a few days. While the texture of my skin improved, I did not like the way I felt while using it. My arms were tingling and something just felt off. I will look for something without the Hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because the reviews were so good. I have been using it twice a day for 3 weeks now and have not noticed any difference in my dark spots. I am very sad about this. I also don&#x27;t like how it smells. I would totally deal with the smell if it worked, but since I am not seeing results it is just insult to injury. I am sure this product does work for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li> This product does work. Of course it takes a couple of days to see the differences other than that i love it. My face is clear and i dont have anymore pimple marks</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve tried the expensive, and VERY EXPENSIVE products and noticed very little change.  With Ambi Skincare Fade Cream my age spots are fading beautifully and barely noticeable.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Works just like they said it would on skin pigments. Doesn&#x27;t do much for scar discolorations, but great on age spots etc.</li>
            <li> Great price for a product that works on my skin. Spots on my face have faded within two weeks easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also this might seem odd, but I also use it to lighten my nipples, labia, and anus- it works great. Only thing that has given me results quickly.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product. I suggest you test this for a couple of days before you use it on larger areas. I had a reaction to it and broke out in a raised itchy rash on my face. I had used this product a few years ago and only had minimal problems with it so I&#x27;m not sure why I am now having problems. Also as the description states this is a two item purchase. I am now having to throw away a practically new tube and one that hasn&#x27;t been opened. You might like to just purchase one tube to try it out. Good Luck, I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> I just buy this to give another try to a long list of creams in hopes that it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I have used before some expensive creams order by Dr. and also buy expensive brand from department stores... i also buy from superstores....I almost got a laser treatment for my dark spots and acne scars...then&lt;br /&gt;and i got this as just another try before pay for treatment (because i have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;It did work!! i been using 2 weeks and i can see the difference on my face, i do not have to use tons of make up to cover my spots.. I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> an okay pleasant cream, does nothing special for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;packaging and pricing are good enough though.&lt;br /&gt;Greetz from Marja</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I chose to buy this product instead of Proactiv brand.  My daughter and I both like the feel of this product on the skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly. My daughter&#x27;s skin is sensitive and this product is gentle but does a good job of lightening dark spots.  I am pleased with this product and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This product gave me MORE acne, and I bought it to try and get rid of dark marks caused by acne. There&#x27;s really no point of using it to get rid of the old marks if it will just cause new ones to appear. However, since it contains hydroquinone I thought it could be useful for getting rid of other scars anywhere except my face, and it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45, fair and was prone to acne, dry patchiness, and rosacea. I had brown spots, red acne scars, red rashes with minor wrinkles.  The over all evenness of my skin has improved by 40%.I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve gone to a lot of god-awful dermatologists--they never work for long no matter what my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, using this in conjunction to eliminating wheat products (\\&quot;Wheat Belly\\&quot;) and using the cleansing and care processes found in the \\&quot;Japanese Skin Revolution\\&quot; has given my skin a new life. It&#x27;s glowy and you would never guess I&#x27;m 45. ...try it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, please try reading the 2 books mentioned. They are life changers. I&#x27;m mostly anti-beauty industry and anti-food industry and these books helped resolve a lot of minor but nagging health issues that I have had for many decades.</li>
            <li> I use this product on many areas of my body. Its faded sun spots, lightened scars &amp; made them more supple. One thing though~ it doesn&#x27;t work overnight. You MUST commit to it. Apply several times a day, everyday, for months.! I put some in small jars to keep in purse, coffee table...all over. So if I see it~ I apply it.! It WILL WORK if u are committed to it. Non irritating, too.! Good stuff man. Great price.!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It&#x27;s not a magical, miracle cream though.  But it&#x27;s softening and smells ok.  I still have brown patches.</li>
            <li> organicbeautyvixen.com/2010/11/breaking-down-ingredients-beware-of-hydroquinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended this to me for an age spot, so I bought it. Then I did some research on hyrdoquinone and immediately threw it away. Sometimes it&#x27;s just not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Used it for one week... the smell gave me terrible headaches, and I had to stop using before saw any results.</li>
            <li> I used one whole tube over a few months and had only minimal lightening of freckles and dark spots. It also has a distinct &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I have had much more luck with professional skin treatments for visible evening of my skintone. I still give it 3 stars because at $8 for two tubes, it works decently as a maintenance product after my treatments to keep the spots from returning, especially in the summer when I have more sun exposure.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that works and cost very little!  Within 2 weeks dark spots fade significantly.  It is light weight and not too terribly greasy.  In the summer, I just put it on more lightly in the T zone to avoid oiliness.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed until the product was gone. The first week I noticed a difference. My freckles were getting lighter. The second week I didn&#x27;t notice any further improvements. About 2 weeks after stopping use, everything was back to dark. Waste of time. Roc products are doing a much better job!</li>
            <li> I have used it about 3 weeks so far, only on the dark patches on my cheeks. I am in my 40s and I noticed I had sun spots I guess, mostly on the left side, probably from driving my car. I used it on basically my cheek bone area and it did work. It minimized the spots enough that people actually commented that I looked good, or ask what makeup I was using, etc. So I noticed a definite uptick in nice compliments probably because it smoothed out the spots on my skin. However this stuff stinks to high heaven. Really this stuff is foul, like perfumy, flowery and nearly headache inducing, I finally got used to the scent, but I don&#x27;t know if it would buy it again. I did not buy it on Amazon, I bought it because my local store had it on sale for $3.99 for some reason. I don&#x27;t know if I would spend much more because of the scent of it. Otherwise it did work and didn&#x27;t mess up my super sensitive skin (most products cause either burning, redness or breakouts, this did not do that for me, so that was a nice surprise)</li>
            <li> I used Ambi when I was younger but found it was not useful, but this time it is doing what it advertised. My face is clearing up nicely of dark spots and even the circles around my eyes are lighter after using it for 30 days. From now on I&#x27;ll buy it from a retail store in my neighborhood though because I found it at a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.A.F.</li>
            <li> I am Indian and the cream did not work at all. I tried it twice a day on body and did not work after 3 weeks. I also put it on my face and it made me break out severally Its too oily for the face.&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> This cream use to really work years ago to remove blemishes and make the skin softer until they changed the product...It now seems to be watered down and less effective...</li>
            <li> For the price this product is great! I pit a little on in the morning and night and the age spots have faded&lt;br /&gt;  One is close to gone. You can&#x27;t even see it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for months.  There is a definite improvement in the size and color of age spots - such a relief.  But now those areas seem to have stopped improving.  I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s because the summer sun just reverses any additional lightening of the pigment.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see if improvement continues as we get into fall and winter.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this does work, but not on every single age spot I have. I&#x27;m going to keep on using it and hope that eventually I&#x27;ll win the battle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months on a couple of dark spots on the base of my neck that are basically friction burns darkening the skin. Not only has my skin seemed to be getting darker where I applied the cream, but within 3-4 hours of application my skin will break out in something like a rash--it&#x27;s hard to explain. It&#x27;s not really acne/pimples; the bumps are hard, small, and round, with no head and not the usual mounded shape of acne. I can only really call it a rash. Either way...this product is not good for me. I&#x27;m going to try natural shea butter instead and hope that works.</li>
            <li> product was FAKE!!!!!  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Today marks 2 months of using this product EVERY day and more days than not I remembered to use it twice a day and I saw NO improvement the dark spots on my feet look exactly the same as they did before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I have moderate melasma, but I&#x27;ve never been able to use this product for more than a week.  The cream is heavy, leaving my normally oily but radiant skin looking awful - ruddy, dull, and with large pores.  Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  My skin returned to its normal condition within a few days of stopping use.  This product also has been confirmed to trigger milia problems for me (milia are small deep clogged pores).  Unfortunately, I have never been able to use this product for long, so I can not speak to it&#x27;s ability to fade dark spots.  I have used prescription medication TriLuma, and this contains 4% hydroquinone and Tretinoin.  TriLuma worked well and did not cause the unpleasant side effects of Ambi.  Of course, TriLuma costs $80.  Ambi costs about 10% of that.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement. I might need to consult with a professional or use something stronger. I will continue using and now I also use a BB cream which seems to cover somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products that promise to fade the dark spots.  This is the only product that delivers.  It works slowly but one will definitely see the difference in a month.  There are a couple of brown spots on my face that are too stubborn to go away, but I am definitely happy with the overall results.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with acne. I&#x27;ve tried many face washes such as Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear and even Proactive. And even though for proactive did work for a while, after using it for a period of time my acne kept coming back. So I ditched all of those products and decided to use normal facewash to help with my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;My mom found this AMBI Fade Cream at the clearance section at Target &amp; gave it to me to try. I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it. But after using it that night before bed, it was love at first sight! This cream makes you wake up with such soft, beautiful, moisturized skin. I couldn&#x27;t help but touch my face all morning. And after time, it has helped prevent my acne like crazy! And it has also faded my old acne scars away too like the description says.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my face too oily or shiny. It feels and looks well under makeup. I strongly recommend this Fade Cream to anyone who wants a more even skin tone, or who wants to eliminate acne scars. It&#x27;s my miracle cream! I love it!</li>
            <li> Cleared up blemishes after a few weeks. Good product for sensitive skin but even you should always mix with lotion</li>
            <li> I have darm underarm skin and have been using this.  It absolutely works!!! The only con is the scent which is that chemically smell.</li>
            <li> Product did not produce any discernible change in skin color or appearance. No change noticed whatsoever.  Could have invested my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using diff. products for my age spots on my face. Until I found this product here in Amazaon. It was really a miracle, the product works great for me. My age spots fades slowly... hopefully it&#x27;ll be gone totally. Thanks for the products and I still remember that I got these products with a good deal and really fast shipping. Keep it up!</li>
            <li> Not only did this product not work for me, it actually made my dark spots worse.  I have one obvious one, and a bunch of light ones, but now they are all dark!  And, my skin texture got worse as well.  Plus, it smells absolutely awful...like something in a hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair (pun intended), I have rather light skin.  Maybe this product works better on darker skin?</li>
            <li> I have been using this nightly for 4 weeks and have seen kindof a lightening of my spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cream works.  I feel my skin is softer and more even toned.  I am very sensitive to smell and it does have a slightly strange smell but it fades quickly.  Great price through amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if your skin is very sensitive, i applied this one and woke up with my skin all red and burn. The ingredients in here is very strong and the instructions to apply the cream is very bad. Do yourself a favor and get a toner or moisturizer if you do plan this use this piece of crap. AVOID IS AT ALL COST</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked this great since I was u middle school, 16+ years ago!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I&#x27;ve seen noticeable improvement on the age spots on my face and arms.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed for three months and found no results. It may be that sun blacked skin is not what this product is for. Cant recommend it bassed on my use of it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on reviews at amazon and Walgreens. It works slightly for dark under eye circles. Other than that it has NO effect on age spots, red patches, or melasma (brown patches). I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> ok..so Im a person who wears makeup and Ive been breaking out for years. But I wash my face at night and cleanse it with alcohol and put the amibi in the areas where needed and it REALLY works. After seeing all the reviews I wanted to try it myself. I am HIGHLY satisfied. Ive been using it for a month and my black spots have cleared up so much that Im having to start look closely to detect them and apply more ambi to where it vanishes. I can truly say for once my face is actually getting clearer from this product.!!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark spots or age spots. Don&#x27;t waste your money because it doesn&#x27;t work. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This faded the brown spots on my hands almost immediately and it has slightly faded the ones on my face.  I&#x27;ve reordered.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white male and bought this to fade acne scars. This didn&#x27;t do diddly. And it is impossible to use as a spot treatment. PASS</li>
            <li> Great deal, Good product. My wife loves this stuff, she says it works great! It keeps her skin smooth and even</li>
            <li> Good face lotion. Good price. As far as fade cream goes, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I went through two bottles of it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product...so high, I bought two.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  After one tube (faithfully applying each day) there was no visible difference to my sun damaged skin or reduction to my brown spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the product contains parabens...something we women should avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Johnson and Johnson--no sale!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an unattractive brown spot on my left cheek for a few years.  (I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s from the sun coming through the driver&#x27;s side window, burning my skin like an ant under a magnifying glass.  Ladies, turn that sun visor to the left when the sun&#x27;s coming from that direction!)  I hoped prescription-strength retinol would make it fade, but it did nothing at all.  Neither did Strivectin cream.  I&#x27;ve finished the first tube of this 2-pack, and I&#x27;m really impressed!  The effect is gradual, but with patience, I saw a big improvement.  The brown spot has faded dramatically.  I think by the time I finish the second tube, it&#x27;ll be gone.  I&#x27;ll discontinue using the cream at that point, because I don&#x27;t like the fact that there are parabens in there.  But I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it short term again if necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and so far I do see my age spots fading.  I have sensitive skins so many products irritate my skins but so far, this has been great.  I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve used it longer.</li>
            <li> Been using this off and on for years, can never find it in the stores, so I&#x27;m so happy Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money. doesn&#x27;t do much. it&#x27;s really such a shame that this item doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does</li>
            <li> It was misrepresented. My search was for 4% fade cream with hydoquinone in it. This word wasn&#x27;t even on the label. I am still using it and am yet to notice any spots fading. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I noticed a moderate fading of the brown &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; discolored areas,  not much change in the reddish discoloration.  I had hoped that the red areas would have cleared more.  I will probably not reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a couple of days.  Only given it a 3 because too early to tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li> This has made the biggest difference of any pigmentation/ lightening product I have ever tried including the $100 Rx that is double the strength. I use it all over and when used twice a day and makes a huge improvement pretty quickly. The only issue is that the ingredient that does the job is questionable from a safety stand point. So far, my pigmentation has come back when I quit using it but I&#x27;m going to go thru a tube and re-commit to wearing a strong sunscreen everyday and see if that does the trick. Even the packaging says to use one tube and give it a rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great but I&#x27;m not sure it is a permanent solution unless I can keep the pigmentation at bay via a strong, daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My 25-year old daughter uses this twice daily on her face, neck and upper chest area, and she has an absolutely amazing complexion now.  Because she is so very fair, every minor skin discoloration always seemed very noticeable on her skin and would take a long time to disappear.  She had freckles and would have darker spots for a long time when her skin would heal after a break-out. I bought her some of this to try when she was bemoaning her skin issues, and she now has been using it faithfully for over a year (gone through several tubes).  She said it didn&#x27;t appear to do much in the first weeks but after continuous use, anyone can see how very even her skin tone is.  She is pretty obsessive about using it regularly along with using sunscreen, and I think that may be key.  I use it myself, but I get lazy or forget to use it all the time.  I do see some results of fading of dark spots I have on the sides of my face on my upper cheekbones, but I think I would likely have even better results if I used it more faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also has a &amp;#34;cafe au lait&amp;#34; type of birthmark discoloration on one leg that she also uses this on. Those results are less spectacular and I don&#x27;t think it is terribly useful for fading that type of mark.</li>
            <li> I have searched for FOREVER to find something to even out my skin tone. I found this by searching and figured I would try because of the low price. After 15 years of always having to wear some kind of powder or foundation, I now can go out of the house and feel like my skin looks great. This is a beauty secret I swear by now. I even feel like my few wrinkles on my forehead have gotten better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take a while to see the difference, and at first I was worried because I did feel like my skin felt greasy. However I stuck with it and now its a part of my daily skin care routine. The skin on my face finally feels and looks like the skin on other &amp;#34;weathered&amp;#34; areas of my body! I highly recommend using it along with Cetaphil face wash, which is a gentle cleanser. Using both together in the morning and night for about 1 month and I could really see the difference. I started noticing a difference in my wrinkles after about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to everyone looking for better, healthier skin! Its an awesome price too compared to all those pricey lotions and creams that do not work. The main thing is to stick with it, it will take a while to see a difference, but all of a sudden you will notice you are using less and less foundation and even venturing out of the house once in a while without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I sound like a commercial, but I really really really believe in this product! Its great and has really changed my life and the way I feel about my skin!!! BUY IT! :)</li>
            <li> It does not work....I&#x27;ve used 1 full tube and have another and will use it, but so far nothing has changed....How do I know this?  Because I took a picture of my hands when I first started and there&#x27;s nothing different,,,,,,,,I&#x27;m so darn sorry that it didn&#x27;t work because my hands realy need to be the help.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my skin but I wish it didn&#x27;t contain some of the strong chemicals. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for the past 6 months, and it actually does work! It&#x27;s not fast and it&#x27;s not something that will work overnight, which is something we are all hoping for on some level, but it gets the job done if you are persistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that if you put some on and leave it on for around an hour without rubbing it in, you can get some pretty quick results! there is a limit to it, but it is defiantly better than waiting months for it to work. If you do this a couple days in a row, it will be 100 times better, so it&#x27;s worth trying out. For it to work though, you should use a q-tip and be careful not to get any on the skin surrounding the discolored area, because then it will bleach the skin around it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real downside that seems to be on everyone&#x27;s mind is the possible carcinogens in the stuff. It hasn&#x27;t been definitively proven, but i would suggest using it sparingly, just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for two months, but don&#x27;t see any obvious improvement.</li>
            <li> smells funny and did nothing for me</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now and I have noticed a very very slight change in my dark spots.  Bought it because of a recommendation on this site.  Going to have to try something else.</li>
            <li> Great Product for getting rid darkness on elbows and knees.  But you have to you twice a day for six weeks to see results!</li>
            <li> This is good for a hand/face cream only. But does it remove spots? Unfortunately for me, it did not work at all. My suggestions is don&#x27;t waster your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have very sensitive skin. I also have rosacea on my cheeks. First I used this under my eyes and although I saw results I could not ignore the dryness. If your skin is not sensitive this may work well for you - just not for me &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in color in the age spots on my face, though I had hoped they would have faded a bit more than they actually have.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a month (maximum the box says to use it), but didn&#x27;t see results on my sun spot.  Disappointed that I had to buy it in a 2 pack.</li>
            <li> Received the cream well packaged and earlier than expected!  The dark circles have begun to go away - I can notice the difference!  It was a Great buy as well!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Good product&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and will recommend</li>
            <li> fast arrival, expiration date not for another year and change :) good purchase, will definitely order my needs repeatedly from here</li>
            <li> Nice tube, smells good, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when my acne was bad and my skin tone was being ruin. My mom let me use her fade cream and then i just kept using it and saw a hug difference. Im buying a new order now because my acne is way better and i want to finish what i started so that my skin tone finishes off great! i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few products to try and get rid of my very light sun spots/freckles with no results. I committed to trying Ambi for 3 months. After 1 month, I&#x27;m just starting to see a lightening in the sun damage on my face. It is working. I also use it on a tattoo that I&#x27;ve been having laser removal done on to help with lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not do anything else for skin except lightening so don&#x27;t plan on replacing your night cream or moisturizer. The manufacturer specifies not using it past 3 months, the active ingredient is carcinogenic with long term exposure.</li>
            <li> I do not see any improvement to my problem so far, using it twice a day for 1 month.  I will continue the use and hope it improves.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  I have used for at least a month faithfully morning and night and have not seen any fading of skin spots at all.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully (as indicated) for just over three months.  Not only has it not made any change at all to the three light age spots on my face, they have gotten darker.  Do not waste your money.  It&#x27;s snake oil to put it mildly!</li>
            <li> Cleared all my brown spots that doctor told me I had to use prescription cream for!  Saved a ton of money- I was at a restaurant the the other day and a server asked, &amp;#34;What did you do to your skin?  Last time you were here you had brown spots everywhere and now your skin looks like porcelain.&amp;#34;  AMAZING</li>
            <li> I had a really bad breakout in December and after the pimples went away red pigmentation stayed.  No amount of makeup would cover it up and I read online that sometimes this can happen with pimples (its called hyper pigmentation) and to use lightening cream to make it fade and go away.  I originally was going to buy the Proactiv version as I&#x27;m a customer of theirs, but all the reviews for this product (and Proactiv) said to go this route - plus it was cheaper.  I have been using this every day twice a day (like it says) for over a month and the redness has gone way down.  I noticed a slight change after 2 weeks and every week it gets a little less visable.  Now I can actually cover those red spots with makeup but I&#x27;m hoping that maybe in another month they will be gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when you use it that you only put it on the red spots and not all over as I found sometimes my pores get clogged around that area (and therefore more pimples).  Just dab a little on the problem area and you should be good.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR TWO WEEKS AND I CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE.  JUST WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AND BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED OTHERS THAT DO NOT LIVE UP TO THEIR PROMISE.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t keep using it for 3 months because I am lazy?&lt;br /&gt;It worked for acne scars. (see results in several weeks)&lt;br /&gt;great deal</li>
            <li> I used this for several weeks despite causing eye irritation.  I have sun damage on my cheeks where sunglasses didn&#x27;t protect.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how well it works. But it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy feeling. I like it.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks I noticed a difference in my skin! So glad I tried this product! Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for 3 months, as directed, on an age spot that had developed on my face.  This product did nothing to lighten this spot.  What a waste of time and money.  It went into the trash....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl and I get dark spots on my upper lip from my oral contraception. The spots are very dramatic in the summer even though I use sunscreen. After makeup failed to cover the dark spots I decided to take action. I have a friend who works for a dermatologist. She suggested a paste that costs about $30 bucks from her office. But I tried AMBI first because it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the product for about 5 days. I already see significant fading. I have been home a lot, and so I use the cream about 3 times a day. However, I don&#x27;t put a huge glob on. I only use a tiny dot. I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritations. I&#x27;m so so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different skin, but this worked on my white hue. The other thing is that the bottles are huge and I got two of them. This will last me a lifetime. The cream is orderless and soaks in fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you give this a try if you are fighting dark spots due to birth control. I can&#x27;t comment on other issues. Good luck.</li>
