            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>If adjusted right, it will be the best liner blade you&#x27;ll have.</li>
            <li>Thank You for supporting a Great product...!!!</li>
            <li>i liked the blades they are working nice</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, as advertised, very happy</li>
            <li>Great and economically</li>
            <li>I guess I am ok with the trade of.</li>
            <li>this blade will help you become more efficient with your line</li>
            <li>i was able to minimize the scratching with this method while my lineups came out crispy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well - much better fix for our high-end clippers than replacing them.</li>
            <li>, it was fine for about 2 more cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think andis should stop selling the original t-blade because so many barbers ended up getting it modified (but that&#x27;s just my opinion)</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works fine.</li>
            <li>Best blade for any Andis trimmer has real deep tooth action to give you a more precision when outlining</li>
            <li>The cut is precise, the blades area also a bit deeper.</li>
            <li>Runs smooth across my face and was a breeze to replace.</li>
            <li>I since have switched blades and I now have a promate deep tooth blade and its 100 times better!!</li>
            <li>The most Crisp line ups ive ever gotten</li>
            <li>This blade does not get as close as the original one</li>
            <li>but I must admit it does not cut my skin the way the original one did.  </li>
            <li>if you do not adjust these blades right, they will easily scratch your skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you it helped alot with  a. Fresh blade</li>
            <li>delivered as expected  nice job</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better design that Andis came out with.</li>
            <li>The deeper teeth let&#x27;s you get a hold of more hair and cuts through it 4 times faster than the regular blade.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The best blade on the market gives superb sharp lineups especially if you set the blade properly won&#x27;t irritate the skin and if you know how to modify the blade by filing the comb blade down any other trimmer is history nothing will compare to it the greatest plain and simple!!!!</li>
            <li>Pure junk, it could be where it was purchased.</li>
            <li>Its super sharp but yet comfortable to skin .</li>
            <li>Now, no matter how much adjustment, cleaning, or oiling I do, it just pulls my hair.</li>
            <li>as always..cuts real close, without bumps</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the T outliner  worked very well</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend that you do not zero gap these blades because it is too sharp on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair which gets caught in the deep grooves, believe should be ok for most.</li>
            <li>I got this as a cheaper alternative but ended up getting a new one for the blade.  </li>
            <li>brand new blade.</li>
            <li>New means no tug.</li>
            <li>i love it, i only wated for a few days and it came threw my mail</li>
            <li>Not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>Its has made a major difference in my Sons business...</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had this trimmer I have had to buy at least 4 blades because the andis deep tooth blade breaks teeth too easy</li>
            <li>Get the job done but NOT sharp enough!</li>
            <li>The blade is blunt and not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>I trim maybe 2 or 3 times a week, this blade worked fine for the first couple of weeks, then it stop cutting.</li>

            <li> I trim maybe 2 or 3 times a week, this blade worked fine for the first couple of weeks, then it stop cutting. I adjusted and oiled it, it was fine for about 2 more cuts. Now, no matter how much adjustment, cleaning, or oiling I do, it just pulls my hair. Pure junk, it could be where it was purchased.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected  nice job</li>
            <li> I bought the andis gtx outliner with the deep teeth blade and I have no complaints about the clipper itself. My complaint is about the blade. Since I&#x27;ve had this trimmer I have had to buy at least 4 blades because the andis deep tooth blade breaks teeth too easy and I am the type to take care of my tools. I since have switched blades and I now have a promate deep tooth blade and its 100 times better!!</li>
            <li> The blades pull my hair and hurts when i use it.  I got this as a cheaper alternative but ended up getting a new one for the blade.  ADVISE:  do not get this blade</li>
            <li> Still sharp as hell after 7 months!</li>
            <li> i liked the blades they are working nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> as always..cuts real close, without bumps</li>
            <li> brand new blade. sharp</li>
            <li> Get the job done but NOT sharp enough!</li>
            <li> This blad hits hard! The most Crisp line ups ive ever gotten and ive tried so man y blades and trimmers till i found this blade</li>
            <li> Best blade for any Andis trimmer has real deep tooth action to give you a more precision when outlining</li>
            <li> Wow this Blade is bad. Not sharp at all. If I can give zero stars I will. I also regret buying the Andis T-Ouliner trimmer. Next purchase is going to be Andis GTX.</li>
            <li> This blade does not get as close as the original one but I must admit it does not cut my skin the way the original one did.  I guess I am ok with the trade of.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which gets caught in the deep grooves, believe should be ok for most.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better design that Andis came out with. The cut is precise, the blades area also a bit deeper. Definitely must get for barbers and clipper fanatics.</li>
            <li> The best blade on the market gives superb sharp lineups especially if you set the blade properly won&#x27;t irritate the skin and if you know how to modify the blade by filing the comb blade down any other trimmer is history nothing will compare to it the greatest plain and simple!!!! A must have..</li>
            <li> The blade is blunt and not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Great and economically fun.products were good i didn&#x27;t like the stickers cause it said to have activities and it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> VERY impressed with this blade. I bought it for my andis t-outliner (not the GTX) and they hit hard. this blade will help you become more efficient with your line ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that adjusting these blades was not easy, and it was time consuming. if you do not adjust these blades right, they will easily scratch your skin. i strongly recommend that you do not zero gap these blades because it is too sharp on the skin. i set the moving blade a hair below the guard blade. i was able to minimize the scratching with this method while my lineups came out crispy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think andis should stop selling the original t-blade because so many barbers ended up getting it modified (but that&#x27;s just my opinion)</li>
            <li> This product is fake, can&#x27;t line up . Don&#x27;t waste your money on it</li>
            <li> Its super sharp but yet comfortable to skin . If adjusted right, it will be the best liner blade you&#x27;ll have. The deeper teeth let&#x27;s you get a hold of more hair and cuts through it 4 times faster than the regular blade.</li>
