            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price</li>

            <li>The product alone works great.  </li>
            <li>I use this product for my hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>I find the scent pleasant.</li>
            <li>It feels really good in my head as well.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product</li>
            <li>Good thing, too.</li>
            <li>works well for my wife, good service, &amp; price.</li>
            <li>it does a good job moisturizing my hair</li>
            <li>But, the good thing is that I don&#x27;t have to reapply until I co-wash again.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good hair butter when I saw this.</li>
            <li>because I can&#x27;t use it has a not so good smell to it ...</li>
            <li>At about 23.00 for 8 oz, it&#x27;s more costly than any hairdress I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>After trying lots of products that didn&#x27;t work, I bought this product based on the reviews and I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the way this hairdress absorbs my scalp!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Before I purchased it for myself, my mom let me use some of hers to see how it liked it.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like vanilla cupcakes with a hint of coconut.</li>
            <li>a good product, costly but good, and worth a try</li>
            <li>The product I received is watery, overly oily, and has a very strong mineral oil scent.</li>
            <li>This product helps prevent shedding and leaves my ends very smooth.</li>
            <li>But this butter is great and thanks to MINA on Youtube from esalonspace</li>
            <li>I was introduced and I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>For those of us who are transitioning and are not too sure to purchase, i&#x27;ts</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and has done a good job at keeping my hair (especially my ends!)</li>
            <li>However there seems to be a genuine consensus of loving it amongst ladies with relaxed hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked wonders on my grand daughter&#x27;s hair who is nature.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be put off by the price, you&#x27;ll be so pleased.</li>
            <li>You will not need more than a dime size amount.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love using this product on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product arrived with oil on top and cream on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Too many products leave a residue on the pillow or the chair or the couch or any surface your hair comes in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never buy again and surely would never recommend.</li>
            <li>I promise you will love it :)</li>
            <li>am biracial and have biracial ringlets, which I relax into a more relaxed and gentle curl pattern, and this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Anyway I do have to use a lot more product than those with fine to medium hair.</li>
            <li>I had been trying to find something to make my transition from relaxed to natural hair easy and this product does a great job.</li>
            <li>The real Mizani Butter Rich is a wonderful product that has managed to keep my hair both healthy and shinny with regular use.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It has the texture of cheap lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy, and makes my hair silky smooth and shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Hmmmm Mizani just blatalantly lied about there mineral ol and petrolatum free.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich cream that absorbs right into the hair.</li>
            <li>With the Butter Rich, that&#x27;s not the case at all.</li>
            <li>My hair feels super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am transiting from relaxed to natural and my hair seems to become more dryer, this helps a lot!</li>
            <li>This Mizani came to me, not in  the creamy, rich texture it was suppose to be but in a LIQUIDIZED form which is not the true Mizani product I will be returning this item and not buying from &amp;#34;NewvoBeauty&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li>Unlike my mom, who has coarse hair, mine in more fine, and I wanted to keep my hair healthy and moisturized, but not at the expense of sacrificing the style or feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s aroma smells like a combination of sweet tobacco and coconut.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for thick curly hair</li>
            <li>I love that it can make my hair soft and smooth WITHOUT making it greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I love Mizani products and this one is highly rated slso.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer that I have used on my natural hair thus far.</li>
            <li>After my hair dries, it&#x27;s silky, soft and has a rich, healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Very important product for my natural hair style along with the Mizani oil.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product, especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use this under a Redkin Fresh Curls Curl Refiner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t claim to be a natural product.</li>
            <li>I just had to use trial and error to figure out how much and how often I needed to apply the Butter Rich to my hair.</li>
            <li>It really is buttery rich.</li>
            <li>I use it right before wrapping my hair for bed.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Yes this is for fine to medium hair, but my hair is coarse, and I love it that way because I know once I am complete my transition</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair richly moisturized and very soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how it says \\&quot;Mineral Oil and Petrolatum-Free\\&quot; on the front</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mizani Butter Rich Creme for years on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I usually have good results with mizani products</li>
            <li>Luckily they issue refunds quickly and the return shipping with Amazon is simple.</li>
            <li>The real Mizani product is thick and does not move freely on its own, the real product has a consistency of  tub margarine or butter spread.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and it keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>The smell was rather strong and even left its odor on my pillow.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Mizani products by my mother (and her stylist recommend the line to her), and the Mizani Butter Rich Deep Nourishing Hairdress became one of her staples.</li>
            <li>It cost a little more but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to a friend, but just warn her that too much of the product can result in stiff-looking hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I found a product I really like for my hair.</li>
            <li>and this is very moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it is very greasy and oily.</li>
            <li>I went to my Target and got the real thing for $15.99.</li>
            <li>AVOID&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT A REAL MIZANI PRODUCT</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>This product really moisturizes and strengthens your hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>This products provides intense moisturizing nourishing and softening of the hair.</li>
            <li>this product really nourish my hair and made it very manageable, but i dint like the after smell of coconut oil .</li>
            <li>I find it a real turn off.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good product, just not so good if it&#x27;s cold outside.</li>
            <li>I use this hairdress on my dry normal/coarse relaxed hair once every day and it leaves my hair easy to comb and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to get my money back from this seller and never put this mess on my hair.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the jar was only 3/4&#x27;s full upon arrival.</li>
            <li>&quot; hairdress from Hollywood Beauty works better for me, and it&#x27;s about half the price.</li>
            <li>I would not reccomend this particular product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Mizani Products for a few years now and typically love all their products.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold the UglyNBeauty product was the normal consistency and color</li>
            <li>It did not smell like the original Mizani, and was only half filled, like it was opened, and it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I liked it enough to buy; however, it has been a little tricky perfecting how I use it.</li>
            <li>My hair is super dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and it leaves your scalp feeling rejuvenated and your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>But THIS time, which was my first time purchasing this product from Newvobeauty, something was different about the product.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and always be sure to seal your hair afterwards</li>
            <li>This cream makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was hydrated, and had a natural looking shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning, my hair is silky soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The oil had completely separated from the mixture.</li>
            <li>I decided to give amazon a try because I prefer to receive things in the mail than to try and rush to the store after work or on a busy weekend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to use the whole Mizani line to get comprehensive results from the relaxer, neutralizing shampoo, conditioner, and now this.</li>
            <li>look old  </li>
            <li>hair soft and shiny while providing hold.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li>I have 3b through 4a, medium-coarse, natural hair.</li>
            <li>She still used it, but didn&#x27;t like nearly as well.</li>
            <li>And that should be good news considering the Mizani product line is on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend as a daily hairdress.</li>
            <li>The product I previously used is 3.00 for 6 oz, and easily available at my local beauty supply and Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>it has a lot of the right ingredients as far as being natural and not being harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li>If you do and it seems that the color is a little darker than normal and it is wrapped in child proof plastic, return before using because it is not the real thing!</li>
            <li>and it really help my dry dehydrated hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m relaxed, and i noticed that many naturals either love this or hate it.</li>
            <li>While this is a really good hair product and quite reasonably priced compared to local retail, I find the scent so unpleasant that I plan to seek refund.</li>
            <li>again, as with many black hair products, the smell it half of what deters me.</li>
            <li>Remember, a little goes a long way to make your hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase Butter Rich from a local hair supply store and have never had issues with the quality.</li>
            <li>I usually buy Mizani Butter Rich product from my local Beatuy Supply store.</li>
            <li>Unlike any other product, it sinks right into the strands, immediately adding sheen and control.</li>
            <li>I placed the container on a shelf along side another Butter Rich container that I&#x27;d previously purchased from UglyNBeauty and left it there a few days.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s funny how it says \\&quot;Mineral Oil and Petrolatum-Free\\&quot; on the front</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mizani Butter Rich Creme for years on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I usually have good results with mizani products</li>
            <li> Luckily they issue refunds quickly and the return shipping with Amazon is simple.</li>
            <li> The real Mizani product is thick and does not move freely on its own, the real product has a consistency of  tub margarine or butter spread.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and it keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The smell was rather strong and even left its odor on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Mizani products by my mother (and her stylist recommend the line to her), and the Mizani Butter Rich Deep Nourishing Hairdress became one of her staples.</li>
            <li> It cost a little more but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a friend, but just warn her that too much of the product can result in stiff-looking hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I found a product I really like for my hair.</li>
            <li> and this is very moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> and it is very greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> I went to my Target and got the real thing for $15.99.</li>
            <li> AVOID&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT A REAL MIZANI PRODUCT</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This product really moisturizes and strengthens your hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> This products provides intense moisturizing nourishing and softening of the hair.</li>
            <li> this product really nourish my hair and made it very manageable, but i dint like the after smell of coconut oil .</li>
            <li> I find it a real turn off.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a good product, just not so good if it&#x27;s cold outside.</li>
            <li> I use this hairdress on my dry normal/coarse relaxed hair once every day and it leaves my hair easy to comb and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was able to get my money back from this seller and never put this mess on my hair.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the jar was only 3/4&#x27;s full upon arrival.</li>
            <li> &quot; hairdress from Hollywood Beauty works better for me, and it&#x27;s about half the price.</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend this particular product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mizani Products for a few years now and typically love all their products.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold the UglyNBeauty product was the normal consistency and color</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the original Mizani, and was only half filled, like it was opened, and it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I liked it enough to buy; however, it has been a little tricky perfecting how I use it.</li>
            <li> My hair is super dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and it leaves your scalp feeling rejuvenated and your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> But THIS time, which was my first time purchasing this product from Newvobeauty, something was different about the product.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and always be sure to seal your hair afterwards</li>
            <li> This cream makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was hydrated, and had a natural looking shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the morning, my hair is silky soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The oil had completely separated from the mixture.</li>
            <li> I decided to give amazon a try because I prefer to receive things in the mail than to try and rush to the store after work or on a busy weekend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to use the whole Mizani line to get comprehensive results from the relaxer, neutralizing shampoo, conditioner, and now this.</li>
            <li> look old  </li>
            <li> hair soft and shiny while providing hold.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li> I have 3b through 4a, medium-coarse, natural hair.</li>
            <li> She still used it, but didn&#x27;t like nearly as well.</li>
            <li> And that should be good news considering the Mizani product line is on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend as a daily hairdress.</li>
            <li> The product I previously used is 3.00 for 6 oz, and easily available at my local beauty supply and Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> it has a lot of the right ingredients as far as being natural and not being harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li> If you do and it seems that the color is a little darker than normal and it is wrapped in child proof plastic, return before using because it is not the real thing!</li>
            <li> and it really help my dry dehydrated hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m relaxed, and i noticed that many naturals either love this or hate it.</li>
            <li> While this is a really good hair product and quite reasonably priced compared to local retail, I find the scent so unpleasant that I plan to seek refund.</li>
            <li> again, as with many black hair products, the smell it half of what deters me.</li>
            <li> Remember, a little goes a long way to make your hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Butter Rich from a local hair supply store and have never had issues with the quality.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Mizani Butter Rich product from my local Beatuy Supply store.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other product, it sinks right into the strands, immediately adding sheen and control.</li>
            <li> I placed the container on a shelf along side another Butter Rich container that I&#x27;d previously purchased from UglyNBeauty and left it there a few days.</li>
            <li> My little sister has super tight AA hair - c4 and</li>
            <li> With this, it&#x27;s no longer necessary to waste money purchasing hydration products, that don&#x27;t live up to their claims.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried on my hair when it is flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at my local beauty supply in New York City.</li>
            <li> I use about a little over a quarter size on my fine medium density hair (a pinch past shoulder length straightened, a little shorter curly of course, which would be WAY too much on flat ironed or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> It was very watery and it made my hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair, and this makes my hair supple and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s applied at night, on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be just mineral or some other type of cheap oil and other ingredients mixed together and smells weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks now, and my opinion of it is still slightly the same, but with some drawbacks.</li>
            <li> It always remained the same consistency despite slight changes in the environmental temperature.</li>
            <li> Not only that but the color looked slightly off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild, without a lot of fragrance....smells faintly of cocoa butter.    </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The scent is characteristic of that of other hair and skin products containing shea butter.</li>
            <li> this should be used in the summer time when you don&#x27;t have to add as much of it to your hair, because the cold air completely obliterates the moisturizing effect of it.</li>
            <li> What I received was a wet oily concoction.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little to get the results.</li>
            <li> but it was just not right for my hair type.</li>
            <li> it looks watered down nothing creamy to it.</li>
            <li> The product is lite and it shines your hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> it seems like it was a fake product, since I already had bought this same product a while back...</li>
            <li> This company is selling a fake product or they are keeping this product in high temperatures.</li>
            <li> But I never thought it would be this coagulated oily mess.</li>
            <li> It smells good, the ingredients are not GREAT, but they aren&#x27;t bad either, holds moisture without the GREASE, helps with frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or heavy (while curly).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an oily, heavy, or greasy formulation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily; no residue buildup or heavy feel.   </li>
            <li> Heavy chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I had not used either product, but something told me to look at the containers a few days after I purchased them.</li>
            <li> and apparently there&#x27;s a black market for fake Mizani products.</li>
            <li> Even though only a very little is needed for results, Mizani is expensive.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer!</li>
            <li> In all the at least 4 years I&#x27;ve been using this product, I had never seen ANYTHING like this.</li>
            <li> I use this product to moisturize my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT AUTHENTIC MIZANI!</li>
            <li> I like that there is not petroleum (Vaseline) or castor oil or any of those thick oils that are not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I hate hair dress&#x27;s that way the hair down and leave a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair approximately 2 times per week.    </li>
            <li> Not sure if I got one from a bad batch</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I open the box to c</li>
            <li> and I know that an oil to seal it is useless.</li>
            <li> Yes, this seller is peddling FAKE Mizani products that smell like mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> This is fake Mizani.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all!</li>
            <li> This product, however is FAKE!!  </li>
            <li> However this product was terrible.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After trying lots of products that didn&#x27;t work, I bought this product based on the reviews and I have to say I love it! It penetrates deeply and moisturizers my relaxed hair without making it greasy. The smell is mild and it keeps my hair soft. I can&#x27;t do without this product. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this literally 1 day ago and I enjoy it. Yes this is for fine to medium hair, but my hair is coarse, and I love it that way because I know once I am complete my transition I can do a lot with my hair. Anyway I do have to use a lot more product than those with fine to medium hair. Because my hair soaks this stuff up, I know when to put enough and I know that an oil to seal it is useless. But this butter is great and thanks to MINA on Youtube from esalonspace I was introduced and I am a satisfied customer. For those of us who are transitioning and are not too sure to purchase, i&#x27;ts a good product, costly but good, and worth a try but if it&#x27;s not for you by all means give it away. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done with all of my products that didn&#x27;t do well on my hair. HHJ.</li>
            <li> I just use a lilttle of this product(dont have to use it everyday)and it moisturizes really well. Remember, a little goes a long way to make your hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Mizani products by my mother (and her stylist recommend the line to her), and the Mizani Butter Rich Deep Nourishing Hairdress became one of her staples. Before I purchased it for myself, my mom let me use some of hers to see how it liked it. Obviously, I liked it enough to buy; however, it has been a little tricky perfecting how I use it. It has a great smell and has done a good job at keeping my hair (especially my ends!) moisturized, but using too much of it can result in a heavy, weighed-down look. Unlike my mom, who has coarse hair, mine in more fine, and I wanted to keep my hair healthy and moisturized, but not at the expense of sacrificing the style or feel of my hair. I just had to use trial and error to figure out how much and how often I needed to apply the Butter Rich to my hair. On the label, it says to use the product \\&quot;sparingly\\&quot; which is exactly how it should be used; a little of this stuff can go a long way! And that should be good news considering the Mizani product line is on the expensive side. I would recommend this to a friend, but just warn her that too much of the product can result in stiff-looking hair.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer Iv&#x27;e gotten to work yet! My little sister has super tight AA hair - c4 and this stuff works wonders! We go through a lot of it but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this with the mizani moisturfusion shampoo and conditioner and it really help my dry dehydrated hair.</li>
            <li> This is simply a wonderful moisturizer!  I have extremely dry hair, and this makes my hair supple and manageable.  It feels really good in my head as well.  I simply cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, and it lasts a long time. You can find it at discounted stores every now and then (Tj Maxx, Marshalls) and it shouldn&#x27;t cost you over 12$. When I smoothed this over my hair, the difference was almost immediate. My hair was hydrated, and had a natural looking shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m relaxed, and i noticed that many naturals either love this or hate it. However there seems to be a genuine consensus of loving it amongst ladies with relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks now, and my opinion of it is still slightly the same, but with some drawbacks. this should be used in the summer time when you don&#x27;t have to add as much of it to your hair, because the cold air completely obliterates the moisturizing effect of it. I&#x27;m in college, so I found myself constantly reapplying some whenever I came back to my apartment between classes. So it&#x27;s a good product, just not so good if it&#x27;s cold outside. The \\&quot;Olive Oil\\&quot; hairdress from Hollywood Beauty works better for me, and it&#x27;s about half the price. I would recommend everyone give that one a try before this!</li>
            <li> It melts in your hair without that greasy feeling. It cost a little more but it is worth every penny. I have been using it over a year and I get a lot of complements about my hair. Try it and you will be sold.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product but it was just not right for my hair type. I have relaxed hair. It worked wonders on my grand daughter&#x27;s hair who is nature. I find that a lot with Mizani hair products.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. My hair 3(b,c), is relaxed with Mizani Butter Blend Rhelaxer.  I wear it short and wrapped.  After washing with the Fructis Triple Nourishing Shampoo and conditoning with their 3 Minute Dryness Reversal Conditoner, I appy this hairdress. After my hair dries, it&#x27;s silky, soft and has a rich, healthy sheen. I wash my hair approximately 2 times per week.    It&#x27;s not an oily, heavy, or greasy formulation. This is a very rich cream that absorbs right into the hair. You don&#x27;t have to work it in. No leftover white reside. Actually, the hairdress feels like whipped butter. It leaves the hair richly moisturized and very soft to touch. I find the scent pleasant. It&#x27;s mild, without a lot of fragrance....smells faintly of cocoa butter.    You only need a very little to get the results. Good thing, too. Even though only a very little is needed for results, Mizani is expensive. The product I previously used is 3.00 for 6 oz, and easily available at my local beauty supply and Walgreens.  At about 23.00 for 8 oz, it&#x27;s more costly than any hairdress I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s very effective. My local stores don&#x27;t carry this, so I have to purchase online. Don&#x27;t be put off by the price, you&#x27;ll be so pleased. The results are worth it. With this, it&#x27;s no longer necessary to waste money purchasing hydration products, that don&#x27;t live up to their claims.  This one does.   I never scoop into the cream. I glide my finger over it&#x27;s surface a couple of times. The amount of product that attaches to my finger is all that&#x27;s needed. Longer hair? You will not need more than a dime size amount.  **UPDATE:  I gotta tell you, I found a product I really like for my hair. It&#x27;s great for relaxed wrapped styles. It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Loreal Paris EverStrong Overnight  Treatment\\&quot;. It&#x27;s applied at night, on dry hair.  I use it right before wrapping my hair for bed.  In the morning, my hair is silky soft, and shiny.  This product helps prevent shedding and leaves my ends very smooth. It also strengthens the hair.  It&#x27;s not oily; no residue buildup or heavy feel.   I must tell you, it&#x27;s aroma smells like a combination of sweet tobacco and coconut. Some reviewers are turned off by it, but I like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s under 6 bucks.  Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> This hair dress is the best I have ever used in my life! I am transiting from relaxed to natural and my hair seems to become more dryer, this helps a lot! I hate hair dress&#x27;s that way the hair down and leave a heavy residue. With the Butter Rich, that&#x27;s not the case at all. I am a firm believer!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have long curly hair and this is very moisturizing without being greasy.  I highly recommend as a daily hairdress.</li>
            <li> works well for my wife, good service, &amp; price. Its worth the money. I would buy from this co, again.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter and she did not like the smell so I tried using it. The smell was rather strong and even left its odor on my pillow.</li>
            <li> Very important product for my natural hair style along with the Mizani oil.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these (one for me and one for a friend) and returned both of them. A butter should have a creamy consistency. What I received was a wet oily concoction. The oil had completely separated from the mixture. It resembled a lava lamp.</li>
            <li> I love the way this hairdress absorbs my scalp! It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and it leaves your scalp feeling rejuvenated and your hair very soft. I also love the way it smells.  It&#x27;s a definite MUST BUY!!!! I will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> The real Mizani Butter Rich is a wonderful product that has managed to keep my hair both healthy and shinny with regular use.  This product, however is FAKE!!  Yes, this seller is peddling FAKE Mizani products that smell like mineral oil.  Who knows what is in these products smh.  I suggest purchasing Mizani products only from an authorized distributor or salon because their are fakes out there.  Fortunately, I was able to get my money back from this seller and never put this mess on my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at my local beauty supply in New York City. I decided to give amazon a try because I prefer to receive things in the mail than to try and rush to the store after work or on a busy weekend. This product is NOT AUTHENTIC MIZANI! the color is almost like cocoa butter and it is very greasy and oily. It has the texture of cheap lotion. When I shake the container the contents squish around and make a \\&quot;glob glob\\&quot; noise. The real Mizani product is thick and does not move freely on its own, the real product has a consistency of  tub margarine or butter spread. It seems to be just mineral or some other type of cheap oil and other ingredients mixed together and smells weird. I went to my Target and got the real thing for $15.99. AVOID&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT A REAL MIZANI PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the hair. My family has always used it, but I decided to start ordering it on the internet.</li>
            <li> This is fake Mizani. I had a licensed stylist confirm it and apparently there&#x27;s a black market for fake Mizani products. I usually purchase Butter Rich from a local hair supply store and have never had issues with the quality. The product I received is watery, overly oily, and has a very strong mineral oil scent. Furthermore, the jar was only 3/4&#x27;s full upon arrival. I will be requesting a prompt refund immediately.</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the original Mizani, and was only half filled, like it was opened, and it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li> again, as with many black hair products, the smell it half of what deters me. I like that there is not petroleum (Vaseline) or castor oil or any of those thick oils that are not good for your hair. it has a lot of the right ingredients as far as being natural and not being harsh on the hair. it does a good job moisturizing my hair but I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> great product. delivery tiome is great.would order again.great for my hair.would not use anthing else .for me this is the product.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, especially for natural hair. It helps to moisturize the hair helps to detangle and style.</li>
            <li> I use this hairdress on my dry normal/coarse relaxed hair once every day and it leaves my hair easy to comb and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal. It smells kind of like vanilla cupcakes with a hint of coconut. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy, and makes my hair silky smooth and shiny but not greasy. It really is buttery rich. I&#x27;m starting to use the whole Mizani line to get comprehensive results from the relaxer, neutralizing shampoo, conditioner, and now this.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer that I have used on my natural hair thus far. It smells good, the ingredients are not GREAT, but they aren&#x27;t bad either, holds moisture without the GREASE, helps with frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or heavy (while curly). I use about a little over a quarter size on my fine medium density hair (a pinch past shoulder length straightened, a little shorter curly of course, which would be WAY too much on flat ironed or relaxed hair. But, the good thing is that I don&#x27;t have to reapply until I co-wash again. Sometimes that can be a week. I use this under a Redkin Fresh Curls Curl Refiner. The combination of the two is GREAT! I have not tried on my hair when it is flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good hair butter when I saw this. I bought it and have used it for six months now with no change to my hair. It makes my hair greasy. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mizani Products for a few years now and typically love all their products. However this product was terrible. It was very watery and it made my hair hard and dry. I would NOT buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how it says \\&quot;Mineral Oil and Petrolatum-Free\\&quot; on the front but it caontains c13-14 isoparaffin. It also has some parabens, and alcohol. I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t claim to be a natural product. Some one gave this to me and it cost them $17.99 for 8 oz Wow! Hmmmm Mizani just blatalantly lied about there mineral ol and petrolatum free.</li>
            <li> This product really moisturizes and strengthens your hair.  I mix it with Carol&#x27;s Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey and get great results.  The product alone works great.  Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Heavy chemical smell. I was so lightheaded had to wash it out immediately. I usually have good results with mizani products but this one is like poison in a jar. I would not reccomend this particular product.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was in a liquid form.</li>
            <li> This products provides intense moisturizing nourishing and softening of the hair. It&#x27;s good for dry and brittle hair. It&#x27;s also protects the hair from heat damage during thermal styling. This product is excellent for thick curly hair</li>
            <li> This product is perfect I have been searching for a quality mosturizer forever and one that would work with my daughters virgin hair and my relaxed hair and this product delivers !! You only need a little and always be sure to seal your hair afterwards I follow up with jojoba oil which results in a beautiful finish</li>
            <li> I love using this product on my hair. I received the product within a couple of days. Would recommend to use.</li>
            <li> It was melted n look as if it had been in the shelf for a while look old  I was very disappointed when I open the box to c how it looked I can&#x27;t even give it 1* because I can&#x27;t use it has a not so good smell to it ...it looks watered down nothing creamy to it.😕</li>
            <li> smells amazing. sometimes I get the urge to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;leaves hair soft and shiny while providing hold.&lt;br /&gt;after only 3 days of use, I see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;BUY BUY BUY.</li>
            <li> this product really nourish my hair and made it very manageable, but i dint like the after smell of coconut oil .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mizani Butter Rich Creme for years on my natural hair. It always remained the same consistency despite slight changes in the environmental temperature. But THIS time, which was my first time purchasing this product from Newvobeauty, something was different about the product. Once it arrived, it was wrapped in plastic in a way I&#x27;d never seen for a Mizani product. Not only that but the color looked slightly off. Despite noticing these things, I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I placed the container on a shelf along side another Butter Rich container that I&#x27;d previously purchased from UglyNBeauty and left it there a few days. I had not used either product, but something told me to look at the containers a few days after I purchased them. Lo and behold the UglyNBeauty product was the normal consistency and color WHILE THE CREME FROM NEWVOBEAUTY HAD TURNED INTO YELLOW-TAN COLORED SOUP.....LITERALLY! In all the at least 4 years I&#x27;ve been using this product, I had never seen ANYTHING like this. Do not purchase this product from this seller! If you do and it seems that the color is a little darker than normal and it is wrapped in child proof plastic, return before using because it is not the real thing! Luckily they issue refunds quickly and the return shipping with Amazon is simple.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with oil on top and cream on the bottom. Furthermore the smell was off so it seems like it was a fake product, since I already had bought this same product a while back... Not happy with this at all!</li>
            <li> I usually buy Mizani Butter Rich product from my local Beatuy Supply store. I have been using this product for years so I know the texture. This company is selling a fake product or they are keeping this product in high temperatures. This Mizani came to me, not in  the creamy, rich texture it was suppose to be but in a LIQUIDIZED form which is not the true Mizani product I will be returning this item and not buying from &amp;#34;NewvoBeauty&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> I use this product to moisturize my thick, curly hair. I love that it can make my hair soft and smooth WITHOUT making it greasy or oily. Too many products leave a residue on the pillow or the chair or the couch or any surface your hair comes in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;I am biracial and have biracial ringlets, which I relax into a more relaxed and gentle curl pattern, and this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. But I never thought it would be this coagulated oily mess. It looks gross, and feels gross and it&#x27;s the messiest thing I&#x27;ve ever used. The product description and picture make it seem like it would be creamy, but it&#x27;s not. I even tried shaking it, thinking it just separated, but it won&#x27;t go back together. Not sure if I got one from a bad batch but it&#x27;s horrible. I&#x27;d never buy again and surely would never recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have 3b through 4a, medium-coarse, natural hair. I&#x27;m using this while my hair is flat-ironed. Unlike any other product, it sinks right into the strands, immediately adding sheen and control. My hair feels super silky and smooth. My only problem is I think it leaves residue on my scalp, but it&#x27;s not an out of control issue (plus my scalp tends to do that). I definitely recommend it! (Note: I didn&#x27;t purchase this on Amazon)</li>
            <li> this is the best thing that i could have come across for my hair. The product is lite and it shines your hair without weighing it down. I promise you will love it :)</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find something to make my transition from relaxed to natural hair easy and this product does a great job. It makes my hair soft and easy to manage. I would definitely recommend this to any african american woman who is trying to transition. My go to product!!</li>
            <li> Have purchased this before.  My granddaughter loves it, but this time the product was runnier than before.  She still used it, but didn&#x27;t like nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I love Mizani products and this one is highly rated slso. I use it as a dryness remedy as well as wrap creme.</li>
            <li> While this is a really good hair product and quite reasonably priced compared to local retail, I find the scent so unpleasant that I plan to seek refund. The scent is characteristic of that of other hair and skin products containing shea butter. I find it a real turn off.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair and it works great. My hair is super dry so I use it all year.</li>
