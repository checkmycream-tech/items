            <li>I was not that impressed.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and looks beautiful,  </li>
            <li>but i also credit that to a great curler (another revlon product).</li>
            <li>Looks great for about a minute.</li>

            <li>the price is amazing!</li>
            <li>Anyway, the one I loved before was the falsies by mabelline</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>The formula is good.</li>
            <li>It also does not do a good job of separating lashes.  </li>
            <li>Good price too</li>
            <li>It is priced fairly based on its quality and superior coverage.</li>
            <li>Has a good brush for separating lashes.  </li>
            <li>Still looked good after 9 hours.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that the search for the perfect, cheaply priced mascara is over!</li>

            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an ok eyelash!</li>
            <li>i love this mascara!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and getting more than what I thought I was getting was an added bonus!  </li>
            <li>its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my lashes grow-</li>
            <li>that I have liked</li>
            <li>Full, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>I kind of like that.</li>
            <li>I still use this mascara regulary, even though I use many others as well, I don&#x27;t know for sure that this has made my lashes grow, but they do seem more full now, so I know that it does work in that measure, and it is a wonderful mascara as well, I do recommend this!</li>
            <li>for the reason that I love this stuff - my lashes are in better shape than ever!</li>
            <li>So far I still like Maybelline Stiletto Lash the best.</li>
            <li>Really nice, really cheap, really effective mascara.  </li>
            <li>i love this product ,very compact in your bag, it gives your eyes lashes a good and sparkling look good to have one.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself, but the image is deceiving.  </li>
            <li>There have been so many improvements in mascara brushes that help with the application</li>
            <li>I also love Revlon because they don&#x27;t test their products on animals.</li>
            <li>I truly love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mascara for years but have never found a product I was completely satisfied with until I found this one.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>For years I have used the latest and greatest mascara from Christian Dior- but at $40 a tube</li>
            <li>Better than mascara</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see if my lashes look like a camel&#x27;s after a couple months&#x27; use. :-)</li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on and not bunch up like some of those others.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best drugstore mascara out there.</li>
            <li>I like the thickness of this brush for top coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find Revlon Grow Luscious Mascra at Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I love the length it gives me.</li>
            <li>I go through so much more eye makeup remover now than I ever did with waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>I did like this product although the &amp;#34;Fabulash Version&amp;#34; is even better</li>
            <li>I noticed the flakeyness from this mascara is more noticeable than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying to apply mascara with different brands, this was the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That was more than a year ago</li>
            <li>They look better even before I use mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Its more of a volumizing one with some lengthening to it.</li>
            <li>I think you have to find your technique :)</li>
            <li>It was ok could of got it from Walmart.</li>
            <li>My lashes are thicker and I just feel more atractive and glamorous when I am using these.  </li>
            <li>A product I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>times faster than I go thru most.</li>
            <li>I like it so much, but I would like it more if it lasted&lt;br /&gt;longer!!</li>
            <li>I liked the original formula and they&#x27;ve changed it to this one.</li>
            <li>So it makes my eyelashes look nice and full.</li>
            <li>i love this mascara because it&#x27;s not too \\&quot;wet\\&quot; like some others i have tried where they tend to clump the lashes easily.  </li>
            <li>but instead it is curved and can fit eyeshapes better.</li>
            <li>I previously wore Great Lash for years and this one is good too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove and no lashes are pulled off.</li>
            <li>Longer lashes, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it where I shop and Amazon made it easy and convenient to order.</li>
            <li>It has practically no clumps and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day and comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge for me or run easily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; or smear easily.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome, I have used too many to name in the past</li>
            <li>The best part is I did get compliments on my lashes a few weeks after I began using it --</li>
            <li>It came out smoothly and coated my lashes evenly, even when I added a couple of coats.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily mascara, I say this because I had realized that after years of using mascara it can break your lashes or seem thinner.</li>
            <li>The brush is big and bristly which is great.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful mascara I&#x27;m older and my eyelashes are in need of extra help</li>
            <li>I was excited about this mascara since I&#x27;m up for anything that would help give me thicker or longer lashes.</li>
            <li>It lengthened pretty well, volume was OK.</li>
            <li>The first application was mildly challenging because I was overshooting my lashes with the illustrious brush and globbing mascara on my outer eye.</li>
            <li>Mascara is by far my favorite makeup product, and when i find a mascara i love, i will stick with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to clump if I clean it on the edge of the tube before applying.  </li>
            <li>They are slightly more abundant and long.  </li>
            <li>It makes them appear full</li>
            <li>Although I still have an almost full tube, I have discontinued use.  </li>
            <li>This was an okay mascara for me, didn&#x27;t really do much for my lashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look as full as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>it really does thicken and lengthen my lashes, but mostly thicken.</li>
            <li>this mascara quickly thickens my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>Its not one of those super defining mascaras.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;really quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras and this is now my favorite one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high pigmented and it makes my lashes look phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>First off, I feel I have to mention the obnoxiously huge brush/wand for this mascara.</li>
            <li>First, the wand applicator is HUGE.  </li>
            <li>New favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Great product and less than $6 shipped to my door every 3 months?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder to find a good wand.</li>
            <li>This brush is big, wide and great for thicker longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li>and it rarely smudged or flaked off.</li>
            <li>On a rare occasion I have tried another mascara but return to Revlon.  </li>
            <li>To use it right</li>
            <li>so I  will continue to buy this product as long as it is available for purchase -- I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and i actually prefer this traditional type of brush as opposed to those newer silicone ones because it grabs every lash and separates them beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The brush is big and spreads out your eyelashes when you put the mascara on, so they totally look individually beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is true that the brush is large, but</li>
            <li>My eyes generally get irritated by most mascara but do well with this.</li>
            <li>Especially love the big fat fluffy brush.</li>
            <li>I started noticing my lashes weren&#x27;t as long or full, so I tried many mascaras to help them look fuller.  </li>
            <li>and as the day progresses, there is more and more smugdging, to the point where it really looks like i have dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>So I am happy that this has a classic fluffy mascara wand</li>
            <li>Like when I drew the brush out of the tube for the first time, I thought it had been designed for a camel.  </li>
            <li>My first time trying and would buy again</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, a couple eyelashes would fall out when I would wash my face.</li>
            <li>irritated my eyes and after several attempts to wash it off my eyes were even more irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does curl and extend the lashes well in only one swipe:-)</li>
            <li>but this is pretty close.   </li>
            <li>There are much better mascaras than this one for the same price.</li>
            <li>This is pretty close though, imo.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that when I first tried Grow Luscious</li>
            <li>It seemed to clump coming out of the tube and the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>pretty</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I saw the advertising for this product, a mascara that actually makes your lashes grow longer!  </li>
            <li>For day, I add a second coat of Grow Luscious and get very nice plush long lashes.  </li>
            <li>If you want a natural (but better than natural) look and stronger healthier lashes, then give this a try.</li>
            <li>Even a cheap brand like Covergirl lash exact is waterproof&lt;br /&gt;but washes off easily enough.</li>
            <li>It looks fine the next day.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>So i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely everything that I was looking for</li>
            <li>and I really feel that they appear so much longer when I wear this.  </li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t buy the promise that this mascara will help my lashes grow longer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li>I bought this product and tried it , and I really like this Mascara.</li>
            <li>Would buy again, now that I have found one I really like.</li>
            <li>A great idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li>one really is a \\&quot;you</li>
            <li>This is a very nurturing product</li>
            <li>but not for people with my eyes haha.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know that this makes them grow, but my lashes are absolutely fuller and longer than they were before.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>and for me really defines your lashes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for me in terms of lengthening or thickening.</li>
            <li>The tutorial suggested using 2 mascaras on top of each other, but I didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>a full large brush similar to the older dior..</li>
            <li>Clump free, allergy friendly, does make your lashes grow, good for every day or dramatic look with a few extra layers, comes off easy.</li>
            <li>guess is young kids with limited budgets and lots of time to put on make up and who think \\&quot;more is better\\&quot;</li>
            <li>i remember reading some negative reviews about this mascara clumping up too much, but i personally love the clump!</li>
            <li>Decent mascara by Revlon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>To me it is very similar to the Maybelline Full and Soft mascara which is what i used for YEARS!</li>
            <li>:) I didn&#x27;t buy it with the intent of actually making my natural eyelashes grow, I just bought it to use as a regular mascara.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite mascara, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look long and full, and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>I have very short non distinct eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my lashes are shaped such that I can get a nice cat-eye effect, but this wand is so large that it&#x27;s impossible to apply mascara more heavily anywhere--not towards the inner eye at those tiny lashes, not in the center where it should be easy, and not even towards the outer lashes where it really ought to be easy to apply more.</li>
            <li>That lets me combine the conditioning of Grow Luscious with the super long lashes look from MAC.  </li>
            <li>The brush is pretty big</li>
            <li>I do shop around for different products pretty often, but this is one I will stick with for awhile.  </li>
            <li>The consistent result is mascara on the lid skin above lashes.</li>
            <li>I really do like this mascara, and I barely ever say that.</li>
            <li>Okay so I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li>I first used revlon double lash in the red tube which just seemed like regular mascara, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased expensive mascara from high end stores and this is just as good and doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li>When I do wear the Grow Luscious it adds volume and is very natural looking and soft.</li>
            <li>i would suggest the NYC big bold curl mascara its cheaper but has a big brush like this</li>
            <li>WAY too large to do anything with my tiny eyelashes</li>
            <li>I felt confident of my look when I was working hard and had no mirrors.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this is the only one that stays on all day and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>So far I like the Revlon Grow Luscious.</li>
            <li>I was surprised I felt like it did help my lashes be longer after a month or so of using</li>
            <li>Have repurchased three times so far.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my lashes look long and full without clumps...</li>
            <li>It is a true black.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing for thin, short eyelashes!</li>
            <li>Some people have also said that the applicator is way too big; I don&#x27;t really think it is at all, but that may just be personal preference.</li>
            <li>however, in just a couple hours, i see black smudges right underneath the outer corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love the Black Brown and Black Shimmer.</li>
            <li>I use a smaller, more concentrated brush for my base layers to make sure I avoid clumping and apply even coverage throughout my lashes.</li>
            <li>Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the wand is big that it makes it hard to get all the lashes and makes it easy to get mascara on eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I have curly, full  lashes, not super long though.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this also may be due to the fact that I don&#x27;t coat my lower lashes (I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s an unofficial makeup \\&quot;rule\\&quot;, but my eyes are already huge as it is and my eyes just look odd with the lower lashes coated).</li>
            <li>i thought buying the expensive brands were better because of the old adage</li>
            <li>It holds plenty of mascara and even makes this old lady of 70 look like she has long lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look forward to using this one and end up using other, older mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have long lashes, but since using this I have definitely noticed an even fuller/longer apperance to my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I first purchased it a few years ago at Walgreens, and it&#x27;s the only mascara I buy now.</li>
            <li>This is a last resort mascara now and will be thrown away as soon as I feel I&#x27;ve gotten at least a little more of my money out of it.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> They look so perfect that they look like falsies</li>
            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> but they do look the best they have ever been</li>
            <li> Both are awesome!</li>
            <li> But grow luscious is great!</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the cost, it is a perfect dupe.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a volume and quality.</li>
            <li> I havent found the perfect mascara yet...</li>
            <li> I was not that impressed.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and looks beautiful,  </li>
            <li> but i also credit that to a great curler (another revlon product).</li>
            <li> Looks great for about a minute.</li>
            <li> I always finish off my look with a coat of Revlon Grow Luscious mascara, adds great length for a polished look</li>
            <li> This mascara is great.  </li>
            <li> It can clump on occasion but its very nice once applied.</li>
            <li> the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> Anyway, the one I loved before was the falsies by mabelline</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> The formula is good.</li>
            <li> It also does not do a good job of separating lashes.  </li>
            <li> Good price too</li>
            <li> It is priced fairly based on its quality and superior coverage.</li>
            <li> Has a good brush for separating lashes.  </li>
            <li> Still looked good after 9 hours.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that the search for the perfect, cheaply priced mascara is over!</li>
            <li> Eh nothing in this world is perfect right?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Mascara of all time!</li>
            <li> when i first apply it, it looks wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I do not buy anything else any more!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an ok eyelash!</li>
            <li> i love this mascara!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and getting more than what I thought I was getting was an added bonus!  </li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my lashes grow-</li>
            <li> that I have liked</li>
            <li> Full, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I kind of like that.</li>
            <li> I still use this mascara regulary, even though I use many others as well, I don&#x27;t know for sure that this has made my lashes grow, but they do seem more full now, so I know that it does work in that measure, and it is a wonderful mascara as well, I do recommend this!</li>
            <li> for the reason that I love this stuff - my lashes are in better shape than ever!</li>
            <li> So far I still like Maybelline Stiletto Lash the best.</li>
            <li> Really nice, really cheap, really effective mascara.  </li>
            <li> i love this product ,very compact in your bag, it gives your eyes lashes a good and sparkling look good to have one.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but the image is deceiving.  </li>
            <li> There have been so many improvements in mascara brushes that help with the application</li>
            <li> I also love Revlon because they don&#x27;t test their products on animals.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mascara for years but have never found a product I was completely satisfied with until I found this one.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> For years I have used the latest and greatest mascara from Christian Dior- but at $40 a tube</li>
            <li> Better than mascara</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see if my lashes look like a camel&#x27;s after a couple months&#x27; use. :-)</li>
            <li> Love the way it goes on and not bunch up like some of those others.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This is simply the best drugstore mascara out there.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of this brush for top coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find Revlon Grow Luscious Mascra at Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I love the length it gives me.</li>
            <li> I go through so much more eye makeup remover now than I ever did with waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> I did like this product although the &amp;#34;Fabulash Version&amp;#34; is even better</li>
            <li> I noticed the flakeyness from this mascara is more noticeable than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying to apply mascara with different brands, this was the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That was more than a year ago</li>
            <li> They look better even before I use mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Its more of a volumizing one with some lengthening to it.</li>
            <li> I think you have to find your technique :)</li>
            <li> It was ok could of got it from Walmart.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and I just feel more atractive and glamorous when I am using these.  </li>
            <li> A product I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li> times faster than I go thru most.</li>
            <li> I like it so much, but I would like it more if it lasted&lt;br /&gt;longer!!</li>
            <li> I liked the original formula and they&#x27;ve changed it to this one.</li>
            <li> So it makes my eyelashes look nice and full.</li>
            <li> i love this mascara because it&#x27;s not too \\&quot;wet\\&quot; like some others i have tried where they tend to clump the lashes easily.  </li>
            <li> but instead it is curved and can fit eyeshapes better.</li>
            <li> I previously wore Great Lash for years and this one is good too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove and no lashes are pulled off.</li>
            <li> Longer lashes, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it where I shop and Amazon made it easy and convenient to order.</li>
            <li> It has practically no clumps and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day and comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge for me or run easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; or smear easily.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome, I have used too many to name in the past</li>
            <li> The best part is I did get compliments on my lashes a few weeks after I began using it --</li>
            <li> It came out smoothly and coated my lashes evenly, even when I added a couple of coats.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily mascara, I say this because I had realized that after years of using mascara it can break your lashes or seem thinner.</li>
            <li> The brush is big and bristly which is great.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mascara I&#x27;m older and my eyelashes are in need of extra help</li>
            <li> I was excited about this mascara since I&#x27;m up for anything that would help give me thicker or longer lashes.</li>
            <li> It lengthened pretty well, volume was OK.</li>
            <li> The first application was mildly challenging because I was overshooting my lashes with the illustrious brush and globbing mascara on my outer eye.</li>
            <li> Mascara is by far my favorite makeup product, and when i find a mascara i love, i will stick with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to clump if I clean it on the edge of the tube before applying.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly more abundant and long.  </li>
            <li> It makes them appear full</li>
            <li> Although I still have an almost full tube, I have discontinued use.  </li>
            <li> This was an okay mascara for me, didn&#x27;t really do much for my lashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look as full as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> it really does thicken and lengthen my lashes, but mostly thicken.</li>
            <li> this mascara quickly thickens my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Its not one of those super defining mascaras.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;really quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras and this is now my favorite one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high pigmented and it makes my lashes look phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> First off, I feel I have to mention the obnoxiously huge brush/wand for this mascara.</li>
            <li> First, the wand applicator is HUGE.  </li>
            <li> New favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Great product and less than $6 shipped to my door every 3 months?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find a good wand.</li>
            <li> This brush is big, wide and great for thicker longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li> and it rarely smudged or flaked off.</li>
            <li> On a rare occasion I have tried another mascara but return to Revlon.  </li>
            <li> To use it right</li>
            <li> so I  will continue to buy this product as long as it is available for purchase -- I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and i actually prefer this traditional type of brush as opposed to those newer silicone ones because it grabs every lash and separates them beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The brush is big and spreads out your eyelashes when you put the mascara on, so they totally look individually beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is true that the brush is large, but</li>
            <li> My eyes generally get irritated by most mascara but do well with this.</li>
            <li> Especially love the big fat fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> I started noticing my lashes weren&#x27;t as long or full, so I tried many mascaras to help them look fuller.  </li>
            <li> and as the day progresses, there is more and more smugdging, to the point where it really looks like i have dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> So I am happy that this has a classic fluffy mascara wand</li>
            <li> Like when I drew the brush out of the tube for the first time, I thought it had been designed for a camel.  </li>
            <li> My first time trying and would buy again</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, a couple eyelashes would fall out when I would wash my face.</li>
            <li> irritated my eyes and after several attempts to wash it off my eyes were even more irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does curl and extend the lashes well in only one swipe:-)</li>
            <li> but this is pretty close.   </li>
            <li> There are much better mascaras than this one for the same price.</li>
            <li> This is pretty close though, imo.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that when I first tried Grow Luscious</li>
            <li> It seemed to clump coming out of the tube and the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> pretty</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw the advertising for this product, a mascara that actually makes your lashes grow longer!  </li>
            <li> For day, I add a second coat of Grow Luscious and get very nice plush long lashes.  </li>
            <li> If you want a natural (but better than natural) look and stronger healthier lashes, then give this a try.</li>
            <li> Even a cheap brand like Covergirl lash exact is waterproof&lt;br /&gt;but washes off easily enough.</li>
            <li> It looks fine the next day.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> So i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely everything that I was looking for</li>
            <li> and I really feel that they appear so much longer when I wear this.  </li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t buy the promise that this mascara will help my lashes grow longer</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and tried it , and I really like this Mascara.</li>
            <li> Would buy again, now that I have found one I really like.</li>
            <li> A great idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li> one really is a \\&quot;you</li>
            <li> This is a very nurturing product</li>
            <li> but not for people with my eyes haha.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know that this makes them grow, but my lashes are absolutely fuller and longer than they were before.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> and for me really defines your lashes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me in terms of lengthening or thickening.</li>
            <li> The tutorial suggested using 2 mascaras on top of each other, but I didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> a full large brush similar to the older dior..</li>
            <li> Clump free, allergy friendly, does make your lashes grow, good for every day or dramatic look with a few extra layers, comes off easy.</li>
            <li> guess is young kids with limited budgets and lots of time to put on make up and who think \\&quot;more is better\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i remember reading some negative reviews about this mascara clumping up too much, but i personally love the clump!</li>
            <li> Decent mascara by Revlon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> To me it is very similar to the Maybelline Full and Soft mascara which is what i used for YEARS!</li>
            <li> :) I didn&#x27;t buy it with the intent of actually making my natural eyelashes grow, I just bought it to use as a regular mascara.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite mascara, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look long and full, and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have very short non distinct eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my lashes are shaped such that I can get a nice cat-eye effect, but this wand is so large that it&#x27;s impossible to apply mascara more heavily anywhere--not towards the inner eye at those tiny lashes, not in the center where it should be easy, and not even towards the outer lashes where it really ought to be easy to apply more.</li>
            <li> That lets me combine the conditioning of Grow Luscious with the super long lashes look from MAC.  </li>
            <li> The brush is pretty big</li>
            <li> I do shop around for different products pretty often, but this is one I will stick with for awhile.  </li>
            <li> The consistent result is mascara on the lid skin above lashes.</li>
            <li> I really do like this mascara, and I barely ever say that.</li>
            <li> Okay so I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> I first used revlon double lash in the red tube which just seemed like regular mascara, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased expensive mascara from high end stores and this is just as good and doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> When I do wear the Grow Luscious it adds volume and is very natural looking and soft.</li>
            <li> i would suggest the NYC big bold curl mascara its cheaper but has a big brush like this</li>
            <li> WAY too large to do anything with my tiny eyelashes</li>
            <li> I felt confident of my look when I was working hard and had no mirrors.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this is the only one that stays on all day and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> So far I like the Revlon Grow Luscious.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I felt like it did help my lashes be longer after a month or so of using</li>
            <li> Have repurchased three times so far.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my lashes look long and full without clumps...</li>
            <li> It is a true black.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing for thin, short eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Some people have also said that the applicator is way too big; I don&#x27;t really think it is at all, but that may just be personal preference.</li>
            <li> however, in just a couple hours, i see black smudges right underneath the outer corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I love the Black Brown and Black Shimmer.</li>
            <li> I use a smaller, more concentrated brush for my base layers to make sure I avoid clumping and apply even coverage throughout my lashes.</li>
            <li> Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the wand is big that it makes it hard to get all the lashes and makes it easy to get mascara on eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, full  lashes, not super long though.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this also may be due to the fact that I don&#x27;t coat my lower lashes (I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s an unofficial makeup \\&quot;rule\\&quot;, but my eyes are already huge as it is and my eyes just look odd with the lower lashes coated).</li>
            <li> i thought buying the expensive brands were better because of the old adage</li>
            <li> It holds plenty of mascara and even makes this old lady of 70 look like she has long lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look forward to using this one and end up using other, older mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have long lashes, but since using this I have definitely noticed an even fuller/longer apperance to my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I first purchased it a few years ago at Walgreens, and it&#x27;s the only mascara I buy now.</li>
            <li> This is a last resort mascara now and will be thrown away as soon as I feel I&#x27;ve gotten at least a little more of my money out of it.</li>
            <li> A little bit hard to wash off, doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as I would want, but with face wash totally will.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not difficult to remove and doesn&#x27;t get hard and crusty either.  </li>
            <li> They do not last as long as I hoped but they are affordable</li>
            <li> I got the \\&quot;Black Shimmer,\\&quot; but as far as I could tell it didn&#x27;t shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I usually like pretty big wands, but this one has an odd shape and it&#x27;s giant.  </li>
            <li> The brush is excessively large and clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush is HUGE and difficult to manuever, yes it is \\&quot;oversized\\&quot; as it claims, but I don&#x27;t know what they were trying to accomplish by that.</li>
            <li> You name a mascara from cheap to expensive and I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> :) I have dark brown hair/lashes, I use the Black, not Blackest Black (might try that, but I like the look of the Black especially for everyday wear.).</li>
            <li> I have really long lashes and for me to cover fully</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product I had issues with lashes falling out at an alarming rate every time I removed my makeup, but now they grow fuller and stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff either; instead they are still soft to the touch after i apply the mascara.    </li>
            <li> but everytime was the same result, a big mess.</li>
            <li> and normally I like big fluffy brushes, but this one was too stiff for me to work with.</li>
            <li> It has a big round brush with the regular bristles on it</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Loreal Voluminous - Carbon Black for that extra long and chunky lash look.</li>
            <li> I too have slept in it and don&#x27;t wake up with a gross mess all over my eyes #4</li>
            <li> The statements in other reviews about it being difficult to wash off is true.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was a little ambivalent about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the same reason I have yet to give any mascara  stars: it doesn&#x27;t do well on the tiny, thin bottom lashes on the bottom, outer corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> if you have big round eyes i would suggest this.</li>
            <li> The trick is to open it, pull out the brush a couple of times and then put it away for a few days.</li>
            <li> Be careful what you put on your eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> i have small sparse short lashed asian like eyes and the brush was so hard to use and just too big for my eye and my liking.</li>
            <li> Clumpy, inferior quality mascara; dries unevenly and leaves my lashes feeling weighted down and gross...</li>
            <li> Other people have stated that it smudges - I didn&#x27;t notice this at all.</li>
            <li> A true disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other users have had problems with clumps, because personally, I&#x27;ve had zero issues there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to an eye makeup product from another brand, even lash growth products from other brands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid enough attention to my eyelashes to notice a difference - I never had particularly thin or short eyelashes to begin with, though.</li>
            <li> For night, or for extra confidence, I add MAC False Lashes mascara as the final coat.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesnt curve or anything so its hard to work with for smaller eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> brush is enormous and unless your eyes are at least 4 inches in diameter</li>
            <li> This formula may help lashes grow, but the wand ruins application.</li>
            <li> I would have considered keeping a mascara that was lighter in color and thin for really natural looks, but I just can&#x27;t work with it.</li>
            <li> (I hate to waste money) and lo and behold, it was like a whole new product.</li>
            <li> (some version of black...)</li>
            <li> I typically stick with maybeline volumizing masc.</li>
            <li> After a month or so of using it I noticed my lashes are slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> (so I&#x27;m looking for something similar), but this luscious lash is no good.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this mascara quickly thickens my lashes.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Mascara of all time! I watched a tutorial on makeup on Youtube and she recommended it. It holds plenty of mascara and even makes this old lady of 70 look like she has long lashes. The tutorial suggested using 2 mascaras on top of each other, but I didn&#x27;t need to. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but the image is deceiving.  There is hardly any product description and the image leads you to believe you receive two mascara&#x27;s but you only get one.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. The only reason I tried it is because I&#x27;m in the prcess of switching mascaras because the one I was using was tested on animals and I don&#x27;t like that. Anyway, the one I loved before was the falsies by mabelline (so I&#x27;m looking for something similar), but this luscious lash is no good. I bought blackest black, but it looks like dark gray and the mascara itself is really thin. I usually like them thin-medium so I can apply at least 2 coats, but this one doesn&#x27;t look like I put anything on my lashes (except for the fact the all look clumped together at the base). You have to keep layering coats for it to make the slightest difference and then it flakes and clumps really bad without making lashes look much fuller or longer. Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the wand is big that it makes it hard to get all the lashes and makes it easy to get mascara on eyelids.  I usually like pretty big wands, but this one has an odd shape and it&#x27;s giant.  I would have considered keeping a mascara that was lighter in color and thin for really natural looks, but I just can&#x27;t work with it. I&#x27;m not sure if it helps lashes grow because I stopped using it because I hate it. If you want something that helps lashes get fuller, longer and stronger buy rapidlash. Haha good luck if you buy this mascara though.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this mascara since I&#x27;m up for anything that would help give me thicker or longer lashes. I was sorely disappointed when I started using it.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps lengthen or makes my lashes fuller because I can&#x27;t get past the fact that it&#x27;s clumpy when I put it on and the brush is awful.  There have been so many improvements in mascara brushes that help with the application and this one seems like a throw back in technology.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Mascara is by far my favorite makeup product, and when i find a mascara i love, i will stick with it. This will be my 2nd tube since I discovered it. It has a big round brush with the regular bristles on it (i cant stand the plastic bristle wands). So it makes my eyelashes look nice and full. I also love Revlon because they don&#x27;t test their products on animals. So i highly recommend it! To me it is very similar to the Maybelline Full and Soft mascara which is what i used for YEARS! But, i had to switch to Revlon since Maybelline tests on animals.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara. I&#x27;ve been using mascara for years but have never found a product I was completely satisfied with until I found this one. It doesn&#x27;t clump or run, and it makes my eyelashes look longer. They look so perfect that they look like falsies :) I didn&#x27;t buy it with the intent of actually making my natural eyelashes grow, I just bought it to use as a regular mascara. I haven&#x27;t paid enough attention to my eyelashes to notice a difference - I never had particularly thin or short eyelashes to begin with, though. Other people have stated that it smudges - I didn&#x27;t notice this at all. I actually noticed that it&#x27;s a little difficult to get it off with my makeup remover pads (and I didn&#x27;t get the waterproof version). I am definitely guilty of falling asleep with makeup on, and I haven&#x27;t yet woken up with big black circles under my eyes from this mascara. Keep in mind that this also may be due to the fact that I don&#x27;t coat my lower lashes (I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s an unofficial makeup \\&quot;rule\\&quot;, but my eyes are already huge as it is and my eyes just look odd with the lower lashes coated). It looks fine the next day. Some people have also said that the applicator is way too big; I don&#x27;t really think it is at all, but that may just be personal preference. It is absolutely everything that I was looking for and I&#x27;m so glad that the search for the perfect, cheaply priced mascara is over!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump or run. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the same reason I have yet to give any mascara  stars: it doesn&#x27;t do well on the tiny, thin bottom lashes on the bottom, outer corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really nice, really cheap, really effective mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, flake, smear or smudge and it separates my lashes and makes them look legitimately fuller.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty big and normally I like big fluffy brushes, but this one was too stiff for me to work with. The worst part of this mascara was not it&#x27;s performance. It lengthened pretty well, volume was OK. The worst part was that this formula caused my eyes to burn and water. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I would say this mascara is no better than any other.  The brush is HUGE and difficult to manuever, yes it is \\&quot;oversized\\&quot; as it claims, but I don&#x27;t know what they were trying to accomplish by that. While trying to get my outer lashes I would hit my cheekbones with it. I got the \\&quot;Black Shimmer,\\&quot; but as far as I could tell it didn&#x27;t shimmer.  I was expecting some extra shine or something, but there was nothing noticeable until I took it off and looked on my cotton pad.  It looked like different colored glitter there.  But I couldn&#x27;t see it when it was on my lashes. If I knew it was just some glitter I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tube was greenish, not this aqua color, and it was not waterproof, and as this one does not state it is waterproof, I&#x27;m listing my review under it. So far I still like Maybelline Stiletto Lash the best.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I curl my eyelashes and then apply this. It is amazing for thin, short eyelashes! It makes them appear full and I really feel that they appear so much longer when I wear this.  Great product and less than $6 shipped to my door every 3 months? Perfect.</li>
            <li> i thought buying the expensive brands were better because of the old adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; but this isn&#x27;t the case here.  i love this mascara because it&#x27;s not too \\&quot;wet\\&quot; like some others i have tried where they tend to clump the lashes easily.  and i actually prefer this traditional type of brush as opposed to those newer silicone ones because it grabs every lash and separates them beautifully.  i really don&#x27;t buy the promise that this mascara will help my lashes grow longer but they do look the best they have ever been but i also credit that to a great curler (another revlon product).</li>
            <li> when i first apply it, it looks wonderful.  it&#x27;s high pigmented and it makes my lashes look phenomenal.  it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff either; instead they are still soft to the touch after i apply the mascara.    however, in just a couple hours, i see black smudges right underneath the outer corners of my eyes.  and as the day progresses, there is more and more smugdging, to the point where it really looks like i have dark circles underneath my eyes. &#x3D;( i tried applying powder underneath my eyes to stop the smudging, but it doesn&#x27;t work. the mascara still gets all over.   if you are looking for a long-lasting mascara, you don&#x27;t want this mascara.      i really, really wanted to like this formula because how it looks in the early hours of my day; however, i absolutely hate smudging!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite mascara, and I have tried quite a few. It makes my lashes look long and full, and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I do shop around for different products pretty often, but this is one I will stick with for awhile.  I was noticing my lashes getting thinner before, and now on my 2nd tube of Grow Luscious, I can say they seem thicker rather than thinner.  I tend to sleep in my makeup and wash it off after my morning workout, and can say this mascara stays on until I wash it off.  But, it&#x27;s not difficult to remove and doesn&#x27;t get hard and crusty either.  My routine is layering -- Hard Candy 1000 Lashes primer, then Grow Luscious.  For day, I add a second coat of Grow Luscious and get very nice plush long lashes.  For night, or for extra confidence, I add MAC False Lashes mascara as the final coat.  That lets me combine the conditioning of Grow Luscious with the super long lashes look from MAC.  Both are awesome!</li>
            <li> This is awesome, I have used too many to name in the past and I found this one about 5 months ago and its the only time I have went back to the same one... Love it!</li>
            <li> For years I have used the latest and greatest mascara from Christian Dior- but at $40 a tube every 3 months(the recommended max time period for keeping used mascara) I needed to find an alternate.. I first used revlon double lash in the red tube which just seemed like regular mascara, nothing special. But grow luscious is great! Dare I say- COMPARABLE!!! Honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my lashes grow- but the pros are #1 a full large brush similar to the older dior.. #2 mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off #3 I too have slept in it and don&#x27;t wake up with a gross mess all over my eyes #4 the price is amazing! I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> I just receive it, and not open it yet. I plan to give my friend, I hope she would like it.</li>
            <li> Holy crap!!!!!!!! Better than mascara I paid pver $40 for</li>
            <li> Initially I was a little ambivalent about this mascara.  Like when I drew the brush out of the tube for the first time, I thought it had been designed for a camel.  The first application was mildly challenging because I was overshooting my lashes with the illustrious brush and globbing mascara on my outer eye. However, I persevered and managed to nail the application.  The test for me was:  Does this stuff flake? It does not flake. My lashes do take on a fuller look, replete with serious pigment power. (some version of black...) I had to give this a chance because it is a different formula than I am accustomed to.  Bottom line:  I like it.  Let&#x27;s see if my lashes look like a camel&#x27;s after a couple months&#x27; use. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this product and tried it , and I really like this Mascara. I have not found one yet that I have liked but this is it, Love the way it goes on and not bunch up like some of those others. and I would recommend it to anyone. Would buy again, now that I have found one I really like.</li>
            <li> Got this bad boy on subscription! Love this mascara. The formula is good. Doesn&#x27;t clump. Especially love the big fat fluffy brush. It&#x27;s getting harder to find a good wand. Hate the rubber spiky ones the companies are going to. So I am happy that this has a classic fluffy mascara wand</li>
            <li> I like my lashes long and thick and this does the trick. My first time trying and would buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for about 6 weeks and I absolutely love it.  Not only does it make my lashes look long and full without clumps...but my lashes have actually benefitted from this formula and have grown quite a bit.  I used to have short lashes and now friends and family have even noticed the change.  If you are  looking for something that will actually change your lashes, this mascara is for you!</li>
            <li> I had always used Maybeline Big Lash, but tried this product because the Maybeline was clumping and I feared I was losing lashes, trying to remove it. So far I like the Revlon Grow Luscious. Sticks well to your lashes, but doesn&#x27;t clump as bad, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m losing lashes in the removal process.</li>
            <li> First off, I feel I have to mention the obnoxiously huge brush/wand for this mascara. It&#x27;s so big that its hard to maneuver and is impossible to get to the small lashes with. The formula itself is goupy and thick. It dries practically instantly, clumps and made my eyelashes stick together. I tried using it several times to try and get it to cooperate but everytime was the same result, a big mess. It was awful looking, like a little girl learning to put on mascara. This product is definitely a no go. Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> This product extends your lashes and it comes off with a regular face cleaner. It is easy to remove and no lashes are pulled off. I have tried other products but this is the only one that stays on all day and comes off easily. It does not cause lashes to fall out. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw the advertising for this product, a mascara that actually makes your lashes grow longer!  I purchased, and have to say I only used it a couple of times, although I keep wanting to try it again because of the promises.  First, the wand applicator is HUGE.  WAY too large to do anything with my tiny eyelashes, I constantly bump my lids, smearing the mascara onto my skin.  It also does not do a good job of separating lashes.  Whoever designed the wand applicator should be fired.  Next, this mascara flakes off throughout the day.  I notice a bunch of flakes beneath my eyes by lunchtime and smears of color throughout the day.  Although I still have an almost full tube, I have discontinued use.  A great idea, poor execution.</li>
            <li> Looks great for about a minute. It flakes horribly and smudges. If you wear contacts, this isn&#x27;t the mascara for you. I liked the original formula and they&#x27;ve changed it to this one. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best drugstore mascara out there. Full, beautiful lashes. I used to use Mac&#x27;s Opulash. At a fraction of the cost, it is a perfect dupe.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! When I first started using it, a couple eyelashes would fall out when I would wash my face.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> New favorite mascara. I have really long lashes and for me to cover fully I usually end up with clumps from other products. I typically stick with maybeline volumizing masc. This brush is big, wide and great for thicker longer eyelashes! Good price too</li>
            <li> You name a mascara from cheap to expensive and I&#x27;ve tried it. The stuff is some of the most awful I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is enormous and unless your eyes are at least 4 inches in diameter you&#x27;re going to have a hard time&lt;br /&gt;only applying it to your lashes and not the rest of your upper face. And it gets worse....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t wash off. Not even with plenty of soap. Even a cheap brand like Covergirl lash exact is waterproof&lt;br /&gt;but washes off easily enough. I&#x27;m not sure why this revlon won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible product and after one use it&#x27;s going in the garbage. At least it didn&#x27;t cost a lot but still, who likes&lt;br /&gt;wasting money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one really is a \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; thing. I am amazed at all the 5 star reviews. Just amazed. This product is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;It irritated my eyes and after several attempts to wash it off my eyes were even more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is young kids with limited budgets and lots of time to put on make up and who think \\&quot;more is better\\&quot; are giving it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean any offense by that.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of this brush for top coat of mascara. I use a smaller, more concentrated brush for my base layers to make sure I avoid clumping and apply even coverage throughout my lashes. I always finish off my look with a coat of Revlon Grow Luscious mascara, adds great length for a polished look</li>
            <li> second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.  I&#x27;ve purchased expensive mascara from high end stores and this is just as good and doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> My favorit mascara. Longer lashes, easy to remove. Excellent price for a volume and quality. I do not buy anything else any more!</li>
            <li> I was glad to find Revlon Grow Luscious Mascra at Amazon. I am 66 and noticed my lashes were quite frankly disappearing. I use this product and it works for me. I couldn&#x27;t find it where I shop and Amazon made it easy and convenient to order. I</li>
            <li> My eyes generally get irritated by most mascara but do well with this. I previously wore Great Lash for years and this one is good too. Does curl and extend the lashes well in only one swipe:-) Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Decent mascara by Revlon. It&#x27;s a little clumpy for my liking, but does the job. I usually use it as my backup mascara to carry around in my purse when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes. Doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mascara I&#x27;m older and my eyelashes are in need of extra help this product seems to be doing just that. I will continue to buy this and would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This formula may help lashes grow, but the wand ruins application. It is a large, awkward wand. Normally, my lashes are shaped such that I can get a nice cat-eye effect, but this wand is so large that it&#x27;s impossible to apply mascara more heavily anywhere--not towards the inner eye at those tiny lashes, not in the center where it should be easy, and not even towards the outer lashes where it really ought to be easy to apply more. The consistent result is mascara on the lid skin above lashes. As said, this formula may help lashes grow, but that only works if you can actually get it on your lashes and want to apply it each day.  I don&#x27;t look forward to using this one and end up using other, older mascaras.  This is a last resort mascara now and will be thrown away as soon as I feel I&#x27;ve gotten at least a little more of my money out of it.</li>
            <li> This is a shockingly terrible product! I look like a raccoon from the smears under my eyes! I expect a mascara that is labeled waterproof to be smearproof; this is not! The brush is excessively large and clumsy to use. I won&#x27;t even address the &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; part. A true disappointment.</li>
            <li> I havent found the perfect mascara yet...its kinda like searching for the \\&quot;one\\&quot;...but this is pretty close.   Clump free, allergy friendly, does make your lashes grow, good for every day or dramatic look with a few extra layers, comes off easy. It does tend to smudge a little, even the waterproof one, when you are working out or are exposed to moisture. The best part is I did get compliments on my lashes a few weeks after I began using it -- so I think it does work.</li>
            <li> Who likes crunchy eyelashes? Not me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other users have had problems with clumps, because personally, I&#x27;ve had zero issues there. Prior to purchasing this product I had issues with lashes falling out at an alarming rate every time I removed my makeup, but now they grow fuller and stronger than ever. This is a very nurturing product and I love the length it gives me.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the lengthening lashes claim of this product, but I decided to pick it up at Wal Mart because it seemed healthier and I wanted to give it a try. I was surprised I felt like it did help my lashes be longer after a month or so of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all I like the look of it, it lengthens and thickens my lashes without clumping and I wore it working in 100+ degree weather on a film set and it rarely smudged or flaked off. I felt confident of my look when I was working hard and had no mirrors. :) I have dark brown hair/lashes, I use the Black, not Blackest Black (might try that, but I like the look of the Black especially for everyday wear.).</li>
            <li> I like this. It can clump on occasion but its very nice once applied.</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely a waste of money. I literally put mine in the trash after three days. It clumps, flakes, and creates the \\&quot;spider\\&quot; effect. Also, it was nearly impossible to remove. The skin around my eyes is red and irritated from trying to remove this mascara, and it still isn&#x27;t off. There are much better mascaras than this one for the same price.</li>
            <li> A mi esposa le encanto este regalo que le hice, lo usa todos los dias y es muy practico porque lo lleva donde ella va.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these mascara&#x27;s and when they arrived it was two per package.  I ended up with four mascara&#x27;s for the price I would have paid for one in the store.  This is an amazing product and getting more than what I thought I was getting was an added bonus!  I will definitely order from here again.</li>
            <li> I used Revlon Grow Luscious eyeliner in black, green and the Grow Luscious Mascara in black two times each, and I got a severe allergic reaction. My eyes swelled to double it&#x27;s size each time and was in severe pain and itched for three days each time. Eye allergy drops or a compress didn&#x27;t help at all. I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to an eye makeup product from another brand, even lash growth products from other brands. I&#x27;m very disappointed as I spent over $30 on these products and was in extreme discomfort. I will not be purchasing Revlon Eye products again, and urge others not to purchase the grow luscious line either.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a mascara I like.  I started noticing my lashes weren&#x27;t as long or full, so I tried many mascaras to help them look fuller.  I finally tried this one and I will never go back to another.  After a month or so of using it I noticed my lashes are slightly longer.  Not dramatically, but enough to notice.  I don&#x27;t find it to clump if I clean it on the edge of the tube before applying.  The statements in other reviews about it being difficult to wash off is true.  I go through so much more eye makeup remover now than I ever did with waterproof mascara.  That won&#x27;t stop me from using this mascara though.  Eh nothing in this world is perfect right? This is pretty close though, imo.</li>
            <li> I really do like this mascara, and I barely ever say that. A little bit hard to wash off, doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as I would want, but with face wash totally will. The brush is big and spreads out your eyelashes when you put the mascara on, so they totally look individually beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have very short non distinct eyelashes.  This product enhanced my eyelashes, both in length and color.  I did like this product although the &amp;#34;Fabulash Version&amp;#34; is even better but I could not find that item on your website.</li>
            <li> I still use this mascara regulary, even though I use many others as well, I don&#x27;t know for sure that this has made my lashes grow, but they do seem more full now, so I know that it does work in that measure, and it is a wonderful mascara as well, I do recommend this!</li>
            <li> i have small sparse short lashed asian like eyes and the brush was so hard to use and just too big for my eye and my liking. if you have big round eyes i would suggest this. but not for people with my eyes haha. The brush doesnt curve or anything so its hard to work with for smaller eyes. i would suggest the NYC big bold curl mascara its cheaper but has a big brush like this but instead it is curved and can fit eyeshapes better. I noticed the flakeyness from this mascara is more noticeable than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;irritation was from flaking.</li>
            <li> i love this product ,very compact in your bag, it gives your eyes lashes a good and sparkling look good to have one.</li>
            <li> Clumpy, inferior quality mascara; dries unevenly and leaves my lashes feeling weighted down and gross... Do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> After trying to apply mascara with different brands, this was the best.  It has practically no clumps and is easy to apply.  It&#x27;s even better than the Sephora brand, which was so expensive and clumpy like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all, at all, at all, at all.  Do not buy this item if you want to grow your lashes.</li>
            <li> Makeup products are one of the hardest things to review since what works for one person doesn&#x27;t work for another. I have to admit that when I first tried Grow Luscious I was not that impressed. It seemed to clump coming out of the tube and the first couple of times I used it I really hated the results. In fact, I stuck it in my makeup drawer and decided not to use it at all. After about a week I decided I&#x27;d try it again (I hate to waste money) and lo and behold, it was like a whole new product. It came out smoothly and coated my lashes evenly, even when I added a couple of coats. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was more than a year ago and I have bought several tubes of this. Every tube starts out clumpy. The trick is to open it, pull out the brush a couple of times and then put it away for a few days. I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it always does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the reason that I love this stuff - my lashes are in better shape than ever! I really don&#x27;t know that this makes them grow, but my lashes are absolutely fuller and longer than they were before. They look better even before I use mascara. When I do wear the Grow Luscious it adds volume and is very natural looking and soft. It stays on all day and comes off easily with makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t flake off, and I don&#x27;t pull my lashes out trying to get it off. It is true that the brush is large, but I kind of like that. If you don&#x27;t, keep in mind that you can always get disposable mascara wands (they sell them here on Amazon) pretty cheaply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, mascara is a very personal and individual item. If you&#x27;re looking for outrageous fake looking eyelashes this won&#x27;t work. If you want a natural (but better than natural) look and stronger healthier lashes, then give this a try.</li>
            <li> Now I have this, I will never go back!! I have decided to have it shipped every 3 months.Stays on all day and looks beautiful,  It  plumps up lashed I didn&#x27;t know I had. Love it (and it is priced so well)</li>
            <li> I always use Revlon mascara.  On a rare occasion I have tried another mascara but return to Revlon.  It is priced fairly based on its quality and superior coverage.</li>
            <li> It gives me both length and volume. I didn&#x27;t think that it would do anything to grow my lashes but I was wrong.  They are slightly more abundant and long.  I do not find any flaking or smudging with this mascara.  Have repurchased three times so far.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara now. I first purchased it a few years ago at Walgreens, and it&#x27;s the only mascara I buy now.</li>
            <li> This was an okay mascara for me, didn&#x27;t really do much for my lashes. May work well for others, but did nothing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for about 2+ years now. This is a great daily mascara, I say this because I had realized that after years of using mascara it can break your lashes or seem thinner. So I was looking for something to maintain mine. I have curly, full  lashes, not super long though. This mascara doesn&#x27;t harden and stiffen then. It doesn&#x27;t smudge for me or run easily. I use about  2-3 coats. I love the Black Brown and Black Shimmer. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. The brush is big and bristly which is great. Its not one of those super defining mascaras. Its more of a volumizing one with some lengthening to it. To use it right I think you have to find your technique :) Cheers.</li>
            <li> It was ok could of got it from Walmart. Same price</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and I just feel more atractive and glamorous when I am using these.  They do not last as long as I hoped but they are affordable so all is well.</li>
            <li> A product I have been using for many years.  Reasonably priced.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; or smear easily.  Enough to last for months.  It is a true black.  Has a good brush for separating lashes.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34;.  As recommended with any mascara, discard it after 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> This product is by no means waterproof.  I have also not noticed any growth in my lashes and I&#x27;ves used it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I use it in combination with Loreal Voluminous - Carbon Black for that extra long and chunky lash look. I naturally have long lashes, but since using this I have definitely noticed an even fuller/longer apperance to my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an ok eyelash!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look as full as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> mascara absorbs into the blood stream!!!!! Be careful what you put on your eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;This mascara dries your skin underneath the eyes out big time!</li>
            <li> i love this mascara! i remember reading some negative reviews about this mascara clumping up too much, but i personally love the clump! haha it really does thicken and lengthen my lashes, but mostly thicken.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara! It lengthens and give volume to your&lt;br /&gt;lashes and for me really defines your lashes. The only reason&lt;br /&gt;I gave this stuff 4 in stead of 5 stars is because it runs out&lt;br /&gt;really quickly. I am not sure why, I have gone thru this mascara&lt;br /&gt;3 times faster than I go thru most. I keep buying it anyway&lt;br /&gt;because I like it so much, but I would like it more if it lasted&lt;br /&gt;longer!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great.  It doesn&#x27;t clunk. The only problem is the brush is too big. The mascara didn&#x27;t smear on me at all and I wore it all day.  Still looked good after 9 hours.</li>
            <li> Okay so I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I just had to for this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras and this is now my favorite one. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I&#x27;m already seeing results. This is now going to be my mascara. This is without curling them!</li>
            <li> Have used Revlon&#x27;s Grow Luscious for several years and do believe this product has helped my lashes grow longer and last longer when using this product -- so I  will continue to buy this product as long as it is available for purchase -- I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> bueno esto fue un regalo para mi cuñada no me ha dicho nada al respecto, aparantemente le gusto al menos parece que lo esta usando bastante</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me in terms of lengthening or thickening.</li>
