            <li>Very pretty with an antique feel!</li>
            <li>They are a perfect size for a little accent in the hair.  </li>
            <li>These would be best used with medium or longer hair, to pin back large sections of hair.  </li>
            <li>However, a few adjustments during the day and they still work great!</li>
            <li>these add a touch to a twist and are great just to get the hair back from my face.  </li>
            <li>quite pretty not to over the top</li>
            <li>Strong and doesn&#x27;t get caught between hairs if you wear it right.</li>
            <li>Has a very vintage, sexy look.  </li>
            <li>One of the gems did fall off, but i hot glue-gunned it, and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty to accent a bun or chignon.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Bummer, because they would be really pretty if they weren&#x27;t so cheaply made.</li>
            <li>i got these fairly cheap and its a good enough classic type of decorations for the hair especially for a party.</li>
            <li>elegant but not too big!</li>
            <li>So pretty</li>
            <li>Today the pretty filigree part broke away from the pin.  </li>
            <li>A bit larger than I thought they would be but relieved that they are good quality and look like they will last.</li>
            <li>sturdy, pretty, and the perfect accessory for an awkward stage pixie cut.</li>
            <li>They are strong solid pins</li>

            <li>highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>much nicer than anything I purchased at Ulta or Claire&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Simple, yet something unique...</li>
            <li>I was really quite surprised at how pretty these bobby pins were.  </li>
            <li>Have received tons of compliments on these beautiful pins, but the one drawback is that the ridges are on the wrong side.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes</li>
            <li>Still great flair, but flawed.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of growing out a very short pixie haircut and wanted some fun bobby pins to keep some of the outgrowth under control.  </li>
            <li>I think that these are very pretty and old fashioned at the same time.</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are very pretty but a little on the large size for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Much better quality than I was expecting, nice and heavy real metal, no prongs or sharp edges to catch in your hair randomly.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty and a bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>They hold pretty tightly as well.</li>
            <li>they are pretty but one of the flowers is welded on uneven nothing that you will notice unless you look.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful - a tiny bit heavy for thin hair, but the clip part is tight so it stays in place well.  </li>

            <li> Bought these for my 6 year old little girl.  </li>
            <li> These silver bobby pins are about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> and I think they look much more expensive in person!  </li>
            <li> The round attachments are bigger than I thought.  </li>
            <li> I still use the other though wish I had both.</li>
            <li> My only issue is they are very stiff and hard to open to clip in your hair.</li>
            <li> One of the pins arrived with it&#x27;s center stone missing.</li>
            <li> I really like them and now only have one usable Bobby pin!! :(</li>
            <li> They are a bit heavy on one end and tend to slip.  </li>
            <li> A bit heavy, fall out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wear these to dress up my everyday and work attire.</li>
            <li> When I try to use them to hold a small section of my bangs off to the side, the heaviness of the filigree decoration causes the pin to slide down.</li>
            <li> have a shorter hair cut, so it&#x27;s difficult to find a spot with enough hair for one of the pins to stay put.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and theses babies hold my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> I lost one unfortunately but the other I wear often.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, these pins may not be for you.</li>
            <li> They stay tight in your hair, and do not fall out !!!!</li>
            <li> Not impressive!</li>
            <li> However, they were packed horribly and arrived broken!  </li>

            <li> I thought it was a gold color and it isn&#x27;t,quality good.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 6 year old little girl.  She loves to wear them in her hair and feels very pretty!  I would buy them again.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Used them for our wedding. elegant but not too big!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and stylish.  Whether you are going for a retro or renaissance look, this pair of Bobbie pins will work for you.  They hold and stay in my hair all day.love them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute, decorative and do the job.</li>
            <li> I think that these are very pretty and old fashioned at the same time. The Bobby pin is taut and stays where you put it.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought these to add to my collection of hair ornaments (I tend to go for the more ornate looking ones, lol). Much better quality than I was expecting, nice and heavy real metal, no prongs or sharp edges to catch in your hair randomly. They hold pretty tightly as well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll still give these pins 5 stars because they are beautiful. Not too big or showy for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a shorter hair cut, so it&#x27;s difficult to find a spot with enough hair for one of the pins to stay put. If you have thin hair, these pins may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I have purchased pins and barrettes the last several months to fix my now-longer hair. These fasteners are just lovely. They are perfect for elegant evening wear and for the modern hippie style that I also love.</li>
            <li> They look excellent in light brown hair.  They are a bit heavy on one end and tend to slip.  However, a few adjustments during the day and they still work great!</li>
            <li> I use these pins to keep my prayer veil on.  They do not distract from wearing one, and it does add a nice touch to it. They stay tight in your hair, and do not fall out !!!!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, and will recommend to buy. Just one thing it is a bit too big on my test, anyway I like it.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy, fall out of my hair.  Others might not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty to accent a bun or chignon.  I&#x27;ve had them quite a while and they haven&#x27;t discolored or lost stones.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. A bit larger than I thought they would be but relieved that they are good quality and look like they will last.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as picture.  The round attachments are bigger than I thought.  They are well made.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful - a tiny bit heavy for thin hair, but the clip part is tight so it stays in place well.  Has a very vintage, sexy look.  Used them in my up-do for wedding.</li>
            <li> These silver bobby pins are about 2 inches long. Each filigree decoration is 1 inch in diameter. Very pretty with an antique feel!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and a bit bigger than I expected. My only issue is they are very stiff and hard to open to clip in your hair.</li>
            <li> One of the pins arrived with it&#x27;s center stone missing. Bummer, because they would be really pretty if they weren&#x27;t so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These are nicer than the picture!  I wore them for a wedding and they were absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> these add a touch to a twist and are great just to get the hair back from my face.  quite pretty not to over the top</li>
            <li> So pretty and I had high hopes but the flower broke off one! I still use the other though wish I had both.</li>
            <li> nice prompt delivery but when i opened the package the two hair accessories are the same design and size but two noticabley different colors. they are pretty but one of the flowers is welded on uneven nothing that you will notice unless you look. i wont send them back because i dont want to fool with it.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful Bobby Pins!  Look better than the ad!  However, they were packed horribly and arrived broken!  Not impressive!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of growing out a very short pixie haircut and wanted some fun bobby pins to keep some of the outgrowth under control.  These bobby pins are very pretty but a little on the large size for my needs.  These would be best used with medium or longer hair, to pin back large sections of hair.  When I try to use them to hold a small section of my bangs off to the side, the heaviness of the filigree decoration causes the pin to slide down.</li>
            <li> beautiful pin. Strong and doesn&#x27;t get caught between hairs if you wear it right. I enjoy putting these pins to puy my bangs away and this one holds it well and looks very elegant. Love it.</li>
            <li> They are so darn cute!!!! I just recieved them todaty and I can not wait to wait them!! I&#x27;d recommend them to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I now how have used these Bobby pins twice.  Today the pretty filigree part broke away from the pin.  What a shame!!! I really like them and now only have one usable Bobby pin!! :(</li>
            <li> Have received tons of compliments on these beautiful pins, but the one drawback is that the ridges are on the wrong side. They need to be secured crosswise with regular bobby pins. Still great flair, but flawed.</li>
            <li> very pretty - the wife loved them.  They are a perfect size for a little accent in the hair.  She wears them all the time.  One of the gems did fall off, but i hot glue-gunned it, and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li> These clips are very very beautiful, just like the picture! They hold my hair well and are lovely accessories :)</li>
            <li> i got these fairly cheap and its a good enough classic type of decorations for the hair especially for a party.</li>
            <li> I lost one unfortunately but the other I wear often. sturdy, pretty, and the perfect accessory for an awkward stage pixie cut.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous. I wear these to dress up my everyday and work attire. I have thick wavy hair, and theses babies hold my hair in place all day. I might even buy more!</li>
