            <li>It&#x27;s also fairly long-lasting since it&#x27;s French-milled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective at removing makeup and the scent is so refreshing and enlivening.</li>
            <li>what is there not to love ?!?</li>

            <li>It has a great fragrance without being too strong.  </li>
            <li>Really, really, nice soap.</li>
            <li>this soap is part of a gift but the scent through the paper smells really nice...</li>
            <li>We both liked the scent.</li>
            <li>It is good quality soap, it is just that for a price tag of $12 per bar I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>A strong eucalyptus aroma will pleasantly wake you up every morning.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and calm aroma.</li>
            <li>Whatever the scent, it&#x27;s happy and full of life.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s also great to shower with, but I keep an unused bar just for the fresh scent in my gym bag.)</li>
            <li>This is excellent soap, sold nowhere near to me for convenient shopping in person.  </li>
            <li>the bathroom smells great and it feels so good on your skin yet not harsh</li>
            <li>A medium to full lather will enable optimum cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shower soap.</li>
            <li>We find that unlike statement made by another the bar is durable; lasts many tens of showers.</li>
            <li>My honey and I usually love all of the Thymes products.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things...</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice light smell but no deposits on your skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of her favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>Scent is a mellow eucalyptus - fantastic in the morning!</li>
            <li>it and enjoy!</li>
            <li>but regardless, I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this soap for the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean scent and get many comments about how nice my perfume(?) smells.</li>
            <li>Smells so refreshing and clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the difference could be ordering it from Amazon as opposed to directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s site, but I read reviews of the product at the manufacturer&#x27;s site and found no one else experienced this issue.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely unique scent.</li>
            <li>and I would be fine.</li>
            <li>Super large and smells so good and clean.</li>
            <li>We stayed at the inn where this product was available to their guests.</li>
            <li>and they told us it was available from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The soap is nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh smell of Eucalyptus!  </li>
            <li>This soap has a rich lather that I like.</li>
            <li>A fresh light scent, that lathers easily and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s invigorating aroma leaves me feeling clean and renewed.</li>
            <li>Great soap, esp for the winter months when skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li>Washes off cleanly, leaves no soap film or residue on skin.</li>
            <li>This is often sold out in our local stores, so it is good to have it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fine product: lathers well, feels good on body, aroma pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend really liked this soap, and she&#x27;s sensitive to a lot of things.</li>
            <li>The bar seemed to last a good while.</li>
            <li>This soap has the most wonderful fresh smell, and the bar lasts a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>I think if it could deliver more aroma or have a bigger size to compensate I would rate it better.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you love Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>we love it too much to live without it.</li>
            <li>Even tho the smell of it is interesting and new you get used to it</li>
            <li>It has the most lovely fragrance which you can smell long after your shower.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the $--just</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrant scent, gentle cleanse with no residue, lasts far longer than other soaps....</li>
            <li>Overpriced, and you&#x27;ll rip right through it</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for a bar of soap, but worth it because it&#x27;s so large and</li>
            <li>More like Irish Spring on steroids.</li>
            <li>I think my husband would love it actually...</li>
            <li>I was willing to share it, and I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>keep it out of the line of fire of the shower spray or it WILL melt fast!</li>
            <li>This is the first time she&#x27;s used the soap</li>
            <li>It lasts a very long time which makes the price worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of  Eucalyptus,soup meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So much so that she wanted some for our home.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love Thymes products, but this particular soap arrives as a huge bar packaged in a plastic cover inside the cardboard box, and after 1 shower it is less than half of the original size, and it lasts exactly 3 showers until it&#x27;s completely dissolved!</li>
            <li>While the smell doesn&#x27;t really last long on your skin, your bathroom will smell amazing.</li>
            <li>At first I thought, ok maybe it was a fluke with the first bar, but the exact same thing happened with the 2nd one in Eucalyptus, AND the 3rd one which was Lavender.</li>
            <li>This price was good, especially since I cut the bar in half and use it for face soap.</li>
            <li>is cheap when considering how long it lasts</li>
            <li>this big should last a long time, and other bar soaps I&#x27;ve purchased from Thymes have been awesome and lasted weeks.</li>
            <li>Better than other \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; eucalyptus bars by far.</li>
            <li>Works really well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It came on time and it&#x27;s my favorite soap, the scent last all day long</li>
            <li>But I live how it cleans and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is a very large bar and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I know it cost a little but close your eyes and let the smell take you in to a place of calm and peace!</li>
            <li>Sometimes a little luxury is so worth it!</li>
            <li>Yes, it does melt a little faster and it is a little pricey, but I do love it!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, not dry.</li>
            <li>I got 3 bars at once (2 Eucalyptus and 1 Lavender), because I have gotten tons of other Thymes products in the past directly from their site (though not this glycerine bar), and this particular soap happened to be significantly cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am sold on Thymes Glycerine Bar Soap and give it a 5 star because we live in a very dry climate</li>

            <li> I am sold on Thymes Glycerine Bar Soap and give it a 5 star because we live in a very dry climate</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a long time and the scent remains until the very last sliver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that said it didn&#x27;t last long, but if it is kept on a ridged soap dish, it is very&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as eucalyptus-y as you&#x27;d think because it&#x27;s layered with Italian citrus and petitgrain (distilled from the leaves and twigs of the bitter orange plant).</li>
            <li> Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time,much longer than non glycerine soaps&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Helps prevent rashes in summer and prevents dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> I am a soap aficionado, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, this soap delivers aroma, wakes me up in the morning, leaves my skin clean, and if you take care of it it will not turn into soup.</li>
            <li> and I feel like the Glycerine soap cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as other soaps.  </li>
            <li> not as fragrant as I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey although it appears to last longer than other bars of soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using thymes eucalyptus soap and other products for years.  </li>
            <li> I have dropped the soap numerous times but the soap hasn&#x27;t broken in pieces like some reviewers have stated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sitting in water in my shower either, but as soon as any water from the shower head hits it in the (vented) soap dish, it&#x27;s just about game over!</li>
            <li> What a stupid waste of money, a bar</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s fairly expensive</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

It&#x27;s not sitting in water in my shower either, but as soon as any water from the shower head hits it in the (vented) soap dish, it&#x27;s just about game over! I got 3 bars at once (2 Eucalyptus and 1 Lavender), because I have gotten tons of other Thymes products in the past directly from their site (though not this glycerine bar), and this particular soap happened to be significantly cheaper at Amazon. At first I thought, ok maybe it was a fluke with the first bar, but the exact same thing happened with the 2nd one in Eucalyptus, AND the 3rd one which was Lavender. What a stupid waste of money, a bar this big should last a long time, and other bar soaps I&#x27;ve purchased from Thymes have been awesome and lasted weeks. I don&#x27;t know what the difference could be ordering it from Amazon as opposed to directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s site, but I read reviews of the product at the manufacturer&#x27;s site and found no one else experienced this issue. I&#x27;m not even going to try ordering the same product from anywhere ever again, though.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does melt a little faster and it is a little pricey, but I do love it! Sometimes a little luxury is so worth it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shower soap. It&#x27;s invigorating aroma leaves me feeling clean and renewed. It&#x27;s a staple in my home.</li>
            <li> not as fragrant as I expected.</li>
            <li> Fine product: lathers well, feels good on body, aroma pleasant and long lasting. We find that unlike statement made by another the bar is durable; lasts many tens of showers. Have bought for years. Better than other \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; eucalyptus bars by far.</li>
            <li> This soap has the most wonderful fresh smell, and the bar lasts a long, long time.  When I cleanse with this soap and follow it with the matching lotion, I get lots of compliments on my scent.  I&#x27;ve recently added the perfume as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  The fragrance is great.</li>
            <li> I keep an unused bar of this soap in my gym bag to keep my clothes smelling great. (It&#x27;s also great to shower with, but I keep an unused bar just for the fresh scent in my gym bag.)</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrant scent, gentle cleanse with no residue, lasts far longer than other soaps....what is there not to love ?!?</li>
            <li> I have been using thymes eucalyptus soap and other products for years.  I love the clean scent and get many comments about how nice my perfume(?) smells.</li>
            <li> This is excellent soap, sold nowhere near to me for convenient shopping in person.  we love it too much to live without it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and calm aroma. It lasts a very long time which makes the price worthwhile. I have bought it before and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Eucalyptus. More like Irish Spring on steroids.</li>
            <li> Smells so refreshing and clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years...love it.  This holiday I&#x27;m giving a bar to my sister.  This price was good, especially since I cut the bar in half and use it for face soap.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap smells wonderful! And the scent remains with you throughout the day. It&#x27;s a little pricey although it appears to last longer than other bars of soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!! Even tho the smell of it is interesting and new you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. But I live how it cleans and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. If I use this soap I don&#x27;t have to use lotion and I would be fine. Really happy with it best bar soap I ever used.</li>
            <li> My honey and I usually love all of the Thymes products.  However, this soap was not satisfactory...it literally disintegrated within 6 baths and/or showers.  NOTE:  WE DID NOT &amp;#34;IMMERSE&amp;#34; THE SOAP, EITHER.  In between uses, we placed the bar on the soap dish.  I am very disappointed.  It smelled really good, though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years.  Nothing beats the smell and lather.  I give it as a gift along with hand made face cloths.  Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I have multiple Eucalyptus scent products from Thymes. This is the third bar soap I&#x27;ve had and will continue to purchase products in this scent. The bar lasts a long time and the scent remains until the very last sliver.</li>
            <li> BUY IT...so nice in the morning!  I know it cost a little but close your eyes and let the smell take you in to a place of calm and peace!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of  Eucalyptus,soup meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I greet</li>
            <li> Very nice soap with beautiful fragrance.  Leaves skin soft, not dry. I would recommend it to anyone for face and body.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things...the bathroom smells great and it feels so good on your skin yet not harsh</li>
            <li> Best soap ever, with a marvelous scent!  I&#x27;ve read reviews that said it didn&#x27;t last long, but if it is kept on a ridged soap dish, it is very&lt;br /&gt;long lasting.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is really nice soap! I smells wonderful! I think my husband would love it actually...if...I was willing to share it, and I&#x27;m not. LOL It even makes my bathroom smell nice, even my cat comes in to smell it! She has eucalyptus in her room and so she already loves the smell and came in to have a sniff. Really, really, nice soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap, esp for the winter months when skin gets dry.  Leaves a nice light smell but no deposits on your skin.  Worth the $--just keep it out of the line of fire of the shower spray or it WILL melt fast!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother---it&#x27;s one of her favorite scents.  This is the first time she&#x27;s used the soap (she&#x27;s used shower gels, lotions and bath salts with this scent) and she&#x27;s really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> Scent is a mellow eucalyptus - fantastic in the morning! Great way to start your day! Planning to buy the lotion and cologne!&lt;br /&gt;Try it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Super large and smells so good and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap in the world----smell and lather and feel----WOW</li>
            <li> this soap is part of a gift but the scent through the paper smells really nice...i may have to get another bar for myself...</li>
            <li> We stayed at the inn where this product was available to their guests. My wife just loved this  soap. So much so that she wanted some for our home. We called the inn and they told us it was available from Amazon.com. We promptly ordered  three bars. My wife is ecstatic about this soap. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I use this to wash my face! It&#x27;s very effective at removing makeup and the scent is so refreshing and enlivening. I think it is very suitable for summertime. A bit pricey for a bar of soap, but worth it because it&#x27;s so large and so potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as eucalyptus-y as you&#x27;d think because it&#x27;s layered with Italian citrus and petitgrain (distilled from the leaves and twigs of the bitter orange plant). In a way, it&#x27;s reminiscent of evergreens. Whatever the scent, it&#x27;s happy and full of life. I enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time,much longer than non glycerine soaps&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for years&lt;br /&gt;price is cheap when considering how long it lasts</li>
            <li> I searched for this after the shop stopped stocking it.  It has a lovely unique scent.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend really liked this soap, and she&#x27;s sensitive to a lot of things. We both liked the scent. The bar seemed to last a good while. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Works really well for sensitive skin. Helps prevent rashes in summer and prevents dry skin in winter. Washes off cleanly, leaves no soap film or residue on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out which hotel turned me on to Thymes Eucalyptus but regardless, I love the scent. The soap is nice and gentle. It&#x27;s also fairly long-lasting since it&#x27;s French-milled. Kudos to whatever hotel offered this in their rooms (perhaps the Fairmont?)!</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I buy it anyway because I love the way it smells on my skin.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, and you&#x27;ll rip right through it but, I cannot get enough. A strong eucalyptus aroma will pleasantly wake you up every morning. A medium to full lather will enable optimum cleaning. While the smell doesn&#x27;t really last long on your skin, your bathroom will smell amazing. I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I am sold on Thymes Glycerine Bar Soap and give it a 5 star because we live in a very dry climate and I feel like the Glycerine soap cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as other soaps.  I like the fresh smell of Eucalyptus!  I have dropped the soap numerous times but the soap hasn&#x27;t broken in pieces like some reviewers have stated.  I will be buying glycerine soaps when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance and competitive price.  This is often sold out in our local stores, so it is good to have it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance without being too strong.  It is a very large bar and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Eucalyptus.  This soap has a rich lather that I like.</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap for the shower.  It has the most lovely fragrance which you can smell long after your shower.  I highly recommend it if you love Eucalyptus.  I didn&#x27;t even know I did until I bought this soap.  One reviewer said that it melted away and only lasted 3 showers.  Not so.  I know it&#x27;s fairly expensive but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite soaps! A fresh light scent, that lathers easily and rinses clean. Always delivered on the promised day.</li>
            <li> It is good quality soap, it is just that for a price tag of $12 per bar I was expecting more. I am a soap aficionado, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, this soap delivers aroma, wakes me up in the morning, leaves my skin clean, and if you take care of it it will not turn into soup. I like it, but for $12 I&#x27;ll try something else next time. For some reason I was under the impression that it was an Italian soap, but it is manufactured in the U.S. I think if it could deliver more aroma or have a bigger size to compensate I would rate it better.</li>
