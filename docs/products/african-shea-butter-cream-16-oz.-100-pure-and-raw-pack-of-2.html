            <li>It is a great product, and I will definitely be ordering it again.  </li>
            <li>Really good, natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>Before B-n-B, I used to buy this \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shea butter from the local BSS (beauty supply store), but then as shea became more popular the price increased dramatically.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of nutty and earthy, and not at all like gasoline as some described on a different product review page.</li>
            <li>but as you rub it in, it is absorbed well into the skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of Shea butter in two containers so it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>So many uses for Natural Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love the natural scent of it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed for the homemade exfoliating soaps I planned on making for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li>primarily use this butter in sealing and styling my natural afro-textured (3c-4b) hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I got two plastic containers of pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li>My hubby works outdoors often and his knees and elbows get so coarse and dry, so I put some of this Shea butter on his skin and made a believer out of him his knees look much better smooth to the touch</li>
            <li>I specifically searched for a particular seller because I&#x27;ve had good experiences in the past.</li>
            <li>It is really grainy feeling.  </li>
            <li>will really get multi uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>and this lotion has been a real skin saver.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Heating it and letting it cool again without mixing with something else (e.g. oils) will tend to make shea butter grainy (I know because I left a container in the hot car once by mistake).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the different types of shea butter, and this product did not match the description or the photo.   </li>
            <li>Graininess is not terrible, as it will melt down in your hands anyway, but if texture is important to you just be careful with it.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more to get quality and purity.</li>
            <li>The extra effort is worth it.</li>
            <li>my ONLY complaint which isnt really a complaint, more like laziness, is that it takes a while to put on your entire body because it has to melt into an oil in your hands and you need to use kind of a lot because it doesnt really spread easily.</li>
            <li>love raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>My mom has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Will last for quite a while and definitely helps in making skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase and I will buy from this seller again, especially if the price stays about the same.ill buy from this seller again, especially if the price stays about the same.</li>
            <li>i want to try all natural body stuff</li>
            <li>I use the product to seal my natural hair, and apply it to my skin immediately after I shower</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I purchased shea butter for the first time to use during the winter for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>same old rub your hands together and then rub from hair to toenails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a tremendous deal, but the bottom line is it&#x27;s not the exact stated weight.  </li>
            <li>and she loves it, her skin looks so supple now, not dry or itcy is what she use to say about her skin.</li>
            <li>Based on previous experience, I expect we will be using these two large containers for about 14 months, if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband and I also use shea butter for daily moisturizing and skin softening, as well as on our faces and lips, sometimes mixed with a little aloe very gel.</li>

            <li> I expected the feel of it to be like \\&quot;butter\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> what i expected  of the product</li>
            <li> two-pack of butter is a deeper yellow tone than B-n-B&#x27;s raw organic version.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One of the tubs was a bit damaged, but i think that was due to shipping.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was reluctant to stray from Butters-n-Bars.com raw organic shea butter, which I have purchased regularly for the past two years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the previous seller was \\&quot;bought</li>
            <li> I use it for two-strand twists on my damp hair or for slightly elongating my curls on a wash-n-go.</li>
            <li> so it takes a little work to get it rubbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> dab a little in palm of your hand and &#x27;smush&#x27; it with your finger until is softens or liquifies.  </li>
            <li> up.leaves little bits in your hair.not</li>
            <li> We rub it between our hands for a few seconds and then apply to skin.</li>
            <li> Because of its purity it is very thick and smells a little like play doe, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> It is really really thick and stiff.  </li>
            <li> However, the product I received in this order was hard and near impossible to deal with - not like what I&#x27;d received in the past.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is very heavy, but my hair is really thick and can take it.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused about how to soften it as it has the consistency of play doh.  </li>
            <li> Everything was wrong about this experience, from the seller I thought I was using to the expected quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I weighed both shea butter tubs when I received them on a food scale and each came to 14.5-15 ounces.</li>
            <li> Before I had terrible bumps on the back of my arms that I absolutely hated, after about a month of using after every shower and exfoliating...</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t roses or coco butter, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  </li>
            <li> Smells nasty and stains the skin and clothes</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product off of Amazon after looking in local stores and coming away with about 3 oz for the 1/2 the price of the 2lbs I bought on here.  The product arrived promptly, well packed and well packaged.  It was exactly what I needed for the homemade exfoliating soaps I planned on making for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> Really good, natural shea butter. Because of its purity it is very thick and smells a little like play doe, but that was expected. I just melt it and mix it with my coconut oil. no complaints...</li>
            <li> Everything was wrong about this experience, from the seller I thought I was using to the expected quality of the product. I specifically searched for a particular seller because I&#x27;ve had good experiences in the past.

I don&#x27;t know if the previous seller was \\&quot;bought out\\&quot; or what, but nothing about this order was what I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t have minded the switch in sellers if the product quality had remained the same. I&#x27;ll find my shea butter elsewhere in the future.</li>
            <li> I love it! I need another order in August.</li>
            <li> i want to try all natural body stuff so i bought this. it hasnt turned ay of my things yellow like others have said. i take showers at night and i put this all over my body and the next day all day my skin is smooth and moisturized, its amazing. my ONLY complaint which isnt really a complaint, more like laziness, is that it takes a while to put on your entire body because it has to melt into an oil in your hands and you need to use kind of a lot because it doesnt really spread easily. i dont know but this stuff is awesome and i will be buying this probably for the rest of my life. very pleased</li>

            <li> I ordered the product on a Thursday, and received it that Saturday in the mail.  One of the tubs was a bit damaged, but i think that was due to shipping. The price was great.  I use the product to seal my natural hair, and apply it to my skin immediately after I shower and before I towel off, which gives me moisturized skin that lasts until my next shower. It is a great product, and I will definitely be ordering it again.  I, however, do not have any previous experience with shea butter, so I do not have any standard of quality with which to compare it with.</li>
            <li> She has dry hands from all the dishwashing and dry winter weather here in CA.  From time to time her hands do bleed from the cracked skin.  She uses this every winter and loves it.  It truly helped with her dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love Shea butter and I use this practically every day. I have also shared some with my friends at work.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everybody. Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using Shea Butter.  I expected the feel of it to be like \\&quot;butter\\&quot;.  It is really grainy feeling.  It does melt in your hands after you rub it in a while. It is really really thick and stiff.  I bought it to use in my  hair.  I had to mix it with something else to make it easier to use. I added in some essential oils too because, it actually smelled like play dough. After putting a generous amount on my afro-textured hair, my hair was nice and shiny.  The Shea Butter is very heavy, but my hair is really thick and can take it. It was a good price for 2 nice size containers of the product.  No problems with the vender or shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, excellent moisturizer for dry skin. It is not liquid at room temp so it takes a little work to get it rubbed into your skin. The extra effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> love raw shea butter.  this is the best stuff for dry skin and lips and hair.  will really get multi uses out of it.  dab a little in palm of your hand and &#x27;smush&#x27; it with your finger until is softens or liquifies.  then rug.  be moderate with your use, as it goes a long way and lasts all day. my neice uses it in her hair as a leave in conditioner. and i use it on my lips when i can&#x27;t find my medicated chapstick, and it does the trick well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I was a little confused about how to soften it as it has the consistency of play doh.  I wrote to the seller and they provided me with good direction.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and have no complaints.  I love it. I make my own lotion with added ingredients.  Before I had terrible bumps on the back of my arms that I absolutely hated, after about a month of using after every shower and exfoliating... my arms are smoother than they have ever been.  I have really dry skin and this lotion has been a real skin saver.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the texture took to long too soften up.leaves little bits in your hair.not what i expected  of the product</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and in perfect condition... I would recommend this Shea Butter to everyone... As someone who has suffered with eczema for the last 12 years, this is the only product that soothes my irritated skin and moisturizes the extra dry areas. Amazing!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and recommend it.  This is the 4th time I have purchased this&lt;br /&gt;shea butter and I and my husband use it. It is a good buy and nice quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Got it in a timely manner, I&#x27;ve used the stuff before so... same old rub your hands together and then rub from hair to toenails. Helps stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Does not absorb into the skin.  Sits on top like vasoline.  Smells nasty and stains the skin and clothes yellow.  I questioned the fact that it was so inexpensive and now I know why.  Do not waste your money.  Spend a little more to get quality and purity.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and started using it as soon as I opened the box.  I used it on my hair and skin.  It feels kind of greasy when you first put it on but as you rub it in, it is absorbed well into the skin and hair.  There&#x27;s a lot of Shea butter in two containers so it was worth the price.  Smell isn&#x27;t roses or coco butter, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is awesome stuff, I&#x27;m always on the prowl for some all natural products for my family. My mom has very sensitive skin and I bought this for her and she loves it, her skin looks so supple now, not dry or itcy is what she use to say about her skin. I also use use this for my kids and I. So many uses for Natural Shea butter. I love the natural scent of it. My hubby works outdoors often and his knees and elbows get so coarse and dry, so I put some of this Shea butter on his skin and made a believer out of him his knees look much better smooth to the touch, elbows too. Will be buying this product for a long time to come. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase experience ,  very good and beautiful Aroma</li>
            <li> I purchased shea butter for the first time to use during the winter for dry skin.  It has been very good in that respect, helping keep my skin moisturized.  I was a bit disapoointed to see that the seller advertises the shea butter as weighing 16 oz each.  Unfortunately, I weighed both shea butter tubs when I received them on a food scale and each came to 14.5-15 ounces. It&#x27;s not a tremendous deal, but the bottom line is it&#x27;s not the exact stated weight.  I&#x27;ll be a bit weary to order again in the future unless I can verify the weight somehow.</li>
