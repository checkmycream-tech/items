            <li>Although a good conditioner don&#x27;t expect Any thing like Rogain</li>
            <li>so I could give it a good</li>
            <li>Sounds like a good plan.</li>
            <li>All in all, good bang for the buck though.</li>
            <li>The Keratin Smooth Conditioner is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Got it good will try it soon</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it lasts forever, looks good, acts good.  </li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My hair looks so great after using this product, no frizzies and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>My high-end stylist thinks I am some hair product expert because my hair always looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Keratin smooth also works great as a leave- in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing too.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this stuff is absolutely AMAZING.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I am an every day conditioner kind of person.</li>
            <li>, it is nice, i will buy it again</li>
            <li>smells nice, seems to make hair more combable; generally good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>biggest problem comes from the fact that Unilever (who own Tresemme) tests on animals.</li>
            <li>They are a nice balance of price and quality.</li>
            <li>This Tressemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner is creamy, goes in smoothly and provides an awesome conditioning experience.</li>
            <li>It is a nice smell, it is just very, very strong and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner but use it with the shampoo and serum for best results.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, and it leaves my hair softer and silkier than with most conditioner.</li>
            <li>great conditioner I use it to mix my hairdye with I am very pleased with how fast I got it</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a shot as it was cheap and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>- my hair is so silky and so soft and sooooo healthy!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought it was great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, and not too strong.</li>
            <li>This is a large amount of conditioner for a very good price - the bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li>Despite not being a fan of new things, she loved the conditioner and has asked me to order her a bottle!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m bizarrely satisfied with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay item.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>and I can manage it better.</li>
            <li>the organix keratin line works much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>love products like this.  </li>
            <li>I get better results with L&#x27;Oreal Eversleek.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast am happy with product.</li>
            <li>this product, in fact i just bought 2 more bottles..</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and I think most people will find that they don&#x27;t need keratin in their hair.</li>
            <li>WAS HOPING IT WOULD MOISTURIZE MY HAIR MUCH MORE</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I am Afric-American with semi natural(coarse but not kinky) hair with many tangles.  </li>
            <li>After towel drying am able to comb out without any additional product-which never happens even for conditioners that claim to detangle/soften hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been moving more and more away from giving money to companies who contribute to animal suffering, so</li>
            <li>Smells lovely too.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so much more tangled free,and managable.</li>
            <li>: On par with most hair conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>guess I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in the end result to greatly recommend this over Dove&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care or even Suave and Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not notice any added shine, but that was ok.</li>
            <li>The description said this conditioner was safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li>The market for shampoos and conditioners is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice vanilla scent and rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this shampoo has changed my life, its amazing, it really works , I love it !</li>
            <li>i loved this product the first time I used it...</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Nice, a bit too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li>This conditioner is probably the best drug store brand product that I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>Just got it and satisfied even after 1-st  use, specially for this price!</li>
            <li>Definitely works fabulously for the price, and smells great too!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is ok - leaves your hair feeling nice, but my hair is used to slightly more higher end products (pureology).</li>
            <li>Made hair smooth and healthy</li>
            <li>This has made my hair so healthy, shiney &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin conditioner along with its matching shampoo for my color-treated pixie haircut.</li>
            <li>; Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner is an okay conditioner.</li>
            <li>and combing it and making sure all strands are covered and wrapped and rinsing it with luke warm water instead of hot water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reasonably price and does good on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about Keratin infused products and how good they are for your hair</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE, WORKS GOOD.</li>
            <li>I use Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Condition along with Tresemme Keratin Infusing Shampoo and my hair is looking strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>The results: her hair is light, smells great, and very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice, makes my hair silky soft</li>
            <li>it is with a bit of pureology, for more budget friendly hair washing.</li>
            <li>My hair also looks shiny and healthier and easy to shape.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy but it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong too so when I wavy my hair around</li>
            <li>Really strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>She said that keratin makes your hair strong but it can make it too strong.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong and over powering, but you can smell it.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>A lot of moisturizing/smoothing conditioners weigh down my hair, but I have found this one to be perfect.</li>
            <li>this works fine and</li>
            <li>I have somewhat fine hair</li>
            <li>After several times of usage, my hair starts to become oily and it doesn&#x27;t bring the awesome looking when I put it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>Couple this with the Tresemme shapoo, and you&#x27;ll have a perfect combo for your hair without spending half of your salary.</li>
            <li>It works surprisingly well on my long hair, leaving it really nice and smooth and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>In search of a new shampoo/conditioner routine I saw the good reviews for Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth and decided to give the conditioner a try in conjunction with their Anti- Breakage shampoo.</li>
            <li>I can see how it may not work well for light, fine hair, but the rest of us should never go without it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need huge piles of it, either.</li>
            <li>i felt a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free with lots of shine.</li>
            <li>but I was trying to use it up before I began using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried the TRESemme Expert Selection - Keratin Smooth 7 Day Smooth System - Heat Activated Treatment you need to.</li>
            <li>I use the condition in conjunction with the Keratin 7 Day Smooth System and on</li>
            <li>I like the light scent of this conditioner and the way that it smooths my hair.</li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair stay so smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li>and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair silky and smooth after I use this.</li>

            <li>Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum, 3.3 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m using all three Tresemme Keratin Smooth products I can brush and go in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>For me a conditioner that rinses well, but still helps retain moisture in my hair is important.</li>
            <li>This is another absolutely fantastic one.  </li>
            <li>There are those that are cheap, detergent-level liquids; there are those that are off-the-charts luxurious.  </li>
            <li>B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>My hair looks good and feels soft.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I find bothersome is the super strong scent.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work well, but the consistency and amount you need reminds me more of a cheaper box store brand than a higher end salon brand.</li>
            <li>though - it was light and bouncy and full of body in the bulk of the hair.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, silky, full of body, shine and life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t expect a miracle, I believe this product will make you happy.</li>
            <li>I give it my highest recommendation, definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>hair feels clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would put Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth Conditioner in a middle category:  good, dependable products that deliver on what they promise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found the Suave keratin products more effective.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this conditioner, it was very cheap and left my hair feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>shampoo was just sufficient, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>And the bottle is huge and not expensive at all!</li>
            <li>But this conditioner has now been my tried and true for years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always been so full of life.</li>
            <li>In my own experience, my beard is softer and its natural curl has been activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is medium thickness and straight, while my wife is a bit more oily and at shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>That part of my hair is shorter then the rest because of so much breaking, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was this product</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>I apply this in the shower after shampooing, leave it on for about two minutes, and am left with incredibly gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li>-- thought I&#x27;d say that in the spirit of full disclosure.  </li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely keep using it :)</li>
            <li>I have naturally super curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile now.</li>
            <li>I love their low price and salon quality, you can not get better for the price.</li>
            <li>The first one is the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Keratin Smooth works pretty well</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good conditioner to keep in my rotation of products and the price is very reasonable especially for the quantity.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally straight, Caucasian hair and this product works great.  </li>
            <li>I have the whole line and it is more like 1 hour straight!  </li>
            <li>In fact, too much keratin can make your hair so strong it becomes brittle.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent which lasts all day, but more importantly, it manages to calm my extreme frizz.</li>
            <li>Love this, my hair is fried and this made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>but when I do use it my hair is super soft :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the whole keratin smooth line and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I thought this would help smooth out the frizzies, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>I tried the whole Tresemme Keratin Smooth system (shampoo, conditioner and serum) and I was blown away.  </li>
            <li>But I honestly just felt this was necessary.</li>
            <li>I really really love this product and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s hair is like mine, or even just naturally frizzy an curly.</li>
            <li>Taking time for it to get absorbed into hair.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice and actually seems to remove a lot of the frizz from my hair.</li>
            <li>Scent is nice and gets tangles out, but I didn&#x27;t notice any extra smoothing power from the \\&quot;keratin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My hair ended up very soft, sleek, and super easy to style without being at all oily or greasy, even the day after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use Garnier curl calm down, and it works amazingly together!</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I&#x27;ve decided to toss the rest of my old shampoo out so that I can begin using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>and overall I find the moisture rich is the better</li>
            <li>wonderful product, especially if your hair is suffering from heat and other damage.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>My hair is less frizzy, more manageable, and very soft... and, like I said, I saved a fair amount of pocket change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY.</li>
            <li>other tresemme products don&#x27;t exactly smell manly but they&#x27;re quite pleasant and neutral</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner and it smooths it right out.  </li>
            <li>and I can still smell it on my hair right now at 11pm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tresemme, you are doing everything right.</li>
            <li>they have quietly introduced some new products, most notably, a line of conditioners, and I have been wowed by them.  </li>
            <li>I love changing up shampoos and conditioners, and in the past have always liked Tresemme.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, this conditioner isn&#x27;t as effective as the keratin treatment but it works pretty damn</li>
            <li>This condition along with the shampoo leaves my hair very soft and silky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a nice clean scent to it, it comes out of the bottle as a thick cream that easily distributes through the hair.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, the product does its job, and Tresemme is a decent company when it comes to social/environmental aspects, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use this with various brands of shampoo and i always get the same results - great looking/feeling hair.</li>
            <li>It was extremely soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>For less than $15 I get the shampoo, conditioner, and defrizzer and my hair has NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li>Only been using a few weeks as of the writing of this review but it is just a wonderful conditioner and leaves my hair very soft and clean.....</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend buying , this was at the right price and gets the jobs done for frizzy thirsty curly hair!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this it made my hair &amp;#34;move&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>At first I was using it every time I washed my hair</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner that I currently have in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, the product itself is pretty to my taste.</li>
            <li>hair is much softer!</li>
            <li>I do have to say that this is the first keratin product I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with wavy hair that can be pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft and smooth as it says but I don&#x27;t know about a long-term improvement to the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is one big bottle, so that makes it an even better deal in my eyes.</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth, soft, shiny and manageable, with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Tresemme since they first became a company.</li>
            <li>I am now having to get deep conditioner shots trying to get my hair healthy enough to keep it from breaking off even more</li>
            <li>As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...</li>
            <li>I was so relaxed in the shower that i applied this to build more product in my but truly its okay with jut the small dot.</li>
            <li>This lasted me a whole month to !</li>
            <li>My hair felt SO soft and so smooth while rinsing and after rinsing.</li>
            <li>My hair actually seemed more ...</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li>When first using this conditioner, I wasn&#x27;t sure it had enough conditioning power.</li>
            <li>Tresemme products have done a 180 degree turn around from when I first tried them years ago.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smooth after the shower.</li>
            <li>My further use of it would probably be most determined by price.</li>
            <li>Product is great, and it will last me for a long time!</li>
            <li>It worked great, but the price was steep and once I stopped using it my hair turned into a complete damaged mess.</li>
            <li>My hair is left feeling softer and smooth, I use it with the complimentary shampoo and also the smoothing serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I needed it to do for my long hair, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Title pretty much sums it up.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty heavy-duty conditioner, so it&#x27;s too much for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to style as usual.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down and minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li>I blow dry most days anyway, so that&#x27;s no issue at all.</li>
            <li>I have wavy Caucasian hair that will friz in certain conditions.  </li>
            <li>my hair is usually very soft and healthy, I saw the tv commercial for it and thought I can&#x27;t wait for it to come out, as soon as it did I bought it.</li>
            <li>but since I alternate between brands this one works fine.</li>
            <li>I usually only put conditioner on the ends of my hair since I have fine hair that lacks body.</li>
            <li>I purchased my (large) bottle at Target and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I think it would be very good for damaged hair or thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I brought both the shampoo and conditioner and it left my families hair silky, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very course wavy/slightly curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a ton of different products, including Nexxus for curls, and for the price range this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really think about it when I purchased this</li>
            <li>but this conditioner smells very perfumey and girly.</li>
            <li>I could really smell it during the day.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The thing about these products is that I really can&#x27;t tell if the keratin is making a difference.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have a wavy to straight hair</li>
            <li>: very rich&lt;br /&gt;Scent:</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product line, would recommend for an affordable high quality conditioner!</li>
            <li>My hair is that hair that wants to be curly, but can&#x27;t make the commitment-</li>
            <li>Tresemme Karatin Smooth Conditioner left my hair at awe!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this conditioner is a great value and definitely recommend it for those with coarse or frizzy hair that needs to be tamed.</li>
            <li>that I can&#x27;t really style it feeling.  </li>
            <li>Also, I really like the floral scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipped fast, with no problems.</li>
            <li>, I get straight, controlled</li>
            <li>I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several new conditioners in recent months, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this TreSemme one.</li>
            <li>Both of us have used their other shampoos and are satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I had been excited about the keratin being included in the conditioner and over time it may actually help out the over all health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I experienced zero frizz reduction using this product, and in the little difference of tangled-ness (I know it&#x27;s not a word, but you know what I mean) that I saw, it almost seemed like I had more tangles and more knots after using this product than if I had just shampooed my hair, rinsed, and dried.</li>
            <li>As an almost daily swimmer, my hair gets dry and fried constantly, and a great conditioner is a must.  </li>
            <li>Once dry, my hair continues to be easy to brush and it looks shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my stylist noticed the difference in texture since I started using this product she informed me that keratin is for hair that is already very damaged and in need of keratin, if your hair is already healthy it will only do the opposite and ruin the hair because its to much protein...</li>
            <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong fragrance, because if you are sensitive to chemicals like I am, it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair.</li>
            <li>It would take more time than I had in the morning to wait for my straight iron to heat and repeatedly run it through my hair only to have the frizz return later in the day.  </li>
            <li>But I most likely won&#x27;t purchase another bottle of this because of the waxy build up and the fact that no matter how much rinsing you do - your hair still feels as if there is still product left in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price for this product is currently near the MSRP of $5.99, which is a pretty good deal already, but I&#x27;ve been watching the price at my local grocery store and have actually seen it as amazingly low as $3.50!</li>
            <li>Smells sweet and tart like green apples, I have very fine naturally blonde hair</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the sweet floral scent, especially since it seems to linger.</li>
            <li>I blow dry hot then flat iron and my hair is still healthy.</li>
            <li>I plan on giving others a shot, but I do really like what this has done thus far!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>these reasons, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>No wonder it is rated so high..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner seemed to give my hair a little more volume, without the craziness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the only thing you need (the serum is a nice extra touch though).</li>
            <li>fragrance is nice and not overpowering in the least.</li>
            <li>The smell was lovely and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I just let it warm up slowly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on some of the other reviews, it looks like reactions are mixed, but we have only good things to say about this combo.  </li>
            <li>For the last few months I&#x27;ve been using a Nexxus conditioner that works wonderfully but costs almost $15 a bottle, so I was amazed to find that Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin conditioner works nearly as well at less than 1/5th of the price!</li>
            <li>I started using TreSemme Keratin Smooth instead of the other TreSemme conditioner I had.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be my new conditioner of choice for that reason.  </li>
            <li>I live in Houston, Home of the Friz, and even in 98% humidity</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice too, subtle and doesn&#x27;t overpower anything.</li>
            <li>I makes your hair very soft, I would recommend that you use the shampoo with it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft!</li>
            <li>I never have soft hair, NEVER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner along with its corresponding shampoo ([[ASIN:B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]]) for a few weeks now and it does a nice job managing my thick and wavy hair that tends to frizz.</li>
            <li>Pretty basic conditioner.</li>
            <li>conditioner is a little thicker than some, but it easily works into the hair.</li>
            <li>The products have also made my scalp itchy and the scent of the shampoo and conditioner is a little strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and a comb runs right through it with no tangles after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I realize that is actually a feature that others find as a positive and a reason to buy.  </li>
            <li>my braids were not stiff but they moved.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that after half a bottle the conditioning effects are starting to lessen, though I suspect if I take a break from this conditioner for a while and come back to it, it will be good again.</li>
            <li>One small annoyance with the large bottle I was provided for review is that the Tresemme 25 ounce container is a bit large in diameter to grip easily in the shower if your hands are not very large.</li>
            <li>Very thick and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I noticed some frizz improvement but compared to my Tresemme moisture rich conditioner this left my hair quite dry</li>
            <li>I shower at night, and in the morning when I wake up and my hair is dry, it&#x27;s under a lot more control than with any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a huge bottle with just a few bucks.</li>
            <li>However, it leaves my hair soft and smoother than if I had used a regular conditioner, so I&#x27;d say it works very well for a brand that isn&#x27;t from a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using almond oil and this conditioner and WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny like it was before I dyed it.</li>
            <li>and my hair is so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old</li>
            <li>(I wear my hair natural)</li>
            <li>conditioner leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell but there is simply too much of it.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>and instead it was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for all naturals looking for a staple product, even if you are protein sensitive like I am.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast but the breakage is keeping it the same length.</li>
            <li>and I have seen far fewer split ends, if any at all.  </li>
            <li>I think I will stick to my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>just ran out of the shampoo and while waiting for my order to arrive from Amazon (much cheaper than purchasing locally)</li>
            <li>I know not everyone feels the same way, but I really don&#x27;t want to be part of that.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft, manageable, and so silky.</li>
            <li>This Tresemme really surprised me.</li>
            <li>The curls were well defined and on the tighter side and held all day, but were soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>it looks like one of those professional bottles they use in salons, rather than a consumer</li>
            <li>Personally, this Tresemme conditioner is really a bargain.</li>
            <li>It produced a head of soft and well-conditioned hair.  </li>
            <li>As soon as i applied this product to my natural hair</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where humidity and frizz are major issues in my life.</li>
            <li>B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]] not only rinses well, but it also leaves my hair soft and with less frizz.</li>
            <li>She recommended that I alternate between the keratin products and a product high in moisture.  </li>
            <li>Only conditioner that makes my hair feel smoother, fresher, free of frizz, and 50% less tangles.</li>
            <li>I usually use Suave humectant, but that was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is thick, I tend to use two to three times the amount of conditioner compared to what I use of shampoo, but with this, I&#x27;ve found I need a lesser amount than with others, which is a nice surprise (the same goes for the shampoo).</li>
            <li>When I blow dry it, it&#x27;s so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>I use only towards the ends of my hair strands, to keep my scalp free of heavy stuff.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a big negative for me because I can&#x27;t tolerate overwhelming smells.  </li>
            <li>Really, though, that&#x27;s not much of a complaint, and I wore my hair down instead of in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely oily, so I don&#x27;t need tons of water to wash it off my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so dry and course and damaged due to all the damaging product and heat, but this stuff made my hair shiny, soft, and very pretty.</li>
            <li>Usually, if I were to review a conditioner product, it would not be anything special.  </li>
            <li>It left it really soft.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft, put curls back in it, and when I washed it and braided it</li>
            <li>I recently combed my 1 year old dreadlocks out-</li>
            <li>When I use all three together my hair is soft, shiny and smooth without the frizz that is so common in the humid southern part of the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use the same shampoo and conditioner every time I wash my hair, but decided I&#x27;ll only use Tresemme&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Keratin helps with occasional use of conditioner when hair feel rough or too clean feeling or stands up or too volume when air is dry like hot dry Summer day or dry Winter weather.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, though, the hair feels conditioned, and not over conditioned and that kind of \\&quot;artificial\\&quot; soft other conditioners leave behind.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that my hair afterward had that it&#x27;s so clean and soft</li>
            <li>Because I like this conditioner so much, I decided to give the other Tresemme conditioners a try, and none of them compare to this one.  </li>
            <li>first, I thought it took away some of the fullness/volume at the roots, but it came right back when I blow dried for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>And I had to clean up all the mess it cost for the other products.</li>
            <li>when I used a palm-sized mountain of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually one to leave reviews-whether they be positive or negative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 6 months and my ends were always dry and puffy.</li>
            <li>But when I received he package, I found out that it only left about half of the whole.</li>
            <li>i think it puts a little too much keratin in your hair  </li>
            <li>I put a little in my hair after I get out of shower and really really helps with split ends</li>
            <li>Over the last month, our house has tried a wide range of shampoo/conditioner combos, and Tresemme is one of the clear winners.  </li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so great after using this product, no frizzies and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> My high-end stylist thinks I am some hair product expert because my hair always looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Keratin smooth also works great as a leave- in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing too.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this stuff is absolutely AMAZING.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I am an every day conditioner kind of person.</li>
            <li> , it is nice, i will buy it again</li>
            <li> smells nice, seems to make hair more combable; generally good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> biggest problem comes from the fact that Unilever (who own Tresemme) tests on animals.</li>
            <li> They are a nice balance of price and quality.</li>
            <li> This Tressemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner is creamy, goes in smoothly and provides an awesome conditioning experience.</li>
            <li> It is a nice smell, it is just very, very strong and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner but use it with the shampoo and serum for best results.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and it leaves my hair softer and silkier than with most conditioner.</li>
            <li> great conditioner I use it to mix my hairdye with I am very pleased with how fast I got it</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a shot as it was cheap and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> - my hair is so silky and so soft and sooooo healthy!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought it was great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, and not too strong.</li>
            <li> This is a large amount of conditioner for a very good price - the bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li> Despite not being a fan of new things, she loved the conditioner and has asked me to order her a bottle!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m bizarrely satisfied with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay item.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> and I can manage it better.</li>
            <li> the organix keratin line works much better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> love products like this.  </li>
            <li> I get better results with L&#x27;Oreal Eversleek.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast am happy with product.</li>
            <li> this product, in fact i just bought 2 more bottles..</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and I think most people will find that they don&#x27;t need keratin in their hair.</li>
            <li> WAS HOPING IT WOULD MOISTURIZE MY HAIR MUCH MORE</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am Afric-American with semi natural(coarse but not kinky) hair with many tangles.  </li>
            <li> After towel drying am able to comb out without any additional product-which never happens even for conditioners that claim to detangle/soften hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been moving more and more away from giving money to companies who contribute to animal suffering, so</li>
            <li> Smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so much more tangled free,and managable.</li>
            <li> : On par with most hair conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> guess I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in the end result to greatly recommend this over Dove&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care or even Suave and Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not notice any added shine, but that was ok.</li>
            <li> The description said this conditioner was safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> The market for shampoos and conditioners is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice vanilla scent and rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has changed my life, its amazing, it really works , I love it !</li>
            <li> i loved this product the first time I used it...</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Nice, a bit too sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> This conditioner is probably the best drug store brand product that I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> Just got it and satisfied even after 1-st  use, specially for this price!</li>
            <li> Definitely works fabulously for the price, and smells great too!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is ok - leaves your hair feeling nice, but my hair is used to slightly more higher end products (pureology).</li>
            <li> Made hair smooth and healthy</li>
            <li> This has made my hair so healthy, shiney &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin conditioner along with its matching shampoo for my color-treated pixie haircut.</li>
            <li> ; Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner is an okay conditioner.</li>
            <li> and combing it and making sure all strands are covered and wrapped and rinsing it with luke warm water instead of hot water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s reasonably price and does good on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about Keratin infused products and how good they are for your hair</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE, WORKS GOOD.</li>
            <li> I use Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Condition along with Tresemme Keratin Infusing Shampoo and my hair is looking strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> The results: her hair is light, smells great, and very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice, makes my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> it is with a bit of pureology, for more budget friendly hair washing.</li>
            <li> My hair also looks shiny and healthier and easy to shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy but it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong too so when I wavy my hair around</li>
            <li> Really strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> She said that keratin makes your hair strong but it can make it too strong.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong and over powering, but you can smell it.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> A lot of moisturizing/smoothing conditioners weigh down my hair, but I have found this one to be perfect.</li>
            <li> this works fine and</li>
            <li> I have somewhat fine hair</li>
            <li> After several times of usage, my hair starts to become oily and it doesn&#x27;t bring the awesome looking when I put it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> Couple this with the Tresemme shapoo, and you&#x27;ll have a perfect combo for your hair without spending half of your salary.</li>
            <li> It works surprisingly well on my long hair, leaving it really nice and smooth and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> In search of a new shampoo/conditioner routine I saw the good reviews for Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth and decided to give the conditioner a try in conjunction with their Anti- Breakage shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can see how it may not work well for light, fine hair, but the rest of us should never go without it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need huge piles of it, either.</li>
            <li> i felt a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free with lots of shine.</li>
            <li> but I was trying to use it up before I began using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the TRESemme Expert Selection - Keratin Smooth 7 Day Smooth System - Heat Activated Treatment you need to.</li>
            <li> I use the condition in conjunction with the Keratin 7 Day Smooth System and on</li>
            <li> I like the light scent of this conditioner and the way that it smooths my hair.</li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair stay so smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li> and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair silky and smooth after I use this.</li>

            <li> B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00AO4EBOI</li>
            <li> Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum, 3.3 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m using all three Tresemme Keratin Smooth products I can brush and go in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> For me a conditioner that rinses well, but still helps retain moisture in my hair is important.</li>
            <li> This is another absolutely fantastic one.  </li>
            <li> There are those that are cheap, detergent-level liquids; there are those that are off-the-charts luxurious.  </li>
            <li> B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> My hair looks good and feels soft.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I find bothersome is the super strong scent.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work well, but the consistency and amount you need reminds me more of a cheaper box store brand than a higher end salon brand.</li>
            <li> though - it was light and bouncy and full of body in the bulk of the hair.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, silky, full of body, shine and life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t expect a miracle, I believe this product will make you happy.</li>
            <li> I give it my highest recommendation, definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> hair feels clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would put Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth Conditioner in a middle category:  good, dependable products that deliver on what they promise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found the Suave keratin products more effective.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this conditioner, it was very cheap and left my hair feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> shampoo was just sufficient, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> And the bottle is huge and not expensive at all!</li>
            <li> But this conditioner has now been my tried and true for years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always been so full of life.</li>
            <li> In my own experience, my beard is softer and its natural curl has been activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thickness and straight, while my wife is a bit more oily and at shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> That part of my hair is shorter then the rest because of so much breaking, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was this product</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I apply this in the shower after shampooing, leave it on for about two minutes, and am left with incredibly gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li> -- thought I&#x27;d say that in the spirit of full disclosure.  </li>
            <li> I love this and will definitely keep using it :)</li>
            <li> I have naturally super curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile now.</li>
            <li> I love their low price and salon quality, you can not get better for the price.</li>
            <li> The first one is the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Keratin Smooth works pretty well</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good conditioner to keep in my rotation of products and the price is very reasonable especially for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally straight, Caucasian hair and this product works great.  </li>
            <li> I have the whole line and it is more like 1 hour straight!  </li>
            <li> In fact, too much keratin can make your hair so strong it becomes brittle.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent which lasts all day, but more importantly, it manages to calm my extreme frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this, my hair is fried and this made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> but when I do use it my hair is super soft :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the whole keratin smooth line and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help smooth out the frizzies, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole Tresemme Keratin Smooth system (shampoo, conditioner and serum) and I was blown away.  </li>
            <li> But I honestly just felt this was necessary.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s hair is like mine, or even just naturally frizzy an curly.</li>
            <li> Taking time for it to get absorbed into hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and actually seems to remove a lot of the frizz from my hair.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice and gets tangles out, but I didn&#x27;t notice any extra smoothing power from the \\&quot;keratin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My hair ended up very soft, sleek, and super easy to style without being at all oily or greasy, even the day after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use Garnier curl calm down, and it works amazingly together!</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I&#x27;ve decided to toss the rest of my old shampoo out so that I can begin using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> and overall I find the moisture rich is the better</li>
            <li> wonderful product, especially if your hair is suffering from heat and other damage.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy, more manageable, and very soft... and, like I said, I saved a fair amount of pocket change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY.</li>
            <li> other tresemme products don&#x27;t exactly smell manly but they&#x27;re quite pleasant and neutral</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner and it smooths it right out.  </li>
            <li> and I can still smell it on my hair right now at 11pm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresemme, you are doing everything right.</li>
            <li> they have quietly introduced some new products, most notably, a line of conditioners, and I have been wowed by them.  </li>
            <li> I love changing up shampoos and conditioners, and in the past have always liked Tresemme.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, this conditioner isn&#x27;t as effective as the keratin treatment but it works pretty damn</li>
            <li> This condition along with the shampoo leaves my hair very soft and silky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice clean scent to it, it comes out of the bottle as a thick cream that easily distributes through the hair.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, the product does its job, and Tresemme is a decent company when it comes to social/environmental aspects, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this with various brands of shampoo and i always get the same results - great looking/feeling hair.</li>
            <li> It was extremely soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> For less than $15 I get the shampoo, conditioner, and defrizzer and my hair has NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few weeks as of the writing of this review but it is just a wonderful conditioner and leaves my hair very soft and clean.....</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend buying , this was at the right price and gets the jobs done for frizzy thirsty curly hair!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it made my hair &amp;#34;move&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> At first I was using it every time I washed my hair</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner that I currently have in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, the product itself is pretty to my taste.</li>
            <li> hair is much softer!</li>
            <li> I do have to say that this is the first keratin product I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with wavy hair that can be pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair soft and smooth as it says but I don&#x27;t know about a long-term improvement to the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is one big bottle, so that makes it an even better deal in my eyes.</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth, soft, shiny and manageable, with no frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Tresemme since they first became a company.</li>
            <li> I am now having to get deep conditioner shots trying to get my hair healthy enough to keep it from breaking off even more</li>
            <li> As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...</li>
            <li> I was so relaxed in the shower that i applied this to build more product in my but truly its okay with jut the small dot.</li>
            <li> This lasted me a whole month to !</li>
            <li> My hair felt SO soft and so smooth while rinsing and after rinsing.</li>
            <li> My hair actually seemed more ...</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li> When first using this conditioner, I wasn&#x27;t sure it had enough conditioning power.</li>
            <li> Tresemme products have done a 180 degree turn around from when I first tried them years ago.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smooth after the shower.</li>
            <li> My further use of it would probably be most determined by price.</li>
            <li> Product is great, and it will last me for a long time!</li>
            <li> It worked great, but the price was steep and once I stopped using it my hair turned into a complete damaged mess.</li>
            <li> My hair is left feeling softer and smooth, I use it with the complimentary shampoo and also the smoothing serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I needed it to do for my long hair, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Title pretty much sums it up.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty heavy-duty conditioner, so it&#x27;s too much for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to style as usual.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down and minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li> I blow dry most days anyway, so that&#x27;s no issue at all.</li>
            <li> I have wavy Caucasian hair that will friz in certain conditions.  </li>
            <li> my hair is usually very soft and healthy, I saw the tv commercial for it and thought I can&#x27;t wait for it to come out, as soon as it did I bought it.</li>
            <li> but since I alternate between brands this one works fine.</li>
            <li> I usually only put conditioner on the ends of my hair since I have fine hair that lacks body.</li>
            <li> I purchased my (large) bottle at Target and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I think it would be very good for damaged hair or thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I brought both the shampoo and conditioner and it left my families hair silky, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very course wavy/slightly curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of different products, including Nexxus for curls, and for the price range this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really think about it when I purchased this</li>
            <li> but this conditioner smells very perfumey and girly.</li>
            <li> I could really smell it during the day.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The thing about these products is that I really can&#x27;t tell if the keratin is making a difference.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have a wavy to straight hair</li>
            <li> : very rich&lt;br /&gt;Scent:</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product line, would recommend for an affordable high quality conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hair is that hair that wants to be curly, but can&#x27;t make the commitment-</li>
            <li> Tresemme Karatin Smooth Conditioner left my hair at awe!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this conditioner is a great value and definitely recommend it for those with coarse or frizzy hair that needs to be tamed.</li>
            <li> that I can&#x27;t really style it feeling.  </li>
            <li> Also, I really like the floral scent of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipped fast, with no problems.</li>
            <li> , I get straight, controlled</li>
            <li> I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several new conditioners in recent months, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this TreSemme one.</li>
            <li> Both of us have used their other shampoos and are satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I had been excited about the keratin being included in the conditioner and over time it may actually help out the over all health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I experienced zero frizz reduction using this product, and in the little difference of tangled-ness (I know it&#x27;s not a word, but you know what I mean) that I saw, it almost seemed like I had more tangles and more knots after using this product than if I had just shampooed my hair, rinsed, and dried.</li>
            <li> As an almost daily swimmer, my hair gets dry and fried constantly, and a great conditioner is a must.  </li>
            <li> Once dry, my hair continues to be easy to brush and it looks shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my stylist noticed the difference in texture since I started using this product she informed me that keratin is for hair that is already very damaged and in need of keratin, if your hair is already healthy it will only do the opposite and ruin the hair because its to much protein...</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong fragrance, because if you are sensitive to chemicals like I am, it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair.</li>
            <li> It would take more time than I had in the morning to wait for my straight iron to heat and repeatedly run it through my hair only to have the frizz return later in the day.  </li>
            <li> But I most likely won&#x27;t purchase another bottle of this because of the waxy build up and the fact that no matter how much rinsing you do - your hair still feels as if there is still product left in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price for this product is currently near the MSRP of $5.99, which is a pretty good deal already, but I&#x27;ve been watching the price at my local grocery store and have actually seen it as amazingly low as $3.50!</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and tart like green apples, I have very fine naturally blonde hair</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the sweet floral scent, especially since it seems to linger.</li>
            <li> I blow dry hot then flat iron and my hair is still healthy.</li>
            <li> I plan on giving others a shot, but I do really like what this has done thus far!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> these reasons, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> No wonder it is rated so high..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner seemed to give my hair a little more volume, without the craziness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the only thing you need (the serum is a nice extra touch though).</li>
            <li> fragrance is nice and not overpowering in the least.</li>
            <li> The smell was lovely and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I just let it warm up slowly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on some of the other reviews, it looks like reactions are mixed, but we have only good things to say about this combo.  </li>
            <li> For the last few months I&#x27;ve been using a Nexxus conditioner that works wonderfully but costs almost $15 a bottle, so I was amazed to find that Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin conditioner works nearly as well at less than 1/5th of the price!</li>
            <li> I started using TreSemme Keratin Smooth instead of the other TreSemme conditioner I had.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be my new conditioner of choice for that reason.  </li>
            <li> I live in Houston, Home of the Friz, and even in 98% humidity</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice too, subtle and doesn&#x27;t overpower anything.</li>
            <li> I makes your hair very soft, I would recommend that you use the shampoo with it.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft!</li>
            <li> I never have soft hair, NEVER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner along with its corresponding shampoo ([[ASIN:B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]]) for a few weeks now and it does a nice job managing my thick and wavy hair that tends to frizz.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic conditioner.</li>
            <li> conditioner is a little thicker than some, but it easily works into the hair.</li>
            <li> The products have also made my scalp itchy and the scent of the shampoo and conditioner is a little strong.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and a comb runs right through it with no tangles after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I realize that is actually a feature that others find as a positive and a reason to buy.  </li>
            <li> my braids were not stiff but they moved.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that after half a bottle the conditioning effects are starting to lessen, though I suspect if I take a break from this conditioner for a while and come back to it, it will be good again.</li>
            <li> One small annoyance with the large bottle I was provided for review is that the Tresemme 25 ounce container is a bit large in diameter to grip easily in the shower if your hands are not very large.</li>
            <li> Very thick and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I noticed some frizz improvement but compared to my Tresemme moisture rich conditioner this left my hair quite dry</li>
            <li> I shower at night, and in the morning when I wake up and my hair is dry, it&#x27;s under a lot more control than with any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a huge bottle with just a few bucks.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves my hair soft and smoother than if I had used a regular conditioner, so I&#x27;d say it works very well for a brand that isn&#x27;t from a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using almond oil and this conditioner and WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny like it was before I dyed it.</li>
            <li> and my hair is so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old</li>
            <li> (I wear my hair natural)</li>
            <li> conditioner leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell but there is simply too much of it.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> and instead it was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for all naturals looking for a staple product, even if you are protein sensitive like I am.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast but the breakage is keeping it the same length.</li>
            <li> and I have seen far fewer split ends, if any at all.  </li>
            <li> I think I will stick to my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> just ran out of the shampoo and while waiting for my order to arrive from Amazon (much cheaper than purchasing locally)</li>
            <li> I know not everyone feels the same way, but I really don&#x27;t want to be part of that.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft, manageable, and so silky.</li>
            <li> This Tresemme really surprised me.</li>
            <li> The curls were well defined and on the tighter side and held all day, but were soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> it looks like one of those professional bottles they use in salons, rather than a consumer</li>
            <li> Personally, this Tresemme conditioner is really a bargain.</li>
            <li> It produced a head of soft and well-conditioned hair.  </li>
            <li> As soon as i applied this product to my natural hair</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where humidity and frizz are major issues in my life.</li>
            <li> B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]] not only rinses well, but it also leaves my hair soft and with less frizz.</li>
            <li> She recommended that I alternate between the keratin products and a product high in moisture.  </li>
            <li> Only conditioner that makes my hair feel smoother, fresher, free of frizz, and 50% less tangles.</li>
            <li> I usually use Suave humectant, but that was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is thick, I tend to use two to three times the amount of conditioner compared to what I use of shampoo, but with this, I&#x27;ve found I need a lesser amount than with others, which is a nice surprise (the same goes for the shampoo).</li>
            <li> When I blow dry it, it&#x27;s so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I use only towards the ends of my hair strands, to keep my scalp free of heavy stuff.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big negative for me because I can&#x27;t tolerate overwhelming smells.  </li>
            <li> Really, though, that&#x27;s not much of a complaint, and I wore my hair down instead of in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely oily, so I don&#x27;t need tons of water to wash it off my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry and course and damaged due to all the damaging product and heat, but this stuff made my hair shiny, soft, and very pretty.</li>
            <li> Usually, if I were to review a conditioner product, it would not be anything special.  </li>
            <li> It left it really soft.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft, put curls back in it, and when I washed it and braided it</li>
            <li> I recently combed my 1 year old dreadlocks out-</li>
            <li> When I use all three together my hair is soft, shiny and smooth without the frizz that is so common in the humid southern part of the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use the same shampoo and conditioner every time I wash my hair, but decided I&#x27;ll only use Tresemme&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Keratin helps with occasional use of conditioner when hair feel rough or too clean feeling or stands up or too volume when air is dry like hot dry Summer day or dry Winter weather.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, though, the hair feels conditioned, and not over conditioned and that kind of \\&quot;artificial\\&quot; soft other conditioners leave behind.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my hair afterward had that it&#x27;s so clean and soft</li>
            <li> Because I like this conditioner so much, I decided to give the other Tresemme conditioners a try, and none of them compare to this one.  </li>
            <li> first, I thought it took away some of the fullness/volume at the roots, but it came right back when I blow dried for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> And I had to clean up all the mess it cost for the other products.</li>
            <li> when I used a palm-sized mountain of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually one to leave reviews-whether they be positive or negative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 6 months and my ends were always dry and puffy.</li>
            <li> But when I received he package, I found out that it only left about half of the whole.</li>
            <li> i think it puts a little too much keratin in your hair  </li>
            <li> I put a little in my hair after I get out of shower and really really helps with split ends</li>
            <li> Over the last month, our house has tried a wide range of shampoo/conditioner combos, and Tresemme is one of the clear winners.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and Spanish and my hair tends to get very dry and breaks so much.</li>
            <li> Now the new Keratin conditioner helps her to brush her hair easier with less tangles.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, kinky red hair, and this takes soooo much of the frizz out!</li>
            <li> so I skipped the leave in products that I normally have to cover my hair with to control the frizz and get a little softness.</li>
            <li> generally not what I&#x27;m looking for) but YMMV.</li>
            <li> and I have always had dry, coarse, frizzy hair UNTIL today</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using a $30 conditioner on my dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have massive amounts of thick, very curly hair, and we both use this conditioner both to remove knots and as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The one qualm I would have is the bottle design--it is very slippery, especially when your hands are already wet and slick with water/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair, I color it, and blow dry it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s no longer on Subscribe and Save for 4.78 or whatever it was, now it&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> Plus this stuff lasts a long time and smells like dreams and wishes.</li>
            <li> It leaves even my heavily treated hair soft, shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> then I recently started to notice my hair was thinning, and became brittle, and very dry!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say I see some big difference after using this product, comparing to any other conditioner I&#x27;ve in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have to wash my hair every other day when I use this product (with the shampoo)</li>
            <li> My hair is even easier to blow dry when using this in conjunction with the shampoo and 7 day treatment.</li>
            <li> My ends were no longer dry</li>
            <li> It is now dry, frizzy and the products are stripping my color out.</li>
            <li> My hair type is long, naturally curly and color treated, so my biggest issue is usually dryness.</li>
            <li> I am a black &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; female whose hair had been mistreated by me for a long time and therefore it was damaged and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy hair that I round brush to shape and smooth, and I&#x27;m always looking for products that help make this tedious job easier.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a chemical scent to it that is pretty unappealing.</li>
            <li> only down side is that I have read a couple articles saying that you shouldn&#x27;t always use Keratin products on your hair every single day</li>
            <li> I will purchase this stuff as long as I can get my hands on it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll base my review on feedback from my housemate and from my own limited experience with my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried every other product, expensive, inexpensive, and mid-range, to calm my coarse, frizzy, tangled mess of curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before trying these products I was unable to manage the straight hair cut my teen talked me into getting.  </li>
            <li> I bought the one that had the pump and the pump hasn&#x27;t got jammed at all</li>
            <li> a big ol&#x27; bottle of heavy &#x27;cone conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I can only use it once every few days</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair shiney and not just because its wet.</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser always tries to sell me the $50 set of keratin stuff.</li>
            <li> The number of times the bottle has fallen out of my hands is kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very little with this product to have results.</li>
            <li> I could tell as soon as I had this conditioner in my hands that it was different from anything else I have EVER tried in the past which includes other brands of Keratin shampoos, conditioners &amp; treatments.</li>
            <li> products work extremely well.</li>
            <li> In both scenarios it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> The other benefit?</li>
            <li> The second is that it left no residue on my relaxed shoulder length thick hair (when I wear a \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot; that&#x27;s air dried).</li>
            <li> I think you can use this every other shampoo but not EVERY shampoo</li>
            <li> I just want to say how extremely displeased I am with these products.</li>
            <li> I just need a conditioner to detangle well, moisturize and not leave my hair limp, weighed down or flat.</li>
            <li> The last reason is that there was little to no frizz after my hair air dried.</li>
            <li> It was dry, frizzy, and just dead.</li>
            <li> I have very thick full hair, but my strands are thin.</li>
            <li> Average I think, or a bit below&lt;br /&gt;Results</li>
            <li> - however I believe that is because my hair was covered with a thick waxy buildup that reminds me of the conditioners I used to use back in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is colored, thick, and coarse.  </li>
            <li> We can leave it in our slightly-coarse curls without them drying greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I can now wear my hair down after the shower without putting gobs of product in my hair to keep it from looking like a bird&#x27;s nest...  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all, just smooths everything out.</li>
            <li> My hair is down to my waist, layered and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other conditioners and nothing was helping.</li>
            <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t do anything my previous one couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Has a slight scent to it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my damaged hair feeling less crunchy</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair got less frizzy</li>
            <li> I had jet black hair and color it a auburn brown</li>
            <li> my curls look significantly less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Typically I can keep my hair straightened for two days without having to wash</li>
            <li> and this helps make it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This 25 ounce bottle costs much less than a 8.5 ounce bottle of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCreme Nourishing</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t like products that claim to be volumizing because they seem to make my hair go haywire and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that is slightly damaged by highlights and</li>
            <li> After use my hair did seem less frizzy</li>
            <li> They all leave them limp, crusty, frizzy, or shapeless, including Tresemme&#x27;s other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Cap was on tight, unlike my shampoo.  </li>
            <li> LITTLE DISSAPOINTED..</li>
            <li> I just squirt a little into a 10oz spray bottle, fill the rest with water, add about 1/2 a teaspoon of olive oil and shake it.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time, maybe a little frozen.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I want other people thinking I smell like a garden of daises and butterflies.</li>
            <li> A little spray-in conditioner and a comb through</li>
            <li> and it killed my hair.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not too watery or too heavy.</li>
            <li> My husband actually came up behind me while I was cooking supper at 7pm and told me my hair smelled</li>
            <li> The hair around my face broke off so bad and is now starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> stylist did warn that too much keratin can be a bad thing though.  </li>
            <li> than it was in the past.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to try the Moroccan oil shampoo as it’s got rave reviews.</li>
            <li> made my hair seem softer than usual</li>
            <li> I usually buy salon brands (Redken &amp; Pureology)</li>
            <li> The directions suggest leaving it in for two to three minutes, which is a minute longer than what I usually see on conditioning instructions.</li>
            <li> She usually leaves the conditioner in for about 15 minutes, washes it out, then blow dries her hair.  </li>
            <li> Who knew Tresemme worked so well on black hair?!!</li>
            <li> It also has a weird chemical smell that I am not particularly fond of.</li>
            <li> They do not look anywhere near as bad as before just one wash.</li>
            <li> Not fluffy in a bad way</li>
            <li> The worst part is the amount of time it takes to rinse out of my hair, it seems to take forever before I feel my hair is free of conditioner.</li>
            <li> and my hair is slowly getting softer, and stronger.</li>
            <li> If you use all three, I&#x27;m almost positive you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin now and it&#x27;s usually very thick.</li>
            <li> Back then they dried and damaged my hair terribly</li>
            <li> made my hair thin and fall out all over the place...</li>
            <li> It actually \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair even when it&#x27;s dirty, so even when my hair might look like crap and needs washed, it at least doesn&#x27;t smell like it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed considering I&#x27;ve been a long-time fan of Tresemme products due to their (usual) salon quality results in conjunction with their drugstore prices.</li>
            <li> It unfortunately has a very heavy fragrance that I find unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive shampoo and conditional but after reading reviews of Tresemme, decided to give it a try and</li>
            <li> Ill spray this on after I get out of the shower and when I style my hair.  </li>
            <li> your hair becomes like nylon and breaks in a weird way when it breaks off  if it breaks off at all  </li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed with this product, solely because it was very difficult for me to see a difference between the results in the following circumstances:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Just wrong  bad Amazon</li>
            <li> I do not have anything bad t say about it at all.</li>
            <li> It smells just like real expensive salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I am used to being disappointed with hair products.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner in conjunction with the matching shampoo: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it was awful</li>
            <li> This is the worst system I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I guess my hair just doesn&#x27;t like keratin because after using this product for about 2 months my hair is horrible!</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks now and they have both made my hair look terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Usually, if I were to review a conditioner product, it would not be anything special.  Conditioner either does its job or it doesn&#x27;t.  So I&#x27;m bizarrely satisfied with this conditioner.  It works surprisingly well on my long hair, leaving it really nice and smooth and easy to work with.  The one qualm I would have is the bottle design--it is very slippery, especially when your hands are already wet and slick with water/conditioner.  The number of times the bottle has fallen out of my hands is kind of annoying.  But other than that, the product does its job, and Tresemme is a decent company when it comes to social/environmental aspects, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Title pretty much sums it up. This conditioner didn&#x27;t do anything my previous one couldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s an okay item. Sometimes it seems to make my hair look weighted, like it doesn&#x27;t rinse out well. Will keep using until the bottle runs out, but probably won&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Split End Remedy Shampoo by Tresemme. It made my hair feel soft! I used to use mane n tail but likewise I also like this conditioner. Godbless!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. moisturizes my hair without leaving a greasy feeling.  Has a slight scent to it. Keeps my damaged hair feeling less crunchy</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair got less frizzy and I can manage it better. It left it really soft. I used this with the shampoo as well. It does wonders!</li>
            <li> i loved this product the first time I used it...then I started to lose my hair after the 2nd and 3rd times so I quit...made my hair thin and fall out all over the place...it was awful</li>
            <li> This is the worst system I have tried.  I have the whole line and it is more like 1 hour straight!  the organix keratin line works much better.</li>
            <li> And I have a wife who has worked for a salon distributing company for 7 years so that&#x27;s saying something when even she likes it!</li>
            <li> I have wavy Caucasian hair that will friz in certain conditions.  I have used this with and without the shampoo and I love it.  My hair looks so great after using this product, no frizzies and easy to manage.  I would not use this everyday though, because I think it would cause too much buildup.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this conditioner, it was very cheap and left my hair feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> this is very good conditioner.  it&#x27;s reasonably price and does good on my hair.  love products like this.  try it.</li>
            <li> I get better results with L&#x27;Oreal Eversleek. I will give it this - it results in great movement and bounce (generally not what I&#x27;m looking for) but YMMV.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have massive amounts of thick, very curly hair, and we both use this conditioner both to remove knots and as a leave-in conditioner.  It&#x27;s great at getting out knots and defrizzing, and has a lovely scent.  We can leave it in our slightly-coarse curls without them drying greasy or weighed down. The price is a no brainer too.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast am happy with product.</li>
            <li> I have heat damaged and color treatment hair. I&#x27;m black and Spanish and my hair tends to get very dry and breaks so much. It&#x27;s a 3b hair type. I started using almond oil and this conditioner and WOW. My hair is soft and shiny like it was before I dyed it. I had jet black hair and color it a auburn brown and it killed my hair. It was dry, frizzy, and just dead. I just leave this on for 10 minutes rinse it and my hair is so silky and soft. Not tangled at all. When I blow dry it, it&#x27;s so much easier and faster. People complimented me after I used this. And the bottle is huge and not expensive at all!</li>
            <li> I have wavy (kinda curly), medium thickness hair. If I use this when I wear my hair curly this works fine and my curls look significantly less frizzy. However, when I used this before straightening my hair it makes my hair feel and look like it has a film of grease on it. Typically I can keep my hair straightened for two days without having to wash but when I used this conditioner before straightening I felt like I had to wash it out immediately. Also, it has a chemical scent to it that is pretty unappealing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the whole keratin smooth line and this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s actually the only thing you need (the serum is a nice extra touch though). This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free with lots of shine. My hair stays manageable and looks great all day. I use this with various brands of shampoo and i always get the same results - great looking/feeling hair. Plus for the price this is a steal!</li>
            <li> This product works well. I brought both the shampoo and conditioner and it left my families hair silky, shiny and smooth. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner about a week ago and love it! I bought the one that had the pump and the pump hasn&#x27;t got jammed at all and it has a lock function. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very thick full hair, but my strands are thin. A lot of moisturizing/smoothing conditioners weigh down my hair, but I have found this one to be perfect. My hair is even easier to blow dry when using this in conjunction with the shampoo and 7 day treatment. It is also a GREAT deal here on Amazon compared to in store prices!</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and I have always had dry, coarse, frizzy hair UNTIL today (: I used the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Conditioner along with another brand of shampoo that I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with but I was trying to use it up before I began using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo. I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner. I could tell as soon as I had this conditioner in my hands that it was different from anything else I have EVER tried in the past which includes other brands of Keratin shampoos, conditioners &amp; treatments. I&#x27;ve tried Wen, Biolage - everything and nothing has come close to this product. I don&#x27;t what&#x27;s in this stuff but I love it! It&#x27;s extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY. I have Lupus and I wasn&#x27;t feeling well so I skipped the leave in products that I normally have to cover my hair with to control the frizz and get a little softness. I fell asleep with my hair still damp. When I awoke I could not believe it was MY hair on my head! I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair. I kept saying to my self &#x27;&#x27;this can&#x27;t be MY hair!&amp;#34;. I never have soft hair, NEVER! I am so excited that I&#x27;ve decided to toss the rest of my old shampoo out so that I can begin using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo along with the conditioner. I will purchase this stuff as long as I can get my hands on it!!</li>
            <li> It just is what it is...a big ol&#x27; bottle of heavy &#x27;cone conditioner. Wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong fragrance, because if you are sensitive to chemicals like I am, it&#x27;s overpowering. It&#x27;s economy conditioner, does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this product smells amazing. I&#x27;ve loved the smell from day one of opening the package. However, I was very disappointed with this product, solely because it was very difficult for me to see a difference between the results in the following circumstances:&lt;br /&gt;1) when I used this product&lt;br /&gt;2) when I did not use any conditioner at all&lt;br /&gt;3) when I used a palm-sized mountain of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually one to leave reviews-whether they be positive or negative. But I honestly just felt this was necessary. I experienced zero frizz reduction using this product, and in the little difference of tangled-ness (I know it&#x27;s not a word, but you know what I mean) that I saw, it almost seemed like I had more tangles and more knots after using this product than if I had just shampooed my hair, rinsed, and dried. Very disappointed considering I&#x27;ve been a long-time fan of Tresemme products due to their (usual) salon quality results in conjunction with their drugstore prices. Back to aisles for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it made my hair &amp;#34;move&amp;#34;.  I am a black &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; female whose hair had been mistreated by me for a long time and therefore it was damaged and dry.  This product made my hair soft, put curls back in it, and when I washed it and braided it (I wear my hair natural) my braids were not stiff but they moved.  This, however, was only one product that I used in order to bring my hair back to life.  At first I was using it every time I washed my hair, now I use it every 2 weeks, and eventually it will be once a month.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the TRESemme Expert Selection - Keratin Smooth 7 Day Smooth System - Heat Activated Treatment you need to. It&#x27;s a serum you put in your hair after washing it and then run your straightener over to seal the product. It works AMAZING! That product IS NOT this product, but is a companion product to this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products work extremely well. I use the condition in conjunction with the Keratin 7 Day Smooth System and on it&#x27;s own. In both scenarios it works extremely well. This is my favorite conditioner that I currently have in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner leaves your hair soft and silky. It does wonder for frizz control. I live in Florida where humidity and frizz are major issues in my life. This conditioner does a wonderful job at controlling the frizz and keeping my hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that I have read a couple articles saying that you shouldn&#x27;t always use Keratin products on your hair every single day so I rotate between this and another TRESemme conditioner. My hair is never as good on the days without the Keratin Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly this conditioner is a bit pricey on here. It&#x27;s about 5 dollars on Target so head to the store and pick it up there.</li>
            <li> good value and luv this product, in fact i just bought 2 more bottles.. it helps nourish and restore our hair&#x27;s moisture</li>
            <li> Well, the product itself is pretty to my taste. But when I received he package, I found out that it only left about half of the whole. And I had to clean up all the mess it cost for the other products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone whose hair is frizzy.  I have curly hair that tends to frizz.  I use this conditioner and it smooths it right out.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I usually use Suave humectant, but that was no longer available.  I gave this conditioner a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works about as good as any budget brand. It unfortunately has a very heavy fragrance that I find unpleasant. It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell but there is simply too much of it. Every time I try it, I feel like I am trapped on an elevator with an elderly woman wearing entirely too much perfume.</li>
            <li> Made hair smooth and healthy</li>
            <li> Saw a big difference immediately and so did everybody else. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Wow. I have tried every other product, expensive, inexpensive, and mid-range, to calm my coarse, frizzy, tangled mess of curls. They all leave them limp, crusty, frizzy, or shapeless, including Tresemme&#x27;s other conditioners. But this conditioner has now been my tried and true for years. I keep going back to it. My high-end stylist thinks I am some hair product expert because my hair always looks amazing. I keep telling him I know nothing about products, I use $5 Tresemme, he can&#x27;t believe it. I hope they never stop making this one.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy. I am an every day conditioner kind of person. I like the light scent of this conditioner and the way that it smooths my hair. The consistency is not too watery or too heavy. It gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down and minimizes frizz. One small annoyance with the large bottle I was provided for review is that the Tresemme 25 ounce container is a bit large in diameter to grip easily in the shower if your hands are not very large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 6 months and my ends were always dry and puffy. I have 3c/4a hair and this is my miracle. I used it as a deep conditioner for an hour (with honey and extra virgin olive oil because I have low porosity hair). My ends were no longer dry and instead it was soft and manageable. I recommend this for all naturals looking for a staple product, even if you are protein sensitive like I am. And the smell is omg.. Amazing. It smells just like real expensive salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has changed my life, its amazing, it really works , I love it !</li>
            <li> love it. cheap and it works. I used to use expensive shampoo and conditional but after reading reviews of Tresemme, decided to give it a try and so glan I got this.</li>
            <li> smells good, it is a good conditioning, make brillant my hair, protects it, it is nice, i will buy it again</li>
            <li> I guess my hair just doesn&#x27;t like keratin because after using this product for about 2 months my hair is horrible! I&#x27;ve always been told that I have beautiful hair and it&#x27;s always been so full of life. The first time I used it I thought it was great but as the keratin builds up in your hair that&#x27;s when the breakage started. My hair is so thin now and it&#x27;s usually very thick. I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it and I have tons of split ends now. The hair around my face broke off so bad and is now starting to grow back. I now have bangs! I definitely didn&#x27;t plan to have them but now that I stopped using it my hair is growing back finally. I had my hair cut a couple of months ago and it still is the same length! My hair grows fast but the breakage is keeping it the same length. This product isn&#x27;t good and I think most people will find that they don&#x27;t need keratin in their hair. I&#x27;m going back to Redken.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been on the oily side.  Even though I&#x27;m not a teenager anymore, I still have oily hair.  However, I still need to use conditioner after each shampoo.  I use only towards the ends of my hair strands, to keep my scalp free of heavy stuff.  This way my scalp is happy, and my hair ends are supple with no split ends.  Detangles in the process too.  Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. Works pretty good. Still I prefer Dove and Pantene but since I alternate between brands this one works fine.</li>
            <li> LITTLE DISSAPOINTED..WAS HOPING IT WOULD MOISTURIZE MY HAIR MUCH MORE</li>
            <li> I have very course wavy/slightly curly hair and I am used to being disappointed with hair products. I recently combed my 1 year old dreadlocks out- so my hair was even more frazzled and angry than it was in the past.  In search of a new shampoo/conditioner routine I saw the good reviews for Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth and decided to give the conditioner a try in conjunction with their Anti- Breakage shampoo. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.  I love the scent which lasts all day, but more importantly, it manages to calm my extreme frizz. Because I like this conditioner so much, I decided to give the other Tresemme conditioners a try, and none of them compare to this one.  Detangling my hair in the shower with it is a breeze.  Keratin smooth also works great as a leave- in conditioner.  I just squirt a little into a 10oz spray bottle, fill the rest with water, add about 1/2 a teaspoon of olive oil and shake it.  Ill spray this on after I get out of the shower and when I style my hair.  The ends of my hair stay so smooth and moisturized and I have seen far fewer split ends, if any at all.  All around great product!  I hope this never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner a lot! I use it with the shampoo and it&#x27;s perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;my hair is much softer! I also have dandruff and for some reason since I started using this conditioner and shampoo my scalp is not itchy! I love this and will definitely keep using it :)</li>
            <li> I have thick, kinky red hair, and this takes soooo much of the frizz out! I love it!! I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends and family with similar problems. I also use Garnier curl calm down, and it works amazingly together!</li>
            <li> I makes your hair very soft, I would recommend that you use the shampoo with it. You only need a very little with this product to have results.</li>
            <li> I like shiny things. Now my hair is shiny. I am eternally happy. Plus this stuff lasts a long time and smells like dreams and wishes.</li>
            <li> Only conditioner that makes my hair feel smoother, fresher, free of frizz, and 50% less tangles. Amazing. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s no longer on Subscribe and Save for 4.78 or whatever it was, now it&#x27;s ridiculously overpriced. I&#x27;d rather pay the 5-6 dollars for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works great  but I don&#x27;t understand how they can change the price like that. I will purchase from CVS for 4.50 same size not 10 something. Just wrong  bad Amazon</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the middle winter in Michigan. It arrived on time, maybe a little frozen. No worries I just let it warm up slowly and it was fantastic. I will always order from amazon. the price was cheeper here than even my local box store.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that this is the first keratin product I&#x27;ve used-- I plan on giving others a shot, but I do really like what this has done thus far! I have naturally super curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile now. I&#x27;ve used a ton of different products, including Nexxus for curls, and for the price range this stuff is fantastic. My hair is less frizzy, more manageable, and very soft... and, like I said, I saved a fair amount of pocket change.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is ok - leaves your hair feeling nice, but my hair is used to slightly more higher end products (pureology). And so I use this or mix it is with a bit of pureology, for more budget friendly hair washing.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the Tresemme shampoo and it made my hair shiny and managable.and that is almost a miracle!  Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! My hair silky and smooth after I use this. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave any oily residue.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with wavy hair that can be pretty frizzy. I noticed some frizz improvement but compared to my Tresemme moisture rich conditioner this left my hair quite dry and overall I find the moisture rich is the better conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other tresemme products don&#x27;t exactly smell manly but they&#x27;re quite pleasant and neutral so I didn&#x27;t really think about it when I purchased this but this conditioner smells very perfumey and girly. The smell is quite strong too so when I wavy my hair around I could really smell it during the day. I don&#x27;t mind it but I&#x27;m not sure if I want other people thinking I smell like a garden of daises and butterflies.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this conditioner. I am Afric-American with semi natural(coarse but not kinky) hair with many tangles.  After towel drying am able to comb out without any additional product-which never happens even for conditioners that claim to detangle/soften hair.  The smell is amazing too. I have already repurchased so will have enough supply for quite some time.  Anxious to try the Moroccan oil shampoo as it’s got rave reviews. Who knew Tresemme worked so well on black hair?!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would help smooth out the frizzies, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all. It also has a weird chemical smell that I am not particularly fond of. My hair is still poofy and now it smells funky too. I think I will stick to my old conditioner.</li>
            <li> smells nice, seems to make hair more combable; generally good conditioner.  Kids like it too.  I have somewhat fine hair and this helps make it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Really strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Have some thinning hair and thought this might help.  After some research,  Keratin is suppose to help with this. Although a good conditioner don&#x27;t expect Any thing like Rogain</li>
            <li> made my hair seem softer than usual</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and tart like green apples, I have very fine naturally blonde hair so I can only use it once every few days or it gets greasy but when I do use it my hair is super soft :)</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, especially if your hair is suffering from heat and other damage.&lt;br /&gt;great amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]] with and without [[ASIN:B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00AO4EBOI Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum, 3.3 Ounce]].  When I use all three together my hair is soft, shiny and smooth without the frizz that is so common in the humid southern part of the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying these products I was unable to manage the straight hair cut my teen talked me into getting.  It would take more time than I had in the morning to wait for my straight iron to heat and repeatedly run it through my hair only to have the frizz return later in the day.  Now that I&#x27;m using all three Tresemme Keratin Smooth products I can brush and go in the morning.  If I have to use a straight iron at all now it is just for a few minutes to turn the ends of my hair under the way I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ran out of the shampoo and while waiting for my order to arrive from Amazon (much cheaper than purchasing locally) I used a different shampoo with this conditioner.  The frizz returned after one shampoo.  I highly recommend this conditioner but use it with the shampoo and serum for best results.</li>
            <li> This is a large amount of conditioner for a very good price - the bottle is huge.  I&#x27;ve heard so much about Keratin infused products and how good they are for your hair I wanted to try this.  The thing about these products is that I really can&#x27;t tell if the keratin is making a difference.  It leaves the hair soft and smooth as it says but I don&#x27;t know about a long-term improvement to the health of my hair.  The one thing that I find bothersome is the super strong scent.  That&#x27;s a big negative for me because I can&#x27;t tolerate overwhelming smells.  I realize that is actually a feature that others find as a positive and a reason to buy.  It is a nice smell, it is just very, very strong and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;.  It won&#x27;t be my new conditioner of choice for that reason.  I would like to keep trying to see if the keratin makes a noticeable difference over time, but I just don&#x27;t like that feature.</li>
            <li> I relly like this product. Nice scent, and it leaves my hair softer and silkier than with most conditioner. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner along with its corresponding shampoo ([[ASIN:B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]]) for a few weeks now and it does a nice job managing my thick and wavy hair that tends to frizz. I like to change things up a lot, so I normally don&#x27;t use the same shampoo and conditioner every time I wash my hair, but decided I&#x27;ll only use Tresemme&#x27;s so I could give it a good trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice and not overpowering in the least. It actually \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair even when it&#x27;s dirty, so even when my hair might look like crap and needs washed, it at least doesn&#x27;t smell like it. Since my hair is thick, I tend to use two to three times the amount of conditioner compared to what I use of shampoo, but with this, I&#x27;ve found I need a lesser amount than with others, which is a nice surprise (the same goes for the shampoo). This is one big bottle, so that makes it an even better deal in my eyes. The conditioner has to be left on for two to three minutes for it to properly condition hair. The worst part is the amount of time it takes to rinse out of my hair, it seems to take forever before I feel my hair is free of conditioner. However, it leaves my hair soft and smoother than if I had used a regular conditioner, so I&#x27;d say it works very well for a brand that isn&#x27;t from a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem comes from the fact that Unilever (who own Tresemme) tests on animals. I&#x27;ve been moving more and more away from giving money to companies who contribute to animal suffering, so I doubt I&#x27;ll be getting this again. I know not everyone feels the same way, but I really don&#x27;t want to be part of that.</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair. This has made my hair so healthy, shiney &amp; smooth. I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I tried the whole Tresemme Keratin Smooth system (shampoo, conditioner and serum) and I was blown away.  My hair was smooth, soft, shiny and manageable, with no frizz.  AND, my hair looked great for 3 days!  I was even more amazed by the price!  This 25 ounce bottle costs much less than a 8.5 ounce bottle of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCreme Nourishing Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist did warn that too much keratin can be a bad thing though.  She said that keratin makes your hair strong but it can make it too strong.  In fact, too much keratin can make your hair so strong it becomes brittle.  She recommended that I alternate between the keratin products and a product high in moisture.  Sounds like a good plan.</li>
            <li> I love this Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin conditioner along with its matching shampoo for my color-treated pixie haircut. Only been using a few weeks as of the writing of this review but it is just a wonderful conditioner and leaves my hair very soft and clean..... Plan to use the entire bottle. Smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using Tresemme since they first became a company. I love their low price and salon quality, you can not get better for the price. It leaves your hair so much more tangled free,and managable. It leaves your hair shiney and not just because its wet. This will keep the shine in while its drying. I used while blow drying and it was still managble as well as shiny looking. This also smells great. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> I have a wavy to straight hair and I can&#x27;t say I see some big difference after using this product, comparing to any other conditioner I&#x27;ve in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: very rich&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Nice, a bit too sweet for my taste&lt;br /&gt;Price: Average I think, or a bit below&lt;br /&gt;Results: On par with most hair conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all there I can say about it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll base my review on feedback from my housemate and from my own limited experience with my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen my housemate&#x27;s hair become luxurious and shiney. In my own experience, my beard is softer and its natural curl has been activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very nice, makes my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> I have no made any purchase for this item online, however I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and 7 day heat treatment. I have to say that jut after one use of each, I LOVE IT! My hair is so dry and course and damaged due to all the damaging product and heat, but this stuff made my hair shiny, soft, and very pretty. I also noticed that my split ends were totally invisible!! They do not look anywhere near as bad as before just one wash. I immediately got compliments from tons of people, even some who don&#x27;t even know me!! If you use all three, I&#x27;m almost positive you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Also, you can buy this at your local drug store, or Walmart. I really really love this product and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s hair is like mine, or even just naturally frizzy an curly. Works amazing wonders!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the TRUTH for my relaxed hair! It leaves my hair feeling so s</li>
            <li> In tandem with Tresemme Keratin Shampoo, the Tresemme Keratin conditioner works with great result, smoother and shinier hair.  My hair is medium thickness and straight, while my wife is a bit more oily and at shoulder length.  Both of us have used their other shampoos and are satisfied with the results.  Now the new Keratin conditioner helps her to brush her hair easier with less tangles.  My hair also looks shiny and healthier and easy to shape.  The other benefit? its great for our pockets too.</li>
            <li> I used this &amp;#34;Infusing Conditioner&amp;#34; immediately after the Keratin Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was just sufficient, nothing special.  It didn&#x27;t lather but got my hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just a palm-sized amount of this lotion-y formula, too and left it on for about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was expecting more.  I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in the end result to greatly recommend this over Dove&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care or even Suave and Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it does do what it claims.</li>
            <li> Tresemm&amp;eacute; Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner is an okay conditioner. It&#x27;s creamy but it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the sweet floral scent, especially since it seems to linger. I am also not at all convinced that it works miracles for frizzy hair. It does come in a generous 25 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair, I color it, and blow dry it but that&#x27;s it my hair is usually very soft and healthy, I saw the tv commercial for it and thought I can&#x27;t wait for it to come out, as soon as it did I bought it. Before I only used dove. I used it for about a month then I recently started to notice my hair was thinning, and became brittle, and very dry! That part of my hair is shorter then the rest because of so much breaking, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was this product so I switched back to dove and my hair is slowly getting softer, and stronger. I went to my hair salon my stylist noticed the difference in texture since I started using this product she informed me that keratin is for hair that is already very damaged and in need of keratin, if your hair is already healthy it will only do the opposite and ruin the hair because its to much protein... I am now having to get deep conditioner shots trying to get my hair healthy enough to keep it from breaking off even more</li>
            <li> I love changing up shampoos and conditioners, and in the past have always liked Tresemme.  I have long, naturally straight, Caucasian hair and this product works great.  The smell is flowery but not nauseating, although a bit weaker smelling then the shampoo.  My hair is left feeling softer and smooth, I use it with the complimentary shampoo and also the smoothing serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product line, would recommend for an affordable high quality conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hair type is long, naturally curly and color treated, so my biggest issue is usually dryness. I tend to condition my hair every day, but only wash it every 2-3 days to keep it from drying out. For me a conditioner that rinses well, but still helps retain moisture in my hair is important. [[ASIN:B00AO4E9MC Tresemme Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce]] not only rinses well, but it also leaves my hair soft and with less frizz. All in all it&#x27;s a good conditioner to keep in my rotation of products and the price is very reasonable especially for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Cap was on tight, unlike my shampoo.  This also had a plastic bag when shipped.  Product is great, and it will last me for a long time!</li>
            <li> great conditioner I use it to mix my hairdye with I am very pleased with how fast I got it I would definitely order again</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using a $30 conditioner on my dry, damaged hair. It worked great, but the price was steep and once I stopped using it my hair turned into a complete damaged mess. (I&#x27;m convinced they put something in that conditioner that starves your hair if you stop using it, forcing you to keep buying it.) I tried a few other conditioners and nothing was helping. So I decided to give this stuff a try. I figured at $5, what do I have to lose? I have to say, this stuff is absolutely AMAZING. My hair is shiny, soft, manageable, and so silky. This is officially a staple for my hair care!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle at a great price!</li>
            <li> After several times of usage, my hair starts to become oily and it doesn&#x27;t bring the awesome looking when I put it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> Very good! Very thick and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love this, my hair is fried and this made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> As one knows , to switch products from time to time is best for your hair.  As with most things , I cannot find it in local stores...so I order online.  The product is great , smells wonderful and does wonders for your hair ,  however the packing of these items leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> My hair is that hair that wants to be curly, but can&#x27;t make the commitment- so it ends up frizzy, with lots of flyaways. This shampoo and conditioner has made all the difference in the world! I can now wear my hair down after the shower without putting gobs of product in my hair to keep it from looking like a bird&#x27;s nest...  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all, just smooths everything out. Definitely works fabulously for the price, and smells great too!</li>
            <li> I usually only put conditioner on the ends of my hair since I have fine hair that lacks body. This is a pretty heavy-duty conditioner, so it&#x27;s too much for me. I think it would be very good for damaged hair or thick, coarse hair. The fragrance is nice and it&#x27;s a good detangler.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Karatin Smooth Conditioner left my hair at awe! The white creamy texture after applying to each strand was just what my hair needed ! I was so relaxed in the shower that i applied this to build more product in my but truly its okay with jut the small dot.This lasted me a whole month to ! I do highly recommend buying , this was at the right price and gets the jobs done for frizzy thirsty curly hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Redken, but recently started looking into all this Keratin hype. I decided to give this a shot as it was cheap and had good reviews. It seems to work well, but the consistency and amount you need reminds me more of a cheaper box store brand than a higher end salon brand. All in all, good bang for the buck though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price and the purpose.  I needed a softening conditioner that did not make my hair feel greasy. It did exactly what I needed it to do for my long hair, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> We have used Tresemme products for years. They are a nice balance of price and quality. The Keratin Smooth Conditioner is wonderful. It has a nice vanilla scent and rich moisturizer. It leaves my hair soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I use Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Condition along with Tresemme Keratin Infusing Shampoo and my hair is looking strong and healthy. This condition along with the shampoo leaves my hair very soft and silky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is probably the best drug store brand product that I have bought in a long time. I usually buy salon brands (Redken &amp; Pureology) but I do try \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; ones now and then when something catches my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells REALLY good! I got my shower at 6am today and I can still smell it on my hair right now at 11pm. It isn&#x27;t strong and over powering, but you can smell it. My husband actually came up behind me while I was cooking supper at 7pm and told me my hair smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It detangles &amp; conditions superbly. I didn&#x27;t need huge piles of it, either. My hair is down to my waist, layered and wavy/curly. I go through A LOT of conditioner. This Tresemme really surprised me. My hair felt SO soft and so smooth while rinsing and after rinsing. It moisturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no buildup, even after using it for weeks on end. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down either. My hair actually seemed more ...hmmm.. \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; is the word that comes to mind. Not fluffy in a bad way though - it was light and bouncy and full of body in the bulk of the hair. I typically don&#x27;t like products that claim to be volumizing because they seem to make my hair go haywire and frizzy. This conditioner seemed to give my hair a little more volume, without the craziness. It looks and feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it took away some of the fullness/volume at the roots, but it came right back when I blow dried for a few minutes. I blow dry most days anyway, so that&#x27;s no issue at all. My curls and waves were perfect. Soft, smooth and bouncy. No fly-aways and no frizz - even on a rainy &amp; humid day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any added shine, but that was ok. I just need a conditioner to detangle well, moisturize and not leave my hair limp, weighed down or flat. This conditioner is pretty perfect in all areas. I do not have anything bad t say about it at all. No complaints or downfalls.</li>
            <li> When first using this conditioner, I wasn&#x27;t sure it had enough conditioning power. When you put it on, even if you use a lot it never feels like quite enough. After rinsing, though, the hair feels conditioned, and not over conditioned and that kind of \\&quot;artificial\\&quot; soft other conditioners leave behind. I shower at night, and in the morning when I wake up and my hair is dry, it&#x27;s under a lot more control than with any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used. A little spray-in conditioner and a comb through and I&#x27;m good to style as usual. The scent is really nice too, subtle and doesn&#x27;t overpower anything. My only gripe is that after half a bottle the conditioning effects are starting to lessen, though I suspect if I take a break from this conditioner for a while and come back to it, it will be good again.</li>
            <li> I only have to wash my hair every other day when I use this product (with the shampoo) It smells great and keeps the frizz out of my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I rated this conditioner 5 starts for several reasons. The first one is the light fragrance. The second is that it left no residue on my relaxed shoulder length thick hair (when I wear a \\&quot;wash and go\\&quot; that&#x27;s air dried). I purchased my (large) bottle at Target and it was reasonably priced. The last reason is that there was little to no frizz after my hair air dried. The curls were well defined and on the tighter side and held all day, but were soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;For these reasons, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Got it good will try it soon</li>
            <li> i think it puts a little too much keratin in your hair  your hair becomes like nylon and breaks in a weird way when it breaks off  if it breaks off at all  I think you can use this every other shampoo but not EVERY shampoo</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE, WORKS GOOD.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner!!! I go through two conditioners per shampoo - my hair is so silky and so soft and sooooo healthy!!! I put a little in my hair after I get out of shower and really really helps with split ends&lt;br /&gt;I have bleach blonde hair</li>
            <li> Love TRESemme products! Keratin Smooth works pretty well</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff. She buys it all the time, seems to be her go to conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same bottle of conditioner for six months; my hair is to my shoulders.  I don&#x27;t know why, but it lasts forever, looks good, acts good.  No wonder it is rated so high..</li>
            <li> I just want to say how extremely displeased I am with these products. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks now and they have both made my hair look terrible. It is now dry, frizzy and the products are stripping my color out. The description said this conditioner was safe for colored hair. The products have also made my scalp itchy and the scent of the shampoo and conditioner is a little strong. Such a waste. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Tresemme products have done a 180 degree turn around from when I first tried them years ago.  Back then they dried and damaged my hair terribly and I swore I would never try them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they have quietly introduced some new products, most notably, a line of conditioners, and I have been wowed by them.  This is another absolutely fantastic one.  I apply this in the shower after shampooing, leave it on for about two minutes, and am left with incredibly gorgeous hair.  It is smooth, silky, full of body, shine and life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a very large bottle, and is an excellent value considering all it does for my hair.  It&#x27;s so big it looks like one of those professional bottles they use in salons, rather than a consumer product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell this has protein in it, which my hair loves, by the way my hair comes back to life.  As an almost daily swimmer, my hair gets dry and fried constantly, and a great conditioner is a must.  This one I will take to the pool with me (in a smaller travel bottle) and use after every swim to put the life back into my hair the chlorine strips away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme, you are doing everything right.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy hair that I round brush to shape and smooth, and I&#x27;m always looking for products that help make this tedious job easier. For the last few months I&#x27;ve been using a Nexxus conditioner that works wonderfully but costs almost $15 a bottle, so I was amazed to find that Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin conditioner works nearly as well at less than 1/5th of the price! My hair ended up very soft, sleek, and super easy to style without being at all oily or greasy, even the day after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price for this product is currently near the MSRP of $5.99, which is a pretty good deal already, but I&#x27;ve been watching the price at my local grocery store and have actually seen it as amazingly low as $3.50! Overall, I think this conditioner is a great value and definitely recommend it for those with coarse or frizzy hair that needs to be tamed.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a wise consumer, so I always want the best for the money. Personally, this Tresemme conditioner is really a bargain. First of all, it&#x27;s cheap. You&#x27;ll get a huge bottle with just a few bucks. Secondly, it is good quality conditioner. It makes my hair soft and smooth after the shower. It&#x27;s not extremely oily, so I don&#x27;t need tons of water to wash it off my hair. Couple this with the Tresemme shapoo, and you&#x27;ll have a perfect combo for your hair without spending half of your salary. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am using it with low sulfur shampoo it pairs with. Keratin helps with occasional use of conditioner when hair feel rough or too clean feeling or stands up or too volume when air is dry like hot dry Summer day or dry Winter weather. I use it paired with shampoo of same type Keratin Infusing. It layers. Taking time for it to get absorbed into hair. and combing it and making sure all strands are covered and wrapped and rinsing it with luke warm water instead of hot water. Taking my time. It works.</li>
            <li> The market for shampoos and conditioners is overwhelming.  There are those that are cheap, detergent-level liquids; there are those that are off-the-charts luxurious.  I would put Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth Conditioner in a middle category:  good, dependable products that deliver on what they promise.  Male, 50s, with not an abundance of hair -- thought I&#x27;d say that in the spirit of full disclosure.  I tend to wash and condition my hair almost every day, so I don&#x27;t want something that either dries it out or makes it oily.  As I said, Tresemme&#x27;s a solid product.  My further use of it would probably be most determined by price.</li>
            <li> Over the last month, our house has tried a wide range of shampoo/conditioner combos, and Tresemme is one of the clear winners.  It sounds like a commercial, but my daughter prefers this conditioner and its [[ASIN:B00AO4E9E0 accompanying shampoo]] to the salon brand she had been using.  The combo leaves hair straighter, shinier, softer, and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on some of the other reviews, it looks like reactions are mixed, but we have only good things to say about this combo.  Give it a try, and see what you think.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner in conjunction with the matching shampoo: [[ASIN:B00AO4E9E0 Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Shampoo, 25 Ounce]].  It produced a head of soft and well-conditioned hair.  The smell was lovely and not too heavy.  My only complaint is that my hair afterward had that it&#x27;s so clean and soft that I can&#x27;t really style it feeling.  Really, though, that&#x27;s not much of a complaint, and I wore my hair down instead of in a ponytail.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I started using TreSemme Keratin Smooth instead of the other TreSemme conditioner I had. It definitely works well. My hair looks good and feels soft. My hair is long and a comb runs right through it with no tangles after I get out of the shower. Once dry, my hair continues to be easy to brush and it looks shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is a little thicker than some, but it easily works into the hair. The directions suggest leaving it in for two to three minutes, which is a minute longer than what I usually see on conditioning instructions. I always seem to have that extra minute to spare though. Also, I really like the floral scent of this conditioner. It&#x27;s nice, and not too strong. I&#x27;ve tried several new conditioners in recent months, and I&#x27;m very pleased with this TreSemme one.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and actually seems to remove a lot of the frizz from my hair. I have wavy hair that is slightly damaged by highlights and I&#x27;ve gotten the keratin treatment done 5 times before. Obviously, this conditioner isn&#x27;t as effective as the keratin treatment but it works pretty damn well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought it with me on vacation where I convinced my mom to try it. Despite not being a fan of new things, she loved the conditioner and has asked me to order her a bottle! As long as you don&#x27;t expect a miracle, I believe this product will make you happy.</li>
            <li> Just got it and satisfied even after 1-st  use, specially for this price!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am an African American woman with 3c/4a hair.  As soon as i applied this product to my natural hair i felt a huge difference. It was extremely soft and easy to detangle. It&#x27;s a wonderful inexpensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic conditioner. Scent is nice and gets tangles out, but I didn&#x27;t notice any extra smoothing power from the \\&quot;keratin\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve actually found the Suave keratin products more effective.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice clean scent to it, it comes out of the bottle as a thick cream that easily distributes through the hair.  After use my hair did seem less frizzy - however I believe that is because my hair was covered with a thick waxy buildup that reminds me of the conditioners I used to use back in the 90&#x27;s.  I had been excited about the keratin being included in the conditioner and over time it may actually help out the over all health of my hair.  But I most likely won&#x27;t purchase another bottle of this because of the waxy build up and the fact that no matter how much rinsing you do - your hair still feels as if there is still product left in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife.  Her hair is colored, thick, and coarse.  She usually leaves the conditioner in for about 15 minutes, washes it out, then blow dries her hair.  The results: her hair is light, smells great, and very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast, with no problems.</li>
            <li> This Tressemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Conditioner is creamy, goes in smoothly and provides an awesome conditioning experience. It leaves even my heavily treated hair soft, shiny and silky. I give it my highest recommendation, definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser always tries to sell me the $50 set of keratin stuff. For less than $15 I get the shampoo, conditioner, and defrizzer and my hair has NEVER looked this good. I live in Houston, Home of the Friz, and even in 98% humidity, I get straight, controlled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring on the heat! Your hair can take it with this stuff. I blow dry hot then flat iron and my hair is still healthy. I can see how it may not work well for light, fine hair, but the rest of us should never go without it.</li>
