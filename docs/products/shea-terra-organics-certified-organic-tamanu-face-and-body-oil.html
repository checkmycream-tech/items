            <li>pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try as there were some good reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>they just happened across my review and wanted to apologize and send some good product out at no charge.  </li>
            <li>since the situation has been righted, i am increasing my stars to three from one, because things can happen and manufacturers should not be villianized over mistakes when they correct them in good faith.  </li>
            <li>Good quality tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li>and btw, it doesn&#x27;t smell that good, but I don&#x27;t mind since it works well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this tamanu oil is really good for just about any skin problem.</li>
            <li>Very nice It does help for sure</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>I got the organic because I don&#x27;t need more chemicals in my system at the age of almost 64!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the pain to stop even after rinsing my face thoroughly and many times!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE TAMANU!  </li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had AMAZING results.</li>
            <li>I get rose thorns, scrapes, and skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the oil seemed nice and I liked the texture</li>
            <li>What this tamanu oil does is to very effectively heal skin problems and wounds just as good as oil of oregano, but is much gentler on skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nice, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>and I could not be more thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>first week my skin looked great, glowy and glistened.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>If it costs more than $10-12 per ounce, you&#x27;re probably getting ripped off.</li>
            <li>It has so many healing properties too</li>
            <li>The experts say the darker the better because it means it hasn&#x27;t been doctored up with additives.</li>
            <li>and I will for sure continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>done more research before purchasing this oil though.</li>
            <li>I must have gotten some on my ears because they were the most itchy of everything and looked as though they had hives on them.</li>
            <li>Oh and I know for sure</li>
            <li>Was recommended to me by an esthetician as a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin now is much more dewy.</li>
            <li>Proactiv for me has also not worked, this stuff in my opinion for my skin type works better.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing at keeping my face acne free.  </li>
            <li>I love Tamanu oil -- it cleared up a skin rash</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but certainly better for you than the drugs your doc would prescribe.</li>
            <li>I wish I had this many years ago.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This oil has helped to eliminate some scars and fade most others in the four months I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I can be confident makeup-free nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The rubber on top was deteriorated and the contents spilling out.</li>
            <li>but it is what it is supposed to be and the odor wears off mostly after applying.</li>
            <li>Love the applicator.  </li>
            <li>--so it seems, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Bonus: excellent moisturizer mixed with your regular lotion, perfect for the winter flakiness I get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I found this tamanu oil from Shea Terra Organics</li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>Still able to use the oil inside just not the stopper.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but would suggest when shipping in the summer, perhaps the eye dropper should be packaged separately and not alrady on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Additionally it seems to be helping prevent more outbreaks, which is very exciting!</li>
            <li>This oil is excellent for dry skin just apply it before going to sleep and see the difference in your skin in the morning</li>
            <li>So far so good nice choice to work with pm night cream</li>
            <li>neither of us liked the smell at all, which was super strong and not pleasent at Ã ll, but I would tolerate it if the oil worked.</li>
            <li>Plus she&#x27;s obviously much more comfortable now.    </li>
            <li>Has a strong turmeric or curry smell that lingers.</li>
            <li>The smell of the oil is strong and pungent.  </li>
            <li>I ordered an body oil from this company and the merchandise came within 3 days, I am very satisfied with the product and fast response from the company.</li>
            <li>There is kind of a funny smell to it</li>
            <li>I bought some in BC and it was a dark nutty smelling oil, this is a great spray bottle and says 100% so NO olive oil, but it is VERY light, which is ok</li>
            <li>I use it for ance and odd but it works great!</li>
            <li>This stuff works well for skin problems including scars, acne, fine lines, cuts, abrasions, etc.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll do just fine.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase again as it is effective and very moisturising.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I put a light layer on at night to see if my skin woyld like it.  </li>
            <li>I will also say that I think the brand is important also.  </li>
            <li>My more specific description of the fact was rejected for publication so good luck.</li>
            <li>Having used this  twice a day for a couple of weeks now, the pain is greatly diminished &amp; the incisions have gone from bright red to a healthy pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I had an allergic reaction to this oil</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this</li>
            <li>the original review is below with a qualification at the end.  </li>
            <li>the original order still gets one star.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this product to get rid of a rash and IT WORKED.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles look smoother (more plumped not so deep) and my skin is getting a nice even glow.</li>
            <li>but it is great for acne and dry skin</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m not crazy about the strong smell.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this in combination with various other organic products and see if I can once again have beautiful clear skin :D</li>
            <li>It took another full day till the pain, irritation, and burning was gone.</li>
            <li>So I wrote to them telling what happened requesting a full refund and hoping for some answers</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that my mild acne will start to keep away.</li>
            <li>It also helped to quickly heal a spot of skin cancer on my nose which had been frozen off (ouch).  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and has no smell.</li>
            <li>I also used it blended with tea tree oil to get rid of athlete&#x27;s foot quickly (75% tea tree oil 25% Tamanu oil).  </li>
            <li>Tamanu oil has quickly helped restore my skin in the matter of days.</li>
            <li>I read a review of this product that described this exact thing, but ordered it anyway because most of the other reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>The odor is pungent the first time you use it, but quickly becomes familiar.</li>
            <li>I got the oil quickly and was super excited b/c of all the great reviews, so I was really anxious to try it.</li>
            <li>the less this is a great oil</li>
            <li>and She has been using it less than two weeks and has seen a great improvement in her varicose veins</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li>I have healthy, clear nail tissue</li>
            <li>(it absorbed well into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy).</li>
            <li>I also should add that I wasn&#x27;t greasy, even after applying it just goes right into your skin.</li>
            <li>Had to scrub it right off.</li>
            <li>I got this one for both myself and my Mom to try and right away</li>
            <li>And more melted black rubber all around the rim and underneath the dropper top lid, which I forgot to say was noticably deformed on arrival, it was stuck pushed together and a lot thinner on one side.</li>
            <li>This products really heals any skin condition quickly.  </li>
            <li>The packing is fine - I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the dispenser/bottle like many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Should&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>ordered a second bottle and this one is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much better her skin looked the next day!</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>One of my big toenails has grown out much better.  </li>
            <li>What a shame, as not only do I now have to make the effort to return it, i have to re-order and wait for another, hopefully better product to arrive.  </li>
            <li>And there isn&#x27;t much else to do but laugh and be grateful that it arrived as it did, so</li>
            <li>I purchased something containing tamanu from another manufacturer and it actually contributed to me breaking out more vs. clearing my skin.  </li>
            <li>I gave up on the many different things I was doing on advice of dr.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time both with Tamanu oil and with Shea Terra Organics</li>
            <li>, I never would&#x27;ve thought it was all thinned out b/c it had been melting into the oil the whole time!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, and it feels good knowing what exactly I&#x27;m putting on my skin as opposed to store brand creams/lotions where I can&#x27;t pronounce half of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but u also have to have faith and be positive about the product because if we look for flaws</li>
            <li>I have read positive reviews about this brand, so thought I would try it for anti aging.</li>
            <li>Still, I really like this oil and am willing to give it another shot to see if the graininess is atypical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I pretty much just use it now for moisturizing my cuticles and elbows.  </li>
            <li>brand seems legitimate and the oil is a nice dark yellowish/green color.</li>
            <li>I cannot say it has made my acne go away, it has not; however it has certainly helped.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Its got 100% pure madagascar tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li>I received it in a couple of days and it was what I had initially expected - intact easy to squirt dispenser - the product smelled and appeared fresh.</li>
            <li>I mixed/diluted it with jojoba oil which I recently purchased as well, applied my makeup and everything seemed fine until the evening.</li>
            <li>, I read it makes them more effective if you switch it up every few days, so I decided to try some new ones to alternate in.</li>
            <li>Just very green&lt;</li>
            <li>So I nixed the neosporin and used the tamanu on the whole area.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my face is so much softer and stays moisturized during the day.</li>
            <li>This product looked promising for my scalp psoriasis, because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything in the universe to relieve the itching.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really, really grateful.  </li>
            <li>Some bottles really stink.  </li>
            <li>(this oil comes from a nut) or much anything else.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if what I bought was what I really bought.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very cooperative with my return/complaints however.</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li>My dog really loves the smell and thinks it is something to eat every time I put it on.</li>
            <li>I get mine from Mountain Rose Herbs -- 8 ounces of certified organic, cold pressed and unrefined Tamanu oil for $21.25 (they have smaller sizes also),  so based on that this product seems way over priced, but Tamanu oil itself is a great product.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil really help me with acne scars and keloids.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>would have given it 5 stars, except for the price being as high as it is!</li>
            <li>After intense investigation I decided to go organic.</li>
            <li>But I had read that it really helped with brown age and hormone spots</li>
            <li>, I was really worried about having using melted rubber on my face and my Moms too, esp with the itchy rash</li>
            <li>Very healing.</li>
            <li>Also, small cuts and scratches really do seem to heal more quickly when I apply a bit of this on them throughout the day...</li>
            <li>I got this oil with high hopes considering all the positive reviews and of course Dr. Oz&#x27;s endorsement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also put it on painful pimples elsewhere on my body and it has helped them heal; especially good news because I think I am becoming allergic to my prescription topical medicine (benzaclin).     </li>
            <li>This product smells better than the other Tamanu products I bought before.</li>
            <li>If you can get past those things, this is a fantastic oil for clearing up blemishes and significantly reduces inflammation and redness.</li>
            <li>After one year, my thinner nails have grown out pretty clear.  </li>
            <li>When I began taking off my makeup, my face started getting even more irritated but it calmed down once all my makeup was off.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on some new tattoos to reduce inflammation and it has worked wonders!</li>
            <li>Also, I recommend this particular brand because it is 100% Tamanu oil</li>
            <li>I got a fungus under my big toenail which we could not get rid of, and I didn&#x27;t want to take the internal medications which can damage more than the fungus.  </li>
            <li>Like a dummy though I applied more tamanu oil (diluted with more jojoba oil) and a few minuted later, my face was unbearably itchy, red, and on FIRE!</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and hands because I get acne/cuts frequently, and they heal much faster.</li>
            <li>i use it on the old brown spots(caused by too much sun)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it to moisturize my face after a shower, it leaves tiny bits of the graininess all over my skin, which I have to wipe off once the oil&#x27;s absorbed in.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that my last two orders from this product were not the same as the product in the picture, instead of a spray bottle (which is the best choice to preserve oil quality), i got a dropper bottle, and one of the bottles was damaged and was leaking all over..</li>
            <li>The smell at first is hard to get used to it, but after a couple application you get used it to the point that it doesn&#x27;t smell strong anymore.</li>
            <li>I got it because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I guess my skin is just too sensitive for it, but I&#x27;ll keep it around for the dogs!</li>
            <li>- I originally cheaped out and got the other brand on Amazon here - turned out</li>
            <li>Better than all skin products I usually used.</li>
            <li>, I would definitely try it if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>Most recently I had a spider bite that has left me wiith an open wound over a year.</li>
            <li>Try it, all natural! &#x27;</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and the first time I&#x27;ve had this problem.</li>
            <li>The second and third bottle had a light green color with a light nutty smell.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear and soft!</li>
            <li>I make a lotion using 4 tbs pure organic aloe vera to 1 tsp tamanu oil with about 5 drops of grapeseed oil for extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been struggling with acne, rosacea, sensitive and combination skin for all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>a natural product</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil has completely changed how I approach skin care.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this and make this a part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item and tried it the very day it arrived.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft, and I have not noticed any evidence of clogged pores or breakouts.</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely into skin without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells, do not purchase this.  </li>
            <li>Your oil should be a light green color.  </li>
            <li>what i have learned from this experience is that in addition to writing a review, i should have contacted the manufacturer directly about the experience and not have assumed as i did that they would know about it.  </li>
            <li>How old must this have been to have dissolved the cap, or rubber inside the bottle, or</li>
            <li>The scars are not gone in a month (though they are in about three), but there&#x27;s a marked difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people may be sensitive to the &amp;#34;earthiness&amp;#34; of the odor of the product</li>
            <li>It also has a dropper lid instead of a pump, which works much better for this thick, creamy oil.</li>
            <li>I am still using it as a face moisturizer, and while my skin hasn&#x27;t become perfect, it stays moisturized without adding awful chemicals to my skin, which I can&#x27;t say for most other</li>
            <li>I quit using the oil after it first started and 2 weeks later, tried again - same result - itchy rash.  </li>
            <li>In looking for products that would sooth my skin after using natural skin cancer treatment which left my skin very tender and raw feeling, I tried  tamanu oil as an over night skin treatment, all I can say is amazing, Out of curiousity, I tried a bit on my face and around my eyes (careful not to get in my eyes), within a couple of days my skin looked amazingly younger and wrinkles seemed to virtually disappear.</li>
            <li>By the next morning I was normal color and not tight or itchy feeling.</li>
            <li>And with regards to the scent, it is a bit odd but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it is simply the act of applying any type of oil to the cuts or if it&#x27;s due to some special property of tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li>I mean if its a natural product then its probably most likely going to smell bad because it doesnt have any chemicals that make it smell good !</li>
            <li>My acne is not completely gone, but is much improved.</li>
            <li>Since my local Vitamin Shoppe discontinued carrying tamanu oil, I had to look for a new source.  </li>
            <li>, thats the only description I could come up with, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all..</li>
            <li>it always surprised me that i never heard back about this, and now i know why.  </li>
            <li>Over the last year I have been dealing with adult acne centered around the bottom and sides of my face.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully if I will be brief and concise this one will get published.</li>
            <li>, I found it had melted black rubber from the dropper top, running down the dropper into the oil like toxic sludge!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of certain essential oils, including oil of oregano to combat infections and take internally</li>
            <li>i rescind my comments about Shea Terra the manufacturer, but not about ToysNGamesEtc because as the seller, they must have known about my return as well as this review and they not only never contacted me but apparently did not advise the manufacturer of the problem.]scind</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t believe all the hype and be careful with new skin products.</li>
            <li>She had several dark spots on her lower jaw caused by too much sun over the years.  </li>
            <li>and it is not long lasting after application.</li>

            <li> pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try as there were some good reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> they just happened across my review and wanted to apologize and send some good product out at no charge.  </li>
            <li> since the situation has been righted, i am increasing my stars to three from one, because things can happen and manufacturers should not be villianized over mistakes when they correct them in good faith.  </li>
            <li> Good quality tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li> and btw, it doesn&#x27;t smell that good, but I don&#x27;t mind since it works well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this tamanu oil is really good for just about any skin problem.</li>
            <li> Very nice It does help for sure</li>
            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> I got the organic because I don&#x27;t need more chemicals in my system at the age of almost 64!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the pain to stop even after rinsing my face thoroughly and many times!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE TAMANU!  </li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had AMAZING results.</li>
            <li> I get rose thorns, scrapes, and skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the oil seemed nice and I liked the texture</li>
            <li> What this tamanu oil does is to very effectively heal skin problems and wounds just as good as oil of oregano, but is much gentler on skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nice, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> and I could not be more thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> first week my skin looked great, glowy and glistened.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> If it costs more than $10-12 per ounce, you&#x27;re probably getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> It has so many healing properties too</li>
            <li> The experts say the darker the better because it means it hasn&#x27;t been doctored up with additives.</li>
            <li> and I will for sure continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> done more research before purchasing this oil though.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten some on my ears because they were the most itchy of everything and looked as though they had hives on them.</li>
            <li> Oh and I know for sure</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by an esthetician as a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin now is much more dewy.</li>
            <li> Proactiv for me has also not worked, this stuff in my opinion for my skin type works better.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing at keeping my face acne free.  </li>
            <li> I love Tamanu oil -- it cleared up a skin rash</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but certainly better for you than the drugs your doc would prescribe.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this many years ago.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This oil has helped to eliminate some scars and fade most others in the four months I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I can be confident makeup-free nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The rubber on top was deteriorated and the contents spilling out.</li>
            <li> but it is what it is supposed to be and the odor wears off mostly after applying.</li>
            <li> Love the applicator.  </li>
            <li> --so it seems, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Bonus: excellent moisturizer mixed with your regular lotion, perfect for the winter flakiness I get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I found this tamanu oil from Shea Terra Organics</li>
            <li> , I love it.</li>
            <li> Still able to use the oil inside just not the stopper.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but would suggest when shipping in the summer, perhaps the eye dropper should be packaged separately and not alrady on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Additionally it seems to be helping prevent more outbreaks, which is very exciting!</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent for dry skin just apply it before going to sleep and see the difference in your skin in the morning</li>
            <li> So far so good nice choice to work with pm night cream</li>
            <li> neither of us liked the smell at all, which was super strong and not pleasent at Ã ll, but I would tolerate it if the oil worked.</li>
            <li> Plus she&#x27;s obviously much more comfortable now.    </li>
            <li> Has a strong turmeric or curry smell that lingers.</li>
            <li> The smell of the oil is strong and pungent.  </li>
            <li> I ordered an body oil from this company and the merchandise came within 3 days, I am very satisfied with the product and fast response from the company.</li>
            <li> There is kind of a funny smell to it</li>
            <li> I bought some in BC and it was a dark nutty smelling oil, this is a great spray bottle and says 100% so NO olive oil, but it is VERY light, which is ok</li>
            <li> I use it for ance and odd but it works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for skin problems including scars, acne, fine lines, cuts, abrasions, etc.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll do just fine.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase again as it is effective and very moisturising.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I put a light layer on at night to see if my skin woyld like it.  </li>
            <li> I will also say that I think the brand is important also.  </li>
            <li> My more specific description of the fact was rejected for publication so good luck.</li>
            <li> Having used this  twice a day for a couple of weeks now, the pain is greatly diminished &amp; the incisions have gone from bright red to a healthy pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I had an allergic reaction to this oil</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this</li>
            <li> the original review is below with a qualification at the end.  </li>
            <li> the original order still gets one star.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product to get rid of a rash and IT WORKED.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles look smoother (more plumped not so deep) and my skin is getting a nice even glow.</li>
            <li> but it is great for acne and dry skin</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m not crazy about the strong smell.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this in combination with various other organic products and see if I can once again have beautiful clear skin :D</li>
            <li> It took another full day till the pain, irritation, and burning was gone.</li>
            <li> So I wrote to them telling what happened requesting a full refund and hoping for some answers</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that my mild acne will start to keep away.</li>
            <li> It also helped to quickly heal a spot of skin cancer on my nose which had been frozen off (ouch).  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has no smell.</li>
            <li> I also used it blended with tea tree oil to get rid of athlete&#x27;s foot quickly (75% tea tree oil 25% Tamanu oil).  </li>
            <li> Tamanu oil has quickly helped restore my skin in the matter of days.</li>
            <li> I read a review of this product that described this exact thing, but ordered it anyway because most of the other reviews were good.  </li>
            <li> The odor is pungent the first time you use it, but quickly becomes familiar.</li>
            <li> I got the oil quickly and was super excited b/c of all the great reviews, so I was really anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> the less this is a great oil</li>
            <li> and She has been using it less than two weeks and has seen a great improvement in her varicose veins</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li> I have healthy, clear nail tissue</li>
            <li> (it absorbed well into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy).</li>
            <li> I also should add that I wasn&#x27;t greasy, even after applying it just goes right into your skin.</li>
            <li> Had to scrub it right off.</li>
            <li> I got this one for both myself and my Mom to try and right away</li>
            <li> And more melted black rubber all around the rim and underneath the dropper top lid, which I forgot to say was noticably deformed on arrival, it was stuck pushed together and a lot thinner on one side.</li>
            <li> This products really heals any skin condition quickly.  </li>
            <li> The packing is fine - I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the dispenser/bottle like many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Should&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> ordered a second bottle and this one is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how much better her skin looked the next day!</li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> One of my big toenails has grown out much better.  </li>
            <li> What a shame, as not only do I now have to make the effort to return it, i have to re-order and wait for another, hopefully better product to arrive.  </li>
            <li> And there isn&#x27;t much else to do but laugh and be grateful that it arrived as it did, so</li>
            <li> I purchased something containing tamanu from another manufacturer and it actually contributed to me breaking out more vs. clearing my skin.  </li>
            <li> I gave up on the many different things I was doing on advice of dr.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time both with Tamanu oil and with Shea Terra Organics</li>
            <li> , I never would&#x27;ve thought it was all thinned out b/c it had been melting into the oil the whole time!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, and it feels good knowing what exactly I&#x27;m putting on my skin as opposed to store brand creams/lotions where I can&#x27;t pronounce half of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but u also have to have faith and be positive about the product because if we look for flaws</li>
            <li> I have read positive reviews about this brand, so thought I would try it for anti aging.</li>
            <li> Still, I really like this oil and am willing to give it another shot to see if the graininess is atypical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I pretty much just use it now for moisturizing my cuticles and elbows.  </li>
            <li> brand seems legitimate and the oil is a nice dark yellowish/green color.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it has made my acne go away, it has not; however it has certainly helped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Its got 100% pure madagascar tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li> I received it in a couple of days and it was what I had initially expected - intact easy to squirt dispenser - the product smelled and appeared fresh.</li>
            <li> I mixed/diluted it with jojoba oil which I recently purchased as well, applied my makeup and everything seemed fine until the evening.</li>
            <li> , I read it makes them more effective if you switch it up every few days, so I decided to try some new ones to alternate in.</li>
            <li> Just very green&lt;</li>
            <li> So I nixed the neosporin and used the tamanu on the whole area.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my face is so much softer and stays moisturized during the day.</li>
            <li> This product looked promising for my scalp psoriasis, because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything in the universe to relieve the itching.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really, really grateful.  </li>
            <li> Some bottles really stink.  </li>
            <li> (this oil comes from a nut) or much anything else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if what I bought was what I really bought.</li>
            <li> Amazon was very cooperative with my return/complaints however.</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li> My dog really loves the smell and thinks it is something to eat every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> I get mine from Mountain Rose Herbs -- 8 ounces of certified organic, cold pressed and unrefined Tamanu oil for $21.25 (they have smaller sizes also),  so based on that this product seems way over priced, but Tamanu oil itself is a great product.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil really help me with acne scars and keloids.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> would have given it 5 stars, except for the price being as high as it is!</li>
            <li> After intense investigation I decided to go organic.</li>
            <li> But I had read that it really helped with brown age and hormone spots</li>
            <li> , I was really worried about having using melted rubber on my face and my Moms too, esp with the itchy rash</li>
            <li> Very healing.</li>
            <li> Also, small cuts and scratches really do seem to heal more quickly when I apply a bit of this on them throughout the day...</li>
            <li> I got this oil with high hopes considering all the positive reviews and of course Dr. Oz&#x27;s endorsement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also put it on painful pimples elsewhere on my body and it has helped them heal; especially good news because I think I am becoming allergic to my prescription topical medicine (benzaclin).     </li>
            <li> This product smells better than the other Tamanu products I bought before.</li>
            <li> If you can get past those things, this is a fantastic oil for clearing up blemishes and significantly reduces inflammation and redness.</li>
            <li> After one year, my thinner nails have grown out pretty clear.  </li>
            <li> When I began taking off my makeup, my face started getting even more irritated but it calmed down once all my makeup was off.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on some new tattoos to reduce inflammation and it has worked wonders!</li>
            <li> Also, I recommend this particular brand because it is 100% Tamanu oil</li>
            <li> I got a fungus under my big toenail which we could not get rid of, and I didn&#x27;t want to take the internal medications which can damage more than the fungus.  </li>
            <li> Like a dummy though I applied more tamanu oil (diluted with more jojoba oil) and a few minuted later, my face was unbearably itchy, red, and on FIRE!</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and hands because I get acne/cuts frequently, and they heal much faster.</li>
            <li> i use it on the old brown spots(caused by too much sun)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it to moisturize my face after a shower, it leaves tiny bits of the graininess all over my skin, which I have to wipe off once the oil&#x27;s absorbed in.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that my last two orders from this product were not the same as the product in the picture, instead of a spray bottle (which is the best choice to preserve oil quality), i got a dropper bottle, and one of the bottles was damaged and was leaking all over..</li>
            <li> The smell at first is hard to get used to it, but after a couple application you get used it to the point that it doesn&#x27;t smell strong anymore.</li>
            <li> I got it because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is just too sensitive for it, but I&#x27;ll keep it around for the dogs!</li>
            <li> - I originally cheaped out and got the other brand on Amazon here - turned out</li>
            <li> Better than all skin products I usually used.</li>
            <li> , I would definitely try it if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> Most recently I had a spider bite that has left me wiith an open wound over a year.</li>
            <li> Try it, all natural! &#x27;</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and the first time I&#x27;ve had this problem.</li>
            <li> The second and third bottle had a light green color with a light nutty smell.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clear and soft!</li>
            <li> I make a lotion using 4 tbs pure organic aloe vera to 1 tsp tamanu oil with about 5 drops of grapeseed oil for extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been struggling with acne, rosacea, sensitive and combination skin for all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> a natural product</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil has completely changed how I approach skin care.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this and make this a part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and tried it the very day it arrived.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft, and I have not noticed any evidence of clogged pores or breakouts.</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely into skin without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, do not purchase this.  </li>
            <li> Your oil should be a light green color.  </li>
            <li> what i have learned from this experience is that in addition to writing a review, i should have contacted the manufacturer directly about the experience and not have assumed as i did that they would know about it.  </li>
            <li> How old must this have been to have dissolved the cap, or rubber inside the bottle, or</li>
            <li> The scars are not gone in a month (though they are in about three), but there&#x27;s a marked difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people may be sensitive to the &amp;#34;earthiness&amp;#34; of the odor of the product</li>
            <li> It also has a dropper lid instead of a pump, which works much better for this thick, creamy oil.</li>
            <li> I am still using it as a face moisturizer, and while my skin hasn&#x27;t become perfect, it stays moisturized without adding awful chemicals to my skin, which I can&#x27;t say for most other</li>
            <li> I quit using the oil after it first started and 2 weeks later, tried again - same result - itchy rash.  </li>
            <li> In looking for products that would sooth my skin after using natural skin cancer treatment which left my skin very tender and raw feeling, I tried  tamanu oil as an over night skin treatment, all I can say is amazing, Out of curiousity, I tried a bit on my face and around my eyes (careful not to get in my eyes), within a couple of days my skin looked amazingly younger and wrinkles seemed to virtually disappear.</li>
            <li> By the next morning I was normal color and not tight or itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> And with regards to the scent, it is a bit odd but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it is simply the act of applying any type of oil to the cuts or if it&#x27;s due to some special property of tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li> I mean if its a natural product then its probably most likely going to smell bad because it doesnt have any chemicals that make it smell good !</li>
            <li> My acne is not completely gone, but is much improved.</li>
            <li> Since my local Vitamin Shoppe discontinued carrying tamanu oil, I had to look for a new source.  </li>
            <li> , thats the only description I could come up with, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all..</li>
            <li> it always surprised me that i never heard back about this, and now i know why.  </li>
            <li> Over the last year I have been dealing with adult acne centered around the bottom and sides of my face.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully if I will be brief and concise this one will get published.</li>
            <li> , I found it had melted black rubber from the dropper top, running down the dropper into the oil like toxic sludge!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of certain essential oils, including oil of oregano to combat infections and take internally</li>
            <li> i rescind my comments about Shea Terra the manufacturer, but not about ToysNGamesEtc because as the seller, they must have known about my return as well as this review and they not only never contacted me but apparently did not advise the manufacturer of the problem.]scind</li>
            <li> my comments about Shea Terra the manufacturer, but not about ToysNGamesEtc because as the seller, they must have known about my return as well as this review and they not only never contacted me but apparently did not advise the manufacturer of the problem.]</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the hype and be careful with new skin products.</li>
            <li> She had several dark spots on her lower jaw caused by too much sun over the years.  </li>
            <li> and it is not long lasting after application.</li>
            <li> , good news is that this little bottle will probably last me at least a year if not more.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from incredibly sensitive skin that does not heal well after acne and other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using it long enough to have results.</li>
            <li> I keep this mixture stored in a jar, it absorbs well mixed and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to rate it five.</li>
            <li> I do not generally endorse items.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw the greenish brown color &amp; smelled the strong aroma.  </li>
            <li> and now they are slowly going away blending into the ksin slowly but surely</li>
            <li> I used neosporin on it with a band-aid for the first 3 days (cleaning &amp; changing at least 1x/day) with little change in the size of my cut and left it bare yesterday.</li>
            <li> All night my face felt completely uncomfortable and it wasn&#x27;t until I washed it the next day that I started to feel a little bit better.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m African American with a dark complexion.  </li>
            <li> For toenails, this is a veeeeeeery long process.  </li>
            <li> It has some strange smell.</li>
            <li> Although I have extremely dry skin -- since this oil is comedogenic -- I still ended up with a bunch of clogged pores (whiteheads) all over my face while still moist after using this just two times.</li>
            <li> I bought it to add to my facial moisturizer, but it&#x27;s too thick and left my face feeling too oily despite having used just a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem much different the next day, so I reapplied it, but also put the tamanu oil in one small area.</li>
            <li> I use this product with black african soap</li>
            <li> You only need 1 small pump so it seems like this bottle is going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> whatever black stuff is dissolved in there, that is actually LETTING THE OIL LEAK OUT?  </li>
            <li> It still scares me, what the heck was in that bottle that it actually melted, liquidfied the black rubber dropper</li>
            <li> It was worse than that; the black cap appears to have dissolved right inside the envelope.  </li>
            <li> Last night, I decided to try a little tamanu oil in place of neosporin.</li>
            <li> Only need a little drop</li>
            <li> Now I put a few drops on the &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; facial points, (chin, cheeks, eyes, lips, nose)  </li>
            <li> Please check your oils and bottles carefully</li>
            <li> so my thumb doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s splitting in half down the middle.</li>
            <li> She had aggravated a small scrape on her back by biting and licking it until her whole backend was covered in angry red spots and scabs.</li>
            <li> I still get small breakouts, but with adding a clay mask 2 to 3 times a week, things are finally under control</li>
            <li> and I think the results are due to the pairing of these products.  </li>
            <li> I checked on the net this past summer to see if anything else had been discovered and found a doctor&#x27;s recommendation for Tamanu oil.  </li>
            <li> The other has had to be treated by a podiatrist.  </li>
            <li> Can I swear the improvement was due to the oil?  </li>
            <li> I know that tea tree oil did nothing, as did any other OTC</li>
            <li> have been using to heal my son&#x27;s wounds and other skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> So in essence versus other moisturizers out there you will save money buying Tamanu oil.     </li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much for me or any of my cuts/abrasions/scabs, and it seemed to irritate my face.</li>
            <li> And my dark spot from my break out is lightening as well.</li>
            <li> You either love it or hate it</li>
            <li> The consistency of the oil has always been odd to me.</li>
            <li> I noticed less pain.  </li>
            <li> but the oil dissolved the black dropper bulb.</li>
            <li> the cap dissolved and leaked black goo into the oil.</li>
            <li> The first bottle was a dark green color with an unpleasant odor, just like what other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I did not return because it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Have faith that ur going to get better and lets hope no one else gets bad products again!</li>
            <li> If one week your face feels a little oily, use a lighter oil and vice versa.  </li>
            <li> This is the single most disgusting buying experience I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> This oil is pretty thick and dark green, with a strong hay odor.(Not too horrible, but not pleasant either)</li>
            <li> I have been pumping a few drops into my moisturizer before applying</li>
            <li> just a few days afer getting it</li>
            <li> I viewed Shea Terra Organics as a trusted brand... until (a few weeks into using the product)</li>
            <li> Once a pimple disappears, it usually scars to almost a black color (I would post pics, but my vanity won&#x27;t allow me to).  </li>
            <li> Mine melted in our AZ heat and now I have bits of black rubber (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s melted rubber from the eye dropper) in the oil!</li>
            <li> or I have applied it plain.</li>
            <li> and it takes very, very little to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad--</li>
            <li> After a few tries it gave my Mom&#x27;s neck and face a bad rash and was starting to break me out too.</li>
            <li> Now, no more break out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a breakout like this since I was a teen so needless to say</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, tamanu nut oil is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I have used tamanu nut oil in the past, and will continue to use it, but not from Shea Terra Organics or their seller ToysNGamesEtc.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply it five times per day, but I wear makeup and cannot do that, so I usually apply twice per day.  </li>
            <li> I said, I don&#x27;t usually endorse things, but I fully endorse this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell to use it.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you have to get past the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell....</li>
            <li> it was a blend with olive oil and is definitely not as effective as the 100% Tamanu oil here.</li>
            <li> The oil was so thick and gooey.</li>
            <li> It is a very small bottle for the price, so if you are going to use it on your skin, I would recommend mixing it with another less expensive oil or cream.  </li>
            <li> Several years ago I tripped and badly sprained my ankle.  </li>
            <li> The stopper had a cut made in it which renders it useless and caused small leakage.</li>
            <li> Previously I entered a rather scathing review of this item.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s helped with keeping the acne I have from getting worse</li>
            <li> Thereafter, I have broken out...</li>
            <li> My face was slowly getting itchy and uncomfortable as the day went on but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think other reviewer&#x27;s bad experience would happen to me</li>
            <li> I mailed the  bottle back and Thank God got a refund, but I am shocked and disgusted that I still haven&#x27;t heard back from them.</li>
            <li> I recently had an appendectomy, &amp; my incisions were still very painful.  </li>
            <li> If anything, my head itches worse!</li>
            <li> Gross, bloody, and painful.</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to get rid of the smell whether the oil is on your skin or clothes.</li>
            <li> saying they were sorry about how the product arrived.  </li>
            <li> after a terrible experience with chemical products such as, salicylic acid, I came to the conclusion that my skin doesn&#x27;t like chemicals at all.</li>
            <li> Be careful when purchasing Tamanu oil because some sellers are charging outrageous prices (probably because it was introduced on the Dr. Oz Show).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that part because it looks dirty</li>
            <li> Scary!</li>
            <li> It also has an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I dont know why people but that it smells bad</li>
            <li> I hope I got into something bad with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on this product, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am really sad to say it was horrible on both parts!</li>
            <li> Very scary experience!</li>
            <li> It was burning so bad!</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad!</li>
            <li> This smells downright awful!  </li>
            <li> but she had them real ugly</li>
            <li> It was Horrible!  </li>
            <li> It also has a nasty brown color to it, so beware of you plan on putting it on your face.</li>
            <li> I used it after a nasty infected wound would not heal.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible hormonal acne...</li>
            <li> Very bad business!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This smells downright awful!  I won&#x27;t be using it long enough to have results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every skin cream on the market for wrinkles and hyper pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try as there were some good reviews and it didn&#x27;t break the bank like some&lt;br /&gt;drugstore/ department store brands can.  It doesn&#x27;t smell nice, but it&#x27;s not awful. Just very green&lt;br /&gt;like a natural product should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First night I used this I had been at the beach, I was wind/sun burned and my face was very red. By the next morning I was normal color and not tight or itchy feeling. I also should add that I wasn&#x27;t greasy, even after applying it just goes right into your skin. It&#x27;s been a week and still I&#x27;m not overly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do micro needling, and this is a great product for afterwards! It heals the micro holes over night and any redness is gone by morning. My wrinkles look smoother (more plumped not so deep) and my skin is getting a nice even glow. I really like this stuff, and it feels good knowing what exactly I&#x27;m putting on my skin as opposed to store brand creams/lotions where I can&#x27;t pronounce half of the ingredients.  I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> This oil is pretty thick and dark green, with a strong hay odor.(Not too horrible, but not pleasant either) If you can get past those things, this is a fantastic oil for clearing up blemishes and significantly reduces inflammation and redness. I alternate days between Tamanu oil and Argan oil of which I only use at nighttime. My skin has never been so clear and soft! I have also used it on some new tattoos to reduce inflammation and it has worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I got this oil with high hopes considering all the positive reviews and of course Dr. Oz&#x27;s endorsement. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much for me or any of my cuts/abrasions/scabs, and it seemed to irritate my face. Plus I&#x27;m not crazy about the strong smell.    BUT then I tried it on my dog. She had aggravated a small scrape on her back by biting and licking it until her whole backend was covered in angry red spots and scabs. I shaved that area and put neosporin on it (and put a cone collar on her to keep her from licking it off). It didn&#x27;t seem much different the next day, so I reapplied it, but also put the tamanu oil in one small area. The next day, the redness was gone from that area, while the neosporin spots were still there. I did the tamanu oil on a larger area and the next day, same thing. So I nixed the neosporin and used the tamanu on the whole area. I could not believe how much better her skin looked the next day! This stuff works wonders! Plus she&#x27;s obviously much more comfortable now.    I guess my skin is just too sensitive for it, but I&#x27;ll keep it around for the dogs!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I used to break out every month and big ones. Now, no more break out. And my dark spot from my break out is lightening as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered an body oil from this company and the merchandise came within 3 days, I am very satisfied with the product and fast response from the company.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Shea Terra Tamanu Face and Body Oil for about five weeks.  I can see a noticeable improvement in her complextion.  She had several dark spots on her lower jaw caused by too much sun over the years.  After five weeks I can no longer see the spots.  She also had some red blotches on her cheeks and they are also gone.  Tamanu oil is definitely worth buying.  Be careful when purchasing Tamanu oil because some sellers are charging outrageous prices (probably because it was introduced on the Dr. Oz Show). If it costs more than $10-12 per ounce, you&#x27;re probably getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been struggling with acne, rosacea, sensitive and combination skin for all of my adult life.  Tamanu oil has completely changed how I approach skin care.  While I still believe in changing up my skin routine, I find I use Tamanu oil 4 to 5 times a week and it has helped control my acne, even out my skin tone, and controls oil.  I still get small breakouts, but with adding a clay mask 2 to 3 times a week, things are finally under control and I could not be more thrilled with the results.  I hope others who go through the constant struggle like I do find similar results with Tamanu oil.  Also, I recommend this particular brand because it is 100% Tamanu oil - I originally cheaped out and got the other brand on Amazon here - turned out it was a blend with olive oil and is definitely not as effective as the 100% Tamanu oil here.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It smells like a tree though so be prepared for that. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly and I feel like my face is so much softer and stays moisturized during the day. It has so many healing properties too and I&#x27;m hoping that my mild acne will start to keep away. I do think it&#x27;s helped with keeping the acne I have from getting worse (I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand seems legitimate and the oil is a nice dark yellowish/green color. The experts say the darker the better because it means it hasn&#x27;t been doctored up with additives.</li>
            <li> I bought some in BC and it was a dark nutty smelling oil, this is a great spray bottle and says 100% so NO olive oil, but it is VERY light, which is ok, I mix it with my daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and my skin has greatly improved. My cheeks were covered in red marks and I am seeing the marks fade and my skin soften.  My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in breakouts. I use this product with black african soap and I think the results are due to the pairing of these products.  I make a lotion using 4 tbs pure organic aloe vera to 1 tsp tamanu oil with about 5 drops of grapeseed oil for extra moisture. I keep this mixture stored in a jar, it absorbs well mixed and it lasts a long time. I love it!! I estimate one bottle will last me several months...Im back to stock up!!</li>
            <li> This is indeed oily, and stays on the surface of my skin for hours. It also has an unpleasant odor. It also irritated some blemishes and dryness I already was experiencing.  After reading all the reviews on this product, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product looked promising for my scalp psoriasis, because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything in the universe to relieve the itching. I added it to my shampoo like it suggested on another website, and it&#x27;s done nothing to help the itching. If anything, my head itches worse! If you get this for any scalp issues, you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent for dry skin just apply it before going to sleep and see the difference in your skin in the morning, I did not try it on scars but I will.. it has a different smell thats not for everyone, an african smell, thats the only description I could come up with, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.. my only complaint is that my last two orders from this product were not the same as the product in the picture, instead of a spray bottle (which is the best choice to preserve oil quality), i got a dropper bottle, and one of the bottles was damaged and was leaking all over.. non the less this is a great oil and I will for sure continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the rave reviews and ignoring the red flag ones noting some ppl broke out after use...well, it was indeed great...at first. first week my skin looked great, glowy and glistened. Thereafter, I have broken out...I haven&#x27;t had a breakout like this since I was a teen so needless to say, I know it&#x27;s the Tamanu oil. It&#x27;s really too bad--I really wanted to like this and make this a part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> Update - 11/27/12&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second bottle and this one is very smooth. It also has a dropper lid instead of a pump, which works much better for this thick, creamy oil. I am still using it as a face moisturizer, and while my skin hasn&#x27;t become perfect, it stays moisturized without adding awful chemicals to my skin, which I can&#x27;t say for most other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;**************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this tamanu oil for three months now. I got it because I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s natural and organic. The consistency of the oil has always been odd to me. It&#x27;s oily but also grainy. Since this oil comes in a bottle with a pump, and the graininess clogs the pump, making it ineffective, I&#x27;m hoping mine is a fluke. For anyone else who&#x27;s tried it, was it grainy for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it to moisturize my face after a shower, it leaves tiny bits of the graininess all over my skin, which I have to wipe off once the oil&#x27;s absorbed in. I don&#x27;t like that part because it looks dirty and I wonder how much of the oil (&amp; my money) is wasted in clumping/graininess. Still, I really like this oil and am willing to give it another shot to see if the graininess is atypical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this oil: I cut the tip of my thumb with a mandoline 5 days ago. It was fairly deep and in a slit/\\&quot;v\\&quot; shape. Gross, bloody, and painful. I used neosporin on it with a band-aid for the first 3 days (cleaning &amp; changing at least 1x/day) with little change in the size of my cut and left it bare yesterday. Last night, I decided to try a little tamanu oil in place of neosporin. This morning, it looks like either side of the cut has begun growing back together so my thumb doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s splitting in half down the middle. I am impressed. That&#x27;s enough reason for me to buy another bottle once this one runs out. If the next bottle is grainy, I&#x27;ll just return it and try another brand.</li>
            <li> There is another use for Tamanu oil which is not mentioned here.  It cures tonail fungus.  Several years ago I tripped and badly sprained my ankle.  In the course of healing, I was wearing a velcro open-toed slipper, sometimes out to feed the horses in the morning.  I got a fungus under my big toenail which we could not get rid of, and I didn&#x27;t want to take the internal medications which can damage more than the fungus.  Our nephew-in-law is a pharmacist and he recommended Vicks Vaporub.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I checked on the net this past summer to see if anything else had been discovered and found a doctor&#x27;s recommendation for Tamanu oil.  It works.  I have healthy, clear nail tissue about half-way up my nail now and I&#x27;m really, really grateful.  It also helped to quickly heal a spot of skin cancer on my nose which had been frozen off (ouch).  It&#x27;s good stuff and it takes very, very little to do the job.  I would put a drop on my toenail and smear it around after a shower and then put on socks.  That was it.  Leftover on my finger would go on my nose.  I got the organic because I don&#x27;t need more chemicals in my system at the age of almost 64!</li>
            <li> Very nice It does help for sure and I will buy again.  Only need a little drop and I use it for everything.</li>
            <li> The packing is fine - I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the dispenser/bottle like many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Should&#x27;ve done more research before purchasing this oil though. Although I have extremely dry skin -- since this oil is comedogenic -- I still ended up with a bunch of clogged pores (whiteheads) all over my face while still moist after using this just two times.</li>
            <li> This tamanu oil is the best it doesnt smell quite good but it is great for acne and dry skin my mom doesnt stop wearing it. I dont know why people but that it smells bad I mean if its a natural product then its probably most likely going to smell bad because it doesnt have any chemicals that make it smell good ! My mom has ordered one for herself and another for a lady at work and She has been using it less than two weeks and has seen a great improvement in her varicose veins doctors say that there isnt a cure but she had them real ugly and now they are slowly going away blending into the ksin slowly but surely but u also have to have faith and be positive about the product because if we look for flaws well no its never going to work! Have faith that ur going to get better and lets hope no one else gets bad products again!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil-wonderful for aging skin! Absorbs quickly and has no smell.Better than all skin products I usually used. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This oil is helping to diminish the appearance of some hyperpigmentation I have from acne. Additionally it seems to be helping prevent more outbreaks, which is very exciting! I will purchase again as it is effective and very moisturising. I like the nutty smell and it is not long lasting after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of certain essential oils, including oil of oregano to combat infections and take internally (both human and dogs, one drop per day) to keep yeast/candida under control, clove oil for anything inside mouth, tea tree oil for external parasite/fungal afflictions. What this tamanu oil does is to very effectively heal skin problems and wounds just as good as oil of oregano, but is much gentler on skin.</li>
            <li> While Tamanu oil is not a miracle, I do like it.  I have been using it for toenail fungus for about a year.  After one year, my thinner nails have grown out pretty clear.  One of my big toenails has grown out much better.  The other has had to be treated by a podiatrist.  After toenail removal, I&#x27;ve added the oil to my regimen.  Can I swear the improvement was due to the oil?  No.  However, I&#x27;m continuing to use it just in case!  I know that tea tree oil did nothing, as did any other OTC treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor from bottle to bottle varies.  Some bottles really stink.  Others have a nutty smell that&#x27;s not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use any product for nail fungus, please know that there is no immediate treatment.  The product has to be used as the nail grows out.  For toenails, this is a veeeeeeery long process.  After 3 or 4 months of use, however, you should see clearer nail growing out if the product is working.</li>
            <li> Let me just say...OUCH! I recently purchased this item and tried it the very day it arrived. I mixed/diluted it with jojoba oil which I recently purchased as well, applied my makeup and everything seemed fine until the evening. My face was slowly getting itchy and uncomfortable as the day went on but not unbearable. When I began taking off my makeup, my face started getting even more irritated but it calmed down once all my makeup was off. Like a dummy though I applied more tamanu oil (diluted with more jojoba oil) and a few minuted later, my face was unbearably itchy, red, and on FIRE! I couldn&#x27;t get the pain to stop even after rinsing my face thoroughly and many times! It was burning so bad! All night my face felt completely uncomfortable and it wasn&#x27;t until I washed it the next day that I started to feel a little bit better. It took another full day till the pain, irritation, and burning was gone. I must have gotten some on my ears because they were the most itchy of everything and looked as though they had hives on them. I&#x27;m pretty sure I had an allergic reaction to this oil and this is coming from someone who&#x27;s not allergic to nuts (this oil comes from a nut) or much anything else. I was a big red-faced ball of burn! It hurt so bad! Also, the pump didn&#x27;t work like at all. The oil was so thick and gooey. I should have known from that point. I don&#x27;t even know if what I bought was what I really bought. Trust your gut people! Oh and I know for sure it wasn&#x27;t the jojoba oil because I&#x27;m still using that today and it works wonderfully! It actually helped soothe my skin after the allergic reaction. I just wanted to tell you all this so that you take precautions in buying something your skin is not used to having on it. Heed this warning and beware of who you are buying from. Don&#x27;t believe all the hype and be careful with new skin products. Amazon was very cooperative with my return/complaints however. The seller never con</li>
            <li> Has a strong turmeric or curry smell that lingers. I like Indian food, so I don&#x27;t mind it too much. My dog really loves the smell and thinks it is something to eat every time I put it on. I have only used it two days, so the jury is out on how well it works. I have read positive reviews about this brand, so thought I would try it for anti aging. I ordered a bottle for my daughter for its purported effects on acne and scars. I like that the oil comes in a pump bottle. I have been pumping a few drops into my moisturizer before applying or I have applied it plain. My face feels soft, and I have not noticed any evidence of clogged pores or breakouts.</li>
            <li> have been using to heal my son&#x27;s wounds and other skin blemishes. it is very effective! no itch, no scar!</li>
            <li> Great product. Was recommended to me by an esthetician as a better moisturizer. Great for mixing with your sunblock. Absorbs completely into skin without a greasy feel. You only need 1 small pump so it seems like this bottle is going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> So far so good nice choice to work with pm night cream especially If it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
            <li> I found out about Tamanu oil through Dr. Oz on his daytime tv show. He recommended it for people like me who are prone to acne and blemishes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now religiously at night before bed.  It is a wonderful moisturizer and my bf has noticed how it has helped my skin tone.  My skin now is much more dewy. I&#x27;ve also put it on painful pimples elsewhere on my body and it has helped them heal; especially good news because I think I am becoming allergic to my prescription topical medicine (benzaclin).     I would order this again when I run out, good news is that this little bottle will probably last me at least a year if not more.  A very little bit goes a long way.  So in essence versus other moisturizers out there you will save money buying Tamanu oil.     I&#x27;m also on birth control as well since my acne is hormonal and stress related-- I cannot say it has made my acne go away, it has not; however it has certainly helped.  Proactiv for me has also not worked, this stuff in my opinion for my skin type works better.  I also use Burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s acne control face wash and daytime moisturizer.      Hope this review helps, I would definitely try it if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful.  I was skeptical when I saw the greenish brown color &amp; smelled the strong aroma.  I recently had an appendectomy, &amp; my incisions were still very painful.  I started putting this oil on them &amp; within a day I noticed less pain.  Having used this  twice a day for a couple of weeks now, the pain is greatly diminished &amp; the incisions have gone from bright red to a healthy pink.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, do not purchase this.  The smell of the oil is strong and pungent.  I couldn&#x27;t use it at all.  Had to scrub it right off.</li>
            <li> I hope I got into something bad with my purchase.  I am breaking out in a rash, itching.  I quit using the oil after it first started and 2 weeks later, tried again - same result - itchy rash.  I&#x27;m going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> This is amazing at keeping my face acne free.  I use nightly.</li>
            <li> This product smells better than the other Tamanu products I bought before.</li>
            <li> I love Tamanu oil -- it cleared up a skin rash I&#x27;d had on my face for months in days.  I also used it blended with tea tree oil to get rid of athlete&#x27;s foot quickly (75% tea tree oil 25% Tamanu oil).  I&#x27;ve never used this brand before. I get mine from Mountain Rose Herbs -- 8 ounces of certified organic, cold pressed and unrefined Tamanu oil for $21.25 (they have smaller sizes also),  so based on that this product seems way over priced, but Tamanu oil itself is a great product.</li>
            <li> Best oil for acne and wrinkles- it works great for me and I love it! There is kind of a funny smell to it but it works well so I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> This stuff works for toenail fungus. A bit pricey, but certainly better for you than the drugs your doc would prescribe. Took about the same amount of time, too.</li>
            <li> Do not feel any difference. It has some strange smell. Feel like I am putting cooking oil on my face.  Overpriced.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this many years ago. I have been suffering from incredibly sensitive skin that does not heal well after acne and other skin ailments. Most recently I had a spider bite that has left me wiith an open wound over a year. Tamanu oil has quickly helped restore my skin in the matter of days. This product will now be a staple in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> At last something that seems to work wonder with my skin. My inverse psoriasis seems to be tamed by this oil and I don&#x27;t necessary have to put on a lot. The smell at first is hard to get used to it, but after a couple application you get used it to the point that it doesn&#x27;t smell strong anymore. Try it, all natural! &#x27;Bye bye chemical creams.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why and how but the oil dissolved the black dropper bulb. I didn&#x27;t think other reviewer&#x27;s bad experience would happen to me but it did. My more specific description of the fact was rejected for publication so good luck.</li>
            <li> The first bottle was a dark green color with an unpleasant odor, just like what other reviewers said. The second and third bottle had a light green color with a light nutty smell. Your oil should be a light green color.  Tamanu oil really help me with acne scars and keloids. It is really difficult to get rid of the smell whether the oil is on your skin or clothes.</li>
            <li> In looking for products that would sooth my skin after using natural skin cancer treatment which left my skin very tender and raw feeling, I tried  tamanu oil as an over night skin treatment, all I can say is amazing, Out of curiousity, I tried a bit on my face and around my eyes (careful not to get in my eyes), within a couple of days my skin looked amazingly younger and wrinkles seemed to virtually disappear. I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best! I love it... its not oil and feels great on my skin I use it for ance and odd but it works great! I have been on accutan 3times and  this works</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pump does not work, so I&#x27;ve not been able to get any of the oil out. This is my second purchase and the first time I&#x27;ve had this problem.</li>
            <li> Caused severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this but once opened I was overwhelmed by smell.  Pungent.  Regardless, I put a light layer on at night to see if my skin woyld like it.  LOL...it smelt like I slathered peanut butter on my face.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it again.  Haven&#x27;t bothered to return it.  Sticking with what works- Argan oil, coconut oil and castor oil.</li>
            <li> november 30, 2014 update: amazon notified me about a comment left on this review.  it was shea terra organics saying they were sorry about how the product arrived.  they just happened across my review and wanted to apologize and send some good product out at no charge.  what i have learned from this experience is that in addition to writing a review, i should have contacted the manufacturer directly about the experience and not have assumed as i did that they would know about it.  the original review is below with a qualification at the end.  it always surprised me that i never heard back about this, and now i know why.  since the situation has been righted, i am increasing my stars to three from one, because things can happen and manufacturers should not be villianized over mistakes when they correct them in good faith.  the original order still gets one star.  the contact gets five stars, so i averaged the stars to three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a hint of a problem before opening the envelope, as it was oily, so I knew the bottle must be leaking.  It was worse than that; the black cap appears to have dissolved right inside the envelope.  I read a review of this product that described this exact thing, but ordered it anyway because most of the other reviews were good.  What a shame, as not only do I now have to make the effort to return it, i have to re-order and wait for another, hopefully better product to arrive.  How old must this have been to have dissolved the cap, or rubber inside the bottle, or whatever black stuff is dissolved in there, that is actually LETTING THE OIL LEAK OUT?  This is the single most disgusting buying experience I have ever had.  :)  And there isn&#x27;t much else to do but laugh and be grateful that it arrived as it did, so i didn&#x27;t use any of it!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, tamanu nut oil is terrific.  I have used tamanu nut oil in the past, and will continue to use it, but not from Shea Terra Organics or their seller ToysNGamesEtc.  [11/30/14 insert: i rescind my comments about Shea Terra the manufacturer, but not about ToysNGamesEtc because as the seller, they must have known about my return as well as this review and they not only never contacted me but apparently did not advise the manufacturer of the problem.]scind my comments about Shea Terra the manufacturer, but not about ToysNGamesEtc because as the seller, they must have known about my return as well as this review and they not only never contacted me but apparently did not advise the manufacturer of the problem.]</li>
            <li> I do not generally endorse items.  However, this item is THE BEST EVER in reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation.  The instructions say to apply it five times per day, but I wear makeup and cannot do that, so I usually apply twice per day.  I started using it in January of this year and I have to say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  I&#x27;ve tried everything to reduce acne scarring and while things work gradually and over time (about a year to fade a scar), I can say that I see noticable results with this oil in about a month.  The scars are not gone in a month (though they are in about three), but there&#x27;s a marked difference.&lt;br /&gt;To give some background, I&#x27;m African American with a dark complexion.  Over the last year I have been dealing with adult acne centered around the bottom and sides of my face.  Once a pimple disappears, it usually scars to almost a black color (I would post pics, but my vanity won&#x27;t allow me to).  This oil has helped to eliminate some scars and fade most others in the four months I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I don&#x27;t usually endorse things, but I fully endorse this product.  I will also say that I think the brand is important also.  I purchased something containing tamanu from another manufacturer and it actually contributed to me breaking out more vs. clearing my skin.  Bottom line, I can be confident makeup-free nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE TAMANU!  If I could, I would marry it.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The smell is putrid, but diminishes after application.  I would slather yourself in it though.</li>
            <li> Previously I entered a rather scathing review of this item. Hopefully if I will be brief and concise this one will get published. The bottle I received was a rubber eye dropper type bottle not like the one pictured. The rubber on top was deteriorated and the contents spilling out. The contents seemed rancid to me. I did not return because it was a mess.  Update: 12/6/2014 - The company contacted me and offered a replacement in the proper bottle. I received it in a couple of days and it was what I had initially expected - intact easy to squirt dispenser - the product smelled and appeared fresh. I have used it and it is an excellent product for the skin. Some people may be sensitive to the &amp;#34;earthiness&amp;#34; of the odor of the product but it is what it is supposed to be and the odor wears off mostly after applying. Will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> It MIGHT be a wonder oil.  I don&#x27;t know.  I can&#x27;t get past the smell to use it.  I used it one time, and the acrid, musty smell just lingered!  It was Horrible!  It also has a nasty brown color to it, so beware of you plan on putting it on your face.</li>
            <li> Good quality tamanu oil.  Love the applicator.  The pump type.  This products really heals any skin condition quickly.  I get rose thorns, scrapes, and skin allergies.  Best product and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> You either love it or hate it --so it seems, but I love it.  I used it after a nasty infected wound would not heal.  I gave up on the many different things I was doing on advice of dr.  I started to incorporate this and it started to heal.  I discovered that what works for you one week might not work for you the next week. Plus, your skin benefits from the different nutrients that comes with changing up your oils. If one week your face feels a little oily, use a lighter oil and vice versa.  Now I put a few drops on the &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; facial points, (chin, cheeks, eyes, lips, nose)  and if I have a wound I apply to wound several times a day until healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its got 100% pure madagascar tamanu oil.  Its doesn&#x27;t smell so great, but so what.  It works.  Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the scent of a smoky fire, and it works WONDERS - I put it on my face and hands because I get acne/cuts frequently, and they heal much faster. Bonus: excellent moisturizer mixed with your regular lotion, perfect for the winter flakiness I get.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for skin problems including scars, acne, fine lines, cuts, abrasions, etc.  It is a very small bottle for the price, so if you are going to use it on your skin, I would recommend mixing it with another less expensive oil or cream.  Oh ya, and btw, it doesn&#x27;t smell that good, but I don&#x27;t mind since it works well!&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars, except for the price being as high as it is!</li>
            <li> this tamanu oil is really good for just about any skin problem. i use it on the old brown spots(caused by too much sun)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mixed with argan oil on my face.  I think it making a difference.  I have not used it long enough to rate it five.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tamanu Oil on my face for a couple of years and like the texture.  My face does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. The odor is pungent the first time you use it, but quickly becomes familiar. My acne is not completely gone, but is much improved.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product to get rid of a rash and IT WORKED.  If you don&#x27;t care about oily hands you&#x27;ll do just fine.  This product is great.  I would order t again.</li>
            <li> Since my local Vitamin Shoppe discontinued carrying tamanu oil, I had to look for a new source.  I&#x27;m so pleased I found this tamanu oil from Shea Terra Organics, I love it.</li>
            <li> I had horrible hormonal acne...after a terrible experience with chemical products such as, salicylic acid, I came to the conclusion that my skin doesn&#x27;t like chemicals at all. After intense investigation I decided to go organic. Tamanu oil has cleared up my hormonal acne. Though I still have clogging, I no longer have any papules or pustules. I&#x27;ve only been using this product maybe a month and I&#x27;ve had AMAZING results. I&#x27;m going to continue using this in combination with various other organic products and see if I can once again have beautiful clear skin :D</li>
            <li> This was my first time both with Tamanu oil and with Shea Terra Organics and I am really sad to say it was horrible on both parts! I got the oil quickly and was super excited b/c of all the great reviews, so I was really anxious to try it. I already use organic Argan oil and just started  using  organic maracuja oil too, I read it makes them more effective if you switch it up every few days, so I decided to try some new ones to alternate in. I got this one for both myself and my Mom to try and right away neither of us liked the smell at all, which was super strong and not pleasent at Ã ll, but I would tolerate it if the oil worked. After a few tries it gave my Mom&#x27;s neck and face a bad rash and was starting to break me out too. But I had read that it really helped with brown age and hormone spots so I wanted to keep trying it  for that .&lt;br /&gt;But the next time I went to use it  just a few days afer getting it, I found it had melted black rubber from the dropper top, running down the dropper into the oil like toxic sludge! And more melted black rubber all around the rim and underneath the dropper top lid, which I forgot to say was noticably deformed on arrival, it was stuck pushed together and a lot thinner on one side. But it looked like it would still work after opening it, I never would&#x27;ve thought it was all thinned out b/c it had been melting into the oil the whole time! Scary! So I wrote to them telling what happened requesting a full refund and hoping for some answers, I was really worried about having using melted rubber on my face and my Moms too, esp with the itchy rash it gave her, but they didn&#x27;t write back at all! Not even an apology! No explanation, nothing! I mailed the  bottle back and Thank God got a refund, but I am shocked and disgusted that I still haven&#x27;t heard back from them. Very bad business! Very scary experience! It still scares me, what the heck was in that bottle that it actually melted, liquidfied the black rubber dropper top???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never order anything from this company ever again! Please check your oils and bottles carefully&lt;br /&gt;Before using!</li>
            <li> I started out very happy with this product. The quality of the oil seemed nice and I liked the texture (it absorbed well into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy). I viewed Shea Terra Organics as a trusted brand... until (a few weeks into using the product) the cap dissolved and leaked black goo into the oil. I had to transfer the oil out of the bottle into a different container and will not be purchasing from this company again unless they fix this packaging issue. The bottom line is that I would definitely recommend trying tamanu oil - just not from this company.</li>
            <li> I bought it to add to my facial moisturizer, but it&#x27;s too thick and left my face feeling too oily despite having used just a tiny amount.  Maybe that was the wasn&#x27;t the best thing to do with it?  I pretty much just use it now for moisturizing my cuticles and elbows.  Also, small cuts and scratches really do seem to heal more quickly when I apply a bit of this on them throughout the day... don&#x27;t know if it is simply the act of applying any type of oil to the cuts or if it&#x27;s due to some special property of tamanu oil.  And with regards to the scent, it is a bit odd but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to get past the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell....but if you can, it is a great oil.  I am using to heal my cheek after treatment for skin cancer.  Very healing.</li>
            <li> Product/shipment arrived on time. The product was damaged. The stopper had a cut made in it which renders it useless and caused small leakage. Still able to use the oil inside just not the stopper. Perhaps it was damaged whilst being re-packed or inspected for customs.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but would suggest when shipping in the summer, perhaps the eye dropper should be packaged separately and not alrady on the bottle.  Mine melted in our AZ heat and now I have bits of black rubber (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s melted rubber from the eye dropper) in the oil!</li>
