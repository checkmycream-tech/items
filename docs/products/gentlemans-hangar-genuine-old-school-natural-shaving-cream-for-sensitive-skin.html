            <li>A friend recommended this shaving cream to me, and I&#x27;m certainly glad they did!  </li>
            <li>In any case, I just love the smell and feel of sandalwood!</li>

            <li>It makes shaving smooth and has a great smell.</li>

            <li>Has a nice scent to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; These are my honest opinions after having tried this product.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>and I thought this would be a nice treat for him.</li>
            <li>This shave cream is nice.</li>
            <li>Product provided at a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent of GH is quite nice, and tends to linger longer than the TOBS, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>My uncle really liked this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say I&#x27;m done with foams and gels from the grocery store.  </li>

            <li>Recommended as it is easy to lather, pleasant scented, and effective.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply, gives a great lather, and leaves my face with a very smooth, refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far, 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>Leaves a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome lather and leaves my skin very soft.</li>

            <li>The aroma is mild and pleasant, and does not affect the scent of an aftershave.</li>
            <li>Nice, light sandlewood scent that the wife liked.  </li>
            <li>So it it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything but shaving cream to me, but it&#x27;s a very smooth and soothing shaving cream.</li>

            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some shave creams out there.  </li>
            <li>As for the shave itself, it was ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Awesome quality and will continue to use daily!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, aside from the price, we love this product and will buy again for twice a week use.</li>
            <li>Although the shaving with the razor takes longer, my shave is usually better.  </li>
            <li>He was okay with it.  </li>
            <li>Love the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>You dont need much to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the TOBS provides better cushion and better glide for the razor.</li>
            <li>If I had I would have bought more than just one that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use the art of shaving sandalwood shaving cream and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>this helps many of you.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and</li>
            <li>So many shaving creams and gels are laden with chemicals to make your skin tingle, and I think that is designed to make you think more is happening.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This shaving cream smells amazing, and leaves skin ultra smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so buttery and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and a full, rich lather.  </li>
            <li>Has a great lather, holds to the face well with or without a lot of growth and is decently priced.  </li>
            <li>Just like I steal his razors, I am excited to use this stuff too!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this shave cream a shot and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li>I was able to make three easy passes without any nicks, cuts, or redness using a Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl with an Astra</li>
            <li>This cream reduced my irritation and allowed me to feel more confident and comfortable after shaving.</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it and is very happy with this high quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, but smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had issues with shaving but wanted to go for a top line cream instead of the cheap 3 dollar supermarket ones.</li>
            <li>Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cute and clean</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how easy it was to make lather.</li>
            <li>Easy to lather.</li>
            <li>You can also warm it up under hot water very quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried it on without washing my face with soap and in spite of the early morning oils on the skin, this went on like nothing and performed remarkably.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made with great healthy ingredients and will be giving it as gifts as everyone who tries it, loves it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that my husband has ever tried this kind of shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I used my hand and not a brush to apply this (just like you would with a gel) and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>He likes it because it leaves his face smooth and because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (like after shave does).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply straight from the container and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>It turns out I was using too little water for my first 3 shaves, but once I learned of my error I moved onto shave number 4 and experienced a very nice lather.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t cheap products but if being clean-shaven and comfortable (no redness, itchiness, etc.) is important to you, these products can be lifesaving.</li>
            <li>This is important  as you know that is what helps in shaving.</li>
            <li>After he shaved his skin was smooth to the touch and there was no irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I liked the consistency and fast order fulfillment.</li>
            <li>My face was smooth and stayed moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>This is great not only for the man in your life</li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely keep using this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and my legs feel silky smooth when I&#x27;m finished shaving.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and made my husband&#x27;s skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall this is great.</li>
            <li>I like it because his face is so smooth after he uses it and stays smooth.  </li>
            <li>No smell (light fragrant)&lt;br /&gt;- Not abrasive on skin</li>
            <li>the shave is incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>He says it gives him a smooth shave and prevents nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any irritation but it is not quite as comfortable of a shave.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised when he told me he loved it</li>
            <li>As good as any of Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this is the soft, warm, woodsy aroma.  </li>
            <li>His skin was nice and soft and he smelled fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying the Shaving Cream, your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face incredibly smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>the best on the market for smooth moisturizing slick shave.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he loves it, he was using a bar soap (a shaving one) but wanted to upgrade to something better, and this is exactly what he needed.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare this to at first because I was new to DE shaving, thus I figured since I was able to get a nice lather and clean shave</li>
            <li>I did touch his face, and it was super smooth.  </li>
            <li>It left my face smooth, my skin felt good.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who use DE safety razors, a rich lather is very important and this cream just didn&#x27;t lather much at all with my badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>Certainly the most practical way of using shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I did not get a special deal to try this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Nothing special to talk about here.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizes skin and smells like heaven :)</li>
            <li>You get a good shave and it last.</li>
            <li>First off it has a wonderful light scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for the bf and have snuck so much of it that I have to buy him more.</li>
            <li>The Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream comes packaged in a very nice jar.</li>
            <li>First I loaded my Perfecto Badger brush in a cup of bowl of very warm water while I took a shower (several minutes).</li>
            <li>, the sandalwood scent was inferior and after the shave the skin was not at all soothed by this product but mildly irritated.</li>
            <li>it must be worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Being a girl, I am particular about the products I put on my skin, and I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for any man :)</li>
            <li>Bought this for an insanely low price to try it and love it!  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream is easily the same if not a lil bit better during the shave.  </li>
            <li>He really likes the close, smooth shave</li>
            <li>We will definitely be purchasing more of this as I tried it on my legs and it leaves them extremely smooth and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular customer of &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; but I found this shaving cream to give me a much more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I love natural products, and this one smells and feels just as advertised.</li>
            <li>The smell is most certainly masculine but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The lather is better than other shaving creams I&#x27;ve used and my skin felt so much better after shaving with Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar&#x27;s Shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely love the smell and the texture is so much more luxurious than other products we have tried.</li>
            <li>it makes shaving close painless and easy for a super soft feel.  </li>
            <li>My razor blade just glides over my face; I think I&#x27;m finished hunting for the right shaving cream</li>
            <li>I am pretty particular about what I use for shaving cream due to my sensitive skin but this product is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>This shave cream does a great job lubricating the face, and takes very little to do so.  </li>
            <li>F. Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood, which will give you a great soothing, truly luxurious shave for no more cost.</li>
            <li>This shave cream works pretty well, but takes a while to get a good lather compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but it still required some practice before I got the technique down good enough to enjoy a nick free shave.</li>
            <li>It can definitely make an elegant and useful gift for any Gentlemen in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old School Sandalwood Shave Cream has a very mild aroma.  </li>
            <li>The Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar however does a better job of lubricating I believe, or at least on par, and always leaves my skin feeling nice post-shave.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this new cream, and had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>Nostalgia is what happened when I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it would that much more better with a brush.</li>
            <li>Lathers up very well!</li>
            <li>I first attempted to use it with the matching GH synthetic badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I will definitely re-order more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>Appreciate that it has natural ingredients and is paraben free.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood smell of this cream smells more like sandalwood mixed with first-aid cream.</li>
            <li>Overall there are better performing creams to be had.</li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients and that its paraben free.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband &amp; the first time he used it, he said he didn&#x27;t care for the oily feel, clogged razors and overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Just recently tried this shaving cream out and love it.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>First my husband tried it.  </li>
            <li>Lather properties first rate.</li>
            <li>Im able to get that close shave and not worry about regretting it hours later.  </li>
            <li>is my first ever shave cream that requires a brush.</li>
            <li>I used TOBS for my first shave with a Feather</li>
            <li>I have been a user of an expensive mall brand for about a decade and thought it was the best.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>Comfortable, old school feeling.</li>
            <li>I literally threw out my Bikini Zone after the first time I used this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad we finally found</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend stealing some for yourself!!</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it first.</li>
            <li>It almost seems unscented other than that beautiful lather, nice and thick cream, very buttery, well moisturized with a  close shave</li>
            <li>Wanted to try something different as I have never really used a shaving cream I liked, and a friend recommended Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very promptly, and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Overall though I have to say TOBS is a superior shave cream and will likely aways have a place in my rotation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I still think this is a decent cream, but for the price and the amount of cream you have to use to build a large enough lather, it doesn&#x27;t deserve any more stars imo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order this product as I normally stick with the big name brands, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>The texture is like whipped cream, and just the slightest dab of the brush tips into it provides constant lather - enough for a relather or two - although I honestly haven&#x27;t had to reshave after the first run.</li>
            <li>My skin felt hydrated and soft after, but the sandalwood-first aid cream smell lingered for half the day after a good rinse.</li>
            <li>and I finally achieved what I consider a perfect lather in my limited experience wet shaving with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and with little effort, smells fantastic, and leaves skin smooth and irritation</li>
            <li>I then applied about a large almond size of shave cream to the brush hairs and swirled in circles in the bowl for about 20 to 30 seconds, added several drops of water to the brush and stirred another 20 to 30 seconds, and then added a few more drops of water and continued stirring for about 20 more seconds.</li>
            <li>HAHA.</li>
            <li>If you want a really comforting shave then this works.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed after my shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and he absolutely raved about it.</li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t really care for the scent,more musty than sandlewood.</li>
            <li>He is very picky about his shave cream</li>
            <li>He loves it and wants me to buy it for him again.</li>
            <li>Some shaving cream leave a very distinctive smell and we do not like that.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shave cream I have used because I normally shave with an electric razor to save time.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is so much easier and faster since I do not have to labor over making lather or even the quality of lather.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  mix too well and drys out fast once applied</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>(although I never got him to try a straight razor shave at the barber).</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to my husband using the Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream is an experience in itself.  </li>
            <li>He is into natural products, it leaves his face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the other big wet shaving brands but at a better price.  </li>
            <li>One more thing to mention for the GH cream is that I was getting much better shaves when using Astra and Gillette blades, but when I tried the Feather brand this week I got several small nicks.</li>
            <li>Gentleman&#x27;s Hanger Old School is natural and mild.  </li>
            <li>I ordered some for my husband and frequently steal it to shave me leggies ;-)</li>
            <li>It is kind of a small container.</li>
            <li>My armpits are smooth and clear for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>It has not only left his skin with no irritation at all but very smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Previously I had been squeezing the hairs to get most of the water out</li>
            <li>Thick and creamy, smells a bit powdery and slightly feminine, but fades quickly and the shave is great.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but then I read to shake it instead so that it holds a little more water.</li>
            <li>He wanted a clean shave that left his face soft</li>
            <li>He says it has quite a bit of slip to it, which means it allows his razor to slide quite easily over his face, and he got an extremely close shave with this.</li>
            <li>The next time he followed instructions of using a very small amount (just a dab instead of the usual amounts with regular shaving cream), &amp; it was a huge difference-- nice smooth skin, no razor issues and a light scent.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews and decided to try this cream instead of my usual bar of soap, I was amazed at how good of a lather you can get with a just a tiny amount of this cream.</li>
            <li>It is not as thick as I&#x27;d like, but maybe I&#x27;m just to used to the kind that squirts out of a can.  </li>
            <li>While shaving I noticed a significant difference from the other shaving cream I normally use, I was able to get a closer shave with less effort and NO skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li>This is my new brand now.</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice, but subtle smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Hemlock and classic Sandalwood shaving creams from GH for a while now, and the Old School Sandalwood delivers just like the rest.</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to avoid knicks and the smell is good too.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>but there are several safe oils that would work; simply apply it between shaves, especially when irritation starts.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging from the brown and white, wood textured cardboard box to the artfully labeled black and white container.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it smelled a little bit more like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>My husband shaves his head in the spring and it makes it soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I actually put some on my hands because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>it is silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Myhusband has a sensitive skin and often gets irritations after shaving.</li>
            <li>The process of shaving with it feels like an experience at the old barberâ€™s saloon when the attention to details and to the quality of the product was important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes him feel like he&#x27;s at an old school barbershop every time he uses it.</li>
            <li>I started over with my old badger brush.</li>
            <li>and I like how soft it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My husband used it on his face and it was soft and smelled yummy.  </li>
            <li>also have sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.</li>
            <li>My lather was complete.</li>
            <li>That was until I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS).</li>
            <li>He feels like he is channeling his grandfather like in the old days.</li>
            <li>All he needs is one of those old shavers and buffer brush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this completely got rid of my redness</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I have is it doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood much.</li>
            <li>You dont have to use much, so it should last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>this product!&lt;br /&gt;This, paired with an old fashioned shaving brush (which makes it go farther)</li>
            <li>I brushed the cream on my face and swept the brush back and forth across my neck and cheeks until I felt the consistency was right</li>
            <li>He shaves everyday, so it is very useful for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite part is when I use it to shave areas that normally leave little red bumps: NO little red bumps!!</li>
            <li>I generally do not use after-shave after using this cream, as I feel a natural cooling-effect from the product itself, but this could very from person to person.</li>
            <li>Fragrances are usually too strong and can even alter the taste of breakfast before they wear off.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorites due to its reasonable price and high quality.</li>
            <li>He says that after trying the Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream he is not going back to his usual drugstore bought shaving creams again.</li>
            <li>really does go a long way!</li>
            <li>My husband loves that he needs a very little amount of the shaving cream to cover his face and neck to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I have bought cheaper knockoff brands at Walmart that do a much better job for less than half the money.  </li>
            <li>This time when I applied the cream to my face it had a nice shiny white sheen with very minimal air bubbles, and it was slick to the touch which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>He said it reminds him of the old days and it left his face softer than he has had in years.</li>
            <li>Going back to Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li>Apparently she likes it too...</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to such things, and allergic to colognes and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>and kept trying to refine my technique to completely stop the redness, itchiness, and irritation that would start immediately or the next day.</li>
            <li>This might not be a complete fix for everyone if your issue is different</li>
            <li>Sandal wood gives a natural feel of cooling your skin, and is used in traditional Indian healing methods (ayurveda).</li>
            <li>Smell is ok though but not great.</li>
            <li>You do not need much to get a nice thick lather with a subtle sandalwood smell.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based on other reviews - I really can&#x27;t agree with what others have said about the scent.  </li>
            <li>I had very small expectation for being impressed by shave cream, boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li>It is about half the price of what I was using before, and I don&#x27;t need to use as much for each application so it lasts longer as well.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any trouble and will certainly continue buying.</li>
            <li>After you shave this product wins hands down it leaves the skin smooth and soft with none of those annoying bumps on my neck from razor burn plus this is at least 10 dollars cheaper than my next favorite shave cream.  </li>

            <li> Has a nice scent to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; These are my honest opinions after having tried this product.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> and I thought this would be a nice treat for him.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is nice.</li>
            <li> Product provided at a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent of GH is quite nice, and tends to linger longer than the TOBS, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> My uncle really liked this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say I&#x27;m done with foams and gels from the grocery store.  </li>

            <li> Recommended as it is easy to lather, pleasant scented, and effective.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply, gives a great lather, and leaves my face with a very smooth, refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and amazing!</li>

            <li> Nice, light sandlewood scent that the wife liked.  </li>
            <li> So it it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything but shaving cream to me, but it&#x27;s a very smooth and soothing shaving cream.</li>

            <li> Leaves my face feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients is a nice plus and the feel of it on the skin is great.</li>
            <li> I was able to produce lots of lather.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be ok on my skin though.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband loves this even i tried  for shaving my legs love love</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some shave creams out there.  </li>
            <li> As for the shave itself, it was ok.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality and will continue to use daily!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, aside from the price, we love this product and will buy again for twice a week use.</li>
            <li> Although the shaving with the razor takes longer, my shave is usually better.  </li>
            <li> He was okay with it.  </li>
            <li> Love the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> You dont need much to get a great shave.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the TOBS provides better cushion and better glide for the razor.</li>
            <li> If I had I would have bought more than just one that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use the art of shaving sandalwood shaving cream and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> this helps many of you.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and</li>
            <li> So many shaving creams and gels are laden with chemicals to make your skin tingle, and I think that is designed to make you think more is happening.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This shaving cream smells amazing, and leaves skin ultra smooth.</li>
            <li> It is so buttery and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and a full, rich lather.  </li>
            <li> Has a great lather, holds to the face well with or without a lot of growth and is decently priced.  </li>
            <li> Just like I steal his razors, I am excited to use this stuff too!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this shave cream a shot and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li> I was able to make three easy passes without any nicks, cuts, or redness using a Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl with an Astra</li>
            <li> This cream reduced my irritation and allowed me to feel more confident and comfortable after shaving.</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it and is very happy with this high quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, but smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with shaving but wanted to go for a top line cream instead of the cheap 3 dollar supermarket ones.</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cute and clean</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easy it was to make lather.</li>
            <li> Easy to lather.</li>
            <li> You can also warm it up under hot water very quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried it on without washing my face with soap and in spite of the early morning oils on the skin, this went on like nothing and performed remarkably.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s made with great healthy ingredients and will be giving it as gifts as everyone who tries it, loves it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that my husband has ever tried this kind of shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I used my hand and not a brush to apply this (just like you would with a gel) and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> He likes it because it leaves his face smooth and because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (like after shave does).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply straight from the container and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> It turns out I was using too little water for my first 3 shaves, but once I learned of my error I moved onto shave number 4 and experienced a very nice lather.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t cheap products but if being clean-shaven and comfortable (no redness, itchiness, etc.) is important to you, these products can be lifesaving.</li>
            <li> This is important  as you know that is what helps in shaving.</li>
            <li> After he shaved his skin was smooth to the touch and there was no irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I liked the consistency and fast order fulfillment.</li>
            <li> My face was smooth and stayed moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> This is great not only for the man in your life</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely keep using this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and my legs feel silky smooth when I&#x27;m finished shaving.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well and made my husband&#x27;s skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall this is great.</li>
            <li> I like it because his face is so smooth after he uses it and stays smooth.  </li>
            <li> No smell (light fragrant)&lt;br /&gt;- Not abrasive on skin</li>
            <li> the shave is incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> He says it gives him a smooth shave and prevents nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any irritation but it is not quite as comfortable of a shave.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised when he told me he loved it</li>
            <li> As good as any of Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is the soft, warm, woodsy aroma.  </li>
            <li> His skin was nice and soft and he smelled fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying the Shaving Cream, your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face incredibly smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> the best on the market for smooth moisturizing slick shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it, he was using a bar soap (a shaving one) but wanted to upgrade to something better, and this is exactly what he needed.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare this to at first because I was new to DE shaving, thus I figured since I was able to get a nice lather and clean shave</li>
            <li> I did touch his face, and it was super smooth.  </li>
            <li> It left my face smooth, my skin felt good.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who use DE safety razors, a rich lather is very important and this cream just didn&#x27;t lather much at all with my badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Certainly the most practical way of using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I did not get a special deal to try this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to talk about here.  </li>
            <li> It really moisturizes skin and smells like heaven :)</li>
            <li> You get a good shave and it last.</li>
            <li> First off it has a wonderful light scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for the bf and have snuck so much of it that I have to buy him more.</li>
            <li> The Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream comes packaged in a very nice jar.</li>
            <li> First I loaded my Perfecto Badger brush in a cup of bowl of very warm water while I took a shower (several minutes).</li>
            <li> , the sandalwood scent was inferior and after the shave the skin was not at all soothed by this product but mildly irritated.</li>
            <li> it must be worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Being a girl, I am particular about the products I put on my skin, and I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for any man :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for an insanely low price to try it and love it!  </li>
            <li> This shaving cream is easily the same if not a lil bit better during the shave.  </li>
            <li> He really likes the close, smooth shave</li>
            <li> We will definitely be purchasing more of this as I tried it on my legs and it leaves them extremely smooth and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular customer of &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; but I found this shaving cream to give me a much more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I love natural products, and this one smells and feels just as advertised.</li>
            <li> The smell is most certainly masculine but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lather is better than other shaving creams I&#x27;ve used and my skin felt so much better after shaving with Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar&#x27;s Shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> We absolutely love the smell and the texture is so much more luxurious than other products we have tried.</li>
            <li> it makes shaving close painless and easy for a super soft feel.  </li>
            <li> My razor blade just glides over my face; I think I&#x27;m finished hunting for the right shaving cream</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular about what I use for shaving cream due to my sensitive skin but this product is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> This shave cream does a great job lubricating the face, and takes very little to do so.  </li>
            <li> F. Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood, which will give you a great soothing, truly luxurious shave for no more cost.</li>
            <li> This shave cream works pretty well, but takes a while to get a good lather compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but it still required some practice before I got the technique down good enough to enjoy a nick free shave.</li>
            <li> It can definitely make an elegant and useful gift for any Gentlemen in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old School Sandalwood Shave Cream has a very mild aroma.  </li>
            <li> The Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar however does a better job of lubricating I believe, or at least on par, and always leaves my skin feeling nice post-shave.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new cream, and had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> Nostalgia is what happened when I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it would that much more better with a brush.</li>
            <li> Lathers up very well!</li>
            <li> I first attempted to use it with the matching GH synthetic badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I will definitely re-order more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Appreciate that it has natural ingredients and is paraben free.</li>
            <li> The sandalwood smell of this cream smells more like sandalwood mixed with first-aid cream.</li>
            <li> Overall there are better performing creams to be had.</li>
            <li> and I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients and that its paraben free.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband &amp; the first time he used it, he said he didn&#x27;t care for the oily feel, clogged razors and overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Just recently tried this shaving cream out and love it.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> First my husband tried it.  </li>
            <li> Lather properties first rate.</li>
            <li> Im able to get that close shave and not worry about regretting it hours later.  </li>
            <li> is my first ever shave cream that requires a brush.</li>
            <li> I used TOBS for my first shave with a Feather</li>
            <li> I have been a user of an expensive mall brand for about a decade and thought it was the best.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Comfortable, old school feeling.</li>
            <li> I literally threw out my Bikini Zone after the first time I used this stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad we finally found</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend stealing some for yourself!!</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it first.</li>
            <li> It almost seems unscented other than that beautiful lather, nice and thick cream, very buttery, well moisturized with a  close shave</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something different as I have never really used a shaving cream I liked, and a friend recommended Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very promptly, and I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Overall though I have to say TOBS is a superior shave cream and will likely aways have a place in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I still think this is a decent cream, but for the price and the amount of cream you have to use to build a large enough lather, it doesn&#x27;t deserve any more stars imo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product as I normally stick with the big name brands, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> The texture is like whipped cream, and just the slightest dab of the brush tips into it provides constant lather - enough for a relather or two - although I honestly haven&#x27;t had to reshave after the first run.</li>
            <li> My skin felt hydrated and soft after, but the sandalwood-first aid cream smell lingered for half the day after a good rinse.</li>
            <li> and I finally achieved what I consider a perfect lather in my limited experience wet shaving with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and with little effort, smells fantastic, and leaves skin smooth and irritation</li>
            <li> I then applied about a large almond size of shave cream to the brush hairs and swirled in circles in the bowl for about 20 to 30 seconds, added several drops of water to the brush and stirred another 20 to 30 seconds, and then added a few more drops of water and continued stirring for about 20 more seconds.</li>
            <li> HAHA.</li>
            <li> If you want a really comforting shave then this works.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed after my shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and he absolutely raved about it.</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t really care for the scent,more musty than sandlewood.</li>
            <li> He is very picky about his shave cream</li>
            <li> He loves it and wants me to buy it for him again.</li>
            <li> Some shaving cream leave a very distinctive smell and we do not like that.  </li>
            <li> This is the first shave cream I have used because I normally shave with an electric razor to save time.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is so much easier and faster since I do not have to labor over making lather or even the quality of lather.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  mix too well and drys out fast once applied</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> (although I never got him to try a straight razor shave at the barber).</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to my husband using the Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream is an experience in itself.  </li>
            <li> He is into natural products, it leaves his face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the other big wet shaving brands but at a better price.  </li>
            <li> One more thing to mention for the GH cream is that I was getting much better shaves when using Astra and Gillette blades, but when I tried the Feather brand this week I got several small nicks.</li>
            <li> Gentleman&#x27;s Hanger Old School is natural and mild.  </li>
            <li> I ordered some for my husband and frequently steal it to shave me leggies ;-)</li>
            <li> It is kind of a small container.</li>
            <li> My armpits are smooth and clear for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> It has not only left his skin with no irritation at all but very smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been squeezing the hairs to get most of the water out</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy, smells a bit powdery and slightly feminine, but fades quickly and the shave is great.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but then I read to shake it instead so that it holds a little more water.</li>
            <li> He wanted a clean shave that left his face soft</li>
            <li> He says it has quite a bit of slip to it, which means it allows his razor to slide quite easily over his face, and he got an extremely close shave with this.</li>
            <li> The next time he followed instructions of using a very small amount (just a dab instead of the usual amounts with regular shaving cream), &amp; it was a huge difference-- nice smooth skin, no razor issues and a light scent.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided to try this cream instead of my usual bar of soap, I was amazed at how good of a lather you can get with a just a tiny amount of this cream.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as I&#x27;d like, but maybe I&#x27;m just to used to the kind that squirts out of a can.  </li>
            <li> While shaving I noticed a significant difference from the other shaving cream I normally use, I was able to get a closer shave with less effort and NO skin irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This is my new brand now.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice, but subtle smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hemlock and classic Sandalwood shaving creams from GH for a while now, and the Old School Sandalwood delivers just like the rest.</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to avoid knicks and the smell is good too.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> but there are several safe oils that would work; simply apply it between shaves, especially when irritation starts.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging from the brown and white, wood textured cardboard box to the artfully labeled black and white container.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it smelled a little bit more like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head in the spring and it makes it soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I actually put some on my hands because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> it is silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> Myhusband has a sensitive skin and often gets irritations after shaving.</li>
            <li> The process of shaving with it feels like an experience at the old barberâ€™s saloon when the attention to details and to the quality of the product was important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes him feel like he&#x27;s at an old school barbershop every time he uses it.</li>
            <li> I started over with my old badger brush.</li>
            <li> and I like how soft it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My husband used it on his face and it was soft and smelled yummy.  </li>
            <li> also have sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.</li>
            <li> My lather was complete.</li>
            <li> That was until I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS).</li>
            <li> He feels like he is channeling his grandfather like in the old days.</li>
            <li> All he needs is one of those old shavers and buffer brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this completely got rid of my redness</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I have is it doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood much.</li>
            <li> You dont have to use much, so it should last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> this product!&lt;br /&gt;This, paired with an old fashioned shaving brush (which makes it go farther)</li>
            <li> I brushed the cream on my face and swept the brush back and forth across my neck and cheeks until I felt the consistency was right</li>
            <li> He shaves everyday, so it is very useful for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite part is when I use it to shave areas that normally leave little red bumps: NO little red bumps!!</li>
            <li> I generally do not use after-shave after using this cream, as I feel a natural cooling-effect from the product itself, but this could very from person to person.</li>
            <li> Fragrances are usually too strong and can even alter the taste of breakfast before they wear off.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites due to its reasonable price and high quality.</li>
            <li> He says that after trying the Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream he is not going back to his usual drugstore bought shaving creams again.</li>
            <li> really does go a long way!</li>
            <li> My husband loves that he needs a very little amount of the shaving cream to cover his face and neck to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I have bought cheaper knockoff brands at Walmart that do a much better job for less than half the money.  </li>
            <li> This time when I applied the cream to my face it had a nice shiny white sheen with very minimal air bubbles, and it was slick to the touch which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> He said it reminds him of the old days and it left his face softer than he has had in years.</li>
            <li> Going back to Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li> Apparently she likes it too...</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to such things, and allergic to colognes and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> and kept trying to refine my technique to completely stop the redness, itchiness, and irritation that would start immediately or the next day.</li>
            <li> This might not be a complete fix for everyone if your issue is different</li>
            <li> Sandal wood gives a natural feel of cooling your skin, and is used in traditional Indian healing methods (ayurveda).</li>
            <li> Smell is ok though but not great.</li>
            <li> You do not need much to get a nice thick lather with a subtle sandalwood smell.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews - I really can&#x27;t agree with what others have said about the scent.  </li>
            <li> I had very small expectation for being impressed by shave cream, boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> It is about half the price of what I was using before, and I don&#x27;t need to use as much for each application so it lasts longer as well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any trouble and will certainly continue buying.</li>
            <li> After you shave this product wins hands down it leaves the skin smooth and soft with none of those annoying bumps on my neck from razor burn plus this is at least 10 dollars cheaper than my next favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Looks like it going to last him a long time because only need a small amount and lather very well!</li>
            <li> It means that he doesnâ€™t need to buy shaving cream as often as  before because this 3.75 oz jar will last him quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent several hours over a weekend researching different brands and types of shaving cream and soaps before finally deciding to purchase Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar.</li>
            <li> One tub will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would attribute this to the natural ingredients of the cream such as Organic Aloe leaf juice, green tea extracts and Vitamin D and it is also Paraben-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been shaving the old fashion way for the past year with double blades.  </li>
            <li> He was surprised that a only a small amount is needed to cover his face and neck.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented and a small amount goes on thick.</li>
            <li> He switches and uses this every other day because he wanted to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> The TOBS explodes in lather with a little bit of water and a few stirs with the badger hair brush, whereas the Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar really doesn&#x27;t build a plentiful lather at all now that I have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 9 samples of artisan and other well known brands that I will be trying soon, and who knows, TOBS might just get bumped too.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to soften the hair as well as some other soaps.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after shaving either.  </li>
            <li> Skin felt dry.</li>
            <li> I should also mention that the reason I think this combination works for me is that I didn&#x27;t realize I had dry skin on my neck and shaving depletes the moisture.</li>
            <li> Now with this cream, my skin feels incredibly soft and I didn&#x27;t get the usual irritation that I do on my neck.  </li>
            <li> In addition; the container has a very thick bottom and you only get about half of what it would fit inside a standard container without the false bottom.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> Big lather from just a little bit of product.  </li>
            <li> I would probably purchase this or at least a different scent in this product line next time.</li>
            <li> I would encourage you to try this at least once, you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both like this cream and are now lifelong customers.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not a big wet shaver, though, so I am not sure how often he&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> -A little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It smells bad, left my face feeling like rubber, didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> , I have to give credit where credit is due.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the usual harshness or sensitivity after shaving my entire face, but it felt like I had just moisturizer my skin instead of just shaved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other shave creams trying to find one he likes that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg</li>
            <li> After shaving my face fees as irritated as when I use any other shaving cream or gel.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying other products from them.  </li>
            <li> I received a response explaining  how it is used like any other shaving soap</li>
            <li> looking forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> My legs stayed moisturized the rest of the day, which has never happened with any other product I&#x27;ve shaved with.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the performance with only natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that since using this product my face has been less irritated compared to using other shaving creams and gels.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something that was a little different than the usual canned shaving creams or gel.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with shave creams usually because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor burn down a lot, too.</li>
            <li> but ladies it works so well on legs and other areas!</li>
            <li> He typically uses Gillette or whatever is on sale at the store</li>
            <li> odd.</li>
            <li> but with a little less fragrance.</li>
            <li> reminded me of my Dad and grandfather when I was little.</li>
            <li> A little dab is all you need.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite &#x27;manly&#x27; to me, but I&#x27;ve used it on my legs &amp; a little</li>
            <li> A little price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble findin something that doesn&#x27;t cause them to break out.</li>
            <li> The experience between the two is night and day, yet not necessarily in a bad way, or not all bad at least.</li>
            <li> I would rank this somewhat lower than Nivea from Germany, a bit above average shave cream which only costs about $5-7 for a tube.  </li>
            <li> He also said it takes very little to cover his face.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my boyfriend who has VERY thick and rough hair on his face.</li>
            <li> Usually my face feels raw/irritated after a shave but not with Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past the off-odor.</li>
            <li> comfort level mediocre, a few minor nicks that I usually would have been protected from using a premium product</li>
            <li> There was no irritation after, but my shave was not as close as I can get with my usual creams.</li>
            <li> He used to cut his face a few times and now he said it&#x27;s like butter!</li>
            <li> A little expensive for everyday use</li>
            <li> The  GH brush was worthless (see my review on it) and couldn&#x27;t produce any real lathering.</li>
            <li> Poor cushioning, not overly slick,</li>
            <li> I got this for hubs, and I am addicted to the smell.</li>
            <li> Worse than using my shower gel.</li>
            <li> I found it to smell faintly like a brewery which is a smell that I like but just not in my shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> and it was comparable to an expensive brand he use to buy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lowered my review from 5 stars to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> One of the worst I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend but used it myself and HOLY CRAP!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for an insanely low price to try it and love it!  My husband shaves his head in the spring and it makes it soft and moisturized.  Really a big difference from using shaving cream. He and I both love what it does to his skin.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest shaving cream!</li>
            <li> Nostalgia is what happened when I used it for the first time. I must admit that I didn&#x27;t quite expect to be impressed this much with the shave cream. This is a very good product and sticks well to your face/beard. This is important  as you know that is what helps in shaving. I tried it on without washing my face with soap and in spite of the early morning oils on the skin, this went on like nothing and performed remarkably. The shave was great and the sandal wood smell is awesome. reminded me of my Dad and grandfather when I was little. Didn&#x27;t have to go over a second time, did the job wonderfully. I used a Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with this. I used my hand and not a brush to apply this (just like you would with a gel) and it worked fine. Not sure if it would that much more better with a brush.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a beard. HAHA. I got this for hubs, and I am addicted to the smell. I actually put some on my hands because I like it so much. it is silky and soft.  The scent is light and amazing!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it, he was using a bar soap (a shaving one) but wanted to upgrade to something better, and this is exactly what he needed. Looks like it going to last him a long time because only need a small amount and lather very well!</li>
            <li> I love when my boyfriend uses this shaving cream. He typically uses Gillette or whatever is on sale at the store but this is so amazing. His face smells wonderful and he never gets any razor bumps anymore. Just like I steal his razors, I am excited to use this stuff too! Just be careful, a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Myhusband has a sensitive skin and often gets irritations after shaving. Not this time. After he shaved his skin was smooth to the touch and there was no irritation whatsoever.  I would attribute this to the natural ingredients of the cream such as Organic Aloe leaf juice, green tea extracts and Vitamin D and it is also Paraben-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light, has a great consistency and smells wonderful but not overpowering. My husband loves that he needs a very little amount of the shaving cream to cover his face and neck to get a clean shave.  It means that he doesnâ€™t need to buy shaving cream as often as  before because this 3.75 oz jar will last him quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my husband using the Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream is an experience in itself.  The cream definitely doesnâ€™t feel like a mass produced product. The process of shaving with it feels like an experience at the old barberâ€™s saloon when the attention to details and to the quality of the product was important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream comes packaged in a very nice jar. It can definitely make an elegant and useful gift for any Gentlemen in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband LOVES this shaving cream! He says that after trying the Gentlemanâ€™s Hangar Genuine Old School Natural Shave Cream he is not going back to his usual drugstore bought shaving creams again. I received this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product as I normally stick with the big name brands, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.  It is about half the price of what I was using before, and I don&#x27;t need to use as much for each application so it lasts longer as well.  Goes on smooth and provides a great end result, all without an overpowering scent.  Next time I will be ordering the shave kit so I can try the Gentleman&#x27;s Hanger brush along with this shave cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product! You only need to use a little. Lathers up very well! I noticed that since using this product my face has been less irritated compared to using other shaving creams and gels. Leaves my face feeling nice and smooth. Has a nice scent to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; These are my honest opinions after having tried this product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works good, smells good, would buy again</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It makes him feel like he&#x27;s at an old school barbershop every time he uses it. It makes shaving smooth and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Reminded me of the shaving cream my grandpa used to use. I liked the consistency and fast order fulfillment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but this shaving cream is so good, I have to give credit where credit is due.  By far the best I have ever used.  Nothing on store shelves compare.  Great logo and packaging if you are looking for a manly gift.  You do not need much to get a nice thick lather with a subtle sandalwood smell.  Usually my face feels raw/irritated after a shave but not with Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar.  My face was smooth and stayed moisturized all day.  If Grizzly Adams used shaving cream, this would be his choice.</li>
            <li> My husband tried it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Cute and clean my dad loves this cream</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is amazing! It really moisturizes skin and smells like heaven :) I love that it&#x27;s made with great healthy ingredients and will be giving it as gifts as everyone who tries it, loves it.  I ordered some for my husband and frequently steal it to shave me leggies ;-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on other reviews - I really can&#x27;t agree with what others have said about the scent.  I found it to smell faintly like a brewery which is a smell that I like but just not in my shaving cream.  The performance is good but I can&#x27;t get past the off-odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s easy to apply straight from the container and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> Recommendable. I&#x27;ve never had issues with shaving but wanted to go for a top line cream instead of the cheap 3 dollar supermarket ones. Difference is good even for the money. All natural ingredients is a nice plus and the feel of it on the skin is great. Haven&#x27;t had any trouble and will certainly continue buying.</li>
            <li> I had very small expectation for being impressed by shave cream, boy was I wrong! I&#x27;m hooked for life!!!</li>
            <li> Great shave, happy with this product... definitely recommend and will purchase muself again</li>
            <li> This is great not only for the man in your life but ladies it works so well on legs and other areas! This cream reduced my irritation and allowed me to feel more confident and comfortable after shaving. It is thick enough to avoid knicks and the smell is good too. My husband and I both like this cream and are now lifelong customers.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Pleasant smell and a full, rich lather.  Every bit as good as the other big wet shaving brands but at a better price.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, gives me the closest shave of my life,and smells good to boot!</li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to give the impression of being one of the premium shave cream such as Trumpers or TOOBS. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Nice packaging from the brown and white, wood textured cardboard box to the artfully labeled black and white container. the contents however disappoint. I first attempted to use it with the matching GH synthetic badger shaving brush. The  GH brush was worthless (see my review on it) and couldn&#x27;t produce any real lathering. I started over with my old badger brush. I was able to produce lots of lather. However the performance was not up to premium standards. Poor cushioning, not overly slick, comfort level mediocre, a few minor nicks that I usually would have been protected from using a premium product, the sandalwood scent was inferior and after the shave the skin was not at all soothed by this product but mildly irritated. For the price it is no bargain as the container only holds 3.75 oz. I would rank this somewhat lower than Nivea from Germany, a bit above average shave cream which only costs about $5-7 for a tube.  A more wise and prudent purchase of a sandalwood shave cream would be Geo. F. Trumper&#x27;s sandalwood, which will give you a great soothing, truly luxurious shave for no more cost.</li>
            <li> It has almost no scent to it. So it it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything but shaving cream to me, but it&#x27;s a very smooth and soothing shaving cream. I would probably purchase this or at least a different scent in this product line next time. If you want a really comforting shave then this works. If you want it to smell like Sandalwood, I don&#x27;t think it does. That&#x27;s why 3 stars. It works great as a shaving product but not as a Sandalwood scented product.</li>
            <li> Yes it lathers so well it will leave you wondering. Make no mistake this is a cream. I did not now what reviewers of shave products meant when they mentioned &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; until using this. I have used all the brands of canned goo in the the last 30+ years of shaving. None left my skin feeling as protected as this. The scent isn&#x27;t over powering but it is there. A little dab is all you need. One tub will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has always had issues with skin irritation after shaving. He has tried just about everything on the market. A friend recommended Gentlemans hangar old-school sandalwood shave cream. It has not only left his skin with no irritation at all but very smooth and moisturized. We will definitely be purchasing more of this as I tried it on my legs and it leaves them extremely smooth and moisturized as well. Wonderful product at a great price !</li>
            <li> I saw this and had to get it for my father. He is in his 70s and I thought this would be a nice treat for him. He absolutely loves it. He said it reminds him of the old days and it left his face softer than he has had in years. He switches and uses this every other day because he wanted to make it last longer. It smells fantastic! He couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it and is very happy with this high quality product. He also said it takes very little to cover his face. I think he&#x27;s hooked. Lol</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I will definitely re-order more when I&#x27;m out. It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed after my shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and he absolutely raved about it. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - leave my face smooth...</li>
            <li> Bought this for both my husband and me after hearing about it from a friend.  He wanted a clean shave that left his face soft and I wanted to try it on my legs.  Appreciate that it has natural ingredients and is paraben free. He really likes the close, smooth shave and I like how soft it makes my skin feel.  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  Lasts a long time and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with shave creams usually because my skin is so sensitive. I decided to give this shave cream a shot and was not disappointed! I didn&#x27;t feel the usual harshness or sensitivity after shaving my entire face, but it felt like I had just moisturizer my skin instead of just shaved it! Great product, will definitely keep using this stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband says &amp;#34;Tends to clog my multi blade razor. Also I didn&#x27;t really care for the scent,more musty than sandlewood. Seems to be ok on my skin though.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He is very picky about his shave cream so I was surprised when he told me he loved it and it was comparable to an expensive brand he use to buy.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other shave creams trying to find one he likes that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and I think I found one.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my boyfriend who has VERY thick and rough hair on his face. He loves it and wants me to buy it for him again. He says it has quite a bit of slip to it, which means it allows his razor to slide quite easily over his face, and he got an extremely close shave with this. Yay for successful gifts!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this even i tried  for shaving my legs love love</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream!  My husband loves it, I love it! It&#x27;s smooth and my legs feel silky smooth when I&#x27;m finished shaving.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after shaving either.  My husband has requested more of this and that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
            <li> Old School Sandalwood Shave Cream has a very mild aroma.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming like some shave creams out there.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> the best on the market for smooth moisturizing slick shave. Got it for hubby for birthday with a brush to brush on and he loves shaving and letting me feel after.  Will never want to run out</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new cream, and had high hopes for it. Sadly, I&#x27;ve only used it once and don&#x27;t plan on using it again. The sandalwood smell of this cream smells more like sandalwood mixed with first-aid cream. For those of us who use DE safety razors, a rich lather is very important and this cream just didn&#x27;t lather much at all with my badger hair brush. As for the shave itself, it was ok. There was no irritation after, but my shave was not as close as I can get with my usual creams. My skin felt hydrated and soft after, but the sandalwood-first aid cream smell lingered for half the day after a good rinse. Overall there are better performing creams to be had.</li>
            <li> Certainly the most practical way of using shaving cream. No tubes to squeeze nor buttons to push. You can use all of it very easily. A good quality product. You can also warm it up under hot water very quickly.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me and I used it for the first time this morning. I am a fairly picky person and she knows this. The product itself has a very pleasant aroma and is easy to apply. While shaving I noticed a significant difference from the other shaving cream I normally use, I was able to get a closer shave with less effort and NO skin irritation at all. I would encourage you to try this at least once, you will be pleasantly surprised. Great Product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! It also has an amazing smell! Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells good and gave my husband a close shave. I like that it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients and that its paraben free.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I expected. After shaving my face fees as irritated as when I use any other shaving cream or gel. In addition; the container has a very thick bottom and you only get about half of what it would fit inside a standard container without the false bottom.</li>
            <li> Smells great work like a charm</li>
            <li> This shave cream is nice. It lathers well and made my husband&#x27;s skin really smooth.It is kind of a small container. But otherwise a very nice quality shave cream product. This could easily be used in a gift and it would look really nice. Overall this is great.</li>
            <li> Recommended as it is easy to lather, pleasant scented, and effective. Good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality and will continue to use daily!</li>
            <li> Great shave!  I have sensitive skin and this product works great!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband &amp; the first time he used it, he said he didn&#x27;t care for the oily feel, clogged razors and overpowering scent. The next time he followed instructions of using a very small amount (just a dab instead of the usual amounts with regular shaving cream), &amp; it was a huge difference-- nice smooth skin, no razor issues and a light scent. The scent is quite &#x27;manly&#x27; to me, but I&#x27;ve used it on my legs &amp; a little really does go a long way! I like the results, &amp; my husband has been using it daily. Product provided at a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Wow. One of the worst I&#x27;ve tried. After the shave was itchy. Skin felt dry. Worse than using my shower gel. I don&#x27;t understand these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my moms boyfriend but he loves it!!</li>
            <li> Just recently tried this shaving cream out and love it.  I&#x27;m a regular customer of &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; but I found this shaving cream to give me a much more comfortable shave.  The lather is better than other shaving creams I&#x27;ve used and my skin felt so much better after shaving with Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar&#x27;s Shaving cream.  I am looking forward to trying other products from them.  I highly recommend trying the Shaving Cream, your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> Have been shaving the old fashion way for the past year with double blades.  This is the best cream made in the US that I have used.  As good as any of Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Art of Shave, Body Shop Men&#x27;s Shave Cream, Proraso and now this. This is one of my favorites due to its reasonable price and high quality. Lightly scented and a small amount goes on thick.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. You get a good shave and it last.</li>
            <li> As advertised by the seller, it performs quite well. I sent an Email to the vendor requesting instructions for his product as I had not used a cream before. I received a response explaining  how it is used like any other shaving soap and it&#x27;s easy to apply, gives a great lather, and leaves my face with a very smooth, refreshed feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband but he doesn&#x27;t want to try it. So I am now using it to shave my legs! It has a wonderful scent and also has aloe. Forget my husband, this one is for me.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving cream.  He likes it because it leaves his face smooth and because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (like after shave does).  Some shaving cream leave a very distinctive smell and we do not like that.  I like it because his face is so smooth after he uses it and stays smooth.  He shaves everyday, so it is very useful for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- No alcohol burn&lt;br /&gt;- No smell (light fragrant)&lt;br /&gt;- Not abrasive on skin&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect glide to prevent cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- A little expensive for everyday use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, aside from the price, we love this product and will buy again for twice a week use.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is the soft, warm, woodsy aroma.  My husband used it on his face and it was soft and smelled yummy.  I tried it on my legs and had the quickest shave and didn&#x27;t need to moisturize my legs after.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve been trying different shave creams and Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar is the best by far!  I&#x27;ve gotten the smoothest, cleanest shaves - and all with a minimum of shaving cream: The texture is like whipped cream, and just the slightest dab of the brush tips into it provides constant lather - enough for a relather or two - although I honestly haven&#x27;t had to reshave after the first run. My razor blade just glides over my face; I think I&#x27;m finished hunting for the right shaving cream</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to reorder this product after I bought it for him and he tried it. If you knew my husband you would know what a big deal that is! For him to prefer me to order something rather then buying it at the store it must be really good! He absolutely loves it! He says its s great shave without pumps!</li>
            <li> Big lather from just a little bit of product.  0 irritation and maximum glide.  Have already purchased again.</li>
            <li> Good lather, zero smell, leaves my face feeling.....odd. Will not be reordering. Going back to Taylor of Old Bond Street.  --UPDATE-- I threw this away after trying it 3 times. It smells bad, left my face feeling like rubber, didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> Awesome. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> This shave cream does a great job lubricating the face, and takes very little to do so.  The aroma is mild and pleasant, and does not affect the scent of an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something different as I have never really used a shaving cream I liked, and a friend recommended Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very promptly, and I love the product.  It lathers well and with little effort, smells fantastic, and leaves skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;I will order again, and soon, because my wife stole mine from me.  Apparently she likes it too...</li>
            <li> Great stuff .. lots of lather and nice smell</li>
            <li> This is the first shave cream I have used because I normally shave with an electric razor to save time.  Although the shaving with the razor takes longer, my shave is usually better.  Now with this cream, my skin feels incredibly soft and I didn&#x27;t get the usual irritation that I do on my neck.  The cream has a nice, but subtle smell.  Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> First my husband tried it.  He was okay with it.  Not a rave reviewer to begin with, but he suggested that because of the smell, I would like it a lot.  I did touch his face, and it was super smooth.  He&#x27;s not a big wet shaver, though, so I am not sure how often he&#x27;ll use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my legs.  I did part of my legs with this stuff, and part with soap.  I love the fact that the smell is very mild.  I am highly sensitive to such things, and allergic to colognes and perfumes.  It is not as thick as I&#x27;d like, but maybe I&#x27;m just to used to the kind that squirts out of a can.  The next day (and after my next shower), I did notice that the area I shaved with shave cream was still softer, and the leg area smoother, than the area I used with soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> Love the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This shave cream works pretty well, but takes a while to get a good lather compared to other brands I&#x27;ve used. The smell isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34;, but isn&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li> Closest shave ever with this product.  I use it with a silver tip badger brush to apply which creates a great lather and even with an end of life razor blade the shave is incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> Lather properties first rate. Scent is not overpowering. The perfect shave is within your reach. From comfort, to smell, to ease of washing off quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving cream.  I used it the morning after I received the cream.  Wow!  It left my face smooth, my skin felt good.  Beware though-A little does go a long way.  Nice, light sandlewood scent that the wife liked.  Would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something that was a little different than the usual canned shaving creams or gel. And thank goodness I did. I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. First off it has a wonderful light scent that is not overwhelming. You dont need much to get a great shave. I think what really impressed me was, its been years since ive been able to shave without skin irritation and this one worked great for me. Im able to get that close shave and not worry about regretting it hours later.  Give it a shot and try it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving cream. He says it gives him a smooth shave and prevents nicks and cuts. Very moisturizing and refreshing. He was surprised that a only a small amount is needed to cover his face and neck.</li>
            <li> Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar Sandalwood shave cream is my first ever shave cream that requires a brush. I recently switched to a double edge safety razor from Mach Fusion and decided to try a shave cream before trying a shave soap. I spent several hours over a weekend researching different brands and types of shaving cream and soaps before finally deciding to purchase Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar. I watched YouTube videos to learn how to lather but it still required some practice before I got the technique down good enough to enjoy a nick free shave. Last night and I finally achieved what I consider a perfect lather in my limited experience wet shaving with a DE razor. It turns out I was using too little water for my first 3 shaves, but once I learned of my error I moved onto shave number 4 and experienced a very nice lather. This time when I applied the cream to my face it had a nice shiny white sheen with very minimal air bubbles, and it was slick to the touch which is what I wanted. I was able to make three easy passes without any nicks, cuts, or redness using a Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl with an Astra blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will explain how I achieved a good lather. First I loaded my Perfecto Badger brush in a cup of bowl of very warm water while I took a shower (several minutes). Next, I shook the brush about 3 or 4 times in the sink to get some of the water out. Previously I had been squeezing the hairs to get most of the water out but then I read to shake it instead so that it holds a little more water. I then applied about a large almond size of shave cream to the brush hairs and swirled in circles in the bowl for about 20 to 30 seconds, added several drops of water to the brush and stirred another 20 to 30 seconds, and then added a few more drops of water and continued stirring for about 20 more seconds. My lather was complete. I brushed the cream on my face and swept the brush back and forth across my neck and cheeks until I felt the consistency was right and then began shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I want to provide an update after 4 weeks of shaving with this cream because my initial impression has changed. I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare this to at first because I was new to DE shaving, thus I figured since I was able to get a nice lather and clean shave it must be worthy of 5 stars. That was until I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street (TOBS). The experience between the two is night and day, yet not necessarily in a bad way, or not all bad at least. The TOBS explodes in lather with a little bit of water and a few stirs with the badger hair brush, whereas the Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar really doesn&#x27;t build a plentiful lather at all now that I have something to compare it to. I thought I was achieving a good lather but it just wasn&#x27;t the case at all. Additionally, the TOBS provides better cushion and better glide for the razor. The Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar however does a better job of lubricating I believe, or at least on par, and always leaves my skin feeling nice post-shave. Also, the scent of GH is quite nice, and tends to linger longer than the TOBS, which is a plus for me. Overall though I have to say TOBS is a superior shave cream and will likely aways have a place in my rotation. I recently ordered 9 samples of artisan and other well known brands that I will be trying soon, and who knows, TOBS might just get bumped too. One more thing to mention for the GH cream is that I was getting much better shaves when using Astra and Gillette blades, but when I tried the Feather brand this week I got several small nicks. I used TOBS for my first shave with a Feather and it was a perfect shave and the smoothest to date, thus I know the GH is not providing the protection level that I require now that I am using Feather blades. Unfortunately I lowered my review from 5 stars to 3 stars. I still think this is a decent cream, but for the price and the amount of cream you have to use to build a large enough lather, it doesn&#x27;t deserve any more stars imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful for others.&gt;I hope this review is helpful for others.</li>
            <li> I did not get a special deal to try this shaving cream. If I had I would have bought more than just one that&#x27;s for sure.  I regularly use the art of shaving sandalwood shaving cream and have been very happy with it.  This shaving cream is easily the same if not a lil bit better during the shave.  After you shave this product wins hands down it leaves the skin smooth and soft with none of those annoying bumps on my neck from razor burn plus this is at least 10 dollars cheaper than my next favorite shave cream.  My only wish is that it smelled a little bit more like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I did not like this shave cream. After the shave my face felt oily.</li>
            <li> very smooth no irratations my shave cream  now.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I was amazed at how easy it was to make lather. I have been a user of an expensive mall brand for about a decade and thought it was the best. I now know that price is not everything. I was going to wait until I ran out of the shave soap of my current supply but not anymore. I am using this now. Shaving is so much easier and faster since I do not have to labor over making lather or even the quality of lather. This is my new brand now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m actually a guy with a beard but I use this to keep it defined. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far, 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> My uncle really liked this shaving cream. He is into natural products, it leaves his face smooth and soft. He feels like he is channeling his grandfather like in the old days. All he needs is one of those old shavers and buffer brush.</li>
            <li> I stopped shaving with plastic razors a couple of years ago to help prevent razor burn and ingrown hairs. I bought all of the &#x27;best&#x27; products (Merkur safety razor, Gillette blades, Proraso cream, etc.) and kept trying to refine my technique to completely stop the redness, itchiness, and irritation that would start immediately or the next day. I tried shaving twice a week and eventually just trimmed my beard. That was until I found this cream! I can&#x27;t say that this completely got rid of my redness but I started using this with Lather &amp; Wood Pre-Shave Oil, Baxter of California aftershave, and vitamin E oil. The oil I had around the house but there are several safe oils that would work; simply apply it between shaves, especially when irritation starts. These aren&#x27;t cheap products but if being clean-shaven and comfortable (no redness, itchiness, etc.) is important to you, these products can be lifesaving. Of course, good technique is a must too. I should also mention that the reason I think this combination works for me is that I didn&#x27;t realize I had dry skin on my neck and shaving depletes the moisture. This might not be a complete fix for everyone if your issue is different but I wanted to share in case this helps many of you.</li>
            <li> My husband loved shaving with this!  He had no razor burn.  His skin was nice and soft and he smelled fantastic!  I would highly recommend this.  It would make a great Father&#x27;s Day gift!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided to try this cream instead of my usual bar of soap, I was amazed at how good of a lather you can get with a just a tiny amount of this cream. It also smells great but the smell is not overpowering. I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out (in about a year by the looks of it).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  mix too well and drys out fast once applied</li>
            <li> All around great products. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave cream! Thick and creamy, smells a bit powdery and slightly feminine, but fades quickly and the shave is great. I would recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hemlock and classic Sandalwood shaving creams from GH for a while now, and the Old School Sandalwood delivers just like the rest. Gives a close shave with a lot fewer nicks than canned cream from the store. Keeps the razor burn down a lot, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar Hemlock and recently switched to Sandlewood.  Both are great shaving creams that smell great and leave my face feeling fresh post-shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like grandpa&#x27;s barbershop. Haven&#x27;t had a nick since I&#x27;ve used it. Easy to lather.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for the bf and have snuck so much of it that I have to buy him more. I love the scent and how great it is for my skin&lt;br /&gt; Being a girl, I am particular about the products I put on my skin, and I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I have is it doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood much. It almost seems unscented other than that beautiful lather, nice and thick cream, very buttery, well moisturized with a  close shave well worth the money!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Another great product from Gentleman&amp;#34;s Hangar. This is just as good as the Sandalwood but with a little less fragrance. It&#x27;s an awesome lather and leaves my skin very soft. My wife loves the smell and I like the price. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who shaves with a razor. looking forward to trying their other products. Also great customer service.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave with this product.  I would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Nothing special to talk about here.  I have bought cheaper knockoff brands at Walmart that do a much better job for less than half the money.  Smell is ok though but not great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for shaving! He used to cut his face a few times and now he said it&#x27;s like butter! Highly recommend this for any man :)</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive skin. Comfortable, old school feeling. A little price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> So many shaving creams and gels are laden with chemicals to make your skin tingle, and I think that is designed to make you think more is happening.  Fragrances are usually too strong and can even alter the taste of breakfast before they wear off.  Gentleman&#x27;s Hanger Old School is natural and mild.  I was skeptical of the performance with only natural ingredients.  But it does the one thing I need it to do, and does it well...it makes shaving close painless and easy for a super soft feel.  As a side benefit, I swear my razors last longer, but I have never bothered to test.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this shaving cream to me, and I&#x27;m certainly glad they did!  I love it, I can honestly say I&#x27;m done with foams and gels from the grocery store.  My face is sensitive to the blade, this cream absolutely is perfect for anyone else is looking for a smoother, easier shaving experience.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> This shaving cream smells amazing, and leaves skin ultra smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, but I&#x27;ll admit that I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it to try it out. It&#x27;s very light, but smooth and creamy. Gives a very close shave. Leaves a light, pleasant scent. You dont have to use much, so it should last for quite some time. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Has a great lather, holds to the face well with or without a lot of growth and is decently priced.  My only qualm is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to soften the hair as well as some other soaps.  Using a Gillette Silver Blue (like I have for years) it definitely has a bit of a tug.  I don&#x27;t get any irritation but it is not quite as comfortable of a shave.  Leaves my face incredibly smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Reordered again. This stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular about what I use for shaving cream due to my sensitive skin but this product is AWESOME!  Great fragrance and smooth finish!  I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble findin something that doesn&#x27;t cause them to break out.</li>
            <li> I love natural products, and this one smells and feels just as advertised. Sandal wood gives a natural feel of cooling your skin, and is used in traditional Indian healing methods (ayurveda). I generally do not use after-shave after using this cream, as I feel a natural cooling-effect from the product itself, but this could very from person to person. In any case, I just love the smell and feel of sandalwood!</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product. My skin is doing good with it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that my husband has ever tried this kind of shave cream.  It was different for him in that it doesn&#x27;t lather.  He wasn&#x27;t a big fan out that after being use to shave cream that does lather all his life.  I tried it on my legs and loved it!  The smell is most certainly masculine but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend but used it myself and HOLY CRAP! It is so buttery and feels fantastic! My legs stayed moisturized the rest of the day, which has never happened with any other product I&#x27;ve shaved with. My favorite part is when I use it to shave areas that normally leave little red bumps: NO little red bumps!! My armpits are smooth and clear for the first time in a long time. I literally threw out my Bikini Zone after the first time I used this stuff. No need for it any longer!&lt;br /&gt;You can imagine what this does for a gentleman&#x27;s face. My boyfriend always had red inflamed skin after shaving, no matter what he used (although I never got him to try a straight razor shave at the barber). He tried countless lotions after shaving but they&#x27;d just make him breakout. Now he just shaves with the Hangar and his chin is like a baby&#x27;s bottom. So glad we finally found this product!&lt;br /&gt;This, paired with an old fashioned shaving brush (which makes it go farther), is the PERFECT Valentine&#x27;s gift for the man in your life. But I highly recommend stealing some for yourself!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it first. We absolutely love the smell and the texture is so much more luxurious than other products we have tried. My skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!!</li>
