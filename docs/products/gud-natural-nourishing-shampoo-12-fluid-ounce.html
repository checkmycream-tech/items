            <li>It smells AMAZING and the scent lasts.</li>
            <li>As everyone has said:  This shampoo smells absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product in the bottle did not leave any of that nice fragrance on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo.  </li>

            <li>My son is loving this orange scented shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is now manageable ad clean!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hair product with many organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have health products available at good prices.</li>
            <li>And YES, sulfate-free shampoos CAN foam (I own many others that do).</li>
            <li>I also liked that it&#x27;s thinner in consistency than most shampoos</li>
            <li>It has a nice, easy to handle shape</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I just wish it worked better.</li>
            <li>and I love the tops where you just press on one side and</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad we won&#x27;t be wasting it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this shampoo for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the orange scent and rich lather!</li>
            <li>Good price for a more natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not even the cheap $2 a bottle stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this shampoo smells like a freshly cut into orange.  </li>
            <li>With this shampoo and conditioner i am happy to have my hair back to its fullness.</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel clean at all.  </li>
            <li>dry her hair was shinier and softer then ever before from one use and she smelled great for days!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
            <li>When my daughter uses it to wash her hair, the pleasant scent lasts until the next day.  </li>
            <li>That is about the only thing good I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year now and love it but got a nice surprise the other day when washing the dog.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo...smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My wife says her hair looks \\&quot;calm and pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just the right thickness, not too runny.  </li>
            <li>so was very easy to work through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made by Burts Bees love the shime and softness it gives to my wirey thick hair ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>It left my hair greasy no matter how many times I washed it.</li>
            <li>Clearly, animal testing is not necessary because the company managed to make a lovely product without it!</li>
            <li>We started using this shampoo (and conditioner and body wash) after our pediatrician suggested using more natural products on our daughter to help her sensitive skin from reacting.</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency that&#x27;s easy to work through my hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>However, my husband who has short hair thought it was fine</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to traditional bad shampoo and at a really good price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any stripping, but find my hair to be healthy looking and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes since it smelled so yummy, buy this stuff</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Gud product line.</li>
            <li>There are other sulfate-free, natural, and/or organic shampoos out there that are dramatically better.</li>
            <li>so used this stuff and put the normal amount on and to my surprise it lathered like nothing else on a dog that hadn&#x27;t been washed in over a month.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt; The conditioner on the other hand isn&#x27;t as good- smells a bit too much like alcohol and is hard to spread, I still use it though, haha..... doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the smell of the orange from the shampoo at all.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing about it is the smell.</li>
            <li>but it is still natural..</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and after a couple uses I see a big difference.</li>
            <li>:) Only bad thing is that I have a slightly harder time combing my hair out right after a shower now, but to be able to actually read the label and have some idea of what the ingredients are and the smell make the extra combing worth</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean And fluffy  without the extra weight of residue on the hair</li>
            <li>I was excited about using this product because it was by the maker&#x27;s of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I was more than disappointed.</li>
            <li>Fruity and sweet, but not overpowering or icky.  </li>
            <li>Very nice shampoo, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Fruity and sweet, but not overpowering or icky.  </li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mention this because it&#x27;s been my experience that the water you use can significantly impact how well or poorly hair care products work, especially shampoo and conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took a long time to detangle it all.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area and have somewhat hard well water.</li>
            <li> I was using other products but my hair ended up looking flat.</li>
            <li> However, we purchased ours from our local Kroger for much less than the price listed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this shampoo - especially because I am a fan of many of their other products.</li>
            <li> It was gross, as if I had run my hair under plain water &amp; attempted to pass it off as \\&quot;clean.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause build up like some other products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it didn&#x27;t lather as well initially as other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, like Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> really fell flat for me.  :(</li>
            <li> This is easily the worst shampoo I have ever tried on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sounds stupid, but I actually grin a little when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have crazy hair, curly and sometimes dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such bad luck with a shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> The coordinating conditioner was even worse (I wrote a review on that too).  </li>
            <li> The consistency is very thin, which some may like, but for me I just ended up with some of it dripping out of my hand before I could even get it to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was bad.  </li>
            <li> It does still have a variation of sulfates, supposedly not as bad, but no parabens.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this along with the matching conditioner, and neither worked well on my hair at ALL.  I understand that each person has different hair and what will work well on one person may not work for another.  This is easily the worst shampoo I have ever tried on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am giving it two stars because it smells REALLY amazing.  That is about the only thing good I can say about it.  The consistency is very thin, which some may like, but for me I just ended up with some of it dripping out of my hand before I could even get it to my hair.  The biggest problem is that it felt like it stripped my hair.  It was bad.  When I rinsed my hair out it felt like straw.  Even the matching conditioner couldn&#x27;t help it.  I&#x27;ve never had such bad luck with a shampoo before.  Not even the cheap $2 a bottle stuff.  I had high hopes since it smelled so yummy, buy this stuff really fell flat for me.  :(</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  I love the fact that this shampoo smells like a freshly cut into orange.  I wish I could eat it for a dessert!</li>
            <li> discovered this shampoo when it was on clearance- Made by Burts Bees love the shime and softness it gives to my wirey thick hair ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this shampoo - especially because I am a fan of many of their other products. The description says the product is \\&quot;foamy,\\&quot; but I experienced no foam, even washing my hair twice.  And YES, sulfate-free shampoos CAN foam (I own many others that do). My hair did not feel clean at all.  It was gross, as if I had run my hair under plain water &amp; attempted to pass it off as \\&quot;clean.\\&quot; Also, the product in the bottle did not leave any of that nice fragrance on my hair.  The coordinating conditioner was even worse (I wrote a review on that too).  There are other sulfate-free, natural, and/or organic shampoos out there that are dramatically better.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo it take a while for your hair to get used to it, but it smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Great, delicious smell!  Fruity and sweet, but not overpowering or icky.  Just the right thickness, not too runny.  Very nice shampoo, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> not the simplest ingredients but it is still natural..good price compared to the store,the scent is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see the pear scent as low in price as this one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair product with many organic ingredients. Hair feels clean And fluffy  without the extra weight of residue on the hair</li>
            <li> We started using this shampoo (and conditioner and body wash) after our pediatrician suggested using more natural products on our daughter to help her sensitive skin from reacting. It smells AMAZING and the scent lasts. The shampoo does a great job cleaning her hair and I&#x27;ve even started using it myself. It doesn&#x27;t cause build up like some other products. I highly recommend the Gud product line.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo...smells good and a little goes a long way. We purchased it especially because no animals are tested in producing their products! Clearly, animal testing is not necessary because the company managed to make a lovely product without it! I would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Way to go Amazon! Its nice to have health products available at good prices. This is a great alternative to traditional bad shampoo and at a really good price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and after a couple uses I see a big difference. My hair is now manageable ad clean!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I was using other products but my hair ended up looking flat. With this shampoo and conditioner i am happy to have my hair back to its fullness. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year now and love it but got a nice surprise the other day when washing the dog. I didn&#x27;t have any dog shampoo nearby so used this stuff and put the normal amount on and to my surprise it lathered like nothing else on a dog that hadn&#x27;t been washed in over a month.&lt;br /&gt;When dry her hair was shinier and softer then ever before from one use and she smelled great for days!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> wonderful aroma, good for your hair</li>
            <li> I love gud products and bertsbees, smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo.  It has a clean fresh fragrance. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because it didn&#x27;t lather as well initially as other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, like Neutrogena.</li>

            <li> This stuff smells so good! This sounds stupid, but I actually grin a little when I use it. It has a good consistency that&#x27;s easy to work through my hair and a little goes a long way. I let it sit in my hair for a minute before rinsing and I think it helps, my hair seems to be shinier and softer- plus people comment on how nice it smells.  :) Only bad thing is that I have a slightly harder time combing my hair out right after a shower now, but to be able to actually read the label and have some idea of what the ingredients are and the smell make the extra combing worth it.&lt;br /&gt; The conditioner on the other hand isn&#x27;t as good- smells a bit too much like alcohol and is hard to spread, I still use it though, haha..... doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the smell of the orange from the shampoo at all.</li>

Very refreshing without being cloying. I also liked that it&#x27;s thinner in consistency than most shampoos so was very easy to work through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about this shampoo is the bottle. It has a nice, easy to handle shape and I love the tops where you just press on one side and the opposite side tilts up to let you dispense the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that it stripped my hair. Maybe part of the fault was my water but after using it I had to apply copious amounts of detangler in order to brush my hair out and it took a long time to detangle it all. For that reason, I won&#x27;t be using this shampoo again. However, my husband who has short hair thought it was fine so I&#x27;m glad we won&#x27;t be wasting it.</li>
            <li> I love the orange scent and rich lather! Would definitely recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> My son is loving this orange scented shampoo. It&#x27;s his favorite!</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for about a year and love it.  It does still have a variation of sulfates, supposedly not as bad, but no parabens.  Good price for a more natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> As everyone has said:  This shampoo smells absolutely amazing.  When my daughter uses it to wash her hair, the pleasant scent lasts until the next day.  When used with the conditioner, her hair does not seem stripped at all.  In fact, her frizzy hair ends up being tamed.  My wife says her hair looks \\&quot;calm and pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shampoo and conditioner myself, and I find that after using it my hair also smells wonderful.  I have not experienced any stripping, but find my hair to be healthy looking and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.  However, we purchased ours from our local Kroger for much less than the price listed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for you morning shower people it will wake you up and leave you smiling. I sometimes use it as shower gel I love the smell so much.</li>
