            <li>I know a lot of people who would fall in love with the fragrance</li>
            <li>Like I said, some love this, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li>I have received many complements about this perfume.</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li>i bought so many of them.</li>
            <li>Okay for lyke a sleepover party or hanging out with my girlfriends</li>
            <li>I WEAR ALL THE TIME.FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this perfume</li>
            <li>I may just purchase a couple more of those.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a strong woodsy thicker smell.</li>
            <li>I would like to add that I do not dislike it because it&#x27;s a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It has a spicy, oriental scent that is strong.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT THE SAMPLER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPECIAL.</li>
            <li>Perfume sample came quickly and safely wrapped.</li>
            <li>It just smells like cheap perfume after a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a beautiful floral fragrance that is concentrated and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a high end fragrance with a nice price tag.</li>
            <li>Thumbs up to the seller for great packaging and quick shipment though and extra sample too!</li>
            <li>but it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered the samples first.</li>
            <li>used to love Liz Claiborne years ago, and when I was a kid Love&#x27;s Baby Soft</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for a hot summer night :)</li>
            <li>but it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I am baffled by those that liked similar perfumes that I like that recommended this.</li>
            <li>would not order from this company again if they dont make this right.</li>
            <li>SHE LIKES IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>have been hearing and hearing about this fragrance for years, but since it&#x27;s pretty pricey, I did not even bother to smell it.</li>
            <li>I could find many fragrances that have the same type of smell.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better in a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>The title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>so I definitely like the clean and fresh fragrances, not the headache inducing</li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S VERY FEMININE, IT&#x27;S LIKE</li>
            <li>Well, flowerbomb isn&#x27;t very floral.</li>
            <li>you pretty much get a full bottle for a third of the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE FRAGRANCE WAS VERY GOOD.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dissappointed that I didn&#x27;t like this as much as I hoped..</li>
            <li>it was better than the outlining description and the personal touches were unexpected.</li>
            <li>I got the most compliments on this perfume than any other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing a full size bottle very soon</li>
            <li>Kind of an old lady smell not fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try a sample to see if I wanted to spend the money on the full size bottle.</li>
            <li>The vial shipped promptly but arrived only a quarter full.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this perfume and I got a decent deal on it</li>
            <li>I use to wear Channel #5 but the scent changed on me as I got older.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying the sample before making</li>
            <li>but i paid 5 dollars for a sample that most companies give away for free and the bottle was half empty!</li>
            <li>My boss mentioned this was her new fav perfume</li>
            <li>This is going to be my new fragrance to wear whenever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a perfume wearer</li>
            <li>As far as the perfume itself, It was okay but not worth the price for me personally.  </li>
            <li>i love how it last all day and youonly have to wear a little.</li>
            <li>mostly faded away after a little while, and what was left was what I would describe as a mix of flowers and baby powder.  </li>
            <li>It is sweet like I like it buy not sickly sweet.  </li>
            <li>I like JLo glow, Victoria Secret&#x27;s Love Rocks,</li>

            <li> There was nothing unique about this frangrance that would make it so expensive.</li>
            <li> It smells floral initially and then dries down to a muskier</li>

            <li> Some other gals could prolly pull it off.</li>
            <li> This was recommended in reviews of other perfumes I was recommended.</li>
            <li> i read the other reviews and thought i would get less</li>

            <li> I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE SAMPLE WAS ONE I COULD HAVE PICKED UP FOR FREE.</li>
            <li> Im going to buy a billion little samples for the rest of forever.</li>
            <li> I purchased a little flowerbomb sample just like this one from ebay...  </li>
            <li> Perfumes that are my faves are Michael Kors, Chance, Beyond Paradise, Jadore and Glow just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> scent- but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Sample arrived without a cover and almost half of the sample was gone!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> If you like a scent that will wilt a flower this is the fragrance for you otherwise don&#x27;t waste your time and money as it can not be returned!</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m seriously considering getting a bottle.</li>
            <li> JUST DATED MYSELF),  VERY DELICATE, TRY IT</li>
            <li> but sadly it will not be in my rotation...a little too expensive for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a little tired of it because she wears it ALL THE TIME!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is expensive know matter where you go to get it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it before spending a fortune (its expensive) and it not working with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scent was.. bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this one.</li>

            <li> Perfume sample came quickly and safely wrapped. Smelled this scent on a friend and loved it! Was leary about purchasing a bottle without knowing how it would smell on me since the bottles were prettry pricey. So this sample was just what i needed.  there was enough in the vile to test it out for a few days and once gone i knew i would be buying a bottle. Granted i bought the smallest- .24 oz but it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and I got a decent deal on it this stuff is expensive know matter where you go to get it.</li>
            <li> i wanted to sample this before I purchased. I like the smell and will buy a bigger bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I got the most compliments on this perfume than any other. I did not think it smelled good until I had sprayed 3 squirts-unfortunately this is a 6 squirt bottle. This is a great size to just try out 2013&#x27;s best fragrance of the year!</li>
            <li> tHIS FRAGRANCE IS SO MAGNIFICENT, IT&#x27;S VERY FEMININE, IT&#x27;S LIKE A BREEZE, IT DOES SMELL LIKE FLOWERS, BUT A HINT Of THEM, NOT A WOOD SMELL, A SUMMERY FLORAL BREEZE, I THINK IT&#x27;S GREAT, IF U LIKE TRESOR LOVE&#x27;S BABY SOFT,(I JUST DATED MYSELF),  VERY DELICATE, TRY IT</li>
            <li> The service was great, thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;I have been hearing and hearing about this fragrance for years, but since it&#x27;s pretty pricey, I did not even bother to smell it. I finally decided to try a sample to see if I wanted to spend the money on the full size bottle. Well, flowerbomb isn&#x27;t very floral. It&#x27;s more of a strong woodsy thicker smell. I know a lot of people who would fall in love with the fragrance but it just did not do anything for me. There was nothing unique about this frangrance that would make it so expensive. I could find many fragrances that have the same type of smell. Like I said, some love this, but it was not for me. I would like to add that I do not dislike it because it&#x27;s a strong smell. I like a variety of different fragrances. From Be Delicious to Lolita lempicka to Chanel Chance.. all which I have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer and my son purchased this fragrance for me while working in Italy. I have received many complements about this perfume.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was expecting.  Kind of an old lady smell not fresh and flowery. Too powdery for me.</li>
            <li> It just smells like cheap perfume after a while. Maybe it&#x27;s better in a bigger bottle I&#x27;m not sure. Not fond of this anymore.</li>
            <li> Amazing. One of my all time favorite scents. Im going to buy a billion little samples for the rest of forever. This scent is so addictive. I cant get enough</li>
            <li> Sample arrived without a cover and almost half of the sample was gone!  Not flowery at all!! very STRONG overpowering smell! If you like a scent that will wilt a flower this is the fragrance for you otherwise don&#x27;t waste your time and money as it can not be returned!</li>
            <li> you get .05 oz no matter how big the bottle is. i read the other reviews and thought i would get less then i paid for. not true. you are buying a sample and its a good deal. i bought so many of them. you pretty much get a full bottle for a third of the price. i love how it last all day and youonly have to wear a little. i love smelling like a sexy flower!!!! love this!</li>
            <li> I purchased a little flowerbomb sample just like this one from ebay...  Unfortunately the scent was.. bad.  I am no \\&quot;nose\\&quot; but what I got from this perfume was an initial chemical smell...  that..  mostly faded away after a little while, and what was left was what I would describe as a mix of flowers and baby powder.  Okay for lyke a sleepover party or hanging out with my girlfriends.. but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to work.. Some other gals could prolly pull it off.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;THE FRAGRANCE WAS VERY GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE, AND SHE LIKES IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> the flower bomb perfume its self is amazing. but i paid 5 dollars for a sample that most companies give away for free and the bottle was half empty! i took pics to prove it. would not order from this company again if they dont make this right.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I would purchase it over and over again! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing a full size bottle very soon</li>
            <li> I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE SAMPLE WAS ONE I COULD HAVE PICKED UP FOR FREE. I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHERE MY HEAD WAS. I THOUGHT THE SAMPLER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPECIAL. IT WOULD BE PERFECT TO BE ABLE TO WEAR FOR MANY TIMES AND MAKE SURE IT IS FOR YOU FOR YOU. FIREBOMB IS PERFUME I WEAR ALL THE TIME.FOR MANY YEARS AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail it was well packaged and the sample itself was perfect.  As far as the perfume itself, It was okay but not worth the price for me personally.  Perfumes that are my faves are Michael Kors, Chance, Beyond Paradise, Jadore and Glow just to name a few.  I&#x27;m dissappointed that I didn&#x27;t like this as much as I hoped..but it was worth a shot. Happy for others that enjoy but not for me.

            <li> The vial shipped promptly but arrived only a quarter full. What was in there smelled great but it didn&#x27;t last all that long!</li>
            <li> I got this for a granddaughter and she loves it. I&#x27;m getting a little tired of it because she wears it ALL THE TIME!!! It should run out soon, tho&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it was better than the outlining description and the personal touches were unexpected. I would buy further items in the future.</li>
            <li> My boss mentioned this was her new fav perfume so wantedto give it a try.  Absolutely love this perfume but sadly it will not be in my rotation...a little too expensive for me</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all. I use to wear Channel #5 but the scent changed on me as I got older. This Flowerbomb is the bomb. It is sweet like I like it buy not sickly sweet.  I wanted to try it before spending a fortune (its expensive) and it not working with my chemistry. Glad I ordered the samples first. I may just purchase a couple more of those.</li>
            <li> This was recommended in reviews of other perfumes I was recommended. The name is not fitting. To me it does not smell like flowers at all. It has a spicy, oriental scent that is strong. I think it is a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; fragrance. I can&#x27;t see anyone below the age of 60 wearing it! I am baffled by those that liked similar perfumes that I like that recommended this. I like JLo glow, Victoria Secret&#x27;s Love Rocks, used to love Liz Claiborne years ago, and when I was a kid Love&#x27;s Baby Soft so I definitely like the clean and fresh fragrances, not the headache inducing, everyone knows you&#x27;re there before you&#x27;re even close fragrances. I&#x27;m disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Smells great I would definatly purchase this in a bigger bottle. This is going to be my new fragrance to wear whenever.</li>
            <li> This is a high end fragrance with a nice price tag. I highly recommend trying the sample before making&lt;br /&gt;the big purchase. It&#x27;s is a beautiful floral fragrance that is concentrated and lasts for a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> I loved how this smelled on my friend so I ordered a sample just to try for a week. I love it so much. It smells floral initially and then dries down to a muskier scent- but not too heavy.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for a hot summer night :) I&#x27;m not usually a perfume wearer but I&#x27;m seriously considering getting a bottle.</li>
