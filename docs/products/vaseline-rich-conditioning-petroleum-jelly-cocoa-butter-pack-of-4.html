            <li>it feels great on the skin and is not heavy....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so greasy everything would slip out of your hand or wear off easily</li>
            <li>Now that I know it&#x27;s available thru Amazon will buy in bulk for the rest of me.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get enough of it lol</li>
            <li>I have never used this product with cocoa butter is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as greasy as the original Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Its great for moisturizing dry skin</li>
            <li>Great combination works well for dry skin</li>
            <li>It soaks into skin quickly, so I use it on my hands and cuticles in the wintertime.</li>
            <li>Next mornign, you get nice smooth skin without the grease.  </li>
            <li>Got my order quick.</li>
            <li>i use this for many different places , for dry skin , it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>It is light, yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I recommend the product, especially if it is part  of a free shipping package, better deal than stores.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fact that it moisturizes my lips better than any of the other lip treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I originally got it to soften my feet, but find that it works very well as a hand lotion, too.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used every single kind of &amp;#34;extra dry&amp;#34; skin lotion and nothing works like this.</li>
            <li>Another good product when I need something a little heavier than the vaseline oil gel</li>
            <li>Can not find this product in the local stores in my area and will buy more whenever I run out .</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like hot chocolate.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase the tiny purse size ....</li>
            <li>Thanks and may GOD bless you!</li>
            <li>I will buy more and the price makes it a double pleasure.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you need to use vaseline at least it smells nice!</li>
            <li>After just a couple uses, it has drastically healed a patch of skin that was so dry it had split many times.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use natural oils like almond and castor and jojoba on my skin, because these are excellent anti-agers and they prevent a lot of breakouts, but they weren&#x27;t helping this stubborn section of skin that was so raw and dry.</li>
            <li>Plus the whole family can use it after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li>When I found this available in bulk at the low price it was being sold for, I immediately jump on it..</li>
            <li>I really like it for items which need a coating of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and it works better than any other skin moisturizer I have tried(I am 69).</li>
            <li>Long lasting, fast results and through results, incredibly inexpensive compared to all the other products on the market; it works and works on everything.  </li>
            <li>It was as expected and arrived on time, smells just like co co butter and is smooth.</li>
            <li>the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this vaseline to anyone wanting something better than the plain vaseline.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in northern ohio</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of other lip balms and sticks and none have worked at all compared to Vaseline Cocoa Butter Petroleum Jelly.</li>
            <li>so this is a great product to use during  the cold winter months.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive to that.</li>
            <li>This Vaseline has a petroleum smell to it, but keep feet soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It has a soft cocoa butter scent nothing overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just know that the tub is quite large and will last a long time!</li>
            <li>excellant product, use it on my feet daily, and have soft feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use my other oils, but for the places on my body that get super dry and split--I&#x27;m using this.</li>
            <li>I have such dry skin and this works very well.</li>
            <li>Love that the cover is connected, no more missing covers.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>

            <li> I have such dry skin and this works very well.</li>
            <li> Love that the cover is connected, no more missing covers.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I normally apply a dab on my hands and feet (have dried feet and heels) and it really does help, and at a fraction of the price of other dedicated products for dry feet!  </li>
            <li> In the short time I used it eased my rough patches, relieved the itching</li>
            <li> Been using this Vaseline for a long time now.</li>
            <li> This is a mandatory item for my legs and feet during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> If you get a single or a pack of 4</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on different product for dry, cracked skin on hands and elbows; thick cracked callouses on my feet; and then I went back to the product my Mother used all her life and as usual: Mom was right.  </li>
            <li> I eat a very healthy diet, get lots of exercise and drink plenty of water, but still I fight this terrible recurrent dry skin and only at specific places on my body like on my hip bone where it protrudes out and gets rubbed by jeans and underwear etc.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyelids and the product has eliminated that, the scaling, and itchiness.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of vaseline for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune condition which leaves my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> It appears that it has been replaced with the original Vaseline... which is a disappointment to me now that I&#x27;ve found the coco butter product.</li>
            <li> Not as greasy as other Vaselines.</li>
            <li> and it fades away dark spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the cure</li>
            <li> and I typically (or used to anyway) avoid those.</li>
            <li> I put little dabs on both palms, massaged in and what a surprize it worked.  </li>
            <li> No more itchy dry skin, no more rashes.</li>

            <li> This is a mandatory item for my legs and feet during the dry winter months. I buy in bulk to save money. The cocoa butter also helps diminish scars. Unbeatable combo for skin health for me!</li>
            <li> Vaseline has outdone itself this time.....it feels great on the skin and is not heavy....Its great for moisturizing dry skin and it fades away dark spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> We needed something to keep my kids from getting diaper rash but I hate the smell of the usual diaper rash creams. This vaseline is perfect, as the cocoa butter scent smells great and is a much better value than the others. Plus the whole family can use it after a shower or bath. Four jars to a case and they&#x27;ll last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> Can not find this product in the local stores in my area and will buy more whenever I run out .</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> This product is a bit too aromatic for my taste. There is cocoa butter in there; I don&#x27;t understand why they needed to add the artificial flavour - I would have preferred the subtle natural scent. Also, the vaseline seems a bit less greasy than plain vaseline, which is a shortcoming in my view.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on different product for dry, cracked skin on hands and elbows; thick cracked callouses on my feet; and then I went back to the product my Mother used all her life and as usual: Mom was right.  Long lasting, fast results and through results, incredibly inexpensive compared to all the other products on the market; it works and works on everything.  Great product at a great price. I&#x27;ll stick with Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Great combination works well for dry skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this from another store this past weekend. Didn&#x27;t know it existed until I saw in store.  I&#x27;ve tried everything else to soothe my red cracked hands (from allergic reactions).  I put little dabs on both palms, massaged in and what a surprize it worked.  In the short time I used it eased my rough patches, relieved the itching and I swear help in the healing (used overnite.  It&#x27;s not so greasy everything would slip out of your hand or wear off easily and that&#x27;s what I like. What I want is a smaller package so I can put in purse.  Totally worth the money. Now that I know it&#x27;s available thru Amazon will buy in bulk for the rest of me.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and works great for anything from dry feet and heels to sore noses. Love the cocoa smell. Waaaaay better than store brands and Dollar store formulations.Have to buy alot, but it is good to have on hand regardless. It&#x27;ll get used!</li>
            <li> everything is good i gave a  three</li>
            <li> I love the vaseline with cocoa butter product. It is very soothing and absorbs quickly. It is light, yet very moisturizing. I have very dry eyelids and the product has eliminated that, the scaling, and itchiness.</li>
            <li> For babies, toddlers and adults. Love this stuff and can never run out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this vaseline! I originally got it to soften my feet, but find that it works very well as a hand lotion, too. Almost every winter I have trouble with the tips of my fingers cracking from dryness and cold -- a very painful condition -- but the regular use of this cocoa butter conditioning petroleum jelly prevents it.</li>
            <li> I use this for two conditions. A G-Tube site and a Tracheotomy site. It cuts done on the skin irritation at both sites.</li>
            <li> Grew up using the regular version on my skin and in my hair. Now I use on my kids. Pleasant fresh scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of other lip balms and sticks and none have worked at all compared to Vaseline Cocoa Butter Petroleum Jelly.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff...its not too greasy and it smells devine...I used it all over the body...I just can&#x27;t get enough of it lol</li>
            <li> The best price and feels great on skin. Will continue buy from them. Always!</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday from a store. After just a couple uses, it has drastically healed a patch of skin that was so dry it had split many times. It was almost like getting paper cut repeatedly. I eat a very healthy diet, get lots of exercise and drink plenty of water, but still I fight this terrible recurrent dry skin and only at specific places on my body like on my hip bone where it protrudes out and gets rubbed by jeans and underwear etc. I prefer to use natural oils like almond and castor and jojoba on my skin, because these are excellent anti-agers and they prevent a lot of breakouts, but they weren&#x27;t helping this stubborn section of skin that was so raw and dry. My skin had bled through my clothes enough that I bought this even though it&#x27;s a petroleum product and I typically (or used to anyway) avoid those. This is day two of using it, and I&#x27;m not going to stop because it is working. I&#x27;ll still use my other oils, but for the places on my body that get super dry and split--I&#x27;m using this. Hands down this is the cure and I like the scent. It smells a bit like hot chocolate.</li>
            <li> excellant product, use it on my feet daily, and have soft feet.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of vaseline for my very dry skin.  I love the smell of this cocoa butter vaseline.  If you need to use vaseline at least it smells nice!</li>
            <li> I Love this vaseline with coco butter. Very good product and keeps the skin sooo soft and moisturized. Will definitely by again!!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this is all I use on my skin.  I just wished I could find a bigger size 13 oz+</li>
            <li> this s*** is awesome to jack off with, great for intercourse also. Havent had a chance to use for anal sex but no doubt it will be outstanding .</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but my skin is sensitive to that.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells good</li>
            <li> we have a baby, and there&#x27;s plenty of uses for this product. I recommend the product, especially if it is part  of a free shipping package, better deal than stores.</li>
            <li> Excelent product  for skin !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a very tiny container in the lip balm department of a local store.  I love the smell and the fact that it moisturizes my lips better than any of the other lip treatments I&#x27;ve tried. I can no longer find the small lip balm size ....It appears that it has been replaced with the original Vaseline... which is a disappointment to me now that I&#x27;ve found the coco butter product. When I cannot find something in our local stores, I am often rewarded with a search on Amazon.  I wasn&#x27;t able to purchase the tiny purse size .... but I did find the larger jars.  I&#x27;ve since discovered that the Cocoa Butter Vaseline is every bit as wonderful in relieving my itchy legs. I always like to share my joy over a great product....and this is a great product. I hope my review encourages you to give it a try and that you are as happy with Cocoa Butter Vaseline as I am!!</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune condition which leaves my skin very dry. I have to moisturize every day after my shower. This stuff does the trick. No more itchy dry skin, no more rashes. I use this head to toe after every shower (within 3 minutes for best results) and my skin is the best it has ever been. Works better than any lotion or cream I have used.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product with cocoa butter is fantastic. I use it for lip gloss body moisturizer moisturize my eyelashes at night. Its great for my hands</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping your feet healthy during &amp;#34;open toe&amp;#34; season.  Apply to feet after shower and put on cotton socks for an hour or so.  Keeps feet beautiful.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED A CASE AND THEY SHORTEN THE ORDER BUT OVER ALL I LOVE THE COCOA BUTTER AND THE SOFTNESS AND I CALL THEM AND THEY DID REFUND MY MONEY BACK SO THAT WAS GREAT BUT THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;GREAT!!!!1</li>
            <li> Great for feet and elbows</li>
            <li> Good value! I use this product daily... When I found this available in bulk at the low price it was being sold for, I immediately jump on it.. Thanks and may GOD bless you!</li>
            <li> use this all the time for everything</li>
            <li> The perfect product I used to use coco butter and Vaseline separately.  Now they have them together what. a wonderful ideal. Not heavy smooth on the skin very excellent product. I will buy more and the price makes it a double pleasure. Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and wonderful seller</li>
            <li> The Vaseline with Cocoa Butter was sold in my local market. I bought one. I really like it for items which need a coating of petroleum jelly. The scent and flavor are very nice. I have used this on my lips with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this item is it was so good my college student took it to college with her! ARGH! Then my local store didn&#x27;t have any. I finally decided to check Amazon. If you get a single or a pack of 4 it is worthwhile to use. If you have college students, just get the pack of 4. It will save you the hassle of looking for your jar.</li>
            <li> i use this for many different places , for dry skin , it&#x27;s great.  also for eyebrows . lips. elbows, heels.</li>
            <li> Item arrived 2 days ahead of schedule. This was a purchase made for a very good friend of mines. She was is very pleased with product so nfar.</li>
            <li> I use this now on an elderly patient who&#x27;s bedridden when I change diapers and even she has commented on how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Also you save more when purchased through the \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; option at Amazon. They send 4 each time depending on how often you need them. I also subscribe to the regular Vaseline and so sometimes the deliveries overlap but I don&#x27;t mind. I like choices.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality here.  I think the presence of Cocoa Butter makes a big difference.  It smells good and the multi-pack is a great value.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline has a petroleum smell to it, but keep feet soft and moisturized. Not as greasy as other Vaselines.</li>
            <li> Love love love it... the only thing that helps my skin. I have such dry skin and this works very well. I have used every single kind of &amp;#34;extra dry&amp;#34; skin lotion and nothing works like this. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Been using this Vaseline for a long time now. Found this big a-- size on Amazon and it&#x27;was a no-brainer. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it works better than any other skin moisturizer I have tried(I am 69). The only difficulty is finding Vaseline brand in a store.</li>
            <li> Good product...just wasn&#x27;t packaged right....melted through everything in the box, including the box.</li>
            <li> Usually, I hate the greasiness of Vaseline but, I love the way it moisturizes and protects skin. I picked this up on a whim and I love it. It&#x27;s not as greasy as the original Vaseline. It works great on cracked heels. It soaks into skin quickly, so I use it on my hands and cuticles in the wintertime. It has a soft cocoa butter scent nothing overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this especially if you like Vaseline but, you hate the greasiness of it. Also, I love the flip-top cap, which is handy.</li>
            <li> I love the countainer!! Love that the cover is connected, no more missing covers.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this vaseline to anyone wanting something better than the plain vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;Finally my kis approved!! I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Always a big fan of Vaseline, and I decided to try the one with the cocoa butter scent: not over powering at all nd stil lithe solid product.  I normally apply a dab on my hands and feet (have dried feet and heels) and it really does help, and at a fraction of the price of other dedicated products for dry feet!  Next mornign, you get nice smooth skin without the grease.  Just know that the tub is quite large and will last a long time! Great value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal. Feels nice and smells great. I would recommend it to everyone. Thank you Vaseline for this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells awesome and not overly greasy.I use this for myself as well as on my toddler and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> great product, great seller!</li>
            <li> Got my order quick. Love it.</li>
            <li> Another good product when I need something a little heavier than the vaseline oil gel this product is great.  I live in northern ohio so this is a great product to use during  the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> It was as expected and arrived on time, smells just like co co butter and is smooth.</li>
