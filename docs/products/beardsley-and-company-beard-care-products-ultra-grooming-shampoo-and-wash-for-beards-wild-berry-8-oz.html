            <li>It has a very nice smell, but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, great smell and better results.</li>
            <li>After using off and on for a couple weeks I have come to the conclusion that a good hair shampoo and conditioner are all you need.</li>
            <li>Smells and tastes good, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my beard texture.</li>
            <li>Smells good and is not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li>Smells good, lathers up well.</li>
            <li>I would always recommend a conditioner for the beard as well, though I prefer leave-in conditioners and have not experience good results with Beardsley&#x27;s conditioner that is to go with this</li>
            <li>Good price for the amount on a targeted product</li>
            <li>They both love it!</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the smell of it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>

            <li>Nice smelling and seemingly gentile shampoo.</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency of the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>nice fragrance --works</li>
            <li>The scent, while good, is strong</li>
            <li>Either way, my face smells nice and feels clean after using this, so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>I knew it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to also use some beard balm...</li>
            <li>washes ok.</li>
            <li>Not enough words to describe how awesome a product this is</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>Keeps my man mane healthy and sexy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Yes, magical.</li>
            <li>Love the beard shampoo.</li>
            <li>I dont know how to describe just better.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because Im getting more beard dander.</li>
            <li>I also have started to use Head &amp; Shoulders, which I have found to function better and is quite a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>for the scent, I do not see what the problem is for most people.</li>
            <li>Light, moisturizes the skin effectively</li>
            <li>The lady do love it</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying more products by them.</li>
            <li>Many of the beard shampoos are great for tangles and scraggly beards, and many are on the lighter side, and are not harsh to the face</li>
            <li>its a pretty good shampoo and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot</li>
            <li>I went from having a beautifully sculpted and soft beard to looking like a mountain man who just returned from a voyage into the windiest part of hell.</li>
            <li>I quite like the scent, but it is strong and it does stick with you for most of the day if you shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps your beard soft for the day but makes it smell Great.  </li>
            <li>If anything, my beard oil easily covers up the scent of the wash, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through after using.</li>
            <li>the smell is not too strong and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>Its fine.</li>
            <li>Great smelling shampoo for all styles and lengths of facial hair.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, even tastes like blueberry if/when you get some in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up well and leaves my beard and mustache feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Great beard shampoo, although I received this as a single piece</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light shampoo that lathers very well in the beard.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product, made bear so soft and it makes you keep and carry  the fruit smell all day long.</li>
            <li>how much softer and more manageable it has made my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a full beard that hangs about one inch off of my face.</li>
            <li>It was like touching a feathery pillow on my face, and my beard was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>Seems fairly mild, nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li>The wash leaves your beard feeling soft and magical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the oils in the shampoo stayed in the beard nicely, and when I brushed deep, I did feel like they were being pulled through my beard effectively.</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;re approved for use, there&#x27;s mounting evidence that these ingredients are toxic and absorbed into the body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used normal shampoos, and have found that the former is better in most cases.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleared that right up.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard clean, much to my wife&#x27;s approval.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard really soft and easy to comb as well as clears up the dandruff.</li>
            <li>Super gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>and you could very much tell.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard soft and smooth like it should feel on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first actual beard shampoo and conditioner that I have bought and after a couple of uses I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell (Wild Berry) and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a shampoo made specifically for beards.  </li>
            <li>Ive found that I get better results from shampoos specifically designed for beards, and bave decided to try different brands and see which I prefer.</li>
            <li>farmers\\&quot; would be interested in at all.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for a couple years now, and I&#x27;ve tried many different beard shampoos.</li>
            <li>It smells more like a berry bush than the actual berry.</li>
            <li>Without thinking to check the ingredients first, I ordered this shampoo and started using it.  </li>
            <li>My beard feels much softer and smoother to touch and the Wild Berry smell is very mild</li>
            <li>Its a thick shampoo that I don&#x27;t have to use very much of to get a good lather and wash out of it, which is a huge plus, as with most items that are considered &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; items, it&#x27;s not exactly cheap, so</li>
            <li>Says it makes him feel fresh and clean and is a must have for any man that has grown out his facial hair.</li>
            <li>If you combine it with the conditioner it gets super soft.</li>
            <li>Ignore the comments about the strong berry scent, such a lie.</li>
            <li>Make so much of a differance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild shampoo that definitely helps keep the skin underneath your facial hair from drying out and becoming itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No one likes the taste of soap, and as a shampoo product that is specifically designed to be used around your mouth, Beardsley apparently figured, why not make it taste better for that inevitable moment that soap meets tongue?  </li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying some more when my next bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Used to use normal shampoo on the mess that is my beard thinking hair is hair, but this stuff leaves my beard feeling so much better than normal stuff you use on the head.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, faint berry smell.</li>
            <li>guess that many people who have a problem with the scent like to feel &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; and would consider this scent to not fit that criteria.</li>
            <li>And the smell is alright, not huge fan of its smell, buts its OK</li>
            <li>I personally found that I wasn&#x27;t really able to smell it after rinsing it out of my beard anyway, which seems to be a running theme I&#x27;ve found with beard shampoos, where the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Softens and straightens coarse beard hairs</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a live and learn purchase for me.</li>
            <li>a user of scented beard oil, my main concern purchasing this product was the strength of the scent after reading some of the reviews stating that it leaves your beard smelling like wild berry after you wash up.</li>
            <li>The packaging was cheaply printed on generic white bottles.</li>
            <li>Personally, I haven&#x27;t gotten into a situation where any has gotten into my mouth, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it tastes, but it is an interesting twist on the product that I haven&#x27;t seen in other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plainly stated right here that it is &amp;#34;wild berry.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not very citrus-esque, more of an understated berry scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread throughout, and after using it for a few days, my beard was softer and it was easier to pull my boar bristle brush through</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely with only using a small amount.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not smell manly, it doesn&#x27;t really smell very adult either.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not smell manly, it doesn&#x27;t really smell very adult either.</li>
            <li>It keeps the beard in check while keeping it soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing it out since early November 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted the soft beard, but not a scent that would overpower my beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t completely fix my dandruff but helped a lot</li>
            <li>Leaves beard soft and untangled</li>
            <li>The other brand of shampoo I tried was Bluebeards Original, which I found to be thin and watery and tough to get a good lather out of, especially if you have a beard with more than an inch of growth.</li>
            <li>consistency, making it easy to lather and making it possible to use less product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>consistency, making it easy to lather and making it possible to use less product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually making my beard any softer, but that could be because I keep my beard pretty short, so I keep trimming off the hair that&#x27;s been shampooed.</li>
            <li>Being new to the beard world (9 months), I am trying a bunch of different products.</li>
            <li>Wish it smelt a little bit more manly other than that</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and solid in the shower, but remains subtle afterwards - the only person who will be smelling it is whoever you&#x27;re kissing.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a mild shampoo that definitely helps keep the skin underneath your facial hair from drying out and becoming itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one likes the taste of soap, and as a shampoo product that is specifically designed to be used around your mouth, Beardsley apparently figured, why not make it taste better for that inevitable moment that soap meets tongue?  </li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying some more when my next bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used to use normal shampoo on the mess that is my beard thinking hair is hair, but this stuff leaves my beard feeling so much better than normal stuff you use on the head.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, faint berry smell.</li>
            <li> guess that many people who have a problem with the scent like to feel &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; and would consider this scent to not fit that criteria.</li>
            <li> And the smell is alright, not huge fan of its smell, buts its OK</li>
            <li> I personally found that I wasn&#x27;t really able to smell it after rinsing it out of my beard anyway, which seems to be a running theme I&#x27;ve found with beard shampoos, where the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Softens and straightens coarse beard hairs</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a live and learn purchase for me.</li>
            <li> a user of scented beard oil, my main concern purchasing this product was the strength of the scent after reading some of the reviews stating that it leaves your beard smelling like wild berry after you wash up.</li>
            <li> The packaging was cheaply printed on generic white bottles.</li>
            <li> Personally, I haven&#x27;t gotten into a situation where any has gotten into my mouth, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it tastes, but it is an interesting twist on the product that I haven&#x27;t seen in other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plainly stated right here that it is &amp;#34;wild berry.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not very citrus-esque, more of an understated berry scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spread throughout, and after using it for a few days, my beard was softer and it was easier to pull my boar bristle brush through</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely with only using a small amount.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not smell manly, it doesn&#x27;t really smell very adult either.</li>

            <li> It keeps the beard in check while keeping it soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing it out since early November 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted the soft beard, but not a scent that would overpower my beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t completely fix my dandruff but helped a lot</li>
            <li> Leaves beard soft and untangled</li>
            <li> The other brand of shampoo I tried was Bluebeards Original, which I found to be thin and watery and tough to get a good lather out of, especially if you have a beard with more than an inch of growth.</li>
            <li> consistency, making it easy to lather and making it possible to use less product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> consistency, making it easy to lather and making it possible to use less product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually making my beard any softer, but that could be because I keep my beard pretty short, so I keep trimming off the hair that&#x27;s been shampooed.</li>
            <li> Being new to the beard world (9 months), I am trying a bunch of different products.</li>
            <li> Wish it smelt a little bit more manly other than that</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and solid in the shower, but remains subtle afterwards - the only person who will be smelling it is whoever you&#x27;re kissing.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve only tried the Wild Berry scent/flavor, so I can&#x27;t comment on the other kinds, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found with this one.</li>

            <li> While I don&#x27;t hate the scent, I personally would prefer something more manly scented, but even putting that thought aside, the first thing I thought of when I smelled it was a child&#x27;s shampoo.</li>

            <li> Very little is needed as it lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> Far less itchy face....  </li>
            <li> It left my beard feeling dry and coarse...not something \\&quot;beard</li>
            <li> My beard hair is pretty thick and it was never soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> While not directly a con to this product, the conditioner that is supposed to go with it is sub par.</li>
            <li> thing I haven&#x27;t seen anyone on here mention is one thing that is different about Beardsley from other beard shampoos</li>
            <li> with dry skin and itchiness&lt;</li>
            <li> with dry skin and itchiness&lt;</li>
            <li> Just as expected Benny the jet Rodriguez</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a few weeks later I checked the ingredients which are stated to contain:  Methtyl Paraben, Butly Paraben, and Propyl Paraben.  </li>
            <li> As a self proclaimed beardsman I would use any other product.</li>
            <li> Smell is not overwhelming and it definitely tames his beard.  </li>
            <li> There are other products out there for beards...go with those.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted me well over 4 months when using it every other day.</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff is twice the size and half the price of other beard shampoos and works just as well.</li>
            <li> After 2 attempts, I dumped the rest of it down the drain.</li>
            <li> the less I have to use, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to find a safer less toxic alternative which is a shame because this one worked so well.</li>
            <li> Makes a buyer think that maybe they got a little screwed out of what should have been combo deal.</li>
            <li> hair would feel rough and hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now and the scent is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> This will keep you beard from getting greasy or too dried out.</li>
            <li> After its gone, I plan on trying other brands to compare, but unless I find one that does everything this one does AND has a scent I prefer, it&#x27;ll be hard to beat</li>

            <li> You only smell it when you apply it, even then the scent is faint.</li>
            <li> A separate shampoo for your face is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> My pillows smell like a field of berries, women tell me I smell like candy, and the beard never looks broken when I&#x27;m using this stuff.</li>
            <li> That was a bad plan.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too bad or overpowering either which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Another nasty ingredient this shampoo contains is Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate.  </li>

            <li> I have a big beard so I use this stuff every day. It keeps the beard in check while keeping it soft. Be sure to also use some beard balm...</li>
            <li> I have 4@1/2 inch hair on my face and I was using regular hair shampoos. Big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;My hair would feel rough and hard. This shampoo cleared that right up. It leaves my beard soft and smooth like it should feel on my face. Ignore the comments about the strong berry scent, such a lie. You only smell it when you apply it, even then the scent is faint. When you&#x27;re done, you don&#x27;t smell it all.!  Highly recommend this product. Good luck!</li>
            <li> As a self proclaimed beardsman I would use any other product.</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo for all styles and lengths of facial hair. Lathers nicely with only using a small amount. I would highly recommend this product. 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells good without being overwhelming</li>
            <li> This is a great product, great smell and better results.</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes just like Berry. Very little is needed as it lathers up very well. The scent is strong and solid in the shower, but remains subtle afterwards - the only person who will be smelling it is whoever you&#x27;re kissing. One bottle lasts me 6-12 months with 1-2 uses per day.</li>
            <li> I must say that I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s the first actual beard shampoo and conditioner that I have bought and after a couple of uses I&#x27;m really satisfied. I enjoy the smell (Wild Berry) and how much softer and more manageable it has made my beard.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is kinda curly so it can be somewhat of a hassle to brush and comb. Overall I recommend these products to my bearded brethren.</li>
            <li> Bought two for my BIL and Husband. They both love it! Fast shipping! Packaged well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, faint berry smell. washes ok. Seems fairly mild, nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and seemingly gentile shampoo. After using off and on for a couple weeks I have come to the conclusion that a good hair shampoo and conditioner are all you need. A separate shampoo for your face is unnecessary. Will use it up on head and beard and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo , smells great.</li>
            <li> Not enough words to describe how awesome a product this is</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!  Smell is not overwhelming and it definitely tames his beard.  He has the conditioner as well, but does not use it as often.  Gave this to my husband, father, and son for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now and the scent is not overpowering at all. The shampoo lathers up well and leaves my beard and mustache feeling clean. I&#x27;ve also noticed my beard seems to be softer since using this product. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Gift recipient said it deserved 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is also great for face and head if you are bald like I am.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using this it for about a year and it works as advertised.  Far less itchy face....  Your bears will thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes good, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my beard texture.</li>
            <li> Keeps my man mane healthy and sexy. Smells good and is not overbearing at all. It is soap, but I had to taste it to check the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;. That was a bad plan. Don&#x27;t eat soap kids, but buy this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a shampoo made specifically for beards.  I used to use soap and then switched to regular shampoo to wash my beard.  My beard hair is pretty thick and it was never soft to the touch.  I have used Beardsley a couple of times and I definitely see the difference.  My beard feels much softer and smoother to touch and the Wild Berry smell is very mild which I like.  I&#x27;m glad that I bought this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Review Preface: I have a full beard that hangs about one inch off of my face. I&#x27;ve been growing it out since early November 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a user of scented beard oil, my main concern purchasing this product was the strength of the scent after reading some of the reviews stating that it leaves your beard smelling like wild berry after you wash up. I wanted the soft beard, but not a scent that would overpower my beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the beard wash, I can tell you two things about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The scent smells great, is not overpowering, and does not cover up my beard oil scent at all. If anything, my beard oil easily covers up the scent of the wash, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The wash leaves your beard feeling soft and magical. Yes, magical. That is the only word that comes to mind in order to describe the softness. It was like touching a feathery pillow on my face, and my beard was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just as expected Benny the jet Rodriguez</li>
            <li> This will keep you beard from getting greasy or too dried out. If you combine it with the conditioner it gets super soft.</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers up well. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Wish it smelt a little bit more manly other than that its a pretty good shampoo and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot trust me I have a big beard.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, made bear so soft and it makes you keep and carry  the fruit smell all day long.</li>
            <li> As someone who&#x27;s been growing a longer beard for a couple years now, I&#x27;ve been wanting to try beard shampoos. Ive found that I get better results from shampoos specifically designed for beards, and bave decided to try different brands and see which I prefer. This is the second brand I&#x27;ve tried, and I prefer this one so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo basically does everything you want from a beard shampoo. It softened my beard hairs and made them easier to manage. It also seems to help straighten the hairs, which for someone who&#x27;s trying to achieve length, is a big plus. It&#x27;s a mild shampoo that definitely helps keep the skin underneath your facial hair from drying out and becoming itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beardsley also helps with stringiness and thinning, as its helped my beard seem fuller. I liked the consistency of the shampoo as well. The other brand of shampoo I tried was Bluebeards Original, which I found to be thin and watery and tough to get a good lather out of, especially if you have a beard with more than an inch of growth. Beardsley was the opposite. Its a thick shampoo that I don&#x27;t have to use very much of to get a good lather and wash out of it, which is a huge plus, as with most items that are considered &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; items, it&#x27;s not exactly cheap, so the less I have to use, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I haven&#x27;t seen anyone on here mention is one thing that is different about Beardsley from other beard shampoos is that it is FLAVORED.  No one likes the taste of soap, and as a shampoo product that is specifically designed to be used around your mouth, Beardsley apparently figured, why not make it taste better for that inevitable moment that soap meets tongue?  Beardsley doesn&#x27;t even describe their shampoos by scent on their website, they describe them by flavor. Personally, I haven&#x27;t gotten into a situation where any has gotten into my mouth, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it tastes, but it is an interesting twist on the product that I haven&#x27;t seen in other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve had with it, which I&#x27;ve seen others comment on as well, is the scent. While I don&#x27;t hate the scent, I personally would prefer something more manly scented, but even putting that thought aside, the first thing I thought of when I smelled it was a child&#x27;s shampoo. Not only does it not smell manly, it doesn&#x27;t really smell very adult either. Now, I&#x27;ve only tried the Wild Berry scent/flavor, so I can&#x27;t comment on the other kinds, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found with this one. I personally found that I wasn&#x27;t really able to smell it after rinsing it out of my beard anyway, which seems to be a running theme I&#x27;ve found with beard shampoos, where the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Softens and straightens coarse beard hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Helps with dry skin and itchiness&lt;br /&gt;-Is flavored for accidental meetings with the mouth&lt;br /&gt;-Thick consistency, making it easy to lather and making it possible to use less product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Scent is a bit childish and doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a very good product.

            <li> My beard has never felt softer. My pillows smell like a field of berries, women tell me I smell like candy, and the beard never looks broken when I&#x27;m using this stuff. I recently went a week without while traveling and you could very much tell. I went from having a beautifully sculpted and soft beard to looking like a mountain man who just returned from a voyage into the windiest part of hell.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell, but not overpowering at all. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually making my beard any softer, but that could be because I keep my beard pretty short, so I keep trimming off the hair that&#x27;s been shampooed. Either way, my face smells nice and feels clean after using this, so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Being new to the beard world (9 months), I am trying a bunch of different products. This didn&#x27;t seem like anymore than a medium grade shampoo. The packaging was cheaply printed on generic white bottles. I used this in conjunction with the Beardsley Conditioner. It left my beard feeling dry and coarse...not something \\&quot;beard farmers\\&quot; would be interested in at all. There are other products out there for beards...go with those. It&#x27;s a live and learn purchase for me. After 2 attempts, I dumped the rest of it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Love the beard shampoo. Make so much of a differance. Easy to comb through after using. Highly recommend. Didn&#x27;t completely fix my dandruff but helped a lot</li>
            <li> Helps with the itching of the skin underneath in my case. I used to use beard oils only on my beard, but those, I think, have a temporary effect rather than permanent.now I use this shampoo every 2 or 3 days. Gives a healthier look to the beard. And the smell is alright, not huge fan of its smell, buts its OK I guess. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does exactly what it says it will do. It makes my beard really soft and easy to comb as well as clears up the dandruff. The scent isn&#x27;t too bad or overpowering either which is a plus. Also, this stuff is twice the size and half the price of other beard shampoos and works just as well. This bottle lasted me well over 4 months when using it every other day. I definitely will be buying some more when my next bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Such a massive improvement over regular shampoo and conditioner. This stuff makes your beard and mustachio feel ... I dont know how to describe just better. the smell is not too strong and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Used to use normal shampoo on the mess that is my beard thinking hair is hair, but this stuff leaves my beard feeling so much better than normal stuff you use on the head.  You know how in those shampoo commercials you see the women doing hair flips?  Picture that, but me doing it with my beard.  My wife also complements the beard and loves the way it smells.  Saves me from having to spray febreze ever morning.</li>
            <li> Great beard shampoo, although I received this as a single piece and it was labeled as a multi pack on the bottle itself.  Makes a buyer think that maybe they got a little screwed out of what should have been combo deal.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, even tastes like blueberry if/when you get some in your mouth.  Keeps my beard clean, much to my wife&#x27;s approval.</li>
            <li> Its fine. The smell is on the lighter side, and does not carry with you at all. I purchased this because Im getting more beard dander. It seems to have helped. I also have started to use Head &amp; Shoulders, which I have found to function better and is quite a bit cheaper. I would only go the route of this shampoo again if I were feeling like I needed a fancy alternative.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo for his beard. Says it makes him feel fresh and clean and is a must have for any man that has grown out his facial hair. Personally, I love the smell of it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Super gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> nice fragrance --works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for a couple years now, and I&#x27;ve tried many different beard shampoos. I&#x27;ve also used normal shampoos, and have found that the former is better in most cases. Many of the beard shampoos are great for tangles and scraggly beards, and many are on the lighter side, and are not harsh to the face underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beardsley Ultra Shampoo definitely fits into that category. It&#x27;s a very light shampoo that lathers very well in the beard. It&#x27;s easy to spread throughout, and after using it for a few days, my beard was softer and it was easier to pull my boar bristle brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the oils in the shampoo stayed in the beard nicely, and when I brushed deep, I did feel like they were being pulled through my beard effectively. I would always recommend a conditioner for the beard as well, though I prefer leave-in conditioners and have not experience good results with Beardsley&#x27;s conditioner that is to go with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I do not see what the problem is for most people. It&#x27;s plainly stated right here that it is &amp;#34;wild berry.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not very citrus-esque, more of an understated berry scent. It smells more like a berry bush than the actual berry. I quite like the scent, but it is strong and it does stick with you for most of the day if you shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d guess that many people who have a problem with the scent like to feel &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; and would consider this scent to not fit that criteria. I personally like to use this and then a scented leave-in conditioner, which will mask it so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Light, moisturizes the skin effectively&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves beard soft and untangled&lt;br /&gt;- Good price for the amount on a targeted product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The scent, while good, is strong&lt;br /&gt;- While not directly a con to this product, the conditioner that is supposed to go with it is sub par.</li>
            <li> works amazing for my beard and flavor is a bonus that I like.</li>
            <li> Keeps your beard soft for the day but makes it smell Great.  The lady do love it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I knew it was too good to be true.  Without thinking to check the ingredients first, I ordered this shampoo and started using it.  It works great!  Unfortunately a few weeks later I checked the ingredients which are stated to contain:  Methtyl Paraben, Butly Paraben, and Propyl Paraben.  Another nasty ingredient this shampoo contains is Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate.  Even though they&#x27;re approved for use, there&#x27;s mounting evidence that these ingredients are toxic and absorbed into the body.  I&#x27;ll have to find a safer less toxic alternative which is a shame because this one worked so well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Exceeded expectations.  Looking forward to buying more products by them.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it about to reorder</li>
