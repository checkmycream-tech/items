            <li>I love the body wash.  </li>
            <li>Love this cocoa butter and shea body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using suave&#x27;s body wash for years now, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for that \\&quot;magic\\&quot; wash that will seal in moisture and will keep my skin from drying out even more.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself using more than I am use to.</li>
            <li>We love both.</li>
            <li>Axe is way better....</li>
            <li>Does the job cleaning my body :) Will keep buying with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>i love the cheap price and the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>Good price and quality, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, very mild.</li>
            <li>Like the bottle and the way it opens easy to manuver</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it gets me clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve upped the rating to 5 stars because Amazon was great about resolving the discrepancy, corrected my order to my satisfaction and both the creamy and regular formulas of this product</li>
            <li>Light scent and creamy.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, decent price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that works better for me, and thankfully this didn&#x27;t cost all that much!</li>
            <li>It provides a clean body wash for the money.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This creamy body wash does a good job as a daily soap.  </li>
            <li>Love the Scent, not too soft or strong.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you like the new formula before ordering it!</li>
            <li>Great product with a slight scent.  </li>
            <li>If you want the creamy formula, better contact the seller first before ordering to find out what you will really get.    </li>
            <li>and it smells nice enough...</li>
            <li>First two shipments were great but the last shipment contained the new formula.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not bad body wash, it certainly works on the &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>The regular formula is fine, a good product, but the reason I gave this item only three stars is because I did not get what was advertised.</li>
            <li>personally, prefer a more ocean or fresh scent.</li>
            <li>There is a strong scent of \\&quot;fake cocoa,\\&quot; the cheap perfume used in many sweet products that never smells like chocolate at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved and used this product for years and just recently subscribed to regular shipments from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>; basically sums up the whole experience here.</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>produces other body washes with better scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got it on subscribe and save and highly recommend the product as being gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>We use daily with super results, alternating between this and Tropical Coconut.</li>
            <li>a user of body wash, this product does leave my skin very soft, but is very floral in scent.&lt;br /&gt;Hi</li>
            <li>This is normal body wash...</li>
            <li>I would say it has a normal consistency.</li>
            <li>My other body wash almost doubles as light</li>
            <li>Smells great but is a little thick for my liking.</li>
            <li>We have a soft water system in our house and it still foams well in the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this body wash lathers well, is decent at moisturizing, feels silky on the skin and doesn&#x27;t require a lot to use, you&#x27;re probably choosing it over similar products because of the scent.</li>
            <li>What I got was the older regular formula.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Slightly curved bottle is easy to hold on to, even when wet.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried Suave&#x27;s Cocoa Butter bodywash which comes in a clear bottle through which you can see the tan (toffee coloured), liquid body wash.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, I can also detect a hint of butterscotch in the bodywash but the overall effect is one which is too heavy on a cheap perfume, rather than hinting at one which is quality.</li>
            <li>Other scents are available for less cost in the store, but can&#x27;t find this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right, not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry like other soaps.  </li>
            <li>Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anymore at a good price.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like the 6-pack because my husband is pretty sensitive to smells and notices when I&#x27;m unable to find the same scent at the store.  </li>
            <li> I use it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a messy soap scum to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely displeased, but I won&#x27;t be buying it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had incredibly dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> The old Cocoa and Shea Butter bodywash came in a white bottle but the scent is not appropriate for either products!</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing...</li>
            <li> Although I did not experience irritation, it&#x27;s definitely not a positive aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave</li>
            <li> I just wish that the smell didn&#x27;t just wash down the drain.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with cocoa butter products like Palmer&#x27;s lotion, you will be sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a disappointing</li>
            <li> I returned to less expensive body wash recently after using dial for months.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if the product itself has changed.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy body wash for a few months!</li>
            <li> At least where I&#x27;m concered, this product sadly ain&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; wash also has this really weird, goopy texture, almost like a gel.  </li>
            <li> Not the worst body wash</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it gets me clean.  I like the 6-pack because my husband is pretty sensitive to smells and notices when I&#x27;m unable to find the same scent at the store.  This multi-pack solves the problem of smelling like a stranger when you switch body washes.  We have a soft water system in our house and it still foams well in the shower.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Suave&#x27;s Cocoa Butter bodywash which comes in a clear bottle through which you can see the tan (toffee coloured), liquid body wash. It appears this product has had a face lift and name change but I am not sure if the product itself has changed. The old Cocoa and Shea Butter bodywash came in a white bottle but the scent is not appropriate for either products! If you&#x27;re familiar with cocoa butter products like Palmer&#x27;s lotion, you will be sorely disappointed. There is a strong scent of \\&quot;fake cocoa,\\&quot; the cheap perfume used in many sweet products that never smells like chocolate at all. Strangely enough, I can also detect a hint of butterscotch in the bodywash but the overall effect is one which is too heavy on a cheap perfume, rather than hinting at one which is quality. This is nothing like a blend of cocoa and shea butter, either. It&#x27;s really just a disappointing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this body wash lathers well, is decent at moisturizing, feels silky on the skin and doesn&#x27;t require a lot to use, you&#x27;re probably choosing it over similar products because of the scent. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this bodywash at all and only am using it because a family member bought it but it causes irritation to her skin. Although I did not experience irritation, it&#x27;s definitely not a positive aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave produces other body washes with better scents.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of cocoa butter. It provides a clean body wash for the money. Very easy to order and have delivered.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the photo showed it was the newer creamy formula. What I got was the older regular formula. The regular formula is fine, a good product, but the reason I gave this item only three stars is because I did not get what was advertised. If you want the creamy formula, better contact the seller first before ordering to find out what you will really get.    UPDATE 3/7/11  Contacted Amazon and they researched the discrepancy. The product is supposed to be the creamy newer formula. They are sending me the correct product to replace the incorrect one initially shipped to me. I&#x27;ve upped the rating to 5 stars because Amazon was great about resolving the discrepancy, corrected my order to my satisfaction and both the creamy and regular formulas of this product are great. I&#x27;ve got it on subscribe and save and highly recommend the product as being gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved and used this product for years and just recently subscribed to regular shipments from Amazon.  First two shipments were great but the last shipment contained the new formula.  The smell is totally different than what I&#x27;m used to getting.  Make sure that you like the new formula before ordering it! They are not the same.</li>
            <li> I love the body wash.  My family and I use it and it keeps our skin moisturized.  The smell is not too overbearing</li>
            <li> It does not look like the picture, Picture is Cocoa and Shea Butter.  The package I got was Cocoa Butter.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the way it makes my skin feel. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I have dry skin. It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This review comes from a man.&lt;br /&gt;As a user of body wash, this product does leave my skin very soft, but is very floral in scent.&lt;br /&gt;Hi personally, prefer a more ocean or fresh scent. I understand how manly this is, as I squeeze that ocean manly smell onto my purple poof.....</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter and shea body wash. I&#x27;ve been using suave&#x27;s body wash for years now, this is my favorite. It smells great and it&#x27;s not overpowering. It&#x27;s a great deal too. I won&#x27;t have to buy body wash for a few months! I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is normal body wash...nothing great about it. It smells good but the smell does not linger on your skin which I would like. It is not very moisturizing...I would say it has a normal consistency. Great price for the amount that you get but if you are looking for something with extra perks such a moisture, aroma, dry skin relief, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a excellent choice because I got a lifetime supply It has an excellent smell and I could not beat the price</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; basically sums up the whole experience here. I&#x27;m not completely displeased, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine just gushed about this stuff, said that it was the best thing since sliced bread and smelled amazing, etc etc... so I bought some.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad body wash, it certainly works on the &amp;#34;I feel clean&amp;#34; front... and it smells nice enough... I just wish that the smell didn&#x27;t just wash down the drain. My other body wash almost doubles as light perfume-- this leaves a trace of scent that disappears by the time you towel off.</li>
            <li> Great! Light scent and creamy. Good moisture and great for shaving. Will order again!</li>
            <li> yum!  i love the cheap price and the smell of this.  it makes my skin nice and soft.  all good.</li>
            <li> This creamy body wash does a good job as a daily soap.  It lathers great on a loafa, cleans effectively, and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve had incredibly dry skin this winter.  I&#x27;m still looking for that \\&quot;magic\\&quot; wash that will seal in moisture and will keep my skin from drying out even more.  At least where I&#x27;m concered, this product sadly ain&#x27;t it.  The \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; wash also has this really weird, goopy texture, almost like a gel.  Not the worst body wash I&#x27;ve ever tried, but not the best either. I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that works better for me, and thankfully this didn&#x27;t cost all that much!</li>
            <li> love the smell, great bargain buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I returned to less expensive body wash recently after using dial for months. This suave product does not lather well and I find myself using more than I am use to. Probably not as good as a bargain as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> At this price, I&#x27;m going to buy these again! Great quality!</li>
            <li> We use daily with super results, alternating between this and Tropical Coconut. We love both.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right, not sure if I would buy again. Axe is way better....</li>
            <li> I use this as bubble bath when taking a bath.  It&#x27;s glorious.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of body wash.  I use it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a messy soap scum to clean up.  Smells nice, decent price.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite washes and a good deal online. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s the perfect body wash.  Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anymore at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great body wash great price</li>
            <li> Smells great and good price here on amazon. Does the job cleaning my body :) Will keep buying with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Love the Scent, not too soft or strong.  Other scents are available for less cost in the store, but can&#x27;t find this one.</li>
            <li> Great product with a slight scent.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry like other soaps.  Easy to use, a little goes a long way. Slightly curved bottle is easy to hold on to, even when wet.  Really like it.  Price is very good.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality, fast delivery. Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, very mild.</li>
            <li> Smells great but is a little thick for my liking. Like the bottle and the way it opens easy to manuver</li>
