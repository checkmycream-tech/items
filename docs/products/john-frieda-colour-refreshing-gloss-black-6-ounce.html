    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>John Frieda Gloss is perfect for helping to hide the gray that appears at my hairline as my hair grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li>Still a great product though!</li>
            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>Best price I could find on this product</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>I love this, works great.</li>
            <li>Great for touch up and covers gray better than my salon color.  </li>
            <li>For me, it works best to limit the application to the new growth areas, close to the scalp...  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About 4 weeks after my salon color/highlights, I&#x27;ll just dab some of this product (top of forehead &amp; temples) about twice a week in the shower.  </li>
            <li>in all, a great value &amp; highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works okay but does not cover my gray growing out around my face.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>If anything, it gave me gray trying to clean up after it!</li>
            <li>The product does a good job of camouflaging that dreaded distinct line separating the hair that proudly declares &amp;#34;I was salon-colored!&amp;#34; and those who scream &amp;#34;I grew in after the last hair coloring appointment.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I put it on after conditioning it makes my hair feel stringy and causes it to knot easily.</li>
            <li>I do my own color (redish brown) and this gloss keeps my roots from standing out between sessions and keeps my hair a warm brown instead of fading out to brassy red.</li>
            <li>and it has a noticeable but not unpleasant scent (reminds me of the scent of cherry coke.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, or recommend it considering it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything</li>
            <li>This product really helps hold colour in and refresh it with each use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this project to others!</li>
            <li>but I find it lasts much longer than that</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well, but didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I have a grey patch near the top of my head that I want covered without dyeing all of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to go back to a light brown after being blonde, had already dyed my hair back to light brown, but wanted to add the shine and tone back into it, to lift some of the dullness</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and the color is refreshed.</li>
            <li>For what it offers, I like it.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and neither has anyone else.</li>
            <li>I see some shine to my hair directly after using but after a couple days that fades away...  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of using I&#x27;m not really seeing where it does much of a difference....  </li>
            <li>The John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t come with all the mess you usually get.</li>

            <li> With hair coloring/cut costing $175-$225 in my area, I do try to wait as long as possible (without scaring the neighbors) between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product stretched my color out....</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts quite a long time and extends your color.</li>
            <li> I tried it for my hair, and it stained my hands, head and various other parts of me and my shower.</li>
            <li> As for the color, the brown dye I used before is starting to wash out a little because I was blonde before</li>
            <li> But when I don&#x27;t use it I can definitely tell my hair is a little duller.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and my grey</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really keeping the color from fading either...  </li>
            <li> and I have medium thick hair that falls to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> every other shampoo, otherwise it builds up and makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have colored hair, but I use it to &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; my already dark hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark brown, almost black.</li>
            <li> I  bought this to add shine to my hair, and tone it a little.  </li>
            <li> starts showing around my forehead after a few weeks getting colored.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be messy to apply, but it is not.</li>
            <li> Just leave on in the shower for a few minutes, rinse and your done.  </li>
            <li> I follow the directions in the shower: I wash and condition my hair as usual, squeeze out excess water and apply quarter-size amounts, beginning at the roots until it has been dispersed throughout all my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called a foam</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s hard to notice.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a thick liquid (the texture reminds me of finger paint)</li>
            <li> This was a bloody mess</li>

            <li> With hair coloring/cut costing $175-$225 in my area, I do try to wait as long as possible (without scaring the neighbors) between visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This John Frieda Gloss is perfect for helping to hide the gray that appears at my hairline as my hair grows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 4 weeks after my salon color/highlights, I&#x27;ll just dab some of this product (top of forehead &amp; temples) about twice a week in the shower.  (After completing shampoo &amp; conditioner.)  The product does a good job of camouflaging that dreaded distinct line separating the hair that proudly declares &amp;#34;I was salon-colored!&amp;#34; and those who scream &amp;#34;I grew in after the last hair coloring appointment.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Squeeze out excess water from hair prior to applying.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Try not to get the product on your skin (if you do, simply wash away with a soapy washcloth after you notice it).&lt;br /&gt;3.  For me, it works best to limit the application to the new growth areas, close to the scalp...  when I tried to use it throughout my hair, it sort of dulled the distinction between my brown color and lighter highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great value &amp; highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this, works great. I have dark brown hair and my grey starts showing around my forehead after a few weeks getting colored. I wanted this to extend trips between colors and it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> This product really helps hold colour in and refresh it with each use. It doesn&#x27;t add colour though,as suggested, which is why I have four instead of five stars. Still a great product though!</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t come with all the mess you usually get. I would highly recommend this project to others!</li>
            <li> Works okay but does not cover my gray growing out around my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair look and feel like it does after a color touch up - every time I shampoo!  I thought it would be messy to apply, but it is not. I follow the directions in the shower: I wash and condition my hair as usual, squeeze out excess water and apply quarter-size amounts, beginning at the roots until it has been dispersed throughout all my hair.  I leave it in while I bathe, then just rinse it out.  My hair is soft, shiny, and the color is refreshed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have colored hair, but I use it to &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; my already dark hair. It works. It gives it a bit of a boost. My hair is very dark brown, almost black. So it&#x27;s hard to notice. But when I don&#x27;t use it I can definitely tell my hair is a little duller. For what it offers, I like it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I&#x27; ve already purchased 8 of this foam hair color and I only wish for bigger bottles!</li>
            <li> I do my own color (redish brown) and this gloss keeps my roots from standing out between sessions and keeps my hair a warm brown instead of fading out to brassy red. I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called a foam, it&#x27;s a thick liquid (the texture reminds me of finger paint) and it has a noticeable but not unpleasant scent (reminds me of the scent of cherry coke.) The bottle promises 6 applications but I find it lasts much longer than that and I have medium thick hair that falls to the middle of my back. I use it once a week, every other shampoo, otherwise it builds up and makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> After using the John Frieda Precision Foam Color Hair Dye, I tried this in an effort to boost my color and shine. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and neither has anyone else. I also don&#x27;t like that when I put it on after conditioning it makes my hair feel stringy and causes it to knot easily. What&#x27;s the point of conditioning then? I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> Helps prolong color, covers gray.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> I definitely cannot recommend this product. I tried it for my hair, and it stained my hands, head and various other parts of me and my shower. I followed the instructions implicitly, and I have no problem using actual hair dye. This was a bloody mess and I don&#x27;t think it did anything for my hair. If anything, it gave me gray trying to clean up after it! Avoid!!</li>
            <li> I  bought this to add shine to my hair, and tone it a little.  I&#x27;m trying to go back to a light brown after being blonde, had already dyed my hair back to light brown, but wanted to add the shine and tone back into it, to lift some of the dullness hair box dye gives....  After two weeks of using I&#x27;m not really seeing where it does much of a difference....  I see some shine to my hair directly after using but after a couple days that fades away...  As for the color, the brown dye I used before is starting to wash out a little because I was blonde before so it&#x27;s not really keeping the color from fading either...  I&#x27;m not disappointed, I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, or recommend it considering it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the stated use- I do not have colored hair.  I have a grey patch near the top of my head that I want covered without dyeing all of my hair.  This worked pretty well, but didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.  It got points for ease of use though.</li>
            <li> Eight weeks in the Florida sunshine does color damage ....this product stretched my color out....works great. Will have to remember next year!</li>
            <li> Great for touch up and covers gray better than my salon color.  Just leave on in the shower for a few minutes, rinse and your done.  Best price I could find on this product, so I stocked up.  The bottle lasts quite a long time and extends your color.</li>
