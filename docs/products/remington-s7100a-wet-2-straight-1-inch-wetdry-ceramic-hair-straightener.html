    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>its very good but not until you accidentally try to straighten your hair and your forgot that you had hairspray in it!</li>
            <li>Would make an excellent travel hair straightner for someone on the road a lot.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it ts the wet-dry feature.  </li>
            <li>I used Remington&#x27;s Ceramic Hair Straightener, however, I was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>but it straightened out my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I just wanted to write in and say how awesome this STILL is.</li>
            <li>But, This is the best straightener i have ever had</li>

            <li>LOL Happened to me</li>
            <li>It saves time and works great.</li>
            <li>- They say the plates are ceramic, but they aren&#x27;t that great quality.</li>
            <li>Great for the forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She enjoys using it and thinks it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried both options and they are both great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really great straightener for people who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on taking care of their hair.</li>
            <li>The straightener itself works great -- however, the newest version I bought from Amazon.com arrived defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Works great on extentions as well.</li>
            <li>I am still using it now and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener for under $20 -</li>
            <li>Very nice item.</li>
            <li>This iron has been a wonderful addition to the many tools I have for dealing with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because the photo looked like the one I had and LOVED for years.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this, I thought it might be a good solution and a time saver.  </li>
            <li>There are good things as well:     </li>
            <li>It takes about a minute for the plates to get to temperature (375) and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li>She loved it.  </li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Good for the price</li>
            <li>recomendo good purchase ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, very effective, and a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does an excellent job of drying and straightening hair in one step.</li>
            <li>It is the best solution for drying your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this!!!  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this iron.  </li>
            <li>I love the wet-to-straight!</li>
            <li>Love this item!</li>
            <li>automatic shut-off is an amazing feature which I didn&#x27;t appreciate until I lived with girls in college..</li>
            <li>I liked this iron a lot.</li>
            <li>It smoothed it out so nicely and even made it look longer.  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with this invention</li>
            <li>and have used it consistently and been happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with Conair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this one was as good as the S2044 as you can&#x27;t regulate the temperature and the ceramic plates don&#x27;t provide adequate coverage on the iron itself.  </li>
            <li>I am getting a better quality straightner for Christmas and will be replacing this one for sure.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this 1 inch version.  </li>
            <li>This is not am improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I just can&#x27;t give this item a more favorable rating.</li>
            <li>A button would have been a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it creates more static than the one I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>it works love it</li>
            <li>and when I tried to use this after just towel drying my hair, it made my hair look even more frizzy and took all of the shine out of it.  </li>
            <li>I think more irons need a clamp lock.     </li>
            <li>This is also more entertaining than a hair-dryer.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>although it works ok also I prefer the ceramic.</li>
            <li>I also have the Remington S2044 and love it.  </li>
            <li>This one is just okay, nothing you have to throw into your travel bag when you go out of town.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and I would never pay for a $100 straightener again after using it.</li>
            <li>Buying this straightener was kind of sketchy for me, because it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>have had better products from remington.</li>
            <li>I have 2 things that I don&#x27;t love about this hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>price 120$&lt;br /&gt;its good for ppl that wants a cheap and good one</li>
            <li>I think if you have fine or straight hair, this might be a great tool for saving time and protecting your hair from too many steps.  </li>
            <li>It works best and fastest when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s best to use this on damp, rather than wet, hair.  </li>
            <li>The grip is good, and it&#x27;s very durable.       </li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she loved it, we have always had a problem with her because she takes hours to be ready</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, even better than described!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other straighteners, but this one was not the best.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s easy to use, is ergonomically-designed</li>
            <li>I liked it at first</li>
            <li>If you are wanting an inexpensive iron, this may work fine for you.</li>
            <li>The iron works fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, shoulder-length hair and one sweep of the straightener</li>
            <li>it works well, works quickly and is safe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and her hair glides through easily.</li>
            <li>Handy, light, gets hot quick, locks &amp; kinda easy to use.</li>
            <li>If I had any criticism, it would be that after using the straightener my hair is not quite as smooth as I&#x27;d like it to be.  </li>
            <li>It seems more effort than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic tool</li>
            <li>plus it makes it reflect light and look glossy.  </li>
            <li>But once I got it open, I was happy with the Remington straightener.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>For such a great price, I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 4 years</li>
            <li>wand gets very hot and it seems for me that the best results come when my hair is slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>i love love love this flat iron ..</li>
            <li>Also, after I use it, I notice that my hair remains looking clean for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair when wet, but when its damp and I straighten it, it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good simple straightener, no temperature controls</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase for the price..</li>
            <li>But, a little bit of finishing cream, and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, easy to travel</li>
            <li>I tried the Remington straightener without using any other hair products--just washed my hair with shampoo--and it worked well and looked great.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still looking for a really good flat iron.  </li>
            <li>dries almost as quickly with this as it does with a blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li>It does work on wet hair as well (more like damp) but you will get the best results with dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I know the above sounds like a lot of negatives, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>but overall, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot very quick so is fast to use and easier to use.</li>
            <li>This ceramic curling hair iron really made flat ironing my hair so much more tolerable and the results are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, that is HOT!</li>
            <li>So if you are one that has fine, hard to straighten hair this one works great.  </li>
            <li>but my wife older straightener are better but higher</li>
            <li>I have had many times where it grabs my hair and rips it near the root.</li>
            <li>oh so worth it)</li>
            <li>Having been impressed with Remington&#x27;s products in the past, I jumped at the chance to try out their new wet/dry hair straightener.</li>
            <li>i own this flat iron.</li>
            <li>The heat makes my hair feel very sticky, even though clean, and I must admit</li>
            <li>It totally worked, now we wait less time :-D</li>
            <li>Nice long cord too.</li>
            <li>While impressive, I suppose, my previous flat irons would heat up with a microchip in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an improvement from the old 2-inch version, because the older version had the controls for temperature on top of the handle, and I would often push them accidentally while using the straightener.  </li>
            <li>I used this the first time on damp hair, and was amazed how stick-straight it made it.  </li>
            <li>However she really liked the locking closed feature that this has.</li>
            <li>It makes ironing hair a bit faster by being able to take a larger section of hair.     </li>
            <li>and so I am always concerned about using anything hot on my hair  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it was on a day I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and it had product in it from the day before to keep my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>I get a soft smooth look</li>
            <li>This straightener works great, it grips small sections of hair really well.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a Helen of Troy and my hair didn&#x27;t react much to it!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have the exact model she wanted, so she went ahead and bought this one instead.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Now with this, she can safely straighten and dry her hair right after towel drying her hair.  </li>
            <li>I love using a flat iron on my curly hair to make it not so frizzy and un-brushed looking</li>
            <li>I think the whole idea of a wet to dry iron is brilliant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off letting my hair dry</li>
            <li>She has much better luck working with hair when it&#x27;s damp and was always worried about damaging the straightener when her hair wasn&#x27;t absolutely dry</li>
            <li>After trying it on dry hair without any better results this straightener met the fate of the drawer never to be seen again.</li>
            <li>I had bought the newer wet2straight straightener and you must do large chunks of hair to get it straightened, and it still doesn&#x27;t straighten well.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the same one but only better!</li>
            <li>have really curly hair and it makes my hair so straight in seconds.</li>
            <li>My impressions about the iron are mixed and will be detailed in the convenient pro/con list below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It saves her so much time.  </li>
            <li>and i like to wear my hair straight sometimes</li>
            <li>it got really straight</li>
            <li>I would have rather spent more money on one that would have worked.</li>
            <li>My hair is still straight at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it too much</li>
            <li>but it don&#x27;t slides very well.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t wait too much.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>She said she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>too much hassle</li>
            <li>I found this to be very affordable and also satisfies my needs.</li>
            <li>She said he hair stayed straight all day, even though she didn&#x27;t use any gel.</li>
            <li>( I was more worried about damage to her with the other</li>
            <li>when straightening hair it takes a lot more &amp;#34;muscle&amp;#34; than with other ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Remington Wet 2 Straight Straighteners.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this particular straightener before, but not through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Very durable...was packed with heavy weight on top and not a scratch...dropped on floor and no chipping occurred.</li>
            <li>I know that it doesn&#x27;t have many temperature settings, but most of the time we only use one setting in our irons (flat or curling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it last a long time since we really like it.  </li>
            <li>but it thankfully doesn&#x27;t go this high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The iron does not allow you to dial a temperature but performs at a high heat setting.  </li>
            <li>lock is easy to use and helps keep it from taking up extra space on her side of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The wet or dry feature is her favorite feature by far though.</li>
            <li>that with a twist of the wand adds a little curve to the bottom, making for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>choice when choosing a new straightener.</li>
            <li>While the concept of a straightener being able to straighten your wet hair seems very cool, the heat/steam settings are very confusing (ranging on a scale of 1-30 based on cool, damp, or dry), and the steam really bothers me.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t feel like this got hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first, or even second,</li>
            <li>Since she&#x27;s usually pretty rushed getting out of the house in the morning, it&#x27;s a big help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it works so quickly when wet, I rarely use the dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up quickly, from off to wet setting</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit itself gets really hot, on the outside as well so don&#x27;t grab the top, especially while using, those little holes let out the steam and will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, properly Iam not happy with the product, but My girlfriend loves this Hair Straightener , now it takes more time to get ready!!</li>
            <li>like my old one (Conair).</li>
            <li>im natural</li>
            <li>The plates don&#x27;t heat up enough and it leaves my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates carried the heat well; my hair felt soft after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>The directions say to direct the steam away from your head, but then there&#x27;s the issue of the hand that&#x27;s trying to comb the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the hair remained completely straight for the next 2 days, until I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really short hair, so I was trying to find a straightener that would straighten it and keep it straight all day.</li>
            <li>I can notice the difference from her old straightener.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Great idea that actually works (slightly).&lt;br /&gt;- Works better straightening dry hair than wet or damp hair, which when used wet left my thick and unruly hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only took 15 minutes for my teen daughter to get all her hair done from wet to a nice sleek dry.  </li>
            <li>everything was fine except for the fact that the labels that say wet and dry on the switch rubbed off so now</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ll use my other straightener as my main one, I still will break this out any time I may need to straighten my hair fast after having washed it.</li>
            <li>and she liked the lock feature; her only complaint is that you can&#x27;t select a specific temperature, which could be done on her old straightener.</li>
            <li>still not the smooth gloss that I get from my regular flat iron, plus it took over an hour to let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>I think burns are a little more likely with this flat iron because of the steam.  </li>
            <li>It did dry my hair really fast</li>
            <li>A few points to note:  - You can&#x27;t adjust the temperature, and this device gets VERY hot.  </li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s broad.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it is so much better with wet hair, as it does not seem to help wet hair dry.</li>
            <li>S9520 Salon Collection Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 2 Inch\\&quot; which she has used for years and absolutely loves.</li>
            <li>My wife has very curly hair and needed a new straightener as her old one was misplaced during a recent move.</li>
            <li>But if you have thick, curly and/or wavy hair like mine, you&#x27;re better off just sticking with a hair dryer, using silicone protectant and a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive straighteners in the past and they were not even half as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>So the next time, I let my hair air dry until almost completely dry and tried again, it was a little better but</li>
            <li>The newer versions of both the 1 inch and 2 inch Wet 2 Straight straighteners have the controls on the side of the handle, and I don&#x27;t have the same problem.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few passes with this straightener to really do anything to my hair, and because of that, it leaves my hair soft, but not silky.</li>
            <li>MY hair is thick and wavy, and the wavy part is a kind of uneven waviness which makes it puff out away from my head</li>
            <li>Using this made my hair go dry and damaged my hair very much and it hardly straightened the hair and not to forget my hair is never hard rather its soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Barrel stays cool and it&#x27;s hard to burn yourself with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the wet option a few times but even if it says it&#x27;s meant for wet hair, I worry about damaging my hair more than I already am, so I keep that to a minimum.</li>
            <li>, isn&#x27;t heavy, straightens her hair on the first go</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10 minutes to dry my completely drenched hair.</li>
            <li>Oh and it takes 20 minutes to cool off, at least enough to lock it and put it away without any issues.  </li>
            <li>This one does the job, it gets your hair straight and dry from completely wet.</li>
            <li>and I would say it takes maybe 5-7 minutes from wet to straight and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather wait for my hair to dry or be damp than straighten it wet.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> its very good but not until you accidentally try to straighten your hair and your forgot that you had hairspray in it!</li>
            <li> Would make an excellent travel hair straightner for someone on the road a lot.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it ts the wet-dry feature.  </li>
            <li> I used Remington&#x27;s Ceramic Hair Straightener, however, I was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> but it straightened out my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to write in and say how awesome this STILL is.</li>
            <li> But, This is the best straightener i have ever had</li>
            <li> She was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> LOL Happened to me</li>
            <li> It saves time and works great.</li>
            <li> - They say the plates are ceramic, but they aren&#x27;t that great quality.</li>
            <li> Great for the forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She enjoys using it and thinks it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I have tried both options and they are both great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a really great straightener for people who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on taking care of their hair.</li>
            <li> The straightener itself works great -- however, the newest version I bought from Amazon.com arrived defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Works great on extentions as well.</li>
            <li> I am still using it now and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener for under $20 -</li>
            <li> Very nice item.</li>
            <li> This iron has been a wonderful addition to the many tools I have for dealing with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because the photo looked like the one I had and LOVED for years.</li>
            <li> so when I saw this, I thought it might be a good solution and a time saver.  </li>
            <li> There are good things as well:     </li>
            <li> It takes about a minute for the plates to get to temperature (375) and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li> She loved it.  </li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> Good for the price</li>
            <li> recomendo good purchase ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, very effective, and a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does an excellent job of drying and straightening hair in one step.</li>
            <li> It is the best solution for drying your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this!!!  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this iron.  </li>
            <li> I love the wet-to-straight!</li>
            <li> Love this item!</li>
            <li> automatic shut-off is an amazing feature which I didn&#x27;t appreciate until I lived with girls in college..</li>
            <li> I liked this iron a lot.</li>
            <li> It smoothed it out so nicely and even made it look longer.  </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with this invention</li>
            <li> and have used it consistently and been happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with Conair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this one was as good as the S2044 as you can&#x27;t regulate the temperature and the ceramic plates don&#x27;t provide adequate coverage on the iron itself.  </li>
            <li> I am getting a better quality straightner for Christmas and will be replacing this one for sure.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this 1 inch version.  </li>
            <li> This is not am improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I just can&#x27;t give this item a more favorable rating.</li>
            <li> A button would have been a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it creates more static than the one I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> it works love it</li>
            <li> and when I tried to use this after just towel drying my hair, it made my hair look even more frizzy and took all of the shine out of it.  </li>
            <li> I think more irons need a clamp lock.     </li>
            <li> This is also more entertaining than a hair-dryer.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> although it works ok also I prefer the ceramic.</li>
            <li> I also have the Remington S2044 and love it.  </li>
            <li> This one is just okay, nothing you have to throw into your travel bag when you go out of town.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and I would never pay for a $100 straightener again after using it.</li>
            <li> Buying this straightener was kind of sketchy for me, because it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li> have had better products from remington.</li>
            <li> I have 2 things that I don&#x27;t love about this hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> price 120$&lt;br /&gt;its good for ppl that wants a cheap and good one</li>
            <li> I think if you have fine or straight hair, this might be a great tool for saving time and protecting your hair from too many steps.  </li>
            <li> It works best and fastest when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s best to use this on damp, rather than wet, hair.  </li>
            <li> The grip is good, and it&#x27;s very durable.       </li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she loved it, we have always had a problem with her because she takes hours to be ready</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, even better than described!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other straighteners, but this one was not the best.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s easy to use, is ergonomically-designed</li>
            <li> I liked it at first</li>
            <li> If you are wanting an inexpensive iron, this may work fine for you.</li>
            <li> The iron works fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder-length hair and one sweep of the straightener</li>
            <li> it works well, works quickly and is safe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and her hair glides through easily.</li>
            <li> Handy, light, gets hot quick, locks &amp; kinda easy to use.</li>
            <li> If I had any criticism, it would be that after using the straightener my hair is not quite as smooth as I&#x27;d like it to be.  </li>
            <li> It seems more effort than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic tool</li>
            <li> plus it makes it reflect light and look glossy.  </li>
            <li> But once I got it open, I was happy with the Remington straightener.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> For such a great price, I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 4 years</li>
            <li> wand gets very hot and it seems for me that the best results come when my hair is slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> i love love love this flat iron ..</li>
            <li> Also, after I use it, I notice that my hair remains looking clean for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair when wet, but when its damp and I straighten it, it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good simple straightener, no temperature controls</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad purchase for the price..</li>
            <li> But, a little bit of finishing cream, and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, easy to travel</li>
            <li> I tried the Remington straightener without using any other hair products--just washed my hair with shampoo--and it worked well and looked great.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still looking for a really good flat iron.  </li>
            <li> dries almost as quickly with this as it does with a blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li> It does work on wet hair as well (more like damp) but you will get the best results with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I know the above sounds like a lot of negatives, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> but overall, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot very quick so is fast to use and easier to use.</li>
            <li> This ceramic curling hair iron really made flat ironing my hair so much more tolerable and the results are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, that is HOT!</li>
            <li> So if you are one that has fine, hard to straighten hair this one works great.  </li>
            <li> but my wife older straightener are better but higher</li>
            <li> I have had many times where it grabs my hair and rips it near the root.</li>
            <li> oh so worth it)</li>
            <li> Having been impressed with Remington&#x27;s products in the past, I jumped at the chance to try out their new wet/dry hair straightener.</li>
            <li> i own this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The heat makes my hair feel very sticky, even though clean, and I must admit</li>
            <li> It totally worked, now we wait less time :-D</li>
            <li> Nice long cord too.</li>
            <li> While impressive, I suppose, my previous flat irons would heat up with a microchip in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an improvement from the old 2-inch version, because the older version had the controls for temperature on top of the handle, and I would often push them accidentally while using the straightener.  </li>
            <li> I used this the first time on damp hair, and was amazed how stick-straight it made it.  </li>
            <li> However she really liked the locking closed feature that this has.</li>
            <li> It makes ironing hair a bit faster by being able to take a larger section of hair.     </li>
            <li> and so I am always concerned about using anything hot on my hair  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it was on a day I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and it had product in it from the day before to keep my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> I get a soft smooth look</li>
            <li> This straightener works great, it grips small sections of hair really well.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a Helen of Troy and my hair didn&#x27;t react much to it!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have the exact model she wanted, so she went ahead and bought this one instead.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Now with this, she can safely straighten and dry her hair right after towel drying her hair.  </li>
            <li> I love using a flat iron on my curly hair to make it not so frizzy and un-brushed looking</li>
            <li> I think the whole idea of a wet to dry iron is brilliant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off letting my hair dry</li>
            <li> She has much better luck working with hair when it&#x27;s damp and was always worried about damaging the straightener when her hair wasn&#x27;t absolutely dry</li>
            <li> After trying it on dry hair without any better results this straightener met the fate of the drawer never to be seen again.</li>
            <li> I had bought the newer wet2straight straightener and you must do large chunks of hair to get it straightened, and it still doesn&#x27;t straighten well.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the same one but only better!</li>
            <li> have really curly hair and it makes my hair so straight in seconds.</li>
            <li> My impressions about the iron are mixed and will be detailed in the convenient pro/con list below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It saves her so much time.  </li>
            <li> and i like to wear my hair straight sometimes</li>
            <li> it got really straight</li>
            <li> I would have rather spent more money on one that would have worked.</li>
            <li> My hair is still straight at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it too much</li>
            <li> but it don&#x27;t slides very well.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait too much.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> She said she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> too much hassle</li>
            <li> I found this to be very affordable and also satisfies my needs.</li>
            <li> She said he hair stayed straight all day, even though she didn&#x27;t use any gel.</li>
            <li> ( I was more worried about damage to her with the other</li>
            <li> when straightening hair it takes a lot more &amp;#34;muscle&amp;#34; than with other ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Remington Wet 2 Straight Straighteners.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this particular straightener before, but not through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Very durable...was packed with heavy weight on top and not a scratch...dropped on floor and no chipping occurred.</li>
            <li> I know that it doesn&#x27;t have many temperature settings, but most of the time we only use one setting in our irons (flat or curling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it last a long time since we really like it.  </li>
            <li> but it thankfully doesn&#x27;t go this high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The iron does not allow you to dial a temperature but performs at a high heat setting.  </li>
            <li> lock is easy to use and helps keep it from taking up extra space on her side of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The wet or dry feature is her favorite feature by far though.</li>
            <li> that with a twist of the wand adds a little curve to the bottom, making for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> choice when choosing a new straightener.</li>
            <li> While the concept of a straightener being able to straighten your wet hair seems very cool, the heat/steam settings are very confusing (ranging on a scale of 1-30 based on cool, damp, or dry), and the steam really bothers me.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t feel like this got hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first, or even second,</li>
            <li> Since she&#x27;s usually pretty rushed getting out of the house in the morning, it&#x27;s a big help.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it works so quickly when wet, I rarely use the dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up quickly, from off to wet setting</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit itself gets really hot, on the outside as well so don&#x27;t grab the top, especially while using, those little holes let out the steam and will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, properly Iam not happy with the product, but My girlfriend loves this Hair Straightener , now it takes more time to get ready!!</li>
            <li> like my old one (Conair).</li>
            <li> im natural</li>
            <li> The plates don&#x27;t heat up enough and it leaves my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates carried the heat well; my hair felt soft after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> The directions say to direct the steam away from your head, but then there&#x27;s the issue of the hand that&#x27;s trying to comb the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the hair remained completely straight for the next 2 days, until I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really short hair, so I was trying to find a straightener that would straighten it and keep it straight all day.</li>
            <li> I can notice the difference from her old straightener.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Great idea that actually works (slightly).&lt;br /&gt;- Works better straightening dry hair than wet or damp hair, which when used wet left my thick and unruly hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took 15 minutes for my teen daughter to get all her hair done from wet to a nice sleek dry.  </li>
            <li> everything was fine except for the fact that the labels that say wet and dry on the switch rubbed off so now</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ll use my other straightener as my main one, I still will break this out any time I may need to straighten my hair fast after having washed it.</li>
            <li> and she liked the lock feature; her only complaint is that you can&#x27;t select a specific temperature, which could be done on her old straightener.</li>
            <li> still not the smooth gloss that I get from my regular flat iron, plus it took over an hour to let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I think burns are a little more likely with this flat iron because of the steam.  </li>
            <li> It did dry my hair really fast</li>
            <li> A few points to note:  - You can&#x27;t adjust the temperature, and this device gets VERY hot.  </li>
            <li> I like how it&#x27;s broad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it is so much better with wet hair, as it does not seem to help wet hair dry.</li>
            <li> S9520 Salon Collection Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 2 Inch\\&quot; which she has used for years and absolutely loves.</li>
            <li> My wife has very curly hair and needed a new straightener as her old one was misplaced during a recent move.</li>
            <li> But if you have thick, curly and/or wavy hair like mine, you&#x27;re better off just sticking with a hair dryer, using silicone protectant and a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive straighteners in the past and they were not even half as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> So the next time, I let my hair air dry until almost completely dry and tried again, it was a little better but</li>
            <li> The newer versions of both the 1 inch and 2 inch Wet 2 Straight straighteners have the controls on the side of the handle, and I don&#x27;t have the same problem.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few passes with this straightener to really do anything to my hair, and because of that, it leaves my hair soft, but not silky.</li>
            <li> MY hair is thick and wavy, and the wavy part is a kind of uneven waviness which makes it puff out away from my head</li>
            <li> Using this made my hair go dry and damaged my hair very much and it hardly straightened the hair and not to forget my hair is never hard rather its soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Barrel stays cool and it&#x27;s hard to burn yourself with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the wet option a few times but even if it says it&#x27;s meant for wet hair, I worry about damaging my hair more than I already am, so I keep that to a minimum.</li>
            <li> , isn&#x27;t heavy, straightens her hair on the first go</li>
            <li> It takes me about 10 minutes to dry my completely drenched hair.</li>
            <li> Oh and it takes 20 minutes to cool off, at least enough to lock it and put it away without any issues.  </li>
            <li> This one does the job, it gets your hair straight and dry from completely wet.</li>
            <li> and I would say it takes maybe 5-7 minutes from wet to straight and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather wait for my hair to dry or be damp than straighten it wet.</li>
            <li> B0009V1YR8 Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron]], so I was prepared to not like this product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always concerned about the damage I might be causing with the hair dryer then the heat from the flat iron</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this flat iron because it has no control setting.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have long enough hair to review this product, I asked my daughter what she thinks of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one allowed you to select the heat level by going up or down numbers.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s easier for me to just dry my hair with a blow dryer, then straighten with a regular flat iron,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I&#x27;m used to, so it&#x27;s more awkward to handle, especially while evading the steam vents.</li>
            <li> I have only tried straightening dry hair</li>
            <li> I picked this up for her from Vine, and I got this specific one because she was always complaining about how she had to wait for her hair to almost completely dry before she could use her straightener.</li>
            <li> I got my first one a few years ago--it was a little bigger (maybe 2 inches?)</li>
            <li> This makes it so that the straightener actually rips single strands of hair out, one by one, as you &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; it through your hair.</li>

            <li> I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t like that it only had two settings dry or wet.</li>
            <li> When I got this one, it only had a wet and dry setting.</li>
            <li> It only has two choices; Wet &amp; Dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this on myself (medium fine hair and thin) and my teen daughter (medium coarse hair and thick).  </li>
            <li> This straightener achieves a level of straight I am not able to get with other straighteners.</li>
            <li> Okay, that was a little disturbing, but it works.</li>
            <li> They would call me in the middle of the day and ask me to check if their straightener was on, and if so, to turn it off which is not only a massive waste of electricity but also a fire hazard!</li>
            <li> but it takes FOREVER to get your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I never get it totally dry with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> And, while I&#x27;m curling my hair with the wet2dry iron, I&#x27;m also getting it dry.  </li>
            <li> Before this, my wife would have to fan dry her hair if she wanted it to dry it in any way faster than just \\&quot;air\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The ends can get quite dry</li>
            <li> , I tought that by buying her this straightener I could do the family a favor because she would not need to wait for her hair to be dry.</li>
            <li> Those other flat irons (Iso Pros) also had heat control, ranging from 250 degrees to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> straightener can be used both on wet hair and on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The wet to dry feature, WORKS</li>
            <li> If your hair is wet, then you move the button to wet, if your hair is dry, you move it to dry.</li>
            <li> I have found that the recessed plates make this iron less likely to come in contact with your skin creating accidental burns.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is very hard, very thick, and becomes so jagged you could easily slice open a finger.    </li>
            <li> Yes, you can use it on wet hair</li>
            <li> If I use the wet setting on damp hair, it creates lots of curls from the moisture.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE ON WET HAIR, i repeat.</li>
            <li> NEVER USE ON WET HAIR.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Things she liked:&lt;br /&gt;It heated faster than the other straighteners used in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy, so no hair straightener among the several I have tried ever managed to straighten it to a noticeable extent.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the iron it did have an unpleasant smell but that has subsided with use.  </li>
            <li> Now that it has been a few years of use, I have to say that I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I have a few complaints:    1.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relatively heavy straightener, I think.</li>
            <li> hands\\&quot; to get an idea of the unnatural stiff look I got from it.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is very thick and long.</li>
            <li> well I was just a little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> hate that it only has 2 &amp;#34;temperatures&amp;#34;, wet and dry.</li>
            <li> found a package so difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dries slowly.  </li>
            <li> Even with my thick, wavy hair, I don&#x27;t need it so hot.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick, wavy hair, that tends to get a halo of frizz.  </li>
            <li> Also, the plate seems very small.</li>
            <li> This iron is NOT good for those who need to straighten in a rush.    </li>
            <li> Not a good combination.  </li>
            <li> However, I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> After valiantly struggling with the plastic packaging for an embarrassing amount of time, I emerged victorious, if exhausted and disheveled, by the process.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thin</li>
            <li> The straightener doesn&#x27;t glide well down my hair, it sorta snags or catches, though not so bad it pulls my hair out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder how would it work on hard hair!!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have very thin hair, this is a time-consuming process.  </li>
            <li> Lesson learned. :(</li>
            <li> product comes in that horrible heat-sealed plastic that has to be opened with a can-opener or something.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, crummy, doesn&#x27;t work, Plus my stylist said these are terrible for your hair.</li>

            <li> its very good but not until you accidentally try to straighten your hair and your forgot that you had hairspray in it! LOL Happened to me so now I just bought one from shop rite that&#x27;s the same one but only better!</li>
            <li> I was given this as a replacement for my wider iron when I cut my hair shorter. I liked it at first but I think it was in comparison to my other iron. Now that it has been a few years of use, I have to say that I do not like it. Because of the fact that the plates do not go to the edges, your hair passes through the plastic as well and this pulls the hair. I have had many times where it grabs my hair and rips it near the root. This makes for (obvious) hair damage but it also makes my hair frizzy.   I am getting a better quality straightner for Christmas and will be replacing this one for sure.   If you are wanting an inexpensive iron, this may work fine for you.</li>
            <li> i own this flat iron. bought it 5 years ago and it works wonderful.i have really curly hair and it makes my hair so straight in seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Remington Wet 2 Straight Straighteners.  I got my first one a few years ago--it was a little bigger (maybe 2 inches?) and have used it consistently and been happy with it.  I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this 1 inch version.  It&#x27;s an improvement from the old 2-inch version, because the older version had the controls for temperature on top of the handle, and I would often push them accidentally while using the straightener.  The newer versions of both the 1 inch and 2 inch Wet 2 Straight straighteners have the controls on the side of the handle, and I don&#x27;t have the same problem.  If I had any criticism, it would be that after using the straightener my hair is not quite as smooth as I&#x27;d like it to be.  I have some fly-aways I have to deal with.  But, a little bit of finishing cream, and I&#x27;m good to go!  I would recommend this product and will continue to use it.  It saves time and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a much more expensive hair straightener for years [[ASIN:B0009V1YR8 Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron]], so I was prepared to not like this product.  I was wrong.  I used this the first time on damp hair, and was amazed how stick-straight it made it.  I have thick, curly hair and it looked like I stepped out of a salon.  Even my CHI doesn&#x27;t straighten that well!  A few points to note:  - You can&#x27;t adjust the temperature, and this device gets VERY hot.  I suppose that is the reason it straightens so well.  Because of this, I recommend a heat protectant spray before straightening, and refraining from using this iron every day.  - It&#x27;s best to use this on damp, rather than wet, hair.  Yes, you can use it on wet hair but it takes FOREVER to get your hair dry.  You have to keep passing the iron over the same section over and over.  Unless you have very thin hair, this is a time-consuming process.  - They say the plates are ceramic, but they aren&#x27;t that great quality. There is a scraping noise when I move the iron along a section of hair.  - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever in my entire life found a package so difficult to open.  It literally took me 15 minutes of hacking and pulling to remove this product.  The plastic is very hard, very thick, and becomes so jagged you could easily slice open a finger.    I know the above sounds like a lot of negatives, but I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  If you want stick-straight hair, try it!</li>
            <li> This iron has been a wonderful addition to the many tools I have for dealing with my hair.  Not only does it straighten, but you can use it to curl your hair too.  My hair is thick and dries slowly.  I never get it totally dry with the hair dryer.  But, using the wet3dry iron solves any problem I might have getting my hair to curl. And, while I&#x27;m curling my hair with the wet2dry iron, I&#x27;m also getting it dry.  I think the whole idea of a wet to dry iron is brilliant.</li>
            <li> I am unimpressed with this straightener. I don&#x27;t understand how it is so much better with wet hair, as it does not seem to help wet hair dry. Also, the plate seems very small. Although I don&#x27;t have long hair, I do have a lot of it. It seems more effort than it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;m better off letting my hair dry damp then styling, which is my current routine. This is not am improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I just can&#x27;t give this item a more favorable rating.</li>
            <li> My wife used this and it worked... sort of. She didn&#x27;t like that it only had two settings dry or wet. Her other straightener has a high/low setting. She didn&#x27;t feel like this got hot enough to do the job. However she really liked the locking closed feature that this has. She didn&#x27;t hate it, she just likes her other straightner better.</li>
            <li> Having been impressed with Remington&#x27;s products in the past, I jumped at the chance to try out their new wet/dry hair straightener. After valiantly struggling with the plastic packaging for an embarrassing amount of time, I emerged victorious, if exhausted and disheveled, by the process. My impressions about the iron are mixed and will be detailed in the convenient pro/con list below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used on both wet and dry hair (duh). Great idea that actually works (slightly).&lt;br /&gt;- Works better straightening dry hair than wet or damp hair, which when used wet left my thick and unruly hair slightly frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;- Auto shut-off after one hour. Great for the forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Only one temperature (375F), so no adjusting that, only the wet/dry switch. And let me tell you, that is HOT! I usually crank up my other iron for maximum straightening power but it thankfully doesn&#x27;t go this high. Even with my thick, wavy hair, I don&#x27;t need it so hot.&lt;br /&gt;- The straightener doesn&#x27;t glide well down my hair, it sorta snags or catches, though not so bad it pulls my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I&#x27;m used to, so it&#x27;s more awkward to handle, especially while evading the steam vents. This may or may not be a problem for others.&lt;br /&gt;- The switches are super hard to move and I&#x27;m always afraid of slipping and burning my hand when turning it off. A button would have been a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ll use my other straightener as my main one, I still will break this out any time I may need to straighten my hair fast after having washed it. The iron works fine but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first, or even second, choice when choosing a new straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy. If I use the wet setting on damp hair, it creates lots of curls from the moisture. Then it takes some time to straighten it. Also, it creates more static than the one I&#x27;m used to. I think it&#x27;s easier for me to just dry my hair with a blow dryer, then straighten with a regular flat iron, like my old one (Conair). I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with Conair. I&#x27;m returning the Remington.</li>
            <li> I liked this iron a lot. It heats up quickly and does an excellent job of drying and straightening hair in one step. Mine is about shoulder length and tends to want to wave, and I found it this straightener does the job. I don&#x27;t think you can beat it for the price. Very nice item.</li>
            <li> Before this, my wife would have to fan dry her hair if she wanted it to dry it in any way faster than just \\&quot;air\\&quot;.  Now with this, she can safely straighten and dry her hair right after towel drying her hair.  It saves her so much time.  She enjoys using it and thinks it&#x27;s great.  Affordable and well designed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the photo looked like the one I had and LOVED for years. When I got this one, it only had a wet and dry setting. My old one allowed you to select the heat level by going up or down numbers. This one does the job, it gets your hair straight and dry from completely wet. My hair is really thin and I would say it takes maybe 5-7 minutes from wet to straight and dry. Because it works so quickly when wet, I rarely use the dry setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly, from off to wet setting I would say it take 2 minutes max so I plug it in when I get out of the shower so it is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord seems plenty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself gets really hot, on the outside as well so don&#x27;t grab the top, especially while using, those little holes let out the steam and will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it and it does the job well I was just a little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be. Would make an excellent travel hair straightner for someone on the road a lot.</li>
            <li> i love love love this flat iron ..im natural and i like to wear my hair straight sometimes and my hair is kinky but afer just using this iron on my damp hair it got really straight it works love it</li>
            <li> I love using a flat iron on my curly hair to make it not so frizzy and un-brushed looking but I&#x27;m always concerned about the damage I might be causing with the hair dryer then the heat from the flat iron so when I saw this, I thought it might be a good solution and a time saver.  However, I have very thick hair and when I tried to use this after just towel drying my hair, it made my hair look even more frizzy and took all of the shine out of it.  So the next time, I let my hair air dry until almost completely dry and tried again, it was a little better but still not the smooth gloss that I get from my regular flat iron, plus it took over an hour to let my hair air dry so that&#x27;s not a time saver at all.  I think if you have fine or straight hair, this might be a great tool for saving time and protecting your hair from too many steps.  But if you have thick, curly and/or wavy hair like mine, you&#x27;re better off just sticking with a hair dryer, using silicone protectant and a regular flat iron.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this flat iron because it has no control setting. The plates don&#x27;t heat up enough and it leaves my hair very frizzy. I would have rather spent more money on one that would have worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other straighteners, but this one was not the best. I have a few complaints:    1. While the concept of a straightener being able to straighten your wet hair seems very cool, the heat/steam settings are very confusing (ranging on a scale of 1-30 based on cool, damp, or dry), and the steam really bothers me. I&#x27;d much rather wait for my hair to dry or be damp than straighten it wet. The heat makes my hair feel very sticky, even though clean, and I must admit, I didn&#x27;t think that was possible.    2. It takes about two minutes to heat up. While impressive, I suppose, my previous flat irons would heat up with a microchip in about 30 seconds. Those other flat irons (Iso Pros) also had heat control, ranging from 250 degrees to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. This iron is NOT good for those who need to straighten in a rush.    3. It takes a few passes with this straightener to really do anything to my hair, and because of that, it leaves my hair soft, but not silky. My hair looks dry and unhealthy, as opposed to using my (more expensive, but oh so worth it) Iso Professionals.     4. It&#x27;s a relatively heavy straightener, I think. I feel like I&#x27;m working out when I use it while standing for over thirty minutes.     There are good things as well:     1. I like that it has a lock. I think more irons need a clamp lock.     2. I like how it&#x27;s broad. It makes ironing hair a bit faster by being able to take a larger section of hair.     3. The grip is good, and it&#x27;s very durable.       Overall, I do not believe the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> well, properly Iam not happy with the product, but My girlfriend loves this Hair Straightener , now it takes more time to get ready!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic tool The best thing about it ts the wet-dry feature.  I have extremely long hair The ends can get quite dry and so I am always concerned about using anything hot on my hair  But this seemed to help rather than hinder the hair. It smoothed it out so nicely and even made it look longer.  MY hair is thick and wavy, and the wavy part is a kind of uneven waviness which makes it puff out away from my head and it appears unruly This tool makes your hair feel and look like silk plus it makes it reflect light and look glossy.  I am so thrilled with this invention</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a hair straightener before.  I have course layered shoulder-length hair with the bottom ends in ringlets if I don&#x27;t do anything with it it.  The first time I tried it was on a day I didn&#x27;t wash my hair and it had product in it from the day before to keep my hair from frizzing.  Not a good combination.  Think \\&quot;jazz hands\\&quot; to get an idea of the unnatural stiff look I got from it.  Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand gets very hot and it seems for me that the best results come when my hair is slightly damp.  I get a soft smooth look that with a twist of the wand adds a little curve to the bottom, making for a more natural look.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated this a 4 star if there was a way to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> My hair is still straight at the end of the day.  I have moderately thick, wavy hair, that tends to get a halo of frizz.  This eliminated the frizz halo.  I tried the Remington straightener without using any other hair products--just washed my hair with shampoo--and it worked well and looked great.  The ceramic plates carried the heat well; my hair felt soft after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dries almost as quickly with this as it does with a blow-dryer.  But with the blow-dryer, within hours my hair is starting to look wavy and lumpy again.  This is also more entertaining than a hair-dryer.  Who doesn&#x27;t want to hear their hair sizzling and see steam pouring off their head?  Okay, that was a little disturbing, but it works. I think burns are a little more likely with this flat iron because of the steam.  The directions say to direct the steam away from your head, but then there&#x27;s the issue of the hand that&#x27;s trying to comb the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in that horrible heat-sealed plastic that has to be opened with a can-opener or something.  But once I got it open, I was happy with the Remington straightener.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It works best and fastest when my hair is dry. I did not use ANY hair products such as hair spray, gel, mousse or anything of that nature and my hair is very thick and long. It stayed in place the entire day and even thru part of the next day til I took a shower.  I have a Remington Wet/straight but it has the metal plates instead of the ceramic and although it works ok also I prefer the ceramic.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once till now and I think it&#x27;s not bad. Handy, light, gets hot quick, locks &amp; kinda easy to use. Not a bad purchase for the price..</li>
            <li> I also have the Remington S2044 and love it.  That one is a Godsend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one at the same time and was comparing them.  I didn&#x27;t think this one was as good as the S2044 as you can&#x27;t regulate the temperature and the ceramic plates don&#x27;t provide adequate coverage on the iron itself.  This one is just okay, nothing you have to throw into your travel bag when you go out of town.  Get the S2044 instead!  [[ASIN:B000K7E2G6 Remington S2044 Damage Therapy Ceramic Hair Straightener with Teflon Fiber Plates]]</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this iron.  It takes about a minute for the plates to get to temperature (375) and it&#x27;s good to go.  I tried this on myself (medium fine hair and thin) and my teen daughter (medium coarse hair and thick).  Hair length is about 4 inches below shoulders and wavy for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took 15 minutes for my teen daughter to get all her hair done from wet to a nice sleek dry.  She loved it.  In my case, it took me half the time just because my hair is thinner.  I know that it doesn&#x27;t have many temperature settings, but most of the time we only use one setting in our irons (flat or curling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it last a long time since we really like it.  Oh and it takes 20 minutes to cool off, at least enough to lock it and put it away without any issues.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about this hair straightener. My hair is very thick and wavy, so no hair straightener among the several I have tried ever managed to straighten it to a noticeable extent. Even when I go to a salon, it takes a hair-dresser well over an hour to straighten my hair. I simply don&#x27;t have the time to do this for myself at home. Besides, I dislike using any hair care product on my hair because I think it can be detrimental to the hair&#x27;s health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used Remington&#x27;s Ceramic Hair Straightener, however, I was extremely impressed. I only used it for 15 minutes or so and applied no hair product but it straightened out my hair perfectly. And the hair remained completely straight for the next 2 days, until I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener can be used both on wet hair and on dry hair. I have tried both options and they are both great. Also, after I use it, I notice that my hair remains looking clean for a longer period of time. I don&#x27;t feel like it damages my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great straightener for people who don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on taking care of their hair. It&#x27;s easy to use, very effective, and a great value for the money. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive straighteners in the past and they were not even half as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> This straightener works great, it grips small sections of hair really well.  I had bought the newer wet2straight straightener and you must do large chunks of hair to get it straightened, and it still doesn&#x27;t straighten well.  So if you are one that has fine, hard to straighten hair this one works great.  It works so well I bought 2, one for me, and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it too much, I&#x27;m still looking for a really good flat iron.  It did dry my hair really fast but it don&#x27;t slides very well. It was cheap, I can&#x27;t wait too much.</li>
            <li> I got this last year and I just wanted to write in and say how awesome this STILL is. Especially for the price. DO NOT USE ON WET HAIR, i repeat. NEVER USE ON WET HAIR. although it may be made for that, you should never damage your hair like that and not doing so will prolong the life of this.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have long enough hair to review this product, I asked my daughter what she thinks of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things she liked:&lt;br /&gt;It heated faster than the other straighteners used in the past. Since she&#x27;s usually pretty rushed getting out of the house in the morning, it&#x27;s a big help.&lt;br /&gt;The lock is easy to use and helps keep it from taking up extra space on her side of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;The wet or dry feature is her favorite feature by far though. She has much better luck working with hair when it&#x27;s damp and was always worried about damaging the straightener when her hair wasn&#x27;t absolutely dry ( I was more worried about damage to her with the other models).&lt;br /&gt;She likes the heated surface too. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and her hair glides through easily.</li>
            <li> For such a great price, I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 4 years and I have no complaints. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair when wet, but when its damp and I straighten it, it works great. The steam from other straighteners may burn you, where the steam goes up and out with this straightener. I absolutely love it, and I would never pay for a $100 straightener again after using it.</li>
            <li> I have really short hair, so I was trying to find a straightener that would straighten it and keep it straight all day. I ordered this one, because my friend has the same one, and she loves it. The wet to dry feature, WORKS VERY WELL. Buying this straightener was kind of sketchy for me, because it was so cheap.  One thing i don&#x27;t like, it doesn&#x27;t let you pick a level of heat. It only has two choices; Wet &amp; Dry. If your hair is wet, then you move the button to wet, if your hair is dry, you move it to dry. But, This is the best straightener i have ever had and i would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the wet-to-straight! I used to have a Helen of Troy and my hair didn&#x27;t react much to it! This straightener achieves a level of straight I am not able to get with other straighteners. I have very long hair and can finish in about 20 minutes or less and it lasts all day! It reduces frizz as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this particular straightener before, but not through Amazon.com. The straightener itself works great -- however, the newest version I bought from Amazon.com arrived defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the straightener will turn on, the plates are not properly aligned. The tips of the straightener come together, but not the rest of the plates. This makes it so that the straightener actually rips single strands of hair out, one by one, as you &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; it through your hair. It&#x27;s terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually really, really pleased with Amazon.com purchases, but I&#x27;m sad about this straightener. I mistakenly threw away the packaging, so I can&#x27;t return it. Lesson learned. :(</li>
            <li> everything was fine except for the fact that the labels that say wet and dry on the switch rubbed off so now i dont know which switch is which</li>
            <li> My wife bought this because her sister had it. They didn&#x27;t have the exact model she wanted, so she went ahead and bought this one instead.  (It&#x27;s a newer model)  She said she absolutely loves it.  I can notice the difference from her old straightener.  Her hair stays a lot less frizzy now.</li>
            <li> good product. hate that it only has 2 &amp;#34;temperatures&amp;#34;, wet and dry. no option to up and down temperature. have had better products from remington. when straightening hair it takes a lot more &amp;#34;muscle&amp;#34; than with other ones. you need to press manually from the handle and from the plates as well. too much hassle</li>
            <li> I have 2 things that I don&#x27;t love about this hair straightener.  1) you can&#x27;t control the temp 2) the ceramic plates don&#x27;t go to the edge of the frame so your hair is pulling accross the plasic housing.  I won&#x27;t purchase another of these when this one goes, but will look for something else.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very durable...was packed with heavy weight on top and not a scratch...dropped on floor and no chipping occurred. Gets very hot very quick so is fast to use and easier to use.</li>
            <li> This ceramic curling hair iron really made flat ironing my hair so much more tolerable and the results are AMAZING. Works great on extentions as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking to spend less on a hair straightener as I don&#x27;t use one alot. I found this to be very affordable and also satisfies my needs. I have only tried straightening dry hair so I can only comment on that. I have fine, shoulder-length hair and one sweep of the straightener was enough to straighten it. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> (Ghost Written by my Wife, who actually has lots of hair) The Remington Hair Straightener has outperformed other straighteners I have owned.  Although it is a heavier iron, I do not notice it when I am styling my hair.  The iron does not allow you to dial a temperature but performs at a high heat setting.  I would like it if I could select the temperature, however.  I have found that the recessed plates make this iron less likely to come in contact with your skin creating accidental burns.  The first few times I used the iron it did have an unpleasant smell but that has subsided with use.  I have only used this straightener in the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; setting but overall, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, even better than described!! Will definitely use this seller again!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I think I ordered this 3 or 4 years ago- I am still using it now and it works great. It&#x27;s a good simple straightener, no temperature controls but you do have the wet/dry option. I&#x27;ve used the wet option a few times but even if it says it&#x27;s meant for wet hair, I worry about damaging my hair more than I already am, so I keep that to a minimum. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic shut-off is an amazing feature which I didn&#x27;t appreciate until I lived with girls in college.. They would call me in the middle of the day and ask me to check if their straightener was on, and if so, to turn it off which is not only a massive waste of electricity but also a fire hazard!</li>
            <li> Fue el regalo perfecto para mi esposa, fue justo lo que me pidi&amp;oacute;, es peque&amp;ntilde;o practico y facil de usar, el material es resistente y su planchas de cer&amp;aacute;mica calientan lo justo para realizar el trabajo.</li>
            <li> Good for the price but my wife older straightener are better but higher price 120$&lt;br /&gt;its good for ppl that wants a cheap and good one</li>
            <li> muy bueno todo ,envio rapido  buen precio buena cualidad recibido mas o menos en el tiempo previsto&lt;br /&gt;los recomendo good purchase ....ok</li>
            <li> Terrible, crummy, doesn&#x27;t work, Plus my stylist said these are terrible for your hair. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife has very curly hair and needed a new straightener as her old one was misplaced during a recent move. I picked this up for her from Vine, and I got this specific one because she was always complaining about how she had to wait for her hair to almost completely dry before she could use her straightener. Well, she loves this one. She says it&#x27;s easy to use, is ergonomically-designed, isn&#x27;t heavy, straightens her hair on the first go and she liked the lock feature; her only complaint is that you can&#x27;t select a specific temperature, which could be done on her old straightener. She said he hair stayed straight all day, even though she didn&#x27;t use any gel. She was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectation. Using this made my hair go dry and damaged my hair very much and it hardly straightened the hair and not to forget my hair is never hard rather its soft and supple. I wonder how would it work on hard hair!!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener for under $20 - it works well, works quickly and is safe.  It does work on wet hair as well (more like damp) but you will get the best results with dry hair.  Barrel stays cool and it&#x27;s hard to burn yourself with it.  Nice long cord too.</li>
            <li> My wife tried to use this on her damp hair after toweling off after a shower. She was not impressed having to go over the same parts of her hair many times and was still not happy with the results of the straightening. After trying it on dry hair without any better results this straightener met the fate of the drawer never to be seen again. She went back to her \\&quot;Remington S9520 Salon Collection Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 2 Inch\\&quot; which she has used for years and absolutely loves. She advises skipping this one and getting the S9520.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this!!!  Use it every day and night and never shows any signs of damage.  Can&#x27;t live without it :)</li>
            <li> I bought these item about 5 years ago at Walmart. It is the best solution for drying your hair quickly. It takes me about 10 minutes to dry my completely drenched hair. Love this item!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she loved it, we have always had a problem with her because she takes hours to be ready, I tought that by buying her this straightener I could do the family a favor because she would not need to wait for her hair to be dry. It totally worked, now we wait less time :-D</li>
