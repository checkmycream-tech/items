            <li>why is it that all the best products get discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>My skin looked great while using this</li>
            <li>This is a great product--</li>
            <li>It also does a great job evening out my skin without covering it up.</li>
            <li>This feels like nothing is on my face but looks great.</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still holding up looking great.  </li>
            <li>Primer works great with this though and setting it with a setting powder.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing value!</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li>This one by Lumene came up while researching good ones and since the price was great on Amazon (I think around 8 or 9 bucks when I bought it)</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have time, or forget powder, it looks great on it&#x27;s own too.</li>
            <li>It has the perfect light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>I loved that.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>That would be a good test.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price and excellent product.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, combo skin and bought the light color.</li>
            <li>I have found most of the products I have tried from them are great, but if you have problem skin this probably isn&#x27;t the one to try.</li>
            <li>Amazing if you are fair skinned, looking for something to even out your skin tone (ie hide the red/darker spots), but don&#x27;t want to look like you have caked on 3 inches of make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly amazed at how good this thing is.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t hurt anything&amp;#34; and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love this brand!</li>
            <li>This stuff is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>This CC cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I honestly can&#x27;t compare it to others</li>
            <li>I liked the coverage</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for my skin and blends really well.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice color (no orange undertones)</li>
            <li>(I do not use foundation over it, just on its own) and pass by a mirror, I do a double-take, because my skin looks so nice.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice and the texture is a bit runny.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and not so many wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, the product was as described, and the price was great.</li>
            <li>Love love it!</li>
            <li>I am 43 and have combination olive skin,I own alo t of lumene products and love all of them,they are everything they say they</li>
            <li>I have tried a multitude of BB and CC creams, and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>It is almost to light for my fair skin</li>
            <li>This is light and has really good coverage.</li>
            <li>I purchased the light, and it blended with my complexion really good.</li>
            <li>Honestly I think it might look better on my face than my fav Peter Thomas Roth CC cream.  </li>
            <li>Lumene makes amazing products, and this may have worked great for others who don&#x27;t have to worry so much about clogged pores.</li>
            <li>This CC cream is light enough for my very fair skin, and gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>not SO good coverage, but overall, good!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the coverage</li>
            <li>love my Estee Lauder</li>
            <li>I am ordering more after I am done with this review</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more neutral.</li>
            <li>but ok.</li>
            <li>This cc cream was much better, I had it in medium and the shades are not comparable at all to the bb.</li>
            <li>My favorite product to use on my face feels light!</li>
            <li>Favorite cc cream ever.</li>
            <li>Its just ok.</li>
            <li>i love it feeling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the even tone this gives.  </li>
            <li>Love the texture and color.</li>
            <li>love this CC</li>
            <li>functions as a primer if you want more coverage with foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like my BB cream better.</li>
            <li>love it , gives good luminous look and does not look greasy perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The BB creme is much better.</li>
            <li>All of my co-workers love it too.</li>
            <li>Most lotions do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about using some sort of mineral powder on top because at the end of the day my face is shining from oil.</li>
            <li>I love this CC cream.</li>
            <li>This is perfect and even has spf in it for sunprotection, and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I read so many reviews, and decided on this product-- Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream.  </li>
            <li>It covers pretty good, and stays on most all of the day.  </li>
            <li>not too cool, not too warm....</li>
            <li>I wear it like a foundation with a light mineral powder on top.</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;ve found your perfect match, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned and have PINK undertones to your skin.  </li>
            <li>However they all loved it so much I went out and bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>If you are watching your $$ and need a good CC cream that really works, you&#x27;ve found it Lumene Time Freeze.</li>
            <li>Not only does this stuff go on easily when applied with my hands (washed first), but it feels nice &amp; light with surprisingly GREAT coverage!!</li>
            <li>I lightly set it using my Estee Lauder Double Wear Powder and it takes me about 2-3 min to get my full coverage now :D</li>
            <li>It blends SO easily</li>
            <li>When I put the CC cream directly on my freshly washed skin it covered perfectly and took care of my red splotchy-ness.  </li>
            <li>It did make my skin seem brighter and more corrected natural skin wise</li>
            <li>The light shade is so light that it can be used only by people with very fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a beautiful cc cream.</li>
            <li>But where it may be lacking in full 12hr coverage like revlon colorstay, it makes up for in the fact that you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a mask of foundation, you just look like a more polished version of yourself.</li>
            <li>I loved the Lumenne BB product, and since the new fad was the CC Correction Cream I decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>The consistency also doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, making it wear well all day.</li>
            <li>I ordered the &#x27;light&#x27; and the shade is a good match to my skin so stick with your normal shade.</li>
            <li>I have the pail light one and its fine when you firat put it on</li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing, and gives amazing coverage, yet it light weight.</li>
            <li>this is the shade Light</li>
            <li>(i am a mix breed, with Caucasian being primary).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say that it color adjusts, but when I smooth it on, it vanishes into my skintone.  </li>
            <li>Too light color for me.</li>
            <li>I suggest a light moisturizer under it during the winter.</li>
            <li>Some days this is the only coverage i use and it works great.</li>
            <li>but it is lightweight and smooth.</li>
            <li>The absolute best finish I get is after I use a facial cleansing cloth and then apply this.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too, although frankly I would twice as much for a product this good.</li>
            <li>Love Love, my new fav!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, would reccomend to anyone and I don&#x27;t normally wear any makeup.</li>
            <li>First, the color is lovely....</li>
            <li>The coverage is nice medium (not sheer like most bb/cc creams)</li>
            <li>This provides amazing coverage for my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or heavy.</li>
            <li>It covers more like a foundation, but my skin looks so much more natural as if I am not even wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I was honestly surprised because my skin is very far from beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have been using a different brand of BB cream which I really like, but it is fairly costly and I needed something that was a bit more budget friendly without sacrificing quality.  </li>
            <li>it goes on ok, but can come out fast</li>
            <li>What really impresses me though, and convinces me to keep it in my makeup bag, is that it has been the best product at keeping my matte all day (I have very oily skin, especially in my tzone).  </li>
            <li>The coverage is perfect, not too thick.</li>
            <li>and I all received full size samples in our TestTube.</li>
            <li>I love it because at the end of the day I still don&#x27;t really feel like I have makeup on</li>
            <li>It is okay maybe as a primer, doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage and seems to fade really fast in the Texas humidity, will try in the winter maybe it will be better than</li>
            <li>This one hits the sweet spot.</li>
            <li>either.this makeup makes my skin look radiant and feels great,I use it when I have to make a quick run or when I wake up or go to bed when there is company over</li>
            <li>As i got older i realized that i needed something more moisturizing as my skin got dryer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light feeling and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and it lasts a long while, as you don&#x27;t use much at one time to cover your face in light, color correcting bliss!!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes getting ready easy.</li>
            <li>Good product but kind of a small tube for how much you need to use.</li>
            <li>This cc in medium was much lighter than the medium in bb, it took away all my redness and discoloration and matched my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, looks fresh and bright, not dewy or wet.</li>
            <li>I tend to prefer a more natural, makeup-less look, and this works well for that.</li>
            <li>I also use blush on my cheeks so that makes it look more natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right in my budget; and a far better quality than what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>just right, and melts effortlessly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>But when I use this product without a primer, it sits in my pores right after application.</li>
            <li>(whenever I don&#x27;t feel like doing a full face of makeup) and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but apparently the CC cream magically takes care of that.</li>
            <li>Good for the summer because it&#x27;s on the sheer side and let&#x27;s your natural skin look shine through.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, like putting spackling compound on your face, but covers just enough that it looks like you have naturally good skin.  </li>
            <li>Can be a little cakey, but does a good job evening the skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying!</li>
            <li>I set it with a sheer powder to help set it, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite for my combination red acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have tried so</li>
            <li>Still, a higher SPF wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal !</li>
            <li>From now on I will buy this instead of my old brand, and will not only save money but will look better too!</li>
            <li>It smells good, but not strong.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily face with very large skin pores, and I also tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I use it as a foundation/moisturizer, then put a light layer of powder over the top with blush and a little bronzer, and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>first I was unsure if the Light color would be a good match for my face, as I&#x27;m a fair skinned Hispanic woman with dark hair and eyes, and I was afraid it was going to be too pale for me, but as it turned out, it was a great match.</li>
            <li>The thing that makes it really stand out is how smooth and natural it looksd on my face.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me about 10-12 minutes to apply all my makeup - a huge time saver for the ones of us who leave home for work at 6am :-)</li>
            <li>but I have been searching for and trying cheaper alternatives and quicker ways to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a whole lot quicker</li>
            <li>and it just felt like I had too much stuff on. ?</li>
            <li>Really did not do much for the lines on side of mouth.</li>
            <li>it only comes in two colors: light and medium.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it really IS just that</li>
            <li>The cc creme is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>It does not take much to put this on.  </li>
            <li>and it lasts soooo much longer.</li>
            <li>and it still covers up the whole face.</li>
            <li>It has evened out my imperfections so much.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using a wet makeup sponge to apply my EL and though it didn&#x27;t take much time, I wanted something I could just throw on real quick.</li>
            <li>I live in a city that gets extremely hot during the summer, and yet, this CC cream still lasts all throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for 2 things - natural looking coverage and the right color.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other CC creams, but compared to the BB creams I have tried I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I have some redness around the bottom of my nose and a small amount in my cheeks and it does nicely on those areas.  </li>
            <li>the older I got.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something for older skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and not thrilled with them, but I had heard great things about CC Cream.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t rate it high as it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>This is so thin but provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>, it can also get a little cakey if u use to much, which is easy to do.</li>
            <li>only complaint about this product is that it only has an SPF of 20, which I guess it&#x27;s OK as I stay mostly indoors.</li>
            <li>This falls somewhere above a tinted moisturizer/BB cream but below a full liquid foundation, it won&#x27;t last all day if you have oily skin and won&#x27;t really cover darker undereye circles.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly amd blends well with other makeup i use.</li>
            <li>I use it as a foundation because the fair shade suits my thin, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way how it distributes all over my face, I use very little of it</li>
            <li>I have normal but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get nearly as oily as I normally do.</li>
            <li>It seems to last all day when the day is not too hot.  </li>
            <li>Now, a big difference between the two  is Peter Thomas Roths CC cream has more SPF and other goodies inside.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very oily with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and clogged pores but my skin is usually not very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I liked more expensive primer+mineral powder combination before that would cost up to $60 from Sephora but wouldn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>This product is completely inexpensive for what it provides.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it has a very noticeable fragrance.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 years old and a bit of a makeup junkie.  </li>
            <li>Chanel, MAC, Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, and a whole host of drugstore products.  </li>
            <li>I put my makeup on after I have dressed and finished with my hair as the last thing before I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li>much like if you put talc or something just after you applied your body lotion because you still have that sort of greasey film until it totally absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Before using this, I usually avoided wearing any type of foundation on my face, as they only made my pores more noticeable, settle into fine lines, make my face unbearably shiny/oily in the afternoon, and/or become a total mess in the summer heat.</li>
            <li>I have stopped wearing foundation, I only use this CC Cream and a light dusting of loose powder and it will last all day.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again and highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for this cvs discontinued product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen myself under the sun with a mirror, or at pictures  taken at night, and I look as natural as if I had a bare face.</li>
            <li>and I like it as much as my more expensive Smashbox Camera Ready BB cream.</li>
            <li>--I don&#x27;t think I use it enough to really receive any potential benefits--but</li>
            <li>so this is a good alternative to thick, heavy foundation.</li>
            <li>No other drugstore brand comes close to keeping oil at bay</li>
            <li>And just a general take it or leave it feeling instead of a</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only worn it indoors and haven&#x27;t tested it out in the heat and humidity although it feels like it will be up to the mid-west heat challenge at this time of the year.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency, not to thick or not to light.</li>
            <li>I decided to write this review only because a few random strangers came up to me to say that I have a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>This product has dried my cheek so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Warm per se, and I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s exactly cool either.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin anyway</li>
            <li>This spreads and covers very well with just a little bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to replace it with one of the new line of BB creams due out January.</li>

            <li> lol</li>
            <li> My skin looked great while using this</li>
            <li> This is a great product--</li>
            <li> It also does a great job evening out my skin without covering it up.</li>
            <li> This feels like nothing is on my face but looks great.</li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still holding up looking great.  </li>
            <li> Primer works great with this though and setting it with a setting powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing value!</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li> This one by Lumene came up while researching good ones and since the price was great on Amazon (I think around 8 or 9 bucks when I bought it)</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have time, or forget powder, it looks great on it&#x27;s own too.</li>
            <li> It has the perfect light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I loved that.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> That would be a good test.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price and excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, combo skin and bought the light color.</li>
            <li> I have found most of the products I have tried from them are great, but if you have problem skin this probably isn&#x27;t the one to try.</li>
            <li> Amazing if you are fair skinned, looking for something to even out your skin tone (ie hide the red/darker spots), but don&#x27;t want to look like you have caked on 3 inches of make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly amazed at how good this thing is.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t hurt anything&amp;#34; and boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> Love this brand!</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> This CC cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> so I honestly can&#x27;t compare it to others</li>
            <li> I liked the coverage</li>
            <li> The color is perfect for my skin and blends really well.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice color (no orange undertones)</li>
            <li> (I do not use foundation over it, just on its own) and pass by a mirror, I do a double-take, because my skin looks so nice.  </li>
            <li> The color is nice and the texture is a bit runny.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and not so many wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, the product was as described, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Love love it!</li>
            <li> I am 43 and have combination olive skin,I own alo t of lumene products and love all of them,they are everything they say they</li>
            <li> I have tried a multitude of BB and CC creams, and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> It is almost to light for my fair skin</li>
            <li> This is light and has really good coverage.</li>
            <li> I purchased the light, and it blended with my complexion really good.</li>
            <li> Honestly I think it might look better on my face than my fav Peter Thomas Roth CC cream.  </li>
            <li> Lumene makes amazing products, and this may have worked great for others who don&#x27;t have to worry so much about clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This CC cream is light enough for my very fair skin, and gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> not SO good coverage, but overall, good!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the coverage</li>
            <li> love my Estee Lauder</li>
            <li> I am ordering more after I am done with this review</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more neutral.</li>
            <li> but ok.</li>
            <li> This cc cream was much better, I had it in medium and the shades are not comparable at all to the bb.</li>
            <li> My favorite product to use on my face feels light!</li>
            <li> Favorite cc cream ever.</li>
            <li> Its just ok.</li>
            <li> i love it feeling.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with the even tone this gives.  </li>
            <li> Love the texture and color.</li>
            <li> love this CC</li>
            <li> functions as a primer if you want more coverage with foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like my BB cream better.</li>
            <li> love it , gives good luminous look and does not look greasy perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The BB creme is much better.</li>
            <li> All of my co-workers love it too.</li>
            <li> Most lotions do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about using some sort of mineral powder on top because at the end of the day my face is shining from oil.</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream.</li>
            <li> This is perfect and even has spf in it for sunprotection, and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I read so many reviews, and decided on this product-- Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream.  </li>
            <li> It covers pretty good, and stays on most all of the day.  </li>
            <li> not too cool, not too warm....</li>
            <li> I wear it like a foundation with a light mineral powder on top.</li>
            <li> - you&#x27;ve found your perfect match, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned and have PINK undertones to your skin.  </li>
            <li> However they all loved it so much I went out and bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> If you are watching your $$ and need a good CC cream that really works, you&#x27;ve found it Lumene Time Freeze.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff go on easily when applied with my hands (washed first), but it feels nice &amp; light with surprisingly GREAT coverage!!</li>
            <li> I lightly set it using my Estee Lauder Double Wear Powder and it takes me about 2-3 min to get my full coverage now :D</li>
            <li> It blends SO easily</li>
            <li> When I put the CC cream directly on my freshly washed skin it covered perfectly and took care of my red splotchy-ness.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin seem brighter and more corrected natural skin wise</li>
            <li> The light shade is so light that it can be used only by people with very fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a beautiful cc cream.</li>
            <li> But where it may be lacking in full 12hr coverage like revlon colorstay, it makes up for in the fact that you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a mask of foundation, you just look like a more polished version of yourself.</li>
            <li> I loved the Lumenne BB product, and since the new fad was the CC Correction Cream I decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> The consistency also doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, making it wear well all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &#x27;light&#x27; and the shade is a good match to my skin so stick with your normal shade.</li>
            <li> I have the pail light one and its fine when you firat put it on</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, and gives amazing coverage, yet it light weight.</li>
            <li> this is the shade Light</li>
            <li> (i am a mix breed, with Caucasian being primary).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say that it color adjusts, but when I smooth it on, it vanishes into my skintone.  </li>
            <li> Too light color for me.</li>
            <li> I suggest a light moisturizer under it during the winter.</li>
            <li> Some days this is the only coverage i use and it works great.</li>
            <li> but it is lightweight and smooth.</li>
            <li> The absolute best finish I get is after I use a facial cleansing cloth and then apply this.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too, although frankly I would twice as much for a product this good.</li>
            <li> Love Love, my new fav!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, would reccomend to anyone and I don&#x27;t normally wear any makeup.</li>
            <li> First, the color is lovely....</li>
            <li> The coverage is nice medium (not sheer like most bb/cc creams)</li>
            <li> This provides amazing coverage for my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or heavy.</li>
            <li> It covers more like a foundation, but my skin looks so much more natural as if I am not even wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I was honestly surprised because my skin is very far from beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different brand of BB cream which I really like, but it is fairly costly and I needed something that was a bit more budget friendly without sacrificing quality.  </li>
            <li> it goes on ok, but can come out fast</li>
            <li> What really impresses me though, and convinces me to keep it in my makeup bag, is that it has been the best product at keeping my matte all day (I have very oily skin, especially in my tzone).  </li>
            <li> The coverage is perfect, not too thick.</li>
            <li> and I all received full size samples in our TestTube.</li>
            <li> I love it because at the end of the day I still don&#x27;t really feel like I have makeup on</li>
            <li> It is okay maybe as a primer, doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage and seems to fade really fast in the Texas humidity, will try in the winter maybe it will be better than</li>
            <li> This one hits the sweet spot.</li>
            <li> either.this makeup makes my skin look radiant and feels great,I use it when I have to make a quick run or when I wake up or go to bed when there is company over</li>
            <li> As i got older i realized that i needed something more moisturizing as my skin got dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light feeling and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it lasts a long while, as you don&#x27;t use much at one time to cover your face in light, color correcting bliss!!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes getting ready easy.</li>
            <li> Good product but kind of a small tube for how much you need to use.</li>
            <li> This cc in medium was much lighter than the medium in bb, it took away all my redness and discoloration and matched my light skin tone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, looks fresh and bright, not dewy or wet.</li>
            <li> I tend to prefer a more natural, makeup-less look, and this works well for that.</li>
            <li> I also use blush on my cheeks so that makes it look more natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right in my budget; and a far better quality than what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li> just right, and melts effortlessly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> But when I use this product without a primer, it sits in my pores right after application.</li>
            <li> (whenever I don&#x27;t feel like doing a full face of makeup) and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but apparently the CC cream magically takes care of that.</li>
            <li> Good for the summer because it&#x27;s on the sheer side and let&#x27;s your natural skin look shine through.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, like putting spackling compound on your face, but covers just enough that it looks like you have naturally good skin.  </li>
            <li> Can be a little cakey, but does a good job evening the skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It is very drying!</li>
            <li> I set it with a sheer powder to help set it, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite for my combination red acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have tried so</li>
            <li> Still, a higher SPF wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal !</li>
            <li> From now on I will buy this instead of my old brand, and will not only save money but will look better too!</li>
            <li> It smells good, but not strong.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face with very large skin pores, and I also tend to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I use it as a foundation/moisturizer, then put a light layer of powder over the top with blush and a little bronzer, and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> first I was unsure if the Light color would be a good match for my face, as I&#x27;m a fair skinned Hispanic woman with dark hair and eyes, and I was afraid it was going to be too pale for me, but as it turned out, it was a great match.</li>
            <li> The thing that makes it really stand out is how smooth and natural it looksd on my face.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 10-12 minutes to apply all my makeup - a huge time saver for the ones of us who leave home for work at 6am :-)</li>
            <li> but I have been searching for and trying cheaper alternatives and quicker ways to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a whole lot quicker</li>
            <li> and it just felt like I had too much stuff on. ?</li>
            <li> Really did not do much for the lines on side of mouth.</li>
            <li> it only comes in two colors: light and medium.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it really IS just that</li>
            <li> The cc creme is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> It does not take much to put this on.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts soooo much longer.</li>
            <li> and it still covers up the whole face.</li>
            <li> It has evened out my imperfections so much.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using a wet makeup sponge to apply my EL and though it didn&#x27;t take much time, I wanted something I could just throw on real quick.</li>
            <li> I live in a city that gets extremely hot during the summer, and yet, this CC cream still lasts all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for 2 things - natural looking coverage and the right color.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other CC creams, but compared to the BB creams I have tried I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I have some redness around the bottom of my nose and a small amount in my cheeks and it does nicely on those areas.  </li>
            <li> the older I got.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something for older skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and not thrilled with them, but I had heard great things about CC Cream.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t rate it high as it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> This is so thin but provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> , it can also get a little cakey if u use to much, which is easy to do.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is that it only has an SPF of 20, which I guess it&#x27;s OK as I stay mostly indoors.</li>
            <li> This falls somewhere above a tinted moisturizer/BB cream but below a full liquid foundation, it won&#x27;t last all day if you have oily skin and won&#x27;t really cover darker undereye circles.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly amd blends well with other makeup i use.</li>
            <li> I use it as a foundation because the fair shade suits my thin, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way how it distributes all over my face, I use very little of it</li>
            <li> I have normal but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get nearly as oily as I normally do.</li>
            <li> It seems to last all day when the day is not too hot.  </li>
            <li> Now, a big difference between the two  is Peter Thomas Roths CC cream has more SPF and other goodies inside.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very oily with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and clogged pores but my skin is usually not very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I liked more expensive primer+mineral powder combination before that would cost up to $60 from Sephora but wouldn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> This product is completely inexpensive for what it provides.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it has a very noticeable fragrance.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am 48 years old and a bit of a makeup junkie.  </li>
            <li> Chanel, MAC, Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, and a whole host of drugstore products.  </li>
            <li> I put my makeup on after I have dressed and finished with my hair as the last thing before I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li> much like if you put talc or something just after you applied your body lotion because you still have that sort of greasey film until it totally absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Before using this, I usually avoided wearing any type of foundation on my face, as they only made my pores more noticeable, settle into fine lines, make my face unbearably shiny/oily in the afternoon, and/or become a total mess in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I have stopped wearing foundation, I only use this CC Cream and a light dusting of loose powder and it will last all day.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again and highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for this cvs discontinued product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen myself under the sun with a mirror, or at pictures  taken at night, and I look as natural as if I had a bare face.</li>
            <li> and I like it as much as my more expensive Smashbox Camera Ready BB cream.</li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t think I use it enough to really receive any potential benefits--but</li>
            <li> so this is a good alternative to thick, heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> No other drugstore brand comes close to keeping oil at bay</li>
            <li> And just a general take it or leave it feeling instead of a</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only worn it indoors and haven&#x27;t tested it out in the heat and humidity although it feels like it will be up to the mid-west heat challenge at this time of the year.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency, not to thick or not to light.</li>
            <li> I decided to write this review only because a few random strangers came up to me to say that I have a beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> This product has dried my cheek so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Warm per se, and I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s exactly cool either.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin anyway</li>
            <li> This spreads and covers very well with just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to replace it with one of the new line of BB creams due out January.</li>
            <li> It offers a little bit of coverage but won&#x27;t hide any major blemishes.  </li>
            <li> it has an odd (not bad, just odd) smell that goes away after a few seconds, and is still a bit darker than my nordic-white natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t particularly long lasting</li>
            <li> I was using another CC cream, and it left my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I do not have pink undertones, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of yellow either.</li>
            <li> I have some minor acne and scars, as well as redness, on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Works well to cover up the pink and red tones of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin developed breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally get them, more clogs than usual, dry red weird patches all over both cheeks, and overall my skin just looked unhealthy.</li>
            <li> however the biggest reason for only 3 stars is due to it having 0 staying power</li>
            <li> It also accentuates any dry patches you may have, so please exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Summer it can be combo, winter it can be dry.</li>
            <li> I have a habit of using green cover-up mixed in with a moisturizing cream, prior to applying CC cream.  </li>
            <li> Literally, every single time.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a higher SPF, but at least this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad like so many other creams do.</li>
            <li> but honestly you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> - FINALLY I can stop blending my foundation/cream down my neck in order to prevent &#x27;cheeto&#x27;-face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is to last on my skin for 10 hours+ without breaking down or settling into pores and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have to use a little bit, so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Usually Lumene products are a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with those product and will buy it consistently!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the thin consistency fool you - it really does provide coverage and moisture.</li>
            <li> This not only saves me time but now means I no longer have to buy green cover-up.  </li>
            <li> Dried my skin out instantly.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face looking like porcelain and not orange looking like other face creams.</li>
            <li> Even in extreme heat.</li>
            <li> So maybe I&#x27;ll use this one every other time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It is just a hint too dark for me</li>
            <li> The tube is kinda small, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The CC cream works well by itself, but I find setting it with a little powder</li>
            <li> cream-- gives just a little coverage to make skintone even, but appear as if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Again, it needs a little time to absorb and the color to come out.  </li>
            <li> I go for full-coverage everyday and with this stuff</li>
            <li> I wish I could have continued wearing it, but it was irritating my skin, especially over time.</li>
            <li> That said, my husband says he prefers it to a few lighter-shade foundations I have, because it &amp;#34;gives me some color and looks smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I wanted something that would help firm as well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily, acne prone, w/large pores, uneven tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of maekup</li>
            <li> I am the type of girl who can&#x27;t leave the house with out some type of coverage because my red face/acne makes me insecure.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure about it, you should just give it a try</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll compare to those).  </li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have that type of problem.</li>
            <li> so I tried a bunch of products in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use Peter Thomas Roths CC Cream.  </li>
            <li> By having that base of facial cream, the CC cream did not seem to give proper coverage.  </li>
            <li> like a fake tan its very strange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;becoming hard to find in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> and it is hard for me to find a bb or cc cream that doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint to it.</li>
            <li> one (half-star) complaint --</li>
            <li> At all times, there is at least one hormone zit somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Stays in place for at least 10 hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a &#x27;makeup line&#x27; and requires very little blending!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the medium was waaaay too dark for pasty redheaded me.</li>
            <li> I put it around my eyes (impossible with other creams as they were either too heavy/cakey or harsh) and it blends in well.</li>
            <li> I have 40-ish ridiculously oily skin, that is prone to breakouts, and have had no issues from using this product.  </li>
            <li> I know some of the other reviewers said it goes on badly.  </li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> It hides redness and imperfections without being as heavy as a foundation, and GLORY BE it does turn my skin orange!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> So, I am in this awkward, not quite 30 stage where i should use products which have an anti-wrinkle element to them.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of drugstore BB creams and after having so-so to bad results, I decided to try a CC cream.  </li>
            <li> But, I also have  had an annoying increased acne since having my daughter( years ago).</li>
            <li> and I would get that nasty cakey look.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it as a highlighter or under my eyes to conceal darkness. Use with primer. If no primer is used it seems too sheer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have never used any type of BB or CC cream before so I honestly can&#x27;t compare it to others BUT I will compare it to Estee Lauder&#x27;s Double Wear Foundation (Liquid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: Pale/Red, acne, oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Estee Lauder but I have been searching for and trying cheaper alternatives and quicker ways to get ready in the morning. I was using a wet makeup sponge to apply my EL and though it didn&#x27;t take much time, I wanted something I could just throw on real quick. After reading the reviews on this CC cream, I thought &amp;#34;why not? can&#x27;t hurt anything&amp;#34; and boy am I glad I did! Not only does this stuff go on easily when applied with my hands (washed first), but it feels nice &amp; light with surprisingly GREAT coverage!! I am the type of girl who can&#x27;t leave the house with out some type of coverage because my red face/acne makes me insecure. I go for full-coverage everyday and with this stuff, it&#x27;s a whole lot quicker a cheaper :D I am ordering more after I am done with this review lol The CC cream works well by itself, but I find setting it with a little powder helps it go ALL day and with oily skin, it helps take away the shine. I lightly set it using my Estee Lauder Double Wear Powder and it takes me about 2-3 min to get my full coverage now :D I bought this is the shade Light and it matches my skin perfectly (something I was struggling with the EL liquid). This product is completely inexpensive for what it provides. If you&#x27;re not sure about it, you should just give it a try like I did...you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I love it. It looks and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, the product was as described, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> not SO good coverage, but overall, good!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, would reccomend to anyone and I don&#x27;t normally wear any makeup.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes getting ready easy. I have several acne scars and a sun spot. This CC cream evens out my skin tone and provides a great base for my powder. If I don&#x27;t have time, or forget powder, it looks great on it&#x27;s own too. I wish it had a higher SPF, but at least this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad like so many other creams do.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and have combination olive skin,I own alo t of lumene products and love all of them,they are everything they say they are.they work!and don&#x27;t make me breakout either.this makeup makes my skin look radiant and feels great,I use it when I have to make a quick run or when I wake up or go to bed when there is company over so my skin still looks good and not tired.lumene dosent test on animals.great products!!!</li>
            <li> Can be a little cakey, but does a good job evening the skin tone.  I&#x27;m probably going to replace it with one of the new line of BB creams due out January.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  The consistency is bothersome -can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it is that bothers me about it.  I tried it under my BB cream and it just felt like I had too much stuff on. ?</li>
            <li> This product has dried my cheek so much! Yes it spreads well and all that... It is very drying! Did not work for me. I have normal but sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll stick with what I used before this product. Not for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing. Will definitely buy again and highly recommend to anyone. This product leaves my face looking like porcelain and not orange looking like other face creams. I wear it like a foundation with a light mineral powder on top.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong shade. This is why I don&#x27;t like buying these kinds of things on-line. Need to see it in person.</li>
            <li> Really did not do much for the lines on side of mouth. Was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> This CC cream is light enough for my very fair skin, and gives great coverage. Don&#x27;t let the thin consistency fool you - it really does provide coverage and moisture. The consistency also doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, making it wear well all day. I only have to use a little bit, so the tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Incredible.  Best CC cream that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I use it as a foundation because the fair shade suits my thin, sensitive skin. It&#x27;s never heavy or oily. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and so growing up I have always stuck with mineral powder foundations. Liquid was never my friend. As i got older i realized that i needed something more moisturizing as my skin got dryer the older I got. I have tried a multitude of BB and CC creams, and this one by far is the best. It has the perfect light to medium coverage. It smells good, but not strong. It blends SO easily, I can apply with fingers or beauty blender with ease. I set it with a sheer powder to help set it, and it lasts most of the day. I have very fair skin, ususally between W1 and W2 depending on if it is summer or winter. This matches me perfectly. It&#x27;s not Warm per se, and I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s exactly cool either. it&#x27;s more neutral. I do not have pink undertones, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of yellow either. (i am a mix breed, with Caucasian being primary). I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this stuff. I am on my second bottle, and about to buy my third. I will never use another product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and am very happy with it. I have very fair, combo skin and bought the light color. This spreads and covers very well with just a little bit. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, looks fresh and bright, not dewy or wet. It has no smell. It cost under 11$ and I like it as much as my more expensive Smashbox Camera Ready BB cream. They are comparable although this is not quite as matte as the Smashbox BB Cream. So far I&#x27;ve only worn it indoors and haven&#x27;t tested it out in the heat and humidity although it feels like it will be up to the mid-west heat challenge at this time of the year. I will definitely buy this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This is so thin but provides good coverage. My skin looked great while using this and I didn&#x27;t get nearly as oily as I normally do. Good for the summer because it&#x27;s on the sheer side and let&#x27;s your natural skin look shine through.</li>
            <li> I bought this Lumene CC cream in medium from a drug store. I like the consistency, not to thick or not to light. It goes on sheer. it only comes in two colors: light and medium. I have the medium. It is almost to light for my fair skin but ok. I have stopped wearing foundation, I only use this CC Cream and a light dusting of loose powder and it will last all day. That is perfect. SPF 20 is a big plus. The light shade is so light that it can be used only by people with very fair skin tone. Lumene is a Finnish product. There are lots of women there with very fair skins.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading about it on a blog. I was using another CC cream, and it left my face feeling dry. This is very moisturizing, and gives amazing coverage, yet it light weight. Amazing value! It&#x27;s right in my budget; and a far better quality than what I was expecting for the price. I only wish I had ordered one shade darker for the summer.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to breakouts and clogged pores but my skin is usually not very sensitive. I also want to say I did not like the bb cream from this brand, the medium shade of that was so orange and it just felt gross on my face. This cc cream was much better, I had it in medium and the shades are not comparable at all to the bb. This cc in medium was much lighter than the medium in bb, it took away all my redness and discoloration and matched my light skin tone. I loved that. I wish I could have continued wearing it, but it was irritating my skin, especially over time. My skin developed breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally get them, more clogs than usual, dry red weird patches all over both cheeks, and overall my skin just looked unhealthy. It also accentuates any dry patches you may have, so please exfoliate. Lastly, it has a very noticeable fragrance. All in all I liked the coverage but I can&#x27;t rate it high as it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself until I tried it.  As a fair-skinned, English/European/Irish mutt, I searched far and wide for a CC or BB cream that didn&#x27;t have that oh-so-common orange glow to it.  Not all of us are tan or have yellow undertones, okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it ladies - you&#x27;ve found your perfect match, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned and have PINK undertones to your skin.  I couldnt believe how well it blended in - FINALLY I can stop blending my foundation/cream down my neck in order to prevent &#x27;cheeto&#x27;-face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU LUMENE!</li>
            <li> This is the best cc cream I have ever used! I am obsessed with those product and will buy it consistently! I wear it alone and my skin looks beautiful. I have also worn this under foundation for a heavier coverage but honestly you will not be disappointed. A little goes a very long way.Thank you for making such a beautiful cc cream. My skin looks and feels like silk after.</li>
            <li> My favorite product to use on my face feels light!</li>
            <li> So, I am in this awkward, not quite 30 stage where i should use products which have an anti-wrinkle element to them. But, I also have  had an annoying increased acne since having my daughter( years ago). I loved the Lumenne BB product, and since the new fad was the CC Correction Cream I decided to give it a whirl. Lumene makes amazing products, and this may have worked great for others who don&#x27;t have to worry so much about clogged pores. If you do have the same problem you might be happier trying their BB products. I have found most of the products I have tried from them are great, but if you have problem skin this probably isn&#x27;t the one to try.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price and excellent product. Love this brand!</li>
            <li> Finally an affordable CC cream that works!  I have been using a different brand of BB cream which I really like, but it is fairly costly and I needed something that was a bit more budget friendly without sacrificing quality.  This CC cream is it.  The color is perfect for my skin and blends really well.  At first I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the coverage but it was user error.  I have a habit of using green cover-up mixed in with a moisturizing cream, prior to applying CC cream.  By having that base of facial cream, the CC cream did not seem to give proper coverage.  When I put the CC cream directly on my freshly washed skin it covered perfectly and took care of my red splotchy-ness.  This not only saves me time but now means I no longer have to buy green cover-up.  I have 40-ish ridiculously oily skin, that is prone to breakouts, and have had no issues from using this product.  From now on I will buy this instead of my old brand, and will not only save money but will look better too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product!</li>
            <li> Love love it! Favorite cc cream ever. No makeup needed.</li>
            <li> My oficcial opinion after using this for a week is MEH. Its just ok. It has a nice color (no orange undertones) it goes on ok, but can come out fast, it can also get a little cakey if u use to much, which is easy to do. The coverage is nice medium (not sheer like most bb/cc creams) however the biggest reason for only 3 stars is due to it having 0 staying power (it comes off on EVERYTHING!!) especially shirts and cell phones. This is after using a setting powder to help it stay! And just a general take it or leave it feeling instead of a i love it feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a great product-- it is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t cake up, settle in pores, look chalky, or overly settle into creases over the work day. It also does a great job evening out my skin without covering it up. I tend to prefer a more natural, makeup-less look, and this works well for that. I use it as a foundation/moisturizer, then put a light layer of powder over the top with blush and a little bronzer, and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;My one (half-star) complaint -- it has an odd (not bad, just odd) smell that goes away after a few seconds, and is still a bit darker than my nordic-white natural skin tone. I would like a lighter shade. That said, my husband says he prefers it to a few lighter-shade foundations I have, because it &amp;#34;gives me some color and looks smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of drugstore BB creams and after having so-so to bad results, I decided to try a CC cream.  This one by Lumene came up while researching good ones and since the price was great on Amazon (I think around 8 or 9 bucks when I bought it) I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it sporadically for months now (whenever I don&#x27;t feel like doing a full face of makeup) and I really like it.  It offers a little bit of coverage but won&#x27;t hide any major blemishes.  I have some minor acne and scars, as well as redness, on my cheeks and I&#x27;m satisfied with the even tone this gives.  It definitely cancels out redness.  What really impresses me though, and convinces me to keep it in my makeup bag, is that it has been the best product at keeping my matte all day (I have very oily skin, especially in my tzone).  No other drugstore brand comes close to keeping oil at bay (I don&#x27;t use department store brands so I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll compare to those).  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s brightening my skin and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s improving the texture or clarity of it--I don&#x27;t think I use it enough to really receive any potential benefits--but I like it and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Finally found a make up that covers and evens my skin. This feels like nothing is on my face but looks great.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out instantly. I have dry sensitive skin anyway so just this product didn&#x27;t work for my skin type</li>
            <li> Good product but kind of a small tube for how much you need to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this initially on Amazon, but am back for a refill.  Let me tell you why....&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 years old and a bit of a makeup junkie.  I probably have at least $500 worth of foundations in my makeup collection: Chanel, MAC, Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, and a whole host of drugstore products.  I don&#x27;t keep things that I don&#x27;t like, so as you can see, I like a lot...and they all have their uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who knew that this sub-ten-dollar CC cream would be among my favorites.  First, the color is lovely....not too cool, not too warm....just right, and melts effortlessly into the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t say that it color adjusts, but when I smooth it on, it vanishes into my skintone.  It is creamy and well-pigmented, and is best applied with fingers.  No need to pull out the beauty blender or a brush!  With primer or without, with powder or without, it performs the same....which is to last on my skin for 10 hours+ without breaking down or settling into pores and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wear this CC cream (I do not use foundation over it, just on its own) and pass by a mirror, I do a double-take, because my skin looks so nice.  Literally, every single time.  I think back, \\&quot;what did I put on this morning?  Oh yeah, the Lumene.\\&quot;  And it&#x27;s not just me.  Whenever I wear this, people compliment me on my beautiful skin.  Trust me, I don&#x27;t have beautiful skin.  Summer it can be combo, winter it can be dry. At all times, there is at least one hormone zit somewhere.  LOL  I have visible pores, plenty of lines, and discoloration.  This makes my skin look beautiful and radiant (but is NOT shiny!).  It is not heavy, like putting spackling compound on your face, but covers just enough that it looks like you have naturally good skin.  Honestly, it really IS just that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t lose anything by trying this, as it is so affordable.  Just do it!!!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Too light color for me.</li>
            <li> Works well. Perfect for combination skin types. I suggest a light moisturizer under it during the winter. Stays in place for at least 10 hours.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and color.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for this cvs discontinued product. I&#x27;ve tried the most expensive foundation bb and cc cream out there and this is my favorite for my combination red acne prone skin. I stocked up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this stuff. The coverage is perfect, not too thick. The price can&#x27;t be beat. Usually Lumene products are a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> Amazing if you are fair skinned, looking for something to even out your skin tone (ie hide the red/darker spots), but don&#x27;t want to look like you have caked on 3 inches of make up. This falls somewhere above a tinted moisturizer/BB cream but below a full liquid foundation, it won&#x27;t last all day if you have oily skin and won&#x27;t really cover darker undereye circles. But where it may be lacking in full 12hr coverage like revlon colorstay, it makes up for in the fact that you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a mask of foundation, you just look like a more polished version of yourself.</li>
            <li> This provides amazing coverage for my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or heavy. It goes on smoothly amd blends well with other makeup i use. Some days this is the only coverage i use and it works great.</li>
            <li> love this CC cream-- gives just a little coverage to make skintone even, but appear as if you&#x27;re not wearing makeup. functions as a primer if you want more coverage with foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;becoming hard to find in the drug stores. why is it that all the best products get discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping and good service.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and the texture is a bit runny. It tends to sit in your pores and look cakey if you have oily skin. I like my BB cream better.</li>
            <li> I boight this around a couple weeks ago and have been using it for a week I have the pail light one and its fine when you firat put it on but after a couple hours or four it turns orange on my skin.. like a fake tan its very strange. It did make my skin seem brighter and more corrected natural skin wise it does get oily through out the day but powder seems to help that</li>
            <li> love it , gives good luminous look and does not look greasy perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The BB creme is much better. The cc creme is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample.  I&#x27;m 49.  I&#x27;ve tried different brands and they seemed to &#x27;gum&#x27; up. I&#x27;ve learned the trick to these BB and CC creams is....you literally can&#x27;t use anything else on your skin before you apply these.  The absolute best finish I get is after I use a facial cleansing cloth and then apply this.  It makes my skin look airbrushed and flawless.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  I use it under my eyes as well. It seems to last all day when the day is not too hot.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything made that will hold up during the heat and not melt, although I walk for an hour outside and it&#x27;s still holding up looking great.  I haven&#x27;t tried it kayaking yet.  That would be a good test.  I ordered the &#x27;light&#x27; and the shade is a good match to my skin so stick with your normal shade.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great when I use a primer with it! Preferably Garnier&#x27;s Skin Renew 5 Second Blur Instant Smoother. But when I use this product without a primer, it sits in my pores right after application. I have normal to oily skin and I usually don&#x27;t have that type of problem. Primer works great with this though and setting it with a setting powder. It&#x27;s a very light feeling and it looks very natural. I didn&#x27;t know there was an age number on this it says &amp;#34;40&amp;#34; on the back and I&#x27;m 20 so I wasn&#x27;t expecting that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great flawless complexion when used with a primer.</li>
            <li> This CC cream is amazing. I&#x27;ve never tried a CC cream before but now I am hooked. I used to apply serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, primer and foundation every day. Now all I need is this CC cream. My co-workers and I all received full size samples in our TestTube. Unfortunately the medium was waaaay too dark for pasty redheaded me. However they all loved it so much I went out and bought the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one. It is just a hint too dark for me but it makes my skin look amazing! And it stays! All of my co-workers love it too.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and I was using the bb cream but I was looking for something for older skin.  I have fair skin and not so many wrinkles yet but I can see the looser skin starting to happen so I wanted something that would help firm as well.  I know some of the other reviewers said it goes on badly.  I put my makeup on after I have dressed and finished with my hair as the last thing before I am ready to go.  So I learned with the bb cream that if I put it on before I start my hair that it gives it time to absorb before I put on my blush and powder.  It does not take much to put this on.  Its lotion with tint so if you need a heavier coverage to go over blemishes of some sort then this won&#x27;t be for you.  I have some redness around the bottom of my nose and a small amount in my cheeks and it does nicely on those areas.  I don&#x27;t use under eye cover either.  Only this.  The tint also doesn&#x27;t come out immediately.  Again, it needs a little time to absorb and the color to come out.  Most lotions do.  When I used the bb cream I had the issue when I would put it on and not let it absorb it would get cakey much like if you put talc or something just after you applied your body lotion because you still have that sort of greasey film until it totally absorbs into your skin.  This is no different.  My powder would get in it and I would get that nasty cakey look.  Yuck.  I love it because at the end of the day I still don&#x27;t really feel like I have makeup on and my skin feels tighter.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, acne prone, w/large pores, uneven tone so I tried a bunch of products in the past. I liked more expensive primer+mineral powder combination before that would cost up to $60 from Sephora but wouldn&#x27;t last that long. I bought this one from Walgreens and now buying it here and it lasts soooo much longer. I love the way how it distributes all over my face, I use very little of it and it still covers up the whole face. I decided to write this review only because a few random strangers came up to me to say that I have a beautiful skin. I was honestly surprised because my skin is very far from beautiful. I have a lot of acne scarring and bumps but apparently the CC cream magically takes care of that. I also use blush on my cheeks so that makes it look more natural. I&#x27;m thinking about using some sort of mineral powder on top because at the end of the day my face is shining from oil. But that would be a problem with may creams/foundations on my skin. I put it around my eyes (impossible with other creams as they were either too heavy/cakey or harsh) and it blends in well. Then mascara and lip gloss and I&#x27;m done for the day. It usually takes me about 10-12 minutes to apply all my makeup - a huge time saver for the ones of us who leave home for work at 6am :-)</li>
            <li> This is light and has really good coverage. Love Love, my new fav!</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream. I am very fair skinned and it is hard for me to find a bb or cc cream that doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint to it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a &#x27;makeup line&#x27; and requires very little blending! This is perfect and even has spf in it for sunprotection, and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li> Works well to cover up the pink and red tones of my skin. Isn&#x27;t particularly long lasting but it is lightweight and smooth. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of maekup so this is a good alternative to thick, heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> I have been using BB cream for the last year. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and not thrilled with them, but I had heard great things about CC Cream. This is the first one I have tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to other CC creams, but compared to the BB creams I have tried I LOVE this. It covers more like a foundation, but my skin looks so much more natural as if I am not even wearing makeup. It has evened out my imperfections so much. I still use an under-eye concealer but that is it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is okay maybe as a primer, doesn&#x27;t offer much coverage and seems to fade really fast in the Texas humidity, will try in the winter maybe it will be better than</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly amazed at how good this thing is. I have a very oily face with very large skin pores, and I also tend to sweat a lot. I live in a city that gets extremely hot during the summer, and yet, this CC cream still lasts all throughout the day. Before using this, I usually avoided wearing any type of foundation on my face, as they only made my pores more noticeable, settle into fine lines, make my face unbearably shiny/oily in the afternoon, and/or become a total mess in the summer heat. Not so with this product, which I bought based on the glowing reviews I read here and elsewhere. This is the real deal for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was unsure if the Light color would be a good match for my face, as I&#x27;m a fair skinned Hispanic woman with dark hair and eyes, and I was afraid it was going to be too pale for me, but as it turned out, it was a great match. I&#x27;ve seen myself under the sun with a mirror, or at pictures  taken at night, and I look as natural as if I had a bare face. What else could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that it only has an SPF of 20, which I guess it&#x27;s OK as I stay mostly indoors. Still, a higher SPF wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an airbrushed look. It hides redness relatively well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal ! Stays all day. Even in extreme heat.</li>
            <li> I usually use Peter Thomas Roths CC Cream.  I absolutely love it.  However, it&#x27;s expensive and I wanted to try something else more affordable.  I read so many reviews, and decided on this product-- Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream.  I purchased the light, and it blended with my complexion really good. The tube is kinda small, but a little goes a long way.  It covers pretty good, and stays on most all of the day.  The thing that makes it really stand out is how smooth and natural it looksd on my face.  Honestly I think it might look better on my face than my fav Peter Thomas Roth CC cream.  Now, a big difference between the two  is Peter Thomas Roths CC cream has more SPF and other goodies inside.  So maybe I&#x27;ll use this one every other time.  If you are watching your $$ and need a good CC cream that really works, you&#x27;ve found it Lumene Time Freeze.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and it lasts a long while, as you don&#x27;t use much at one time to cover your face in light, color correcting bliss!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 different BB and CC creams at this point. I&#x27;ve been looking for 2 things - natural looking coverage and the right color. This one hits the sweet spot. It hides redness and imperfections without being as heavy as a foundation, and GLORY BE it does turn my skin orange!!!! It even smells good! The price is right too, although frankly I would twice as much for a product this good.</li>
