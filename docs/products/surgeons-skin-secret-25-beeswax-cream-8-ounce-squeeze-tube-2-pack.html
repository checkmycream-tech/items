            <li> I work in an ER where I wash my hands all the time. I also have eczema and dry hands. This is the ONLY cream I will use on my hands. I&#x27;ve used it for 10+ years. It is the best!!</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands and this HAS really helped heal all the cracks in my hands... would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I work in a research lab and I&#x27;m constantly gloving/ungloving and washing.. This is the only cream that keeps my hands moisturizer!</li>
            <li> do to age and medical problems my legs and feet get very dry, this is the only product that stays and works all day with one  application in the morning. I use it on cuts and scrapes  on hands and it works, keeps skin soft and ouches heals very quickly. If you have chafing  do to tight clothing or stretch marks, this is the body cream you want to try. fan damn tactics.</li>
            <li> received samples of the original  surgeons skin, and after a little searching found the site with all sorts of scents.&lt;br /&gt;great stuff with a light fragrance. try it you might like it!</li>
            <li> This beeswax cream really works good</li>
            <li> I love this product !!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry or cracked skin.  Works very well and is not greasy; absorbs into skin.  I had purchase this product before from QVC and it lasts for a very long time.  I have given tubes of this to friends to try because their skin gets so dry and cracks especially in the winter and they couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works.  Great for diabetics with skin problems.  Great price because one tube lasts for about a year for me.  Has a very light fresh lavender scent.  I even put it on my lips at night before I go to sleep; rub it into my hands, cuticles and elbows and on my feet under socks at night.  You wake up with nice soft skin.</li>
            <li> I love these lotions. I work in a hospital and am always washing my hands. So I take this lotion to work and always apply. Also a little goes a long way. These will last me for a few months before I have to re order. I love the lavender scent because it is not to much or little. So I can use this lotion for pretty much everything. Also my mother uses this and she has sensitive skin, therefore if you have sensitive skin this could totally work for you if you are just wanting a smelly good lotion for everyday. Hope this review helps !</li>
            <li> This is another version of Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret hand cream in lemon.  The scent is light and wonderful.  It stays with your skin for quite awhile without being greasy or sticky.  I have to wash my hands in a medical setting many, many times a day and use germicidal products which dry out my aging hands to the max.  This is what I use to re-moisturize them.  I love it and highly recommend it, both scents.</li>
            <li> I have used the almond product in the past and it helps my hands with cracks and severe dryness.  It is a heavy duty cream but that is what makes it work so well.</li>
            <li> Have used the unscented before but like this much better. Like the scent and the consistency is the same.  Good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Surgeon&#x27;s Secret hand creams for years and love them.  I do a lot of baking and need to wash my hands many, many times a day.  Surgeon&#x27;s Secret hand creams prevent the cracking and peeling of my skin from so much washing.  Also, they&#x27;re great in the winter time when your hands are affected by the cold and dry out.  You only need  to use very little and the product lasts for years.  I particularly like the Honey Almond scented cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Keeps skin smooth and you don&#x27;t need very much. A little goes a long way. Love it!</li>

            <li> The best cream I have used. I been using this for years.</li>

            <li> Nice smelling. Just wish would dry little more not leave little greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many hand creams and nothing worked.  I can stop looking now. I have recommended it to family and friends</li>
            <li> I have drawers full of creams and lotions to try and alleviate my severely dry skin on my hands and especially my dry and cracked cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;This product works best and works quickly. Have started several friends using it as well. We all agree on how good it is for hands. I think it would be too thick to use all over the body, but great for use on the feet, with socks put on over it.</li>
