            <li>Everything in the picture is there and works amazing for the price....</li>
            <li>but I thought it would have come with some kind of instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li>I have set up the machine perfectly and the needle will not move at all no matter how much I adjust it</li>
            <li>then it was estimated to, which was nice.</li>
            <li>:)i loved it</li>
            <li>All very cheap.</li>
            <li>however the ink is very cheap.</li>
            <li>No problems with the power supply although the foot peddle is very cheap.</li>
            <li>im super happy that this kit that is so inexpensive &amp; can give you so much!!!</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING ELSE IS OK.</li>
            <li>however I have order three guns from two different places and this was the best one.</li>
            <li>but I think with some information he would like it better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Great kit thank you so much for the help:-)</li>
            <li>u can&#x27;t beat it ,already done 4 tattoos look excellent, I would like to see shader tip put with the kit, but I would deff recommend this keit if your starting out even for the novice &amp; expert level...</li>
            <li>But it still would stop when the needle was attached to the top hat grommet.</li>
            <li>get better ink, that is all.</li>
            <li>I love the product, my boyfriend does all his work with this gun.</li>
            <li>I do wish there was more ink though.</li>
            <li>it is deff everything ive always wanted:)</li>
            <li>i love the machine itself ...</li>
            <li>Machine works good if you tune it right.</li>
            <li>but I got it all pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I had contacted the seller, in which the issue was resolved very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to transport as well.</li>
            <li>The piece should be easily removed for storage, cleaning, and replacing needles to avoid bending the needle when putting it on.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the product and got here EXTREMELY fast.</li>
            <li>While the allen wrenches are a little sucky, THIS IS A GREAT KIT!</li>
            <li>The needle didn&#x27;t fit in the nozzel 2.</li>
            <li>Kinda like when you touch two wires together, the power light didn&#x27;t come on and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I did manage to get it to fit with some help from someone tougher then myself and a hammer.</li>
            <li>I only did numbers and they came out great.  </li>
            <li>so if your looking for a cheap tattoo gun, then go to ebay.</li>
            <li>But overall, everything has been great.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know much about tattoo or tattoo guns but after reading alot and practicing on orange peels i opened a new needle and my tattoo came out great.  </li>
            <li>But yah, it&#x27;s ok to practice on oranges ;)</li>
            <li>Cool tatto kit, works excelent</li>
            <li>A bunch of problems connecting the power source to the gun and getting it to have full power 3.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good machine for a beginner that is just starting to learn the ropes of tattooing!</li>
            <li>the clip cord DID NOT work, very upset, everything else is fine and works well.</li>
            <li>This is great little gun.</li>
            <li>The only gripe is the ink, its really not the greatest, but it does work.</li>
            <li>tried taking it apart to re wire it (the wires weren&#x27;t connected right)</li>
            <li>is like a guitar, if you don&#x27;t tune it just right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and i dont suggest following what i did but for the price i was happy and my friend said it looked like a solid gun.  </li>
            <li>the ink cups and needles run out super fast.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t listen to the comments that say get a better gun because if your starting out you may decide you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do a finger tattoo as my first one to see how it is.</li>
            <li>Also was exactly what was described and works like a dream.</li>
            <li>but that wasnt a problem for us (not his first machine)</li>
            <li>so I havent been able to actually use it.i</li>
            <li>I have prior experience with better needles.</li>
            <li>great overall product the small tube of ink that comes with this is more than enough for the average beginner just a great product</li>
            <li>At first glance I was pleased, it&#x27;s what I been waiting so long for.</li>
            <li>it works fine gave it to a friend to do a tattoo for me turn out pretty nice ink took a little long to stick but other than that its pretty good</li>
            <li>Granted, this is my first gun, and I wasn&#x27;t very knowledgeable about how they work.</li>
            <li>So I also utilized youtube to find the needed information, which was easy enough.</li>
            <li>Done about ten tattoos so far machine and supply doing fine!</li>
            <li>He really likes it</li>
            <li>and when I hooked the cord to the wall and inserted the two plugs into the power supply it started a low humming sound.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very satisfiedðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>It works great but needs set up instructions especially for first timers other than that I haven&#x27;t had any problems would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>The gun also was not green and yellow like the picture but was all black which was actually a happy change.  </li>
            <li>its good to start small if your starting out</li>
            <li>I ordered a few more needles, stencil paper and some practice skin to go with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s terrible cheap ink... if you want good ink you&#x27;re gonna pay a bit more..</li>
            <li>Of course, the normal allen key set we have at the house doesn&#x27;t include the right size.</li>
            <li>but problem could not be solved...buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Basic but exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>The higher power was rattling the contact screw loose and stopping it from running, so I ended up tightening it more, and then had no more issues with the gun.</li>
            <li>This was the way and the settings that other artists were saying were adequate.</li>
            <li>Package came early.</li>
            <li>Heats up REALY fast,  on my machine the upper tube doesn&#x27;t go in all the way.</li>
            <li>I ordered it a lil late for the Christmas season and didnt expect to be able to give the gift on time.</li>
            <li>However, I seriously doubt that it will be able to be removed again.</li>
            <li>I found that tightening the contact screw just enough to turn the green light on on the power supply made it work with the needle attached while the power supply was between 7 and 9.</li>
            <li>i got everything as advertised, however, one MAJOR problem.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t set the volts too high and tune your gun</li>
            <li>I had to turn the power up to nearly 15 in order to have enough power to puncture my arm flesh so that the ink was staying in my arm.</li>
            <li>After completely assembling the gun, it was only working briefly then stopping.</li>
            <li>the only thing is, its kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>My only super small thing was that there was no instruction/assemble manual</li>

            <li> the only thing is, its kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> My only super small thing was that there was no instruction/assemble manual</li>
            <li> I have recieved this product very quickly before expected date, Item is as described although when I recieved my product I was missing a few screws for the grip</li>
            <li> It smells very strange and is runny.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I took the needle off, and flipped the armature bar around, giving the spring some careful pushes up which got it running.</li>
            <li> this is just a horrible buy the power supply cuts out cheap and worth less</li>
            <li> So I open the almost too small box and remove the contents.</li>
            <li> When I went to remove it to put the other tip on, the allen head bolt didn&#x27;t want to cooperate.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with any sort of manual, which I expected from reading previous reviews.</li>
            <li> less than one star, thank you for nothing</li>
            <li> and it has little power</li>
            <li> Which was included in the package, but misplaced by my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I have no real comment on the machine as I Had hooked it up and everything seems to work.my complaint is the</li>
            <li> One of which is too small for the needles that were included in the kit.</li>
            <li> One of the other guns where broken and the company would not replace it so amazon is the go to place.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was that my skin was too tough, or if it was the needles or power supply.</li>
            <li> not happy that its not all in working condition though.</li>
            <li> I am not a happy camper.</li>

            <li> Easy setup, great starter kit.....</li>
            <li> No power, doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> i got everything as advertised, however, one MAJOR problem. the clip cord DID NOT work, very upset, everything else is fine and works well. not happy that its not all in working condition though. tried taking it apart to re wire it (the wires weren&#x27;t connected right) but problem could not be solved...buying a new one. BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> the only issue i had with this is the gun cuts off and on like it has a short didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected but pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all. was DOA. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! POWER SUPPLY IS FAULTY. EVERYTHING ELSE IS OK. DON&#x27;T BUY DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
            <li> Package came early. but i did not get the 2 steel tips that the discription came with but over all this was a great produck and will order again when i need more things</li>
            <li> it works fine gave it to a friend to do a tattoo for me turn out pretty nice ink took a little long to stick but other than that its pretty good</li>
            <li> Good Beginner tattoo kit , how can you complain for the price?! Done about ten tattoos so far machine and supply doing fine!</li>
            <li> This is great little gun. My husband is just learning however I have order three guns from two different places and this was the best one. One of the other guns where broken and the company would not replace it so amazon is the go to place.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson. He really likes it but I thought it would have come with some kind of instructions on how to use it. He doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it but I think with some information he would like it better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Heats up REALY fast,  on my machine the upper tube doesn&#x27;t go in all the way. No tubes for the rest of the nedels sizes. But what can you expect for $20.  Just for dummies like me the tunner (power supply) doent just stop working the tattoo machine is like a guitar, if you don&#x27;t tune it just right it will never start. Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s bad about the ink? But yah, it&#x27;s ok to practice on oranges ;)</li>
            <li> I have recieved this product very quickly before expected date, Item is as described although when I recieved my product I was missing a few screws for the grip and I had contacted the seller, in which the issue was resolved very quickly. Would Buy this product again</li>
            <li> great overall product the small tube of ink that comes with this is more than enough for the average beginner just a great product 9.9/10 just because there was no instructions but there is youtube lol</li>
            <li> Ink is horrible does not go in skin</li>
            <li> This machine is working perfectly. all the parts came youtube made it easy to set up, for beginners this is great and an awesome price! its good to start small if your starting out deff go with this gun don&#x27;t listen to the comments that say get a better gun because if your starting out you may decide you don&#x27;t like it. Why pay up to 200$ on something you may put away. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Cool tatto kit, works excelent</li>
            <li> Great kit thank you so much for the help:-)</li>
            <li> Very great item I will be purchasing from them again</li>
            <li> The tattoo machine has a bunch of problems. 1. The needle didn&#x27;t fit in the nozzel 2. A bunch of problems connecting the power source to the gun and getting it to have full power 3. I have set up the machine perfectly and the needle will not move at all no matter how much I adjust it</li>
            <li> Comes with everything that&#x27;s pictured. I ordered a few more needles, stencil paper and some practice skin to go with it. All very cheap. Everything arrived sooner than expected. All parts working perfectly. I would recommend. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Best buy ever. Basic but exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Loved this tattoo kit</li>
            <li> Works great, for the price u can&#x27;t beat it ,already done 4 tattoos look excellent, I would like to see shader tip put with the kit, but I would deff recommend this keit if your starting out even for the novice &amp; expert level... Easy to transport as well.</li>
            <li> The price was very attractive and caught my eye immediately, a kit with everything I need to do tattoos! So I open the almost too small box and remove the contents. At first glance I was pleased, it&#x27;s what I been waiting so long for. Then I looked for the instructions and I found nothing, so I search you tube and finally get it all set up and when I hooked the cord to the wall and inserted the two plugs into the power supply it started a low humming sound. Kinda like when you touch two wires together, the power light didn&#x27;t come on and it doesn&#x27;t work. I am not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> The package arrived sooner then it was estimated to, which was nice. It included everything needed to assemble it and does work. However, the tube that goes inside the grip was too big for the hole in the frame for the tube. I did manage to get it to fit with some help from someone tougher then myself and a hammer. However, I seriously doubt that it will be able to be removed again. The piece should be easily removed for storage, cleaning, and replacing needles to avoid bending the needle when putting it on. Like I said, it does work in the condition. But it did take multiple hours to find a way to get it to work. It didn&#x27;t come with any sort of manual, which I expected from reading previous reviews. So I also utilized youtube to find the needed information, which was easy enough. The machine came with two tips. One of which is too small for the needles that were included in the kit. When I went to remove it to put the other tip on, the allen head bolt didn&#x27;t want to cooperate. I was under the impression that it was stripped. However, I think that it would work with the correct allen key. Which was included in the package, but misplaced by my boyfriend. *grunt* Of course, the normal allen key set we have at the house doesn&#x27;t include the right size. It&#x27;s in between the sizes. There&#x27;s just my tip to you, don&#x27;t lose your allen keys if you purchase! After completely assembling the gun, it was only working briefly then stopping. Granted, this is my first gun, and I wasn&#x27;t very knowledgeable about how they work. I took the needle off, and flipped the armature bar around, giving the spring some careful pushes up which got it running. But it still would stop when the needle was attached to the top hat grommet. I found that tightening the contact screw just enough to turn the green light on on the power supply made it work with the needle attached while the power supply was between 7 and 9. However, it would stop when trying to run a tattoo, and wasn&#x27;t puncturing my skin. Not sure if it was that my skin was too tough, or if it was the needles or power supply. This was the way and the settings that other artists were saying were adequate. I had to turn the power up to nearly 15 in order to have enough power to puncture my arm flesh so that the ink was staying in my arm. Even with that, it took quite a bit of pressure and some dragging to work. The higher power was rattling the contact screw loose and stopping it from running, so I ended up tightening it more, and then had no more issues with the gun. I did also take the O ring off of the front spring in order to get it to run initially. I would still suggest this gun to another beginner. I think part of the issue was just me having to get used to how it works. Rating it 3 stars for the issue with the tube. &#x27;Cus it was a pain.</li>
            <li> It works great but needs set up instructions especially for first timers other than that I haven&#x27;t had any problems would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> lame, weak, garbage, p.o.s., chinese, dissapoinment, rip off, s***ty, hate it, fell apart, don&#x27;t buy it, less than one star, thank you for nothing</li>
            <li> I was alittle scared i wouldn&#x27;t get everything i needed but no worries im super happy that this kit that is so inexpensive &amp; can give you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Good kit for a good price everything came and the packaging was good. Machine works good if you tune it right.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!! I already knew how to set it up and everything. It came before the orginal date.! I wanted to do a finger tattoo as my first one to see how it is. And it worked amazing for me. I suggest it for a beginner!!</li>
            <li> Got this to fix my homemade tattoo that i did with a homemade gun that was fadding.  Didn&#x27;t know much about tattoo or tattoo guns but after reading alot and practicing on orange peels i opened a new needle and my tattoo came out great.  I only did numbers and they came out great.  I wouldnt recommend anyone tattoo themselves and i dont suggest following what i did but for the price i was happy and my friend said it looked like a solid gun.  The gun also was not green and yellow like the picture but was all black which was actually a happy change.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great starter kit...I would recommend to anyone... Everything in the picture is there and works amazing for the price.... Very satisfiedðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Everything this kit includes works, and it works good for the price. As long as you don&#x27;t set the volts too high and tune your gun right it will last you a while. The only gripe is the ink, its really not the greatest, but it does work. I have recommended it, and will continue to recommend it to beginners.&lt;br /&gt;Just get better ink, that is all.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the product and got here EXTREMELY fast. I ordered it a lil late for the Christmas season and didnt expect to be able to give the gift on time. Boy was I wrong.....it got here in days. Also was exactly what was described and works like a dream. My only super small thing was that there was no instruction/assemble manual but that wasnt a problem for us (not his first machine)</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I want to be a tattoo artist when I grow up. I got in a tiny package. And since there are no instructions I had to look on youtube but I got it all pretty good. This is an awesome kit.</li>
            <li> I love the product, my boyfriend does all his work with this gun. the only thing is, its kind of expensive. so if your looking for a cheap tattoo gun, then go to ebay. the ink cups and needles run out super fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this an no directions I still haven&#x27;t put it together to scared I&#x27;ll do it wrong an looked on you tube there&#x27;s nothing that explains how to put it together</li>
            <li> I have no real comment on the machine as I Had hooked it up and everything seems to work.my complaint is the I didnt recieve the grip for the machine so I havent been able to actually use it.i noticed im the only one with this problem maybe something went wrong during the transfer. I tried to contact the company but no luck considering I havent recieved a order form nor a return address so I have no idea what to do. Thats the readon for the low rating. Maybe I was unlucky to be the one to ecperience this problem.</li>
            <li> i like it but the problem is its not working and it has little power, someone help? :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[</li>
            <li> Got this for a bday present. While the allen wrenches are a little sucky, THIS IS A GREAT KIT! 5/5</li>
            <li> Everything works great. I do wish there was more ink though. But overall, everything has been great. No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> :)i loved it and i use it alot! it is deff everything ive always wanted:) so happpy that i got it</li>
            <li> Definitely a good machine for a beginner that is just starting to learn the ropes of tattooing! i love the machine itself ... as for the ink i will never ever use dragonhawk ink. It&#x27;s terrible cheap ink... if you want good ink you&#x27;re gonna pay a bit more.. i suggest Mom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Fair beginners  kit. Fair for the price however the ink is very cheap. I did not use it. It smells very strange and is runny. The needles are awful. They catch and they scrape across the skin. I have prior experience with better needles. The gun is good. No problems with the power supply although the foot peddle is very cheap. But it was metal. The best part is that the tools are interchangeable. It was packaged great.</li>
            <li> not happy the grip screw is striped the needles are horrible  this is just a horrible buy the power supply cuts out cheap and worth less</li>
