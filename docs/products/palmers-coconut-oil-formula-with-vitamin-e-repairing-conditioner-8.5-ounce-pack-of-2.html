            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>l love it, this product does work on my hair</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>We have very fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>I looked around for a long time for a good shampoo and conditioner for dyed hair that worked great and didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>I have afro-textured hair: lots of fine strands that do their own thing thus looking super frizzy.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, is inexpensive, and works really well!</li>
            <li>This is a protein conditioner and it helps &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; those fine strands together</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair and it also had the most intoxicating smell!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful conditioner better than many other high priced brands.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and smell good</li>
            <li>SUPER HYDRATED HAIR, soft with a pleasant smell of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft and silky with a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for dry hair, but it does work well and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>It soaked right into my hair..</li>
            <li>The summer heat with sun, pool water and constant rinsing was not the friendliest time to my hair - this conditioner is rich but rinses very well keeping my hair smooth and light.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was that I found that it sometimes stung the top of my head,</li>
            <li>I tried this first when I bought it from Target (in the ethnic hair section--</li>
            <li>It smells great and really moisturizes my dry, dry hair.</li>
            <li>and this helps moisturize it and after using it my hair is healthier, softer and not so dry and my curls look better.</li>
            <li>This is great especially for someone with naturally curly hair that has a tendency to stay dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>it was mainly coconut oil, I was pretty diappointed.</li>
            <li>so I have less frizz and better defined curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend for curly hair</li>
            <li>I used to a believer in high end hair care products.</li>
            <li>Makes hair manageable and soft without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice but not overpowering like other heavily perfumed cosmetics out there.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;d reuse it again and highly recommend it to anyone, especially coconut lovers.</li>
            <li>It revived my dry hair and made it very shiny - but not shiny because of grease...</li>
            <li>I use this stuff pretty often because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens like a lot of other products</li>
            <li>In this very humid weather, it&#x27;s helped cut down frizz substantially as well.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that gets dry</li>

            <li> yes my hair was that dry)</li>
            <li> recommend it for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Spent hundreds on Terax and while I do like it and cannot say one bad thing about it, I learned that since I do conditioner only washes and no longer use shampoo, I can find very affordable conditioners that work just as well.</li>
            <li> not much different than similiar products but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The product is very thick and creamy and has a heavenly coconut scent that lasts even on dry hair.</li>

            <li> Makes hair manageable and soft without making it greasy. Smell is nice but not overpowering like other heavily perfumed cosmetics out there. I&#x27;d highly recommend for curly hair that&#x27;s thin at the strand level (dunno how it&#x27;d work on coarser hair though).</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and smell good</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells great and really moisturizes my dry, dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works Great</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner better than many other high priced brands. It smells great and leaves the hair smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff pretty often because it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens like a lot of other products</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great and so is the shampoo. I recommend it to anyone who needs a deep conditioning product for your hair !</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I used it postpartum with my son to keep my hair from drying out. I also use it on my 4 year old daughter. We have very fine hair that tangles easily so we never go a wash without it. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and creamy and has a heavenly coconut scent that lasts even on dry hair. It revived my dry hair and made it very shiny - but not shiny because of grease... ACTUAL shine. In this very humid weather, it&#x27;s helped cut down frizz substantially as well. The only issue I had was that I found that it sometimes stung the top of my head, mind you it wasn&#x27;t painful but I&#x27;ve never had a conditioner &#x27;sting&#x27; my scalp. Either way, I&#x27;d reuse it again and highly recommend it to anyone, especially coconut lovers.</li>
            <li> I looked around for a long time for a good shampoo and conditioner for dyed hair that worked great and didn&#x27;t break the bank. This stuff is the best! It makes my hair feel amazing, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair and it also had the most intoxicating smell! I tried this first when I bought it from Target (in the ethnic hair section--yes my hair was that dry) but if you order it from Amazon you get two bottles for the price of one. I think I&#x27;ll be using this stuff for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> l love it, this product does work on my hair</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for dry hair, but it does work well and it smells good.  I have naturally curly hair that gets dry and this helps moisturize it and after using it my hair is healthier, softer and not so dry and my curls look better.</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner for curly &amp; damaged hair! I also use it as a co-wash &amp; a leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year &amp; I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> not much different than similiar products but less expensive.  Nice coconut fragrance.  I would purchase again but it does not add shine to hair.</li>
            <li> I have afro-textured hair: lots of fine strands that do their own thing thus looking super frizzy. This is a protein conditioner and it helps &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; those fine strands together so I have less frizz and better defined curls (yay!). I follow it up with any non-protein conditioner for softness and shine. This stuff smells amazing, is inexpensive, and works really well!</li>
            <li> Good product and on time</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product!</li>
            <li> It soaked right into my hair..it seemed to condition it but I just didn&#x27;t like the feeling of it on my hair..but it smelled wonderful..</li>
            <li> This stuff works a miracle on my hair. It makes it so soft and silky with a nice smell. I even use it as a leave in conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white and flakey</li>
            <li> i love Palmers  hair polisher serum and the olive oil hair pudding AMAZING makes my hair feel like it did when I was a teenager !!! They all smell great but this repairing conditioner&#x27;s first three ingreidents are alcohols and I was under the impression it was mainly coconut oil, I was pretty diappointed.</li>
