            <li>Stuff is great for strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>The difference is remarkable and noticeable within a day.</li>
            <li>I have used Sally Hansen gel for stronger nails and have had good results</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s good quality</li>
            <li>and it works really good.</li>
            <li>great makes my nails thicker and stronger, love it</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The formula was nice too.</li>
            <li>It would not come off like most polishes do.</li>
            <li>however I now find this product to be even better.  </li>
            <li>I JUST BOUGHT 5 MORE</li>
            <li>Very nice product and really does work</li>
            <li>Not only is this product incredibly affordable, but it has kept my nails strong and split-free since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with the recommendation because this product builds my nails quickly and adds strength.</li>
            <li>Love this, dries really quickly</li>
            <li>This is the best by far at a low cost.</li>
            <li>It is really helping me out with my nails!</li>
            <li>My nails are definitely stronger and are able to reach a longer length without breaking.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part about this nail builder is that when I do happen to break a nail, the use of this product helps my damaged nail grow back faster and stronger every time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I should had bought from Amazon, got from Sally&#x27;s @ a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>I have also been using this as a top coat since I found it help my manicure last longer than a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>It is a bit messy but does give good coverage and adds to strength.</li>
            <li>make my nail strong and healthy, no more brittle nails for me.</li>
            <li>I use this gel on clean bare nails or under and over nail enamel.</li>
            <li>This stuff really did help my  nails.</li>
            <li>This product really helps strengthens your nail and promotes nail growth.</li>
            <li>Now I have tried the Garlic nail treatment from LA Girl and did not like it as much because it peels off faster.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Growing Nails with Garlic and really like the product but still prefer this calcium builder.  </li>
            <li>I own nearly 500 polishes from various brands, and this base coat has worked perfectly with all of them.</li>
            <li>This product leaves a nice shine and does not give a yellow look to nails as other products might.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this calcium nail builder by LA Girl for a few months now and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer live in that area.</li>
            <li>, It is good when you want to stop using fake nails</li>
            <li>As a former &#x27;nail biter&#x27; I have always had issues with splitting and peeling and just soft nails in particular.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve converted so many of my friends to loyal users of this product and they all love it and say they will never use another base coat again!</li>
            <li>If you keep it in a cool dark place it will last.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to strengthen my weak nails.  </li>
            <li>Bomb, makes my nails tough and strong.</li>

            <li> This stuff really did help my  nails. It would not come off like most polishes do.</li>
            <li> Have use only once.  It is a bit messy but does give good coverage and adds to strength.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me as a strengthner but I&#x27;ll have to give it 5 stars since I used this as a base coat &amp; I never once my nails stained. The formula was nice too.</li>
            <li> Stuff is great for strengthening my nails. Also noticed that it makes my manis last longer</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 5 years now. Sadly there is only 1 beauty store that sells it and I no longer live in that area. I use this gel on clean bare nails or under and over nail enamel. No only does it create a thicker nail but has aided in my nails growing stronger. Now that I know Amazon sells it, I will stock up. If you keep it in a cool dark place it will last.</li>
            <li> Many years ago after removing my artificial nails (thin and weak) an employee at Sally&#x27;s referred this product. It makes the nails flexible without breaking.  Love,Love,Love it!</li>
            <li> make my nail strong and healthy, no more brittle nails for me.</li>
            <li> It is really helping me out with my nails! Very nice product and really does work, It is good when you want to stop using fake nails</li>
            <li> As a former &#x27;nail biter&#x27; I have always had issues with splitting and peeling and just soft nails in particular.  I have used Sally Hansen gel for stronger nails and have had good results however I now find this product to be even better.  My nails are definitely stronger and are able to reach a longer length without breaking.  I actually have to file them back because they attain the length before breaking.  This product leaves a nice shine and does not give a yellow look to nails as other products might.</li>
            <li> great makes my nails thicker and stronger, love it</li>
            <li> I have an acrylic overlay on my nails my and they would break all the time. I started using this nail builder underneath my nails and It keeps my long nails thick and prevents them from breaking.</li>
            <li> LA GIRL Calcium Nail Builder treatment was recommended to me in a beauty group. I&#x27;m glad I went with the recommendation because this product builds my nails quickly and adds strength. The difference is remarkable and noticeable within a day. My dry, brittle names get stronger and grow faster with this product.</li>
            <li> STAYS ON LONGER THAN ALL THE OTHERS AND SEEMS TO BE HELPING...I JUST BOUGHT 5 MORE BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO FIND ANYWHERE~!!</li>
            <li> This product really helps strengthens your nail and promotes nail growth. The product arrived on time. I have been using this product for a while now and I like it</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  AFTER JUST ONE USE I COULD FEEL MY NAILS HARDER AND THEY BREAK AND SPLIT LESS ALREADY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this calcium nail builder by LA Girl for a few months now and love it.  I am very hard on my nails and before using the product I was suffering from breaking nails all the time.

My favorite part about this nail builder is that when I do happen to break a nail, the use of this product helps my damaged nail grow back faster and stronger every time.&lt;br /&gt;  Now I have tried the Garlic nail treatment from LA Girl and did not like it as much because it peels off faster.  I have tried Growing Nails with Garlic and really like the product but still prefer this calcium builder.  This is a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> As a nail polish blogger, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different base coats, but this is far superior to any other product I have used as a base coat, including high end salon brands.

            <li> Bomb, makes my nails tough and strong. I should had bought from Amazon, got from Sally&#x27;s @ a much higher price.  Can be used as a base coat or by itself.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after removing my acrylics to help my nails recover. It does make my nails feel stronger and there&#x27;s been no chipping or any of the other stuff you expect after removing acrylics. I don&#x27;t think it actually makes nails grow faster but it does help them recover. I have also been using this as a top coat since I found it help my manicure last longer than a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this, dries really quickly and I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s good quality and it works really good.</li>
