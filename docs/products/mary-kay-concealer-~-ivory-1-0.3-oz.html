            <li>It arrived so quickly and I am very happy with the response from the vendor.  </li>
            <li>It blends easily and is the perfect color for my very light skin (I&#x27;m a redhead).  </li>
            <li>She is absolutely right when she says that Mary Kay Concealer is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Love the Mary Kay concealer, does what it should and had to buy it for my daughter after she started taking mine!</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products so that won&#x27;t stop me from buying them!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with their quality.  </li>
            <li>And it really does stay on great all day!  </li>
            <li>:) I love it!</li>
            <li>It is by far the best product I have found for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair (think Christina Agulera fair) and use this in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>If I powder over it, it will stay on all day and does a pretty great job in the water.  </li>
            <li>Concealer is good for MILD coverage, but nothing I would rave about.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all up in the wrinkles (lol) and goes on very smoothly and blends very well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This concealer works so well with my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause break outs or oil buildup or anything like most concealers do.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be ok but it does not cover like I would like for it to.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li>and it will mostly stay on.  </li>
            <li>I love Paula Beogun and her beautypedia.com recommendations.</li>
            <li>Have used this for sometime and love the color and ease of applying.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like a shade darker would match better since a too light concealer would highlight  instead</li>
            <li>I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY ORDER OF MARY KAY IVORY 1 CONCEALER AND THE FAST SERVICE THAT I RECEIVED.  </li>
            <li>This is the best concealer for a little under eye lift.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I liked my previous Mary Kay concealer better.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and the product description was right on.</li>
            <li>This concealer is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The only concealer I have found that actually covers the dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Received very quickly and in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>This product is an A+  Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have tryed many different types of concealer.</li>
            <li>Just the tiniest bit goes so far and blends so smoothly.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t powder it, it stays on all day unless I get in the water, but even then it still stays on pretty dang</li>
            <li>It even lasts pretty well through my workouts and sweating.  </li>
            <li>This one seems a little thinner, and doesn&#x27;t stay on quite as long, but the color match was good, and it&#x27;s still definitely better than anything I can pick up at a department store.</li>
            <li>I have light acne scars that take several layers</li>
            <li>I love this concealer, it covers my dark circles very well!</li>
            <li>Very pretty eye look without being obvious.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Mary Kay for years and it is always high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>Provides full coverage of my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I moisturized my eyes really well before applying the concealer and within a few hours my under eyes looked super dry and the concealer was really flaky.</li>
            <li>You need very little to cover and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It really works and last long.</li>
            <li>My item arrived a little messy from the post office&#x27;s lack of care probably, but the seller fixed it immediately and gave me a full refund for it.</li>

            <li> I gave this such a low rating because the concealer is both hard to blend and does not cover very well.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and as long as they make it, I&#x27;ll be wearing it.  </li>
            <li> pat it dry</li>
            <li> I use it ever single day</li>
            <li> &amp; I could NOT live without it!</li>
            <li> but I only use a little bit</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t rub your face when it is wet...</li>
            <li> Plus it lasts unlike a lot of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If you have bought over-the-counter products and not tried this one from Mary Kay, you won&#x27;t buy any other after using this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality product but shade is lighter than I expected, no biggie!</li>
            <li> Once I found it and started using it again, I realized it settled into my fine lines and dried up like crazy.</li>
            <li> I use this concealer for my dark under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li> I should use a slightly darker shade in summer but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> too even cover slightly with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker.</li>
            <li> I got this concealer a little bit sooner than the day it was suppose to arrive &amp;</li>
            <li> This product was a lot lighter than I expected and is so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding anything to cover up my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Covers little spots nobody needs to be seeing and stays put!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This product works well under eyes but does nothing for small blemishes/pimples.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay came through as usual!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complete crap with a freakish sickly sheen to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wonderful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what came in the mail was bronze 1 instead of ivory 1</li>
            <li> the product blends in with makeup base, too.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and it&#x27;s cheaper than what my mary kay representative charges me.</li>
            <li> I use this every day but I only use a little bit so it lasts a long time. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Not the same as Nude, but close. It&#x27;s a little darker.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get it online. My connection moved away.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been buying it for the last 10 years or so. It really works and last long.</li>
            <li> Have used or years.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> I got a gift basket for a bunch of Mary Kay cosmetics.  I was thrilled with their quality.  I tried this out and was equally happy.  This foundation is lightweight and blends well.  Plus it lasts unlike a lot of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer for a little under eye lift.  Very pretty eye look without being obvious.  If you have bought over-the-counter products and not tried this one from Mary Kay, you won&#x27;t buy any other after using this one.  It arrived so quickly and I am very happy with the response from the vendor.  I will most likely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Ladies,  I guess I should have done my homework before buying this product, it&#x27;s not used so I am going to see if I can return it. The ingredients have a couple PARABENS in it and I try to stay away from that. MAC concealer does not have parabens, I had the product department email me the ingredient so I guess I am back to MAC..I have been using that for years and am happy but I thought I&#x27;d try something new. Also: YES To Carrots has zero parabens- great line.</li>
            <li> Love the Mary Kay concealer, does what it should and had to buy it for my daughter after she started taking mine!</li>
            <li> I got this concealer a little bit sooner than the day it was suppose to arrive &amp; it&#x27;s a great concealer! I got the ivory 1 &amp; I&#x27;m a 300beige in the Marykay foundation and I feel like a shade darker would match better since a too light concealer would highlight  instead, it still works great &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without it! Great buy and great seller!</li>
            <li> This concealer is by far my favorite. Blends in very nice! The price is unbeatable, too. This product is an A+  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product was a lot lighter than I expected and is so hard to apply. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t cover evenly. Looks chalky</li>
            <li> covers under eye circles great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complete crap with a freakish sickly sheen to it. YUK. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, color true to my skin color &amp; the product blends in with makeup base, too.  Mary Kay products are the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality product but shade is lighter than I expected, no biggie!</li>
            <li> I used to like this concealer and it was the only concealer I would use until I lost it and stopped using it. Once I found it and started using it again, I realized it settled into my fine lines and dried up like crazy. I stopped using it for a while until recently. I used it hoping I would like it again. I moisturized my eyes really well before applying the concealer and within a few hours my under eyes looked super dry and the concealer was really flaky.</li>
            <li> You need very little to cover and it goes on smoothly.  I would recommend this product.  I have been using Mary Kay for years and it is always high quality.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and as long as they make it, I&#x27;ll be wearing it.  I don&#x27;t use all Mary Kay products but this stuff is the best for me.</li>
            <li> great product...have used it for years...works great under my foundation to create a beautiful smooth look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you for your prompt service.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> It works to cover all those spots, and makes my skin color blend.  I use only Mary Kay products and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I give it a three bc I have used and like the MK concealer. Unfortunately what came in the mail was bronze 1 instead of ivory 1 :/ I obviously can&#x27;t use it but we were in the middle of a move so I didn&#x27;t have time to mail it back. I gave it to a friend instead.</li>
            <li> My item arrived a little messy from the post office&#x27;s lack of care probably, but the seller fixed it immediately and gave me a full refund for it. I love Mary Kay products so that won&#x27;t stop me from buying them! This concealer works so well with my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause break outs or oil buildup or anything like most concealers do. I love it.</li>
            <li> Umm.. I think I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 10 years. Oh wait.. I have. :) I love it! Covers little spots nobody needs to be seeing and stays put! I&#x27;m pretty fair (think Christina Agulera fair) and use this in the winter.  I should use a slightly darker shade in summer but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT AND WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I buy 3 at a time.  The only concealer I have found that actually covers the dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Received very quickly and in perfect shape.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay came through as usual!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding anything to cover up my dark circles. I have tryed many different types of concealer. This one seems to be ok but it does not cover like I would like for it to.</li>
            <li> Concealer is good for MILD coverage, but nothing I would rave about. I gave this such a low rating because the concealer is both hard to blend and does not cover very well. I have light acne scars that take several layers too even cover slightly with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent concealer I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> Just the tiniest bit goes so far and blends so smoothly. I love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the product description was right on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my bread and butter!  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It is a great color and is waterproof.  And it really does stay on great all day!  If I powder over it, it will stay on all day and does a pretty great job in the water.  If I don&#x27;t powder it, it stays on all day unless I get in the water, but even then it still stays on pretty dang well.  It even lasts pretty well through my workouts and sweating.  Just don&#x27;t rub your face when it is wet...pat it dry and it will mostly stay on.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I liked my previous Mary Kay concealer better. It was the signature series. This one seems a little thinner, and doesn&#x27;t stay on quite as long, but the color match was good, and it&#x27;s still definitely better than anything I can pick up at a department store.</li>
            <li> Product does what it supposed to.  Works great, feels nice on too.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY ORDER OF MARY KAY IVORY 1 CONCEALER AND THE FAST SERVICE THAT I RECEIVED.  WOULD ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer, it covers my dark circles very well!</li>
            <li> I love Paula Beogun and her beautypedia.com recommendations. She is absolutely right when she says that Mary Kay Concealer is one of the best. Provides full coverage of my dark circles. I love it! It goes everywhere with me!</li>
            <li> This Mary Kay concealer, Ivory 0.3 ounce, was recommended to me by my niece who&#x27;s in the entertainment industry.  I trusted her opinion when she said this is the best concealer shes used, because I know she&#x27;s had alot of experience with makeup.  It blends easily and is the perfect color for my very light skin (I&#x27;m a redhead).  It doesn&#x27;t get all up in the wrinkles (lol) and goes on very smoothly and blends very well.  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Have used this for sometime and love the color and ease of applying.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This product works well under eyes but does nothing for small blemishes/pimples.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I use it ever single day &amp; I could NOT live without it! I will be purchasing this product for the rest of my life &amp; I do recommend it to everyone I know!! Thank You! A+++++</li>
            <li> I use this concealer for my dark under-eye circles.  It is by far the best product I have found for this purpose.  It goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way.  I follow up with a bit of powder to blend the color in.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
