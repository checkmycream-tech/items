            <li>Worked great no hassles!</li>
            <li>My daughter is a competitive dancer and these are the best bun makers I have found.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>This makes my bun perfect because I have layered hair.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST :D</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>best bun holder i&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully all the time.  </li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>People kept telling me how great they were, but I didn&#x27;t believe them.</li>
            <li>Works great once you get the hang of putting it in daughter has a lot of hair</li>
            <li>Great for those days when your hair doesn&#x27;t cooperate and you need to run to work.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It makes a perfect neat and sophisticated bun.  </li>
            <li>So many accessories slip thru my hair but this holds it perfectly intact!</li>
            <li>just right, it makes a beautiful, perfect bun with no bobby pins.</li>
            <li>When you try to remove it good luck.</li>
            <li>children loved it...</li>
            <li>Have always loved these.</li>
            <li>Works great on my mothers. :)</li>
            <li>Awesome for a quick, easy ballet bun that STAYS IN!</li>
            <li>Great for making ballet buns quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good tool for making a bun, but not my favorite one to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, works great.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to get cut by the metal underneath</li>
            <li>If you get the wrap right, which does take some learning, it&#x27;s a very tidy bun.</li>
            <li>Very cheap....</li>
            <li>WOW this is the best for when you need your hair pulled up quickly &amp; easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with it for about an hour, maybe more.</li>
            <li>decided to try it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, hoping by being able to see what I was doing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d end up being out even more that I paid.</li>
            <li>I love my Hairagami :)</li>
            <li>This is the only way to make a perfect bun!</li>
            <li>really love this thing for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Favorite hair accessory purchase of all time.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I love using this to put my hair in a bun.</li>
            <li>The one time I thought I was successful, but it sprang shut in an \\&quot;O\\&quot; shape, completely trapping my hair!</li>
            <li>Its super easy!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of though It is so easy.</li>
            <li>That, combined with trying to wind up with the hairigami facing the right way at the top so that I can snap it around, can prove challenging.  </li>
            <li>My hair is quite fine and shoulder length.</li>
            <li>so paying less than $5 was great!</li>
            <li>This is so easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to learn which way works best to roll it, but we figured it out in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>There is a reason that they have it so cheap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic purchase</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>I finally bought one and am happy to say they were right.  </li>
            <li>pretty easy to put in and stays put.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s look super neat when u put on ur hair and looks classyüòç</li>
            <li>Even though it is cheap...not worth your money.</li>
            <li>I have found that it takes some practice to get it right.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing that will hold my hair in a beautiful style for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li>This is good for a tight ballet-like bun.</li>
            <li>so I new what to expect (and was not disappointed).  </li>
            <li>We have tried several bun makers and this is quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>I put her hair in a pony tail first, and then use the Hairigami for the bun.  </li>
            <li>i may buy more as soon as possible</li>
            <li>Watch the video first on the company website or on YouTube until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I got them when they were first introduced 10 years ago</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for any woman serving in the military to meet the standards, especially female Soldiers under the guidance of AR 670-1.</li>
            <li>Make great buns but can be frustrating if you don&#x27;t start the turn in the  right direction.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to redo if you feel the need to freshen up later in the day.  </li>
            <li>Smaller sizes would be nice for  my little one with baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of this product.  </li>
            <li>I never used the scrunchi one too much.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t need any bobby pins even when my daughter spends 3 hours straight in dance classes.</li>
            <li>I have recently bought several more.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll be starting ROTC in the fall, and we&#x27;ll be sending her off with at least a 1/2 dozen of these amazing tools!</li>
            <li>It does however take a couple of tries to get it to work right at first.</li>
            <li>As I said, I am purchasing two new pieces as I now have daughters that use them as well.  </li>
            <li>Looks so elegant and stays in all day long - not matter how busy or active she is.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 month old who likes to pull hair</li>
            <li>Because it is like snap bracelet, it continues to hold tight even in a full out dance class.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these one year ago in a store near my house and was good, so I decided to buy two more in Amazon, but they are horrible.</li>
            <li>I barely touch it and it springs shut.</li>
            <li>We put her hair in a tight pony tail first and then use the bun maker.  </li>
            <li>It still usually takes me on average, a few times, to get a good wrap.</li>

            <li> It still usually takes me on average, a few times, to get a good wrap.</li>

            <li> Her hair is not all the same length, which means I am constantly tucking in loose pieces as I roll it up.  </li>
            <li> and they still work as long as i don&#x27;t lose them.</li>
            <li> It came with two like this (in blue and black) and a third piece that was one snap side and one scrunchi side.  </li>
            <li> my daughters hair is very difficult to control but with this product it made it so easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I usually have to try multiple times each time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this same product in the past</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them for her thick curly hair to put into a bun when she wears her JROTC uniform for the last 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I just had to practice with it a little</li>
            <li> The material is of such poor quality that they are rusting; also let my hair smelly and small particles of rust on my clothes and hair.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seem them as expensive as $12 at dance apparel stores</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m frustrated beyond belief.</li>
            <li> The stupid thing keeps snapping shut before I am done rolling my hair, and then I can&#x27;t get them straightened out again!</li>

            <li> Ugh. I was so excited to get this and now I&#x27;m frustrated beyond belief. I&#x27;ve been struggling with it for about an hour, maybe more. The stupid thing keeps snapping shut before I am done rolling my hair, and then I can&#x27;t get them straightened out again! The one time I thought I was successful, but it sprang shut in an \\&quot;O\\&quot; shape, completely trapping my hair! It took 15 minutes to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, hoping by being able to see what I was doing I would get the hang of it. Nope. I barely touch it and it springs shut. I&#x27;d return it, but they won&#x27;t refund what I paid in shipping, AND I have to pay to send it back. I&#x27;d end up being out even more that I paid. It sucks.</li>
            <li> Yes!! Used it for my daughter&#x27;s dance recital!! Worked great no hassles!</li>
            <li> Does NOT work for curly hair. Works great on my mothers. :)</li>
            <li> Very cheap.... did not work. You can see the hairgami through your hair. Also fabric is already ripping. Even though it is cheap...not worth your money. There is a reason that they have it so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is the handiest dandiest hair accessory I have ever had.  It makes a perfect neat and sophisticated bun.  It is easy to redo if you feel the need to freshen up later in the day.  I would be lost without it.  My hair is quite fine and shoulder length. So many accessories slip thru my hair but this holds it perfectly intact!</li>
            <li> These are great. My daughter is a competitive dancer and these are the best bun makers I have found. We don&#x27;t even need bobby pins. We put her hair in a tight pony tail first and then use the bun maker.  Because it is like snap bracelet, it continues to hold tight even in a full out dance class. It takes a little bit to learn which way works best to roll it, but we figured it out in a couple minutes. People kept telling me how great they were, but I didn&#x27;t believe them. I finally bought one and am happy to say they were right.  I have ordered multiple so I never have to look for them when we are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I love my Hairagami :)</li>
            <li> This is the only way to make a perfect bun!</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this product.  I got it to help with buns for my daughter&#x27;s ballet class.  I put her hair in a pony tail first, and then use the Hairigami for the bun.  I have found that it takes some practice to get it right.  I usually have to try multiple times each time I make her bun.  Her hair is not all the same length, which means I am constantly tucking in loose pieces as I roll it up.  That, combined with trying to wind up with the hairigami facing the right way at the top so that I can snap it around, can prove challenging.  When I do manage to get it just right, it makes a beautiful, perfect bun with no bobby pins. There&#x27;s a learning curve, so be prepared.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these one year ago in a store near my house and was good, so I decided to buy two more in Amazon, but they are horrible. The material is of such poor quality that they are rusting; also let my hair smelly and small particles of rust on my clothes and hair. I &#x27;ll throw them away. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> really love this thing for my hair it&#x27;s look super neat when u put on ur hair and looks classyüòçI recommend this product it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and I can&#x27;t get this to work.  The bars click into a roll before I can get my hair pulled all the way out to start rolling up.  I even tried to just go around the outside of the item instead of putting my hair in between and it didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> Great for making ballet buns quickly!</li>
            <li> I bought the Hairagami set ten years ago.  It came with two like this (in blue and black) and a third piece that was one snap side and one scrunchi side.  I never used the scrunchi one too much.  I love this product.  It is the only thing that will hold my hair in a beautiful style for a long period of time.  Anytime I wear my Hairagami people stop me and ask how I did my hair or where I had it done.  I almost always use both pieces and \\&quot;join\\&quot; them to make the \\&quot;S\\&quot; shaped hairdo.&lt;br /&gt;  Over the last ten years I&#x27;ve had waist length to shoulder length hair.  My hair is very thick.  It works beautifully all the time.  As I said, I am purchasing two new pieces as I now have daughters that use them as well.  Favorite hair accessory purchase of all time.</li>
            <li> This makes my bun perfect because I have layered hair.  I can&#x27;t use a sock without it looking bulky.  This is a great tool for any woman serving in the military to meet the standards, especially female Soldiers under the guidance of AR 670-1.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I cannot even curl my hair but I use this all of the time! Its super easy! I have layers in my hair but it doesnt matter, just bobby pin the extra stray hairs and go!</li>
            <li> This is good for a tight ballet-like bun. If you get the wrap right, which does take some learning, it&#x27;s a very tidy bun. It still usually takes me on average, a few times, to get a good wrap. It&#x27;s a good tool for making a bun, but not my favorite one to use. I like a looser, messier bun.</li>
            <li> pretty easy to put in and stays put. When you try to remove it good luck. The frustration made me chuck it into the trash. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great once you get the hang of putting it in daughter has a lot of hair so it took a little longer than normal.</li>
            <li> my daughters hair is very difficult to control but with this product it made it so easy to handle. i may buy more as soon as possible</li>
            <li> After six or seven uses the cloth covering comes off and it is very easy to get cut by the metal underneath</li>
            <li> WOW this is the best for when you need your hair pulled up quickly &amp; easily. My daughter uses them for her thick curly hair to put into a bun when she wears her JROTC uniform for the last 3 yrs. She&#x27;ll be starting ROTC in the fall, and we&#x27;ll be sending her off with at least a 1/2 dozen of these amazing tools! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Watch the video first on the company website or on YouTube until you get the hang of it. Fabulous! Looks so elegant and stays in all day long - not matter how busy or active she is. THE BEST :D</li>
            <li> children loved it...12-15</li>
            <li> Have always loved these. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this same product in the past so I new what to expect (and was not disappointed).  The price can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve seem them as expensive as $12 at dance apparel stores so paying less than $5 was great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hairagami since 1999. These are fantastic! I use them all the time. Fantastic purchase</li>
            <li> We use these for my granddaughters for dance.  Make great buns but can be frustrating if you don&#x27;t start the turn in the  right direction.  Smaller sizes would be nice for  my little one with baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and comfortable. I have a 4 month old who likes to pull hair and I where it even sleeping</li>
            <li> Works great! We have tried several bun makers and this is quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> best bun holder i&#x27;ve ever found. i don&#x27;t need any bobby pins even when my daughter spends 3 hours straight in dance classes.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, works great.  I just had to practice with it a little but I noticed it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like an elastic band or the plastic thing I used to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome for a quick, easy ballet bun that STAYS IN!</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  Great for those days when your hair doesn&#x27;t cooperate and you need to run to work.  I use a hair tie underneath for the ease.</li>
            <li> I love using this to put my hair in a bun. I got them when they were first introduced 10 years ago and they still work as long as i don&#x27;t lose them. I have recently bought several more. It does however take a couple of tries to get it to work right at first. Once you get the hang of though It is so easy.</li>
