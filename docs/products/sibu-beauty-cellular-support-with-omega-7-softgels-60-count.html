            <li>I love Sea Buckthorn!</li>
            <li>This is amazing because the lack of moisture damages your teeth, eyes, heart, etc.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to relieve that fear.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t effective at all</li>
            <li>Got it for mom and now she&#x27;s more beautiful in her golden years</li>
            <li>I will give it one more month since a lot of reviewers mentioned that it needs time to build up.</li>
            <li>This product is the best thing I ever got it not only sped up my weight loss</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love this</li>
            <li>those decades of abuse from her two ex-husbands never damped her spirit and she shines more than ever.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also eating healthy and working out.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker, wavier and so much more body..</li>
            <li>i have rosacea, and while it hasn&#x27;t cleared up, it has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Came on time, as many softgells as stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my favorite supplement :)</li>
            <li>I feel so much more confident, and sexy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the stress was worsening the issue...</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve never been more confident in myself.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve never been more confident in myself.  </li>
            <li>SO, PLEASE if you are considering Omega 7 pills, try Macadamian nuts for a healthy, non-invasive way to get your Omega 7 instead.  </li>
            <li>I love these softgels.  </li>
            <li>I have more energy.</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be a better deal.</li>
            <li>So glad I found you,</li>
            <li>THIS TO OTHERS!,LOVE,LOVE,LOVE AND LOVE.</li>
            <li>I ALSO LOVE THE SIBU OMEGA7  </li>
            <li>I have notice I have more energy</li>
            <li>I read reviews that most people use them for hair and nails but that is  not what they work on for me.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the capsules from the discount places but is not as potent as others.</li>
            <li>I was suprised to find these are a lower dosage than most others.</li>
            <li>A cobalt or amber bottle would have been a better choice of packaging.</li>
            <li>I take it daily...and have not used lubricant once since I started taking it consistently in February!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over the hill, but frequently people will comment on how beautiful my skin looks</li>
            <li>Still taking them and at 75 I feel pretty good</li>
            <li>My hair was growing I was loosing weight, and I honestly believe these pills helped me get pregnant me</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY GOOD TAKEN INTERNALLY BECAUSE IT HELPS  CONTROL OF, AND IT ALSO  MUCOUS  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
            <li>but my hair is softer, I will continue to use this product because I am happy so far.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that my bladder pain is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>My doctor had warned me that herbal/alternative treatments for issues can have their own problems, and in this case he was right.  </li>
            <li>So easy to swallow and soothing for the digestive process.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bother my tummy and are easy to take.</li>
            <li>My nails still feel strong &amp;</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure my vagina is magic now.</li>
            <li>This is a huge feat considering I wear contact lenses.</li>
            <li>I need only take one softgel per day to keep my skin happy.  </li>
            <li>I must have this to stay acne free.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews on Sea Buckthorn I decided to try it to help eliminate the occasional hormonal acne that I have.  </li>
            <li>it comes with, oils &amp; supplements are degraded by light.</li>
            <li>and I was right my rosacea is about 90% better now,  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>- this vitamins work wonders for hair and skin, no other vitamins did so much good for me as these.</li>
            <li>I plan to wait and try to learn more first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t write my review after the first month because I would have given this product 1 or 2 stars.</li>
            <li>and I eat pretty healthy, but after taking this product, I have started to lose weight.</li>
            <li>I also eat foods rich in fiber.</li>
            <li>Within the first week or two I noticed my skin had a healthy glow with no flakiness whatsoever.</li>
            <li>originally started buying it on their website.....</li>
            <li>I love the product and have had no ill side effects from it that I can tell.</li>
            <li>I used Sibu Beauty&#x27;s sea buckthorn Omega 7 soft gels for about two months with amazing results.</li>
            <li>I seemed to cure that by taking it with a FULL glass of water.</li>
            <li>They really made my hair grow fast, shine more and my skin feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much shinier and nails look so much better.  </li>
            <li>It is the super berry.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and had read it best to attack the problem internally as well as externally.  </li>
            <li>I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>My nose, mouth, eyes &amp; nether regions all are SUPER moisturized.</li>
            <li>The price was right however and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was told by a woman at a health food store to go on Sea Buckthorn Oil and try the New Chapter brand which was more then I could afford.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!nd things have never-ever-ever-ever been better downstairs, always fresh and ready to go when I am!!</li>
            <li>but hell, this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>sure how I felt about this product until I realized out of the blue that my skin was looking great, more vibrant, softer, less dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>and I rarely break out now after using the M2 products..</li>
            <li>I get comments on my healthy looking hair frequently.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was worth a try</li>
            <li>It is a bit expensivebut totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for skin, hair, and nails, right?</li>
            <li>it is strong, shiny, and i&#x27;ve had so much new growth.</li>
            <li>skin is moisturized, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as healthy and my breakouts came back full force.</li>
            <li>I take both daily, and things have never-ever-ever-ever been better downstairs, always fresh and ready to go when I am!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do not seem to upset my tummy at half-dosage, which is another reason I started off at half, as many things (certainly most vitamins) make me queasy.</li>
            <li>Having seen the results at half dosage, I will try the full dosage and see if I can&#x27;t get better hair/nails!</li>
            <li>The first product I tried didn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference</li>
            <li>I paused to read up on carageenan and learned that numerous respectable doctors, including Dr. Andrew Weil, tell us that carageenan has been linked, in peer-reviewed studies, to stomach cancer.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I see that we can buy the oil for topical skincare -- it might be better to use a version that you don&#x27;t have to put in your stomach.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 2 months now.</li>
            <li>I use this product with the Sibu facial bar that I also absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I bought these vitamins when I read an article in First magazine with Dr. OZ.  </li>
            <li>, you will love this product (especially if you are post-menopausal)!  </li>
            <li>I used this product last year, it cleared my skin, gave me more energy</li>
            <li>It could be a placebo effect, but maybe it just really does what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>If it helps with my skin and hair too, then hot damn</li>
            <li>So is my boyfriend, hahaa ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Supplements obviously don&#x27;t work for everyone, but it works for me :)</li>
            <li>I finished my first 30 day supply yesterday.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this product!</li>
            <li>BUT after reading more on this product and considering my overall health I STOPPED using Omega 7.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products, only seeing temporary improvements.</li>
            <li>I can get my Sibu skin back! :)</li>
            <li>I have been taking 2 a day as directed and am almost at the end of the first month.</li>
            <li>I ordered these originally because I&#x27;m prone to adult onset acne...</li>
            <li>Just started to use this product waiting for results hope its brings me good results may replace fish oil but more expensive</li>
            <li>I use my eye drops way less now &amp; my contacts don&#x27;t swirl around in my eyes any more!</li>
            <li>I pretty much stopped using scrubs.</li>
            <li>pretty much everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin has been smooth, soft &amp; relatively blemish free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 now, and I finally feel like a normal healthy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne my whole life, so I have a lot of scarring mainly on my cheeks!</li>
            <li>I am only 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t weigh that much to begin with, so losing 3 pounds is huge for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My nails have taken off and are growing about twice as fast as before and my hair is too.</li>
            <li>I really think it takes time to build up in your system.</li>
            <li>and this has really helped with breakouts.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my hair or nails (yet).</li>
            <li>I can absolutely see a difference in my skin when I am taking these (1 pill, twice a day).  </li>
            <li>My whole family has noticed.</li>
            <li>I look the whole jar and never got any results.</li>
            <li>Really helps my rosacea.</li>
            <li>but she said something else that really piqued my interest.</li>
            <li>I ready to go?&amp;#34; before sex.</li>
            <li>Hi, I really worry about my product??</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Hair is not falling out as much.</li>
            <li>The oil &amp; serum helped, but the capsules are where I really see results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had issues with these from whole foods but had issues from y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Sibu would consider making a more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; version of the product for folks that want to steer clear of such filler additives?</li>
            <li>per capsule you pay a little more than other brands, but this seller is the most economical.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear less makeup and not stress so much about &amp;#34;covering up&amp;#34; all the imperfections (Time saver + confidence booster!)</li>
            <li>She added them to her other vitamins and said they made her skin care routine that much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the formula differs, but for me it just wasn&#x27;t as effective as Sibu.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s typical with softgels</li>
            <li>, I called the seller &amp; they responded quickly, he said it is one &amp; the same.</li>
            <li>They are FAR less costly on Amazon as they are on the site where I originally saw them, and thus far have been genuine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone having skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for menopausal women because it lubricates ALL of your membranes...</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These are little magic capsules.  </li>
            <li>Taking one pill a day has no negative side effects that I can determine in my regiment.  </li>
            <li>However, the facial patches pretty much go away 100% on this softgel.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>I take this and other omega product and have been staying acne free ever since.  </li>
            <li>started using the New Chapter</li>
            <li>In a nut shell, this is a live plant that lives in the ocean and in the desert.  </li>
            <li>Since using this bottle I have moved on to the New Chapter brand to see which I</li>
            <li>With all that being said, I came back and ordered my next 2 months worth!</li>
            <li>and I owe it all to this and frequent salmon meals which I eat whenever I get the chance!</li>
            <li>Found absolutely no effect or difference while taking the full supply of these.</li>
            <li>I also eat clean and do yoga and other forms of exercise.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try taking this since it was suggested by a friend and had such positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I finally found something that works for my sensitive, red, dry skin :)</li>
            <li>I have been using these for over 6 months and found them on amazon for almost half price of what I had been paying and they are the original product.  </li>
            <li>Also, helps to clear my Roseaca.</li>
            <li>The bottle is clear</li>
            <li>So far they seem to be helping with weight loss, but I am also exercising.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference there, probably because I was way too surprised by what else it was doing - namely, easing vaginal dryness.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0027UZV6E SEABUCKTHORN SOFT GEL CAP PILL]]</li>
            <li>I NOW eat Macadamian Nuts, which are a NATURAL way to get Omega 7.  </li>
            <li>I now order directly from SIBU.</li>
            <li>My fingernails have become stronger, an improvement I can attribute to this natural product.</li>
            <li>All a plus plus for me so far.</li>
            <li>I had tried everything the doctor perscribed and had tried some  natural remedies too</li>
            <li>i LOVE these supplements, and I have tried this brand and one other brand, and this brand, while more expensive, is def.</li>
            <li>Also small easy to swallow gel caps.</li>
            <li>use the product  mainly for health maintenance  but have noticed improvements to hair nails and facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>My skin has turned very soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s probably a mental thing...</li>
            <li>I then purchased M2 Skin Refining 20% serum along with the M2 Moisturizer and these 2 products helped calm my skin down</li>
            <li>There are no other additives or oils besides purified water, gelatin, &amp; vegetable</li>
            <li>I have tried every product on the market for fine, thin hair and this is the ONLY thing that actually make your hair grow more hair and appear to be healthy and have less thin spots.  </li>
            <li>As far as weight loss, I&#x27;ve definitely lost weight (30+ lbs)</li>
            <li>I tried the product for 2 months without apparent benefit (or side effect)</li>
            <li>When I went to reorder I noticed that another brand contained double the amount of soft gels</li>
            <li>The oil is very healing for the skin and one can mix it with other seential oils</li>
            <li>So be careful &amp; buy the lesser priced one, since it is the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;skin is not nearly as dry as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea on my face, keratosis pilaris on my arms, very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>... I&#x27;ve had some minor redness on my face and was hoping this would help clear it up, but it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li>These breakouts normally last for a long time and they are not small.  </li>
            <li>I have not been using this product long enough to give a complete review, hence the 3 stars.</li>

            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it is cruelty free and VEGAN!!!!</li>
            <li> Just an all around great product for MANY reasons!</li>
            <li> I got these for my mom and she loved them.</li>
            <li> superior.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt this good in almost five years</li>
            <li> but it gets two star for good packaging</li>
            <li> These Capsules I take every day, they are so good for you and my hair and&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has been really good for blood circulation.</li>
            <li> Very safe.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in my skin - I love it!</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks since I started taking those supplements and my skin has never looked so healthy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product!</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up better than it had in years!</li>
            <li> I love Sea Buckthorn!</li>
            <li> This is amazing because the lack of moisture damages your teeth, eyes, heart, etc.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to relieve that fear.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t effective at all</li>
            <li> Got it for mom and now she&#x27;s more beautiful in her golden years</li>
            <li> I will give it one more month since a lot of reviewers mentioned that it needs time to build up.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing I ever got it not only sped up my weight loss</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really love this</li>
            <li> those decades of abuse from her two ex-husbands never damped her spirit and she shines more than ever.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also eating healthy and working out.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, wavier and so much more body..</li>
            <li> i have rosacea, and while it hasn&#x27;t cleared up, it has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Came on time, as many softgells as stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my favorite supplement :)</li>
            <li> I feel so much more confident, and sexy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the stress was worsening the issue...</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never been more confident in myself.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never been more confident in myself.  </li>
            <li> SO, PLEASE if you are considering Omega 7 pills, try Macadamian nuts for a healthy, non-invasive way to get your Omega 7 instead.  </li>
            <li> I love these softgels.  </li>
            <li> I have more energy.</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be a better deal.</li>
            <li> So glad I found you,</li>
            <li> THIS TO OTHERS!,LOVE,LOVE,LOVE AND LOVE.</li>
            <li> I ALSO LOVE THE SIBU OMEGA7  </li>
            <li> I have notice I have more energy</li>
            <li> I read reviews that most people use them for hair and nails but that is  not what they work on for me.  </li>
            <li> It works better than the capsules from the discount places but is not as potent as others.</li>
            <li> I was suprised to find these are a lower dosage than most others.</li>
            <li> A cobalt or amber bottle would have been a better choice of packaging.</li>
            <li> I take it daily...and have not used lubricant once since I started taking it consistently in February!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over the hill, but frequently people will comment on how beautiful my skin looks</li>
            <li> Still taking them and at 75 I feel pretty good</li>
            <li> My hair was growing I was loosing weight, and I honestly believe these pills helped me get pregnant me</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY GOOD TAKEN INTERNALLY BECAUSE IT HELPS  CONTROL OF, AND IT ALSO  MUCOUS  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
            <li> but my hair is softer, I will continue to use this product because I am happy so far.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that my bladder pain is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> My doctor had warned me that herbal/alternative treatments for issues can have their own problems, and in this case he was right.  </li>
            <li> So easy to swallow and soothing for the digestive process.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t bother my tummy and are easy to take.</li>
            <li> My nails still feel strong &amp;</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty sure my vagina is magic now.</li>
            <li> This is a huge feat considering I wear contact lenses.</li>
            <li> I need only take one softgel per day to keep my skin happy.  </li>
            <li> I must have this to stay acne free.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on Sea Buckthorn I decided to try it to help eliminate the occasional hormonal acne that I have.  </li>
            <li> it comes with, oils &amp; supplements are degraded by light.</li>
            <li> and I was right my rosacea is about 90% better now,  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> - this vitamins work wonders for hair and skin, no other vitamins did so much good for me as these.</li>
            <li> I plan to wait and try to learn more first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t write my review after the first month because I would have given this product 1 or 2 stars.</li>
            <li> and I eat pretty healthy, but after taking this product, I have started to lose weight.</li>
            <li> I also eat foods rich in fiber.</li>
            <li> Within the first week or two I noticed my skin had a healthy glow with no flakiness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> originally started buying it on their website.....</li>
            <li> I love the product and have had no ill side effects from it that I can tell.</li>
            <li> I used Sibu Beauty&#x27;s sea buckthorn Omega 7 soft gels for about two months with amazing results.</li>
            <li> I seemed to cure that by taking it with a FULL glass of water.</li>
            <li> They really made my hair grow fast, shine more and my skin feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much shinier and nails look so much better.  </li>
            <li> It is the super berry.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and had read it best to attack the problem internally as well as externally.  </li>
            <li> I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li> My nose, mouth, eyes &amp; nether regions all are SUPER moisturized.</li>
            <li> The price was right however and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was told by a woman at a health food store to go on Sea Buckthorn Oil and try the New Chapter brand which was more then I could afford.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!nd things have never-ever-ever-ever been better downstairs, always fresh and ready to go when I am!!</li>
            <li> but hell, this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> sure how I felt about this product until I realized out of the blue that my skin was looking great, more vibrant, softer, less dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> and I rarely break out now after using the M2 products..</li>
            <li> I get comments on my healthy looking hair frequently.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was worth a try</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensivebut totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for skin, hair, and nails, right?</li>
            <li> it is strong, shiny, and i&#x27;ve had so much new growth.</li>
            <li> skin is moisturized, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as healthy and my breakouts came back full force.</li>
            <li> I take both daily, and things have never-ever-ever-ever been better downstairs, always fresh and ready to go when I am!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do not seem to upset my tummy at half-dosage, which is another reason I started off at half, as many things (certainly most vitamins) make me queasy.</li>
            <li> Having seen the results at half dosage, I will try the full dosage and see if I can&#x27;t get better hair/nails!</li>
            <li> The first product I tried didn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I paused to read up on carageenan and learned that numerous respectable doctors, including Dr. Andrew Weil, tell us that carageenan has been linked, in peer-reviewed studies, to stomach cancer.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I see that we can buy the oil for topical skincare -- it might be better to use a version that you don&#x27;t have to put in your stomach.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Sibu facial bar that I also absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I bought these vitamins when I read an article in First magazine with Dr. OZ.  </li>
            <li> , you will love this product (especially if you are post-menopausal)!  </li>
            <li> I used this product last year, it cleared my skin, gave me more energy</li>
            <li> It could be a placebo effect, but maybe it just really does what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li> If it helps with my skin and hair too, then hot damn</li>
            <li> So is my boyfriend, hahaa ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Supplements obviously don&#x27;t work for everyone, but it works for me :)</li>
            <li> I finished my first 30 day supply yesterday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product!</li>
            <li> BUT after reading more on this product and considering my overall health I STOPPED using Omega 7.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products, only seeing temporary improvements.</li>
            <li> I can get my Sibu skin back! :)</li>
            <li> I have been taking 2 a day as directed and am almost at the end of the first month.</li>
            <li> I ordered these originally because I&#x27;m prone to adult onset acne...</li>
            <li> Just started to use this product waiting for results hope its brings me good results may replace fish oil but more expensive</li>
            <li> I use my eye drops way less now &amp; my contacts don&#x27;t swirl around in my eyes any more!</li>
            <li> I pretty much stopped using scrubs.</li>
            <li> pretty much everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin has been smooth, soft &amp; relatively blemish free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 now, and I finally feel like a normal healthy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne my whole life, so I have a lot of scarring mainly on my cheeks!</li>
            <li> I am only 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t weigh that much to begin with, so losing 3 pounds is huge for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My nails have taken off and are growing about twice as fast as before and my hair is too.</li>
            <li> I really think it takes time to build up in your system.</li>
            <li> and this has really helped with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my hair or nails (yet).</li>
            <li> I can absolutely see a difference in my skin when I am taking these (1 pill, twice a day).  </li>
            <li> My whole family has noticed.</li>
            <li> I look the whole jar and never got any results.</li>
            <li> Really helps my rosacea.</li>
            <li> but she said something else that really piqued my interest.</li>
            <li> I ready to go?&amp;#34; before sex.</li>
            <li> Hi, I really worry about my product??</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Hair is not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> The oil &amp; serum helped, but the capsules are where I really see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with these from whole foods but had issues from y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Sibu would consider making a more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; version of the product for folks that want to steer clear of such filler additives?</li>
            <li> per capsule you pay a little more than other brands, but this seller is the most economical.</li>
            <li> I was able to wear less makeup and not stress so much about &amp;#34;covering up&amp;#34; all the imperfections (Time saver + confidence booster!)</li>
            <li> She added them to her other vitamins and said they made her skin care routine that much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the formula differs, but for me it just wasn&#x27;t as effective as Sibu.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s typical with softgels</li>
            <li> , I called the seller &amp; they responded quickly, he said it is one &amp; the same.</li>
            <li> They are FAR less costly on Amazon as they are on the site where I originally saw them, and thus far have been genuine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone having skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for menopausal women because it lubricates ALL of your membranes...</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are little magic capsules.  </li>
            <li> Taking one pill a day has no negative side effects that I can determine in my regiment.  </li>
            <li> However, the facial patches pretty much go away 100% on this softgel.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> I take this and other omega product and have been staying acne free ever since.  </li>
            <li> started using the New Chapter</li>
            <li> In a nut shell, this is a live plant that lives in the ocean and in the desert.  </li>
            <li> Since using this bottle I have moved on to the New Chapter brand to see which I</li>
            <li> With all that being said, I came back and ordered my next 2 months worth!</li>
            <li> and I owe it all to this and frequent salmon meals which I eat whenever I get the chance!</li>
            <li> Found absolutely no effect or difference while taking the full supply of these.</li>
            <li> I also eat clean and do yoga and other forms of exercise.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try taking this since it was suggested by a friend and had such positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that works for my sensitive, red, dry skin :)</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over 6 months and found them on amazon for almost half price of what I had been paying and they are the original product.  </li>
            <li> Also, helps to clear my Roseaca.</li>
            <li> The bottle is clear</li>
            <li> So far they seem to be helping with weight loss, but I am also exercising.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference there, probably because I was way too surprised by what else it was doing - namely, easing vaginal dryness.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0027UZV6E SEABUCKTHORN SOFT GEL CAP PILL]]</li>
            <li> I NOW eat Macadamian Nuts, which are a NATURAL way to get Omega 7.  </li>
            <li> I now order directly from SIBU.</li>
            <li> My fingernails have become stronger, an improvement I can attribute to this natural product.</li>
            <li> All a plus plus for me so far.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything the doctor perscribed and had tried some  natural remedies too</li>
            <li> i LOVE these supplements, and I have tried this brand and one other brand, and this brand, while more expensive, is def.</li>
            <li> Also small easy to swallow gel caps.</li>
            <li> use the product  mainly for health maintenance  but have noticed improvements to hair nails and facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> My skin has turned very soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s probably a mental thing...</li>
            <li> I then purchased M2 Skin Refining 20% serum along with the M2 Moisturizer and these 2 products helped calm my skin down</li>
            <li> There are no other additives or oils besides purified water, gelatin, &amp; vegetable</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market for fine, thin hair and this is the ONLY thing that actually make your hair grow more hair and appear to be healthy and have less thin spots.  </li>
            <li> As far as weight loss, I&#x27;ve definitely lost weight (30+ lbs)</li>
            <li> I tried the product for 2 months without apparent benefit (or side effect)</li>
            <li> When I went to reorder I noticed that another brand contained double the amount of soft gels</li>
            <li> The oil is very healing for the skin and one can mix it with other seential oils</li>
            <li> So be careful &amp; buy the lesser priced one, since it is the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;skin is not nearly as dry as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea on my face, keratosis pilaris on my arms, very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> ... I&#x27;ve had some minor redness on my face and was hoping this would help clear it up, but it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li> These breakouts normally last for a long time and they are not small.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to give a complete review, hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with thinning, illustrious, straw-like hair, you should seriously consider using this for at least 3 months to see an amazing difference.  </li>
            <li> The next day the redness has gone down considerably.</li>
            <li> On my own, I have a hard time getting and staying lubricated, which is frustrating and demoralizing.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve ever taken fish oil supplements and had fish burps, I tell you now that sea buckthorn burps are far less unpleasant/</li>
            <li> It is a wide mouthed plastic container that is simple to open, close &amp; store.</li>
            <li> omega-7 gel tabs at first, but switched to sibu after the first bottle (it&#x27;s significantly less expensive),</li>
            <li> The only other drug I take is Hydroxyzine daily and Pyridium as needed.  </li>
            <li> So imagine my surprise when, after a few days of using this stuff, everything starts working like it did when I was in my early twenties.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to see the results...</li>
            <li> I still have a long way to go to heal</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s one of those things you take in faith that it&#x27;s gonna prove benenficial in the long run.</li>
            <li> Adult Breakouts can be caused by the skin&#x27;s inability to slough off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> My acne cleared up 80% &amp; stayed that way as long as I took one a day.</li>
            <li> (I only needed 1 a day of Sibu&#x27;s) for almost 2 months with not much result.</li>
            <li> I will continue to take this product for as long as it keeps helping me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post back when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> so the review does not yet reflect how effective the product actually is, but I was disappointed to find the package did not have the 60 pills as advertised but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but I think my wrinkles on my face and around my upper lip seem less pronounced.</li>
            <li> My symptoms (burning) are always there only improving slightly over the last year.  </li>
            <li> The last 2 from Amazon the tamper seal was open half way around.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this after reading the rave reviews, but several other reviews warned that it contains carageenan.  </li>
            <li> But for my skin, there are virtually NO wrinkles on my face, especially around my eyes, and it is 100% due to these pills.</li>
            <li> I have some capsules left of this other brand, but I just ordered 3 containers of Sibu.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes, skin, hair, etc.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also hoping for some relief from dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> For starters, my skin is not as dry as it use to be, haven&#x27;t see any growth</li>
            <li> Skin dry.</li>
            <li> I also use the sea buckthorn oil on my dry skin and it works wonders for the dryness and irritation.</li>
            <li> but I do not normally have blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking these for three weeks, but I have already lost 5 additional pounds, have less dry itchy skin, and am noticing that my skin is clearing.  </li>
            <li> I am combined 1 pill daily (less than their recommended amount</li>
            <li> my face frequently breaks out with one or two angry pimples around my nose and forehead, and I&#x27;m 66 years old!  </li>
            <li> I have only been taking them for a little over two weeks, but I think I have lost like 3 pounds.</li>
            <li> It drastically reduced the size of the little bugger by the morning &amp; next day</li>
            <li> I do take 2 pills per day orally but on a few occassions, I&#x27;ve punctured a capsule and put a little of the oil directly on a blemish.</li>
            <li> have to say I have not noticed any benefits to my nails or hair, though I must follow up by saying I have only been taking half the recommended dosage due to the expense.</li>
            <li> I would advise purchasers to price-shop carefully.</li>
            <li> I started taking these a few weeks later</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t notice an extreme change in my skin and hair, but I use a lot of skincare products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Normally at night the burning seems to be worse and will also worsen if I feel stressed out.  </li>
            <li> It is a plant that kills other plants to survive and thrive.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I found out that it depletes your muscles and causes a host of other issues which you can read about from others.  </li>
            <li> I think this product may help with energy, but I&#x27;ve also been taking other vitamins</li>
            <li> but it was disappointing to know that I didn&#x27;t have the full 60.</li>
            <li> My hair glistens in the sun when before it looked like straw and was falling out due to thyroid problems.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this product was that when I opened the bottle I found that several of the softgels were broken and the liquid had seeped out.</li>
            <li> Its not worth being without them.</li>
            <li> I used it for at least 5 month with absolutely no change in my skin or dry eyes.</li>
            <li> These really reduce the amount of deep, painful cyst-like acne I tend to get on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The one thing I thought was odd was it did cause some indigestion</li>
            <li> From a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worse, my pain level for the last two weeks has been a minus one.  </li>
            <li> since finding it on Amazon, I&#x27;m paying half now.</li>
            <li> one of the containers did not have the protective covering, and at one of the capsules had burst causing a mess.</li>
            <li> I have had extremely dry skin all of my life even while using thick moisterizers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they haven&#x27;t done anything for my nails as far as I can tell, but I am a nail biter and nail picker (ugh!).  </li>
            <li> Not sure what other benefits it may have in store.</li>
            <li> Took a few months to deplete my supply and felt that any benefit would have shown up by then.</li>
            <li> My rosacea flared up badly few weeks ago and nothing would help.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when i run out after a few days i start to get a few blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I am a repeat buyer because anything that saves me a few skin issues is a must have in my book.  </li>
            <li> I used to try to combat this with scrubs &amp; peels that were probably too harsh.</li>
            <li> If I had a few strays I just used a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefits to this product and felt it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Redness is gone, even little bumps on my arms are gone!</li>
            <li> I am in no position to evaluate them since I have been sick for the last month with a lingering deep chest cough.</li>
            <li> Last year I was suffering in a big way from rosacea and dry skin, I hated leaving the house.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I am truly shocked at how much moisture</li>
            <li> I have been taking two a day for the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of my hair either.  </li>
            <li> , only problem is it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> but these are expensive in my estimation), along with the buckthorn oil &amp; facial cream.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will use it again.</li>
            <li> so I stopped :/.</li>
            <li> As a young woman, you wouldn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have any issues with that, but sadly I do!</li>
            <li> I was unable to give blood for testing without my veins breaking due to previous chemo treatment and these have strengthened my blood vessels and helped my digestion so that I do not have issues with ulcers in spring and fall.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it&#x27;s working though.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> My signs of my rosacea have diminished - to what extent this had verses the other 2 products, it is difficult to tell.  </li>
            <li> (I typically have weak, thin, easily broken nails).  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try but was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Sounds silly, but that is 3 days less product!  </li>
            <li> Working out made my skin even worse, so by the end of last summer I was really frustrated.</li>
            <li> Tired.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the capsules at one stage and almost immediately I could see and feel my skin getting worse again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks of taking the supplements I noticed a dramatic improvement in my mucus membranes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am working out</li>
            <li> well - I guess thinking they&#x27;re doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> I get angry red/flaky patches on either side of my nose and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Omega 7 is a rarer type of Omega that is difficult to get from foods</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who suffers from rosacea.  </li>
            <li> It became very expensive</li>
            <li> That seems very expensive for omega 7.  </li>
            <li> so I can fall asleep because the pain is so bad.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expired bad pills.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, I didn&#x27;t recieve it</li>
            <li> I hate it...</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> About two weeks after I stopped, I started having those nasty breakouts again.  </li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever used!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is amazing! I have had extremely dry skin all of my life even while using thick moisterizers. My estestician told me to try Omega 7/sea Buckthorn so I did. The first product I tried didn&#x27;t seem to make a noticeable difference then I tried his one and immediately noticed it changed the texture of my skin, the look and the feel! I am sold and will be reordering! Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> I ordered these originally because I&#x27;m prone to adult onset acne...my face frequently breaks out with one or two angry pimples around my nose and forehead, and I&#x27;m 66 years old!  These breakouts normally last for a long time and they are not small.  While I took these softgels for six months and had no problems with any breakouts.  I stopped using them because I thought I might not need them anymore.  Big mistake.  About two weeks after I stopped, I started having those nasty breakouts again.  I need only take one softgel per day to keep my skin happy.  I highly recommend this product.  They work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Omega 7 for three month and there is a vast improvement with my digestive system, skin and weight loss.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try taking this since it was suggested by a friend and had such positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a month now and don&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin, etc... I&#x27;ve had some minor redness on my face and was hoping this would help clear it up, but it hasn&#x27;t helped at all. I will give it one more month since a lot of reviewers mentioned that it needs time to build up.</li>
            <li> These really reduce the amount of deep, painful cyst-like acne I tend to get on my face and neck. I have been taking two a day for the past 2 months.  I use them in combination with the sea buckthorn oil topically.</li>
            <li> Taking it daily, no noticeable difference into 2nd week</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost two years and take 1 cap twice a day.  I was looking for something in the antioxidant line, this doesn&#x27;t have an aftertaste.  My hair is thicker and doesn&#x27;t seem as lifeless</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing I ever got it not only sped up my weight loss but it gave me the softest skin. My nails have taken off and are growing about twice as fast as before and my hair is too. I made the mistake of running out and within 7 days my skin was already drying out and cracking. Believe me I won&#x27;t let that happen again.</li>
            <li> Was just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about this product until I realized out of the blue that my skin was looking great, more vibrant, softer, less dry.&lt;br /&gt;I use some very simple facial care products and the combination with the Sea Buckthorn oil seems perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with overall body health IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to give a complete review, hence the 3 stars. So far they seem to be helping with weight loss, but I am also exercising. I have not noticed any changes with my skin or hair yet. It takes time for them to get in your system, so will update after a month or two.</li>
            <li> Just got my bottle and I&#x27;m happy so far. I will write another review in another month. Thank you! &#x27;</li>
            <li> Got it for mom and now she&#x27;s more beautiful in her golden years those decades of abuse from her two ex-husbands never damped her spirit and she shines more than ever.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market for fine, thin hair and this is the ONLY thing that actually make your hair grow more hair and appear to be healthy and have less thin spots.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to take them everyday for about 2 months to really notice a big difference however.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for skin, hair, and nails, right? And I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference there, probably because I was way too surprised by what else it was doing - namely, easing vaginal dryness. On my own, I have a hard time getting and staying lubricated, which is frustrating and demoralizing. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to do anything to my downstairs - the thought didn&#x27;t enter my mind at all. So imagine my surprise when, after a few days of using this stuff, everything starts working like it did when I was in my early twenties. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s Niagara Falls or anything; I&#x27;m not, like, saturated 24/7. But I&#x27;m pretty sure my vagina is magic now.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it is cruelty free and VEGAN!!!!</li>
            <li> I got these for my mom and she loved them. She added them to her other vitamins and said they made her skin care routine that much better. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this after reading the rave reviews, but several other reviews warned that it contains carageenan.  I paused to read up on carageenan and learned that numerous respectable doctors, including Dr. Andrew Weil, tell us that carageenan has been linked, in peer-reviewed studies, to stomach cancer.  Perhaps Sibu would consider making a more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; version of the product for folks that want to steer clear of such filler additives? I believe the folks who say it helped their skin, but are we robbing Peter to pay Paul? I plan to wait and try to learn more first. In the meantime, I see that we can buy the oil for topical skincare -- it might be better to use a version that you don&#x27;t have to put in your stomach.</li>
            <li> Found absolutely no effect or difference while taking the full supply of these. Took a few months to deplete my supply and felt that any benefit would have shown up by then.</li>
            <li> This has been great for my skin, has helped somewhat with my nails and hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 2 months now. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t write my review after the first month because I would have given this product 1 or 2 stars. I really think it takes time to build up in your system. There is a noticeable difference in my skin - I love it! I have acne prone skin and this has really helped with breakouts. My skin also feels smoother. I do take 2 pills per day orally but on a few occassions, I&#x27;ve punctured a capsule and put a little of the oil directly on a blemish. The next day the redness has gone down considerably. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my hair or nails (yet). As far as weight loss, I&#x27;ve definitely lost weight (30+ lbs) but I&#x27;m also eating healthy and working out. Who knows, it may be helping but I can&#x27;t give it all the credit. The only drawback I&#x27;ve had is burping up the taste of it after taking it. Gross, I know! I seemed to cure that by taking it with a FULL glass of water. With all that being said, I came back and ordered my next 2 months worth!</li>
            <li> i LOVE these supplements, and I have tried this brand and one other brand, and this brand, while more expensive, is def. superior.  I have also ordered and tried the sea buckthorn oil, which my dad prefers, however, I prefer this brand in this tablet form.  I can absolutely see a difference in my skin when I am taking these (1 pill, twice a day).  Unfortunately, they haven&#x27;t done anything for my nails as far as I can tell, but I am a nail biter and nail picker (ugh!).  I&#x27;m not sure of my hair either.  But for my skin, there are virtually NO wrinkles on my face, especially around my eyes, and it is 100% due to these pills.</li>
            <li> These are little magic capsules.  My hair is thicker, wavier and so much more body..I can&#x27;t believe it...It didn&#x27;t take long to see the results...</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who suffers from rosacea.  I use this in combination with cetaphil soap and lotion in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been about 2 months and i&#x27;m officially a believer! my hair has never looked so good! it is strong, shiny, and i&#x27;ve had so much new growth. i have rosacea, and while it hasn&#x27;t cleared up, it has gotten better. my overall skin tone has also improved. definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne my whole life, so I have a lot of scarring mainly on my cheeks! This product has definitely improved my skin by visibly reducing my scarring. My whole family has noticed. I use this product with the Sibu facial bar that I also absolutely love. I take one softgel in the morning and one at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my nails have definetly gotten stronger. My nails are always painted so are damaged/weak. But I can tell that are a lot stronger now so I am happy. I have not noticed anything with my hair yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I think this product is helping me lose weight! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am working out and I eat pretty healthy, but after taking this product, I have started to lose weight. I have only been taking them for a little over two weeks, but I think I have lost like 3 pounds. I am only 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t weigh that much to begin with, so losing 3 pounds is huge for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and will continue taking it!!!</li>
            <li> Just so that you know, I ordered this product &amp; thought I received a sustitute because my box said \\&quot;Cellular Support\\&quot; by Sibu but looked identical to picture shown. Here on Amazon, there is a $7.00 price difference between the two, but if you blow up the picture you can see the box does say \\&quot;Cellular Support\\&quot;, I called the seller &amp; they responded quickly, he said it is one &amp; the same. So be careful &amp; buy the lesser priced one, since it is the exact same thing. In my case he adjusted the price, but hopefully you will not need to if you learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> Just started to use this product waiting for results hope its brings me good results may replace fish oil but more expensive</li>
            <li> I bought these vitamins when I read an article in First magazine with Dr. OZ.  They really made my hair grow fast, shine more and my skin feels so much better.  The one thing I thought was odd was it did cause some indigestion so I take one pill in the AM and one in PM......that stopped that issue.  I am on my way to reorder some more!!! [[ASIN:B0027UZV6E SEABUCKTHORN SOFT GEL CAP PILL]]</li>
            <li> I never write reviews here but I had to do it this time! I have rosacea on my face, keratosis pilaris on my arms, very sensitive, dry skin. My rosacea flared up badly few weeks ago and nothing would help. I was looking for something on amazon and saw all the comments about Sea Buckthorn supplements. I decided to give it a try but was a little skeptical. It has been 2 weeks since I started taking those supplements and my skin has never looked so healthy! Redness is gone, even little bumps on my arms are gone! My nails are stronger and longer. My hair is shiny. I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product! I finally found something that works for my sensitive, red, dry skin :)&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I look the whole jar and never got any results. I was hopeful but won&#x27;t spend my money on a refill. I just decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes, skin, hair, etc., etc., you will love this product (especially if you are post-menopausal)!  I saw a difference within a week, especially in terms of eye lubrication.  Very safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but I think my wrinkles on my face and around my upper lip seem less pronounced. I&#x27;m also hoping for some relief from dry eyes.  I think I&#x27;ll be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and It did wonders for my face. It became very expensive so I stopped using it.  I found it again on Amazon at a very good price.  I started using it again and  I noticed a glow in my face and so did others.  I had people asking me if I changed my makeup!  Along with this I also used Sibu soap and liquid suppliants and I was very pleased.  I highly recommend this product for anyone having skin problems.  I thank Amazon for selling this a lot cheaper than others.  I will continue  to purchase this from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I used this product last year, it cleared my skin, gave me more energy and I lost weight, only problem is it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but I felt like I had to on this item.  I have Lupus and have had over 30 years.  Along with everything Lupus has to offer I also have Sjogrens (the wonderful disease that takes all the moisture out of your body).  After taking this for just 2 days my mouth has moisture and so do my eyes!  This is amazing because the lack of moisture damages your teeth, eyes, heart, etc.  I still have a long way to go to heal but I finally have hope that this might be the ticket for some relief.</li>
            <li> Great for skin, hair, nails, ligaments and joints; has a wonderful healing effect on skin.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day, and my skin is blemish-free.  I&#x27;m over the hill, but frequently people will comment on how beautiful my skin looks and I owe it all to this and frequent salmon meals which I eat whenever I get the chance!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this in an effort to reduce breakouts.  I have noticed that when i run out after a few days i start to get a few blemishes.  Therefore I am a repeat buyer because anything that saves me a few skin issues is a must have in my book.  Also small easy to swallow gel caps.</li>
            <li> Came on time, as many softgells as stated. Hard to tell if it&#x27;s working though. If I notice a definite change, I&#x27;ll update the review but I think it&#x27;s one of those things you take in faith that it&#x27;s gonna prove benenficial in the long run. Which I think is the case.</li>
            <li> great for skin, heart and hair. The oil is very healing for the skin and one can mix it with other seential oils</li>
            <li> I purchase this product based on the reviews I read here, being taking it for a month now and am beginning to see some improvement. For starters, my skin is not as dry as it use to be, haven&#x27;t see any growth but my hair is softer, I will continue to use this product because I am happy so far.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and appears to have a finer texture.</li>
            <li> Really helps my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as promised. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been taking Sibu for a couple of months now.  It has helped me to have regular bowel movements without constipation. I take two gel caps daily as recommended. I also eat foods rich in fiber.</li>
            <li> It is the super berry.  Been taken it for years - well b/f Dr. Oz mentioned it.  Yes, it is pricey overall but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried the product for 2 months without apparent benefit (or side effect) so I decided to give it another 2 months.  The second supply that I purchased gave me nothing but wierd tasting burps.</li>
            <li> I used it for at least 5 month with absolutely no change in my skin or dry eyes. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product!! One day while in my local nutrition shop, a sales woman saw me looking at the omega oils and asked me if I&#x27;d tried the omega-7 sea buckthorn oil...I hadn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m always all about the hair and skin products- but she said something else that really piqued my interest. She mentioned it helps with vaginal dryness. As a young woman, you wouldn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have any issues with that, but sadly I do! Since my early/mid 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve struggled with it, and have used lubricants - but sometimes it&#x27;s just embarrassing and some boyfriends haven&#x27;t understood or dealt with it well - I guess thinking they&#x27;re doing something wrong.  I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s probably a mental thing...but hell, this stuff really works!! It could be a placebo effect, but maybe it just really does what it claims to do!  If it helps with my skin and hair too, then hot damn I&#x27;ve found my favorite supplement :)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice an extreme change in my skin and hair, but I use a lot of skincare products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the New Chapter omega-7 gel tabs at first, but switched to sibu after the first bottle (it&#x27;s significantly less expensive), and I believe it works much better!! I take it daily...and have not used lubricant once since I started taking it consistently in February!!! It&#x27;s truly liberating. I feel so much more confident, and sexy. I no longer have to stress about &amp;#34;am I ready to go?&amp;#34; before sex. My body was just not in the same place as my mind. I&#x27;m sure the stress was worsening the issue...so it&#x27;s nice to relieve that fear.  Sometimes I am truly shocked at how much moisture I&#x27;ve got going on now! So is my boyfriend, hahaa ;) we are BOTH happy campers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements obviously don&#x27;t work for everyone, but it works for me :) I&#x27;m 31 now, and I finally feel like a normal healthy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take a probiotic called Fem-dophilis by Jarrow Formulas...which has also worked miracles for balance issues. I take both daily, and things have never-ever-ever-ever been better downstairs, always fresh and ready to go when I am!! And I&#x27;ve never been more confident in myself.  Highly recommended!!!!nd things have never-ever-ever-ever been better downstairs, always fresh and ready to go when I am!! And I&#x27;ve never been more confident in myself.

            <li> I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis almost 5 years ago.  Since then I have followed the IC diet and I only drink water or herbal tea.  I also eat clean and do yoga and other forms of exercise.  My symptoms (burning) are always there only improving slightly over the last year.  Normally at night the burning seems to be worse and will also worsen if I feel stressed out.  I&#x27;ve had to take Ambein every night so I can fall asleep because the pain is so bad.  The only other drug I take is Hydroxyzine daily and Pyridium as needed.  I was told by a woman at a health food store to go on Sea Buckthorn Oil and try the New Chapter brand which was more then I could afford.  I ordered the Sibu brand just for the heck of it.  I finished my first 30 day supply yesterday.  I am happy to report that my bladder pain is almost completely gone.  From a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worse, my pain level for the last two weeks has been a minus one.  I haven&#x27;t felt this good in almost five years and I am totally off of Ambien.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s working!  I just ordered the 90 day supply.  I also have Rosacea but already have it under control with doxy and topical metro gel so I&#x27;m not noticing any difference just yet.</li>
            <li> Hi, I really worry about my product?? I purchested this about 20 days and nothing??? Can you please send me some information? I realy need this. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Still taking them and at 75 I feel pretty good</li>
            <li> I see improvement in the way my skin looks. I&#x27;m really liking this product!</li>
            <li> I had used this product for over three years with NO BREAK in use.  I had thought it the greatest thing EVER.  BUT after reading more on this product and considering my overall health I STOPPED using Omega 7.  In a nut shell, this is a live plant that lives in the ocean and in the desert.  It is a plant that kills other plants to survive and thrive.  Therefore, I found out that it depletes your muscles and causes a host of other issues which you can read about from others.  I NOW eat Macadamian Nuts, which are a NATURAL way to get Omega 7.  My doctor had warned me that herbal/alternative treatments for issues can have their own problems, and in this case he was right.  He had suggested internal HRT for me, which I did not like at all.  SO, PLEASE if you are considering Omega 7 pills, try Macadamian nuts for a healthy, non-invasive way to get your Omega 7 instead.  I am now excercising to try and build up my muscles after the three years on this plant!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t effective at all but it gets two star for good packaging</li>
            <li> I love these softgels.  So easy to swallow and soothing for the digestive process.  Also, helps to clear my Roseaca.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, I didn&#x27;t recieve it so I don&#x27;t know anything about it.  It sounds like something I would like to try.  Ignore the I hate it...I didn&#x27;t know how to say I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> My fingernails grow all one length. My skin has turned very soft and not dry. Hair is not falling out as much. I have more energy. In 3 months have lost 20 pounds and I am not dieting. I stopped taking them for a couple months. My fingernails started splitting. Skin dry. Tired. Is it these capsules? I think so. Will continue to always take 2 a day. As a sidenote. I now order directly from SIBU. The last 2 from Amazon the tamper seal was open half way around. Just my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts &amp; slow-healing skin for over 15 years. Working out made my skin even worse, so by the end of last summer I was really frustrated. I read about sea buckthorn &amp; noticed this brand was recommended. The oil &amp; serum helped, but the capsules are where I really see results. It literally heals from the inside out. I used Sibu Beauty&#x27;s sea buckthorn Omega 7 soft gels for about two months with amazing results. My skin cleared up better than it had in years! I&#x27;ve tried so many products, only seeing temporary improvements. Adult Breakouts can be caused by the skin&#x27;s inability to slough off dead skin cells. I used to try to combat this with scrubs &amp; peels that were probably too harsh. Within the first week or two I noticed my skin had a healthy glow with no flakiness whatsoever. I pretty much stopped using scrubs. If I had a few strays I just used a spot treatment. My acne cleared up 80% &amp; stayed that way as long as I took one a day. I was able to wear less makeup and not stress so much about &amp;#34;covering up&amp;#34; all the imperfections (Time saver + confidence booster!) Also my nails got stronger &amp; hair looked healthier. I think this product may help with energy, but I&#x27;ve also been taking other vitamins so it&#x27;s hard to tell. When I went to reorder I noticed that another brand contained double the amount of soft gels so I figured it would be a better deal. Bad idea! I&#x27;ve been taking 1-2 a day (I only needed 1 a day of Sibu&#x27;s) for almost 2 months with not much result. My nails still feel strong &amp; skin is moisturized, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as healthy and my breakouts came back full force. I&#x27;m not sure how the formula differs, but for me it just wasn&#x27;t as effective as Sibu. I have some capsules left of this other brand, but I just ordered 3 containers of Sibu. I can&#x27;t wait until they come in the mail &amp; I can get my Sibu skin back! :)</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with this product was that when I opened the bottle I found that several of the softgels were broken and the liquid had seeped out. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s typical with softgels but it was disappointing to know that I didn&#x27;t have the full 60.</li>
            <li> Now 71, my skin kept getting drier and drier....went thru gallons of moisturizers applying several times per day....since starting sea buckthorn, I can tell you there&#x27;s a big difference.....especially my face.....originally started buying it on their website.....since finding it on Amazon, I&#x27;m paying half now.</li>
            <li> I am combined 1 pill daily (less than their recommended amount but these are expensive in my estimation), along with the buckthorn oil &amp; facial cream.  I have rosacea and had read it best to attack the problem internally as well as externally.  My signs of my rosacea have diminished - to what extent this had verses the other 2 products, it is difficult to tell.  My fingernails have become stronger, an improvement I can attribute to this natural product. (I typically have weak, thin, easily broken nails).  Taking one pill a day has no negative side effects that I can determine in my regiment.  I have been taking this product for about 2 months - it does take time for its benefits to appear - give it time.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking these for three weeks, but I have already lost 5 additional pounds, have less dry itchy skin, and am noticing that my skin is clearing.  This has also helped reduce my cravings for junk food and sugar.  All a plus plus for me so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with these from whole foods but had issues from y&#x27;all. They&#x27;re expired bad pills.</li>
            <li> I must have this to stay acne free.  I take this and other omega product and have been staying acne free ever since.  Since I don&#x27;t eat read meat anymore, I felt I needed to get Omega or fat in some fashion after reading something.  It may be all in my head but acne that I was getting around my mouth are staying away from me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a wonderfull price. i will definately be a return customer. So glad I found you, Thank-you&lt;br /&gt;much</li>
            <li> Since using this product my liver enzymes have gone up. The doctor has asked me to stop using the product for 3 months to see if this is what is causing the flareup. Not sure I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Texture of my skin is smoother. Not sure what other benefits it may have in store. However, I do have a glow</li>
            <li> I STARTED TAKING THIS PRODUCT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND WOULD DEFINATLY RECOMEND THIS TO OTHERS!,LOVE,LOVE,LOVE AND LOVE. I ALSO LOVE THE SIBU OMEGA7  JUICE,WHICH I INCORPORATE INTO MY BREAKFAST SMOOTHIE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SIBU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive facial skin. I get angry red/flaky patches on either side of my nose and on my forehead. They are aggravated by alcohol/allergies/hot weather/cold weather/humid weather/products/lack of products...pretty much everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I have not noticed any benefits to my nails or hair, though I must follow up by saying I have only been taking half the recommended dosage due to the expense. However, the facial patches pretty much go away 100% on this softgel. I can tell the difference within a week or two of stopping taking them.&lt;br /&gt;Like any softgel, you occasionally get &#x27;the burps&#x27;...but if you&#x27;ve ever taken fish oil supplements and had fish burps, I tell you now that sea buckthorn burps are far less unpleasant/common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not seem to upset my tummy at half-dosage, which is another reason I started off at half, as many things (certainly most vitamins) make me queasy. They are FAR less costly on Amazon as they are on the site where I originally saw them, and thus far have been genuine. Having seen the results at half dosage, I will try the full dosage and see if I can&#x27;t get better hair/nails!</li>
            <li> Great for healthier looking hair and nails.  My hair is much shinier and nails look so much better.  I take just 1 a day even though it says to do 2.</li>
            <li> The website did not inform as to the dosage or # of capsules.  There are 30 capsules at 2 per day.  That seems very expensive for omega 7.  I would advise purchasers to price-shop carefully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the softgel supplement for about 2 weeks. I have notice I have more energy and my nails are getting stronger. I will be reordering. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Very Good Supplements which works and I can see the results</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over 6 months and found them on amazon for almost half price of what I had been paying and they are the original product.  I do not take them every day now but almost.  I read reviews that most people use them for hair and nails but that is  not what they work on for me.  I was unable to give blood for testing without my veins breaking due to previous chemo treatment and these have strengthened my blood vessels and helped my digestion so that I do not have issues with ulcers in spring and fall. They are plant based which is what I look for.  I love the product and have had no ill side effects from it that I can tell.</li>
            <li> My hair was growing I was loosing weight, and I honestly believe these pills helped me get pregnant me and my boyfriend were together for 2 years didn&#x27;t use condoms or anything. I started taking these a few weeks later I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li> I like this as it does what is says on the box. It maintains my balance specifically through the menopausal period. I will continue to take this product for as long as it keeps helping me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Have been taking capsules for about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I use the product  mainly for health maintenance  but have noticed improvements to hair nails and facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase from this supplier.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT--  IT CONTAIN  AN EXCELLENT AMOUNT OF OMEGA 7 I HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS  IT IS VERY GOOD TAKEN INTERNALLY BECAUSE IT HELPS  CONTROL OF, AND IT ALSO  MUCOUS  AND IT HELPS TO KEEP THE SKIN MOIST--I HAVE  SUGGESTED THIS TO  SEVERAL FRIENDS--IT TAKES ABOUT  THREE OR FOUR WEEKS FOR  THE PRODUCT  TO SHOW  IMPROVEMENT</li>
            <li> I have been taking 2 a day as directed and am almost at the end of the first month. I am in no position to evaluate them since I have been sick for the last month with a lingering deep chest cough. I accidentally ordered another supply because it was packaged differently and I thought I was ordering another of their products. I now have another month&#x27; supply and will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I just got this product so the review does not yet reflect how effective the product actually is, but I was disappointed to find the package did not have the 60 pills as advertised but instead only 54.  Sounds silly, but that is 3 days less product!  So we are talking 22 servings instead of 25.  I do not like to be cheated- will give an update on actual product later.</li>
            <li> Just an all around great product for MANY reasons! I take it for arthritis support and inflammation. this product helps for a myriad of symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just 3 weeks and notice that my stomach is flater and Im not as hungry</li>
            <li> These Capsules I take every day, they are so good for you and my hair and&lt;br /&gt;skin is not nearly as dry as it used to be.  Would recomment these for eveyone to try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve changed or feel different but then I&#x27;m only 1/4 of the way through the bottle. They don&#x27;t bother my tummy and are easy to take. I&#x27;ll post back when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> These made me break out when I took them so I stopped :/.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on Sea Buckthorn I decided to try it to help eliminate the occasional hormonal acne that I have.  Worst product I have ever used!  It caused me to break out in cystic acne which I never had before and they would not go away!  I then purchased M2 Skin Refining 20% serum along with the M2 Moisturizer and these 2 products helped calm my skin down and I rarely break out now after using the M2 products..</li>
            <li> Although I like the product (I orderedf 2 boxes, one of the containers did not have the protective covering, and at one of the capsules had burst causing a mess. I did not use the capsules from that box as I did not trust its safety.  I will not be using this seller again.</li>
            <li> This product has been really good for blood circulation. I bought this product for my mom and it has done wonders for her.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Sea Buckthorn! It has caused my hair and nails to be stronger.  My hair glistens in the sun when before it looked like straw and was falling out due to thyroid problems.  If you have problems with thinning, illustrious, straw-like hair, you should seriously consider using this for at least 3 months to see an amazing difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now.. I get comments on my healthy looking hair frequently.</li>
            <li> Last year I was suffering in a big way from rosacea and dry skin, I hated leaving the house. I had tried everything the doctor perscribed and had tried some  natural remedies too but nothing helped. One day I came across a review on sea buckthorn and I thought it was worth a try and I was right my rosacea is about 90% better now,  I also use the sea buckthorn oil on my dry skin and it works wonders for the dryness and irritation. I ran out of the capsules at one stage and almost immediately I could see and feel my skin getting worse again. Its not worth being without them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefits to this product and felt it was a waste of money.  No need to reorder</li>
            <li> This is the brand Dr Oz had on one of his shows. It works better than the capsules from the discount places but is not as potent as others. I was suprised to find these are a lower dosage than most others. The price was right however and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve settled on this product as I prefer the size of the capsules.  They are easier to take than all the others that have the oblong shape. 900MG per capsule you pay a little more than other brands, but this seller is the most economical. As the for substance itself I&#x27;ve been on sea buckthorn oil for about 3 or 4 months and there has been an improvement in hair growth and nail strength.</li>
            <li> all the SIBU stuff I used is excellent  - this vitamins work wonders for hair and skin, no other vitamins did so much good for me as these.</li>
            <li> I had been researching the Sea Buckthorn Berry for quite some time before I decided to try it. After looking over the various name brand supplements I decided upon the Sibu brand because I had used their skin care products before [the body lotion &amp; bar soap specifically]. Since using this bottle I have moved on to the New Chapter brand to see which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills come 60 to a bottle. It is a wide mouthed plastic container that is simple to open, close &amp; store. The bottle is clear so I recommend you keep it inside of the box it comes with, oils &amp; supplements are degraded by light. A cobalt or amber bottle would have been a better choice of packaging. Oils also absorb plastic esters eventually, so if you are going to keep these on the shelf awhile you might want to transfer them to something glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serving size is 2 soft-gels which contain 900mg of the Sea Buckthorn oil blend. The fruit oil is 720mg &amp; the seed oil is 180mg. There are no other additives or oils besides purified water, gelatin, &amp; vegetable glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of taking the supplements I noticed a dramatic improvement in my mucus membranes. My nose, mouth, eyes &amp; nether regions all are SUPER moisturized. This is a huge feat considering I wear contact lenses. I use my eye drops way less now &amp; my contacts don&#x27;t swirl around in my eyes any more! I highly recommend this for menopausal women because it lubricates ALL of your membranes... if you catch my drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been smooth, soft &amp; relatively blemish free but I do not normally have blemishes. I did develop a pimple during the month &amp; I broke open a pill and topically applied the Sea Buckthorn oil to it over night. It drastically reduced the size of the little bugger by the morning &amp; next day it was totally gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omega 7 is a rarer type of Omega that is difficult to get from foods so I highly recommend this product. Especially for women who have dryness issues! It is a bit expensivebut totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
