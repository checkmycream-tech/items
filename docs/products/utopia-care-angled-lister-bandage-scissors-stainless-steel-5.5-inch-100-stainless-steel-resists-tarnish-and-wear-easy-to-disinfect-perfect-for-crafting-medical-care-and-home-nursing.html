            <li> These are some decent quality bandage scissors that cut well. They are made in Pakistan and the surface finish isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, so I am deducting one star for that. Overall they are a pretty good deal at the price (4.99$) and a hell of a lot better than the cheap sheet metal stamped ones that you get to buy at the local Walmart for 6.99$. I bought them to integrate them into a first aid kit and they are prefect for that.</li>
            <li> First thing i did when i got my scissors was measure them. They are exactly 5.5 inches. perfect size for bandage cutting on anyone other than an infant. the tip guard is well formed and allows you to slide the tip under a bandage without hurting the person you are removing the bandage from. These are not meant to cut paper or anything like that. They have no gap between the blades like others i have seen making every cut count. Easily sterilized...just dip them in rubbing alcohol They come in a good durable pouch that will help keep them clean while in your first aid kit. I highly recommend these to anyone and everyone. I am glad i was able to get these at a discounted rate in return for my review although i would gladly pay the $5 they are asking for this great pair of bandage scissors.</li>
            <li> This product is used by my co-workers who think that its a very good product.  Very sharp and gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. I tent to lose these alot at work so expensive isn&#x27;t an option. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy delivery of the scissors. They work great and are perfect for nursing school and beyond. The blunt tip is necessary to not hurt the patient while doing things like wound care or taking off ID bracelets from previous hospitals or facilities. I love them!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat them! Came sharp. Iv already used them quite a bit at work and there are no problems I can find!</li>
            <li> very nice, sharp, well made</li>
            <li> Received scissors on schedule however they were not 5.5 inches in size as ordered. The quality of the scissors is good but the rating is based on receiving the incorrect size.</li>
            <li> Because scissors tend to grow legs and walk away on the job I needed a replacement set and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot so  I purchased these. Now that I&#x27;ve used them I am very pleased with their operation and quality. I would recommend them to anyone in the medical profession.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount in return for my unbiased opinion. We have needed a pair of these for our first aid kit. I always have to use my home sheers and then I get them all sticky with adhesive. These slide right underneath wrapped areas and cut the bandage off. Great for cutting the bandage before applying too! Just a must have for a first aid kit!</li>
            <li> Great scissors. Strong material and nice and small.  Fit into my scrub pockets really easily.</li>
            <li> Love these scissors.  They work wonderful.  I bought them to cut bandages off my horses leg and it just worked great.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Handy at work for sure</li>
            <li> They get the job done..eventually. Not as sharp as I thought, can be hard to cut tape</li>
            <li> Have not started usin it tho, but it looks very sturdy and neat, used it to cut a piece of cloth and it was as sharp as expected!</li>
            <li> I bought these, as they are suppose to cut through thick athletic tape, they dont.  Save your money.  A little pair of walmart kid scissors work better.</li>
            <li> I had a scissor like this for 10 years when I leant them to a fellow nurse and she forgot and I failed to get them back, I was heart broken for a week hoping she would return to my unit, or I would see her again. Nope. Gone. BUT AMAZON had extactly what I wanted, got them right away and they filled the hole in my heart....THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> Carry them in my fanny pack at work.</li>
            <li> These are not great scissors, they stick and have a cheap manufacturing feel to them.  If you need scissors that will be in constant use, get different pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Material is solid stainless steel, density is good.&lt;br /&gt;Good blade set. difficult to fit paper between blades but not impossible.&lt;br /&gt;Exterior surfaces are polished.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cutting surfaces show a lot of grooves that pull the overall quality to average.&lt;br /&gt;Sterilizing will require scrubbing or scouring, not just wipe-down.&lt;br /&gt;Country of origin appears to be Pakistan.</li>
            <li> Got these for my First Aid Kit and they are sharp and work perfect! You can&#x27;t beat the price either</li>
            <li> The scissors are lite weight and easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;. This makes them great to take on trips.&lt;br /&gt;I never leave on a trip without them.</li>
            <li> We purchased these for an alternate purpose than the intended use but they are working out well for our needs.  They seem to be quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> Lister scissors are a very useful tool for self and family first-aid care.  Made with a protective (blunt) bottom blade and used correctly will help cut material surrounding the skin without injury.  There are varies sizes but I use the 5.5 inch the most.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these surgical steel scissors for adult use only as with other objects.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. Very good.</li>
