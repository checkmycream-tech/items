            <li>but now it is nice again.</li>
            <li>They were a perfect match as replacements and the cost was a great bargain over other replacement heads that I could find for the Norelco shaver I had.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that parts are still available for the old shaver that I have.</li>
            <li>but those heads did not cut any better.....</li>
            <li>Blades seem to work ok, but eBay listing says &amp;#34;by norelco&amp;#34;,but then after you under them</li>
            <li>Bought this battery powered razor about 5 years ago and have not been able to get replacement heads until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My older Norelco is once again giving me great shaves.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth a shave, needs more going-over.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to shave reasonably again.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the whole order experience.</li>
            <li>NEW BLADES DO NOT CUT AS GOOD</li>
            <li>The razor seems work work fine still.</li>
            <li>Sound is very mild.  </li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>The fit my Phillip Razor, they work fine</li>
            <li>It does not give smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>an sent me another set free of charge....</li>
            <li>It was good to find these heads that will fit my current good shaver and the price was really acceptable.</li>
            <li>Fits fine, works well...came quickly..</li>
            <li>Works great, wonder why I waited so long to replace them.</li>
            <li>These new ones do not seem to shave as close to my skin as I experienced with the older heads.  </li>
            <li>AS THE USED ONES.WOULD BE BETTER TO BUY A NEW RAZOR !!</li>
            <li>The price was great and my old shaver works just like new again.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, but less good than OEM.</li>
            <li>The shaver head replacements fit exactly, were reasonably priced,  easy to order and</li>
            <li>so I am glad to have these new heads for my shaver.</li>
            <li>Came on time and I love the new heads.</li>
            <li>the fine print says &amp;#34;not norelco or not originall manufacturer.&amp;#34; I probably would have ordered from a different seller for $3.00 more.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>In general, I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>The original sound is sharp and strong when the blades rotate.  </li>
            <li>I thought by paying a little more I would get better results.</li>
            <li>They fit in my Norelco shaver as stated, they are much sharper than my old blades, and they are much cheaper than genuine Norelco blades.  </li>
            <li>The part came very fast.  </li>
            <li>Works the way it should, at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and no pulling now.</li>
            <li>fact, I bought a new one and was very dissatisfied-mostly because more plastic parts were used and these did not shave close enough at all.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t substitute for the real norelco blades.</li>
            <li>it worked but wasn&#x27;t expecting to pay so much..</li>
            <li>fast shipping to Canada.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>I would get the original one from Norelco next time.</li>
            <li>Clearly these are cheaply made, but they work better than dull blades.</li>
            <li>The previous set of shaver heads lasted more than 40 years.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these for an older electric razor for which we were told replacement parts were unavailable.  </li>
            <li>The new blades made the Norelco shave like a new razor again, thanks.</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for ever and wanted new blades</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that we will be able to figure it out.  </li>
            <li>You can buy a new shaver with the old style head</li>
            <li>These looked a little different on the bottom side but mounted in the shaver and worked just like new, even better.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my old Norelco shaver (about 5 years old now) to see if it was the heads being worn</li>
            <li>I needed these for my husbands old Norelco.....</li>
            <li>in fact, ny old ones were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have had old blades for years.  </li>
            <li>My original blades lasted decades, and had a spring-steel support tab for each little blade.  </li>
            <li>The difference between this replacement and the original is the missing lift and cut feature.  </li>
            <li>but the shaver is cheap and you only get a half of an hour shave from an 8 hour charge.</li>
            <li>First ones did not cut at all, and made slight buzz sound as if not perfect fit.</li>
            <li>finally just bought a new electric razor.....</li>
            <li>The cutter heads were not sharp and the shave requires a longer time.</li>
            <li>This set of shaver heads has the same design as the first shaver I bought and the heads lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li>the shaver outlet inc replacements were little better than shaving with a dull straight edge.  </li>
            <li>They were clearly glued in and the blue just gave way.  </li>
            <li>It brought my old razor back to life.</li>
            <li>Some of the heads are kind of expensive</li>
            <li>and you can buy a new shaver on sale for less than buying new heads.</li>
            <li>I have the same old shave back again.  </li>

            <li> I have the same old shave back again.  </li>
            <li> I see very little difference between the new blades and the old blades.  </li>
            <li> What is sad is the newer heads have all the fancy slots and holes and they do not cut a older guys beard worth a hoot.</li>
            <li> , now I have to wait and see how long they last.</li>
            <li> They get dull very qucik.  </li>
            <li> They were very responsive to my complaint</li>
            <li> The replacement heads shaved close and it has been  a long time since I have had a close shave.</li>
            <li> The only difference seems to be the missing Norelco logo.&lt;br /&gt;Update - recently the center discs inside the blades fell out.  </li>
            <li> It appears loose.  </li>
            <li> I only had it a short time and it is already dull.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> Been years and shaving was getting rough</li>
            <li> Simple to install and was using them within a few minutes!</li>
            <li> The other makes and  models I have seen lately are no better than this older model.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> This is a compatible product, not original one from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> shipping time was just a few days.</li>
            <li> I tried to find the heads in the store and they were not available</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t, and seem to have gone dull in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it seems like they were just on there for decoration, I am not sure.  </li>
            <li> No more irritation!</li>
            <li> This shaver head is not good at all.  </li>
            <li> , I guess it is because the razor is old, but $45.00 for 3 little heads are terrible !  </li>
            <li> , they arrived on time and they were not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but they were always expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> plus they are way to expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The fit my Phillip Razor, they work fine, they arrived on time and they were not too expensive.  Five stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for ever and wanted new blades but they were always expensive in the stores. These work and the cost was low</li>
            <li> The replacement heads arrived in a timely manner but they are not assembled and do not have any instructions with them.  We have not had the time to figure out how they should be put into the shaver yet.  I&#x27;m not sure that we will be able to figure it out.  This product may be going back.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only a very short time-about 2 weeks, every morning.  As of now, I like it.  The previous set of shaver heads lasted more than 40 years.  These new ones do not seem to shave as close to my skin as I experienced with the older heads.  Because it does not shave as close as I would like, I must go over and over the same areas until they are acceptable. This takes additional time, which is still acceptable. The other makes and  models I have seen lately are no better than this older model.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I bought a new one and was very dissatisfied-mostly because more plastic parts were used and these did not shave close enough at all.  I am very happy that parts are still available for the old shaver that I have.</li>
            <li> Fits fine, works well...came quickly..</li>
            <li> This is a compatible product, not original one from Norelco.  It does not give smooth shave.  I would get the original one from Norelco next time.</li>
            <li> Terrific replacement heads for my Norelco Electric Razor.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  They fit in my Norelco shaver as stated, they are much sharper than my old blades, and they are much cheaper than genuine Norelco blades.  The only difference seems to be the missing Norelco logo.&lt;br /&gt;Update - recently the center discs inside the blades fell out.  One by one over a period of a month.  They were clearly glued in and the blue just gave way.  Anyways, it seems like they were just on there for decoration, I am not sure.  The razor seems work work fine still. Clearly these are cheaply made, but they work better than dull blades.</li>
            <li> The part came very fast.  Parts came in good order and condition.  No complains about the vendor.    This part does not fit very well to my Philips HQ481 unit as stated.  It works but the RPM (revolutions per minute) is not the same.  It appears loose.  Sound is very mild.  The original sound is sharp and strong when the blades rotate.  It appears that the depth of the grabbers may be different.    The difference between this replacement and the original is the missing lift and cut feature.  This one is just a cut.  I did not call the vendor to see if the part was defective or not.</li>
            <li> Bought replacements for my norelco...the shaver outlet inc replacements were little better than shaving with a dull straight edge.  Learned my lesson on this one...don&#x27;t substitute for the real norelco blades.</li>
            <li> [...] Phillips/Norelco HQ4 Compatible Replacement Shaver Head. This shaver head is not good at all.  I only had it a short time and it is already dull.  Had I known this I would have not purchased it  This was purchased at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my old Norelco shaver (about 5 years old now) to see if it was the heads being worn that were causing a lot of extra pulling and irritation. Some of the heads are kind of expensive and you can buy a new shaver on sale for less than buying new heads. These looked a little different on the bottom side but mounted in the shaver and worked just like new, even better. No more irritation! The price was great and my old shaver works just like new again. The instructions say to replace the heads once a year and with these I don&#x27;t think I will hesitate to do so. I will buy these again if the rest of the shaver keeps holding up.</li>
            <li> Given as gift; recipient very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I needed these for my husbands old Norelco.....only place that had them....now has &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; razor. I would recommend this site for anyone looking for blades.</li>
            <li> my husband was very satisfied with the head replacement. The service was good and we got it sooner then we thought it would get here. Over all we are happy with Amazon..</li>
            <li> Garbage.  They are cheap and not the real thing.  They get dull very qucik.  I had to buy the real ones since these were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> First ones did not cut at all, and made slight buzz sound as if not perfect fit. They were very responsive to my complaint an sent me another set free of charge.... but those heads did not cut any better..... in fact, ny old ones were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally just bought a new electric razor..... a Braun this time</li>
            <li> it worked but wasn&#x27;t expecting to pay so much..I thought it would be all one piece.and no instructions to replace.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, good price, excellent quality.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly with my razor</li>
            <li> Works the way it should, at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> NEW BLADES DO NOT CUT AS GOOD AS THE USED ONES.WOULD BE BETTER TO BUY A NEW RAZOR !! I TRIED......</li>
            <li> Blades seem to work ok, but eBay listing says &amp;#34;by norelco&amp;#34;,but then after you under them the fine print says &amp;#34;not norelco or not originall manufacturer.&amp;#34; I probably would have ordered from a different seller for $3.00 more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the whole order experience. The shaver head replacements fit exactly, were reasonably priced,  easy to order and shipping time was just a few days. My older Norelco is once again giving me great shaves.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for an older electric razor for which we were told replacement parts were unavailable.  They work great.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  I have the same old shave back again.  Bought this battery powered razor about 5 years ago and have not been able to get replacement heads until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping to Canada.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The cutter heads were not sharp and the shave requires a longer time. Don&#x27;t scrimp on your face, it does matter</li>
            <li> Fits great in my Norelcos. Happy with these replacements.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads shaved close and it has been  a long time since I have had a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to shave reasonably again. Nice and sharp and no pulling now. I tried to find the heads in the store and they were not available so I am glad to have these new heads for my shaver.</li>
            <li> Came on time and I love the new heads. Been years and shaving was getting rough but now it is nice again.</li>
            <li> This set of shaver heads has the same design as the first shaver I bought and the heads lasted a very long time. What is sad is the newer heads have all the fancy slots and holes and they do not cut a older guys beard worth a hoot. You can buy a new shaver with the old style head but the shaver is cheap and you only get a half of an hour shave from an 8 hour charge. It was good to find these heads that will fit my current good shaver and the price was really acceptable. If the heads last an acceptable time I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> My original blades lasted decades, and had a spring-steel support tab for each little blade.  These don&#x27;t, and seem to have gone dull in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works very well. It brought my old razor back to life.</li>
            <li> The blades sometimes leave irritation marks.</li>
            <li> I have had old blades for years.  I see very little difference between the new blades and the old blades.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The new blades made the Norelco shave like a new razor again, thanks. Walter.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were shipped and recieved in a timely manner.  They were a perfect match as replacements and the cost was a great bargain over other replacement heads that I could find for the Norelco shaver I had.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were Norelco blades, they are not the lift and cut blades either. They do however, give a good shave, now I have to wait and see how long they last. In general, I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Good shaver heads.  They fit and worked worked perfectly and I will purchase another set when needed.  The price was good.</li>
            <li> I received a tiny cardboard box with the 3 cutters inside. No marks about the content. The package has not similarity with the blister showed. The cutters were compatible with the shaver.</li>
            <li> These blades are very good. Gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here...plus they are way to expensive, I guess it is because the razor is old, but $45.00 for 3 little heads are terrible !  I may see if I can find a different brand !!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good, but less good than OEM. Not as smooth a shave, needs more going-over.</li>
            <li> works fine. fast shipping</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and a great value.</li>
            <li> Simple to install and was using them within a few minutes! Works great, wonder why I waited so long to replace them.</li>
            <li> Bought cheaper ones before. They preformed as well as these. I thought by paying a little more I would get better results.</li>
