            <li> It&#x27;s light and not as dramatic as a fire engine red color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and stays on for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The orange-based red is a tiny bit sheer, but went opaque after 3 thin layers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dark</li>
            <li> so that was a little disappointing.</li>
