            <li>It is the best color of auburn that I have ever tried that  matches my red hair.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not always running out and searching for more.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find them anywhere else</li>

            <li>I have been using this product for many, many years.</li>

            <li>perfect color matching my colored hair-easy to use..sometimes red &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and that is my favorite shade.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years, but haven&#x27;t been able to find auburn in the stores.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for any shade of red or auburn hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Auburn color for over forty years and have never found any auburn eyebrow pencils that work better.</li>
            <li>Love Maybelline Expert Brow pencils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure us redheads will be out of luck</li>
            <li>So glad I found this...</li>
            <li>Thanks again for your most excellent and fast service.</li>
            <li>This is for more of a light reddish brown.</li>
            <li>So glad to find the original Maybelline auburn.  </li>
            <li>+ yr olds have a unique coloring)I&#x27;m glad to have found it .</li>
            <li>My delivery came quickly, packaged appropriately and all is well.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available to me.  </li>
            <li>So happy to have found this... Can&#x27;t believe maybelline would discontinue such a product!</li>
            <li>The auburn color is too light.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness Amazon had these available.</li>
            <li>and my eyebrows were too light.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair a vibrant red shade and this pencil matches perfect!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, long lasting and this color Auburn is perfect for my hair and complexion match</li>
            <li>I colored my hair auburn which is my original color</li>
            <li>This pencil is the perfect color - it looks totally natural for people who have auburn or red hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good color and matches up to my strawberry blonde and</li>
            <li>I was really glad to be able to try this product yet the color was too red for me to be comfortable with.</li>
            <li>Timeless - consistant, true to color as it has been for decades</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and exactly the color I want.</li>
            <li>Was saddened that Maybelline as well as most cosmetic companies have quit producing auburn eyebrow pencil, even as many hair color companies continue or expand their assortment of red tints.</li>
            <li>My friend who is my best and worst critic says it matches my hair perfectly</li>
            <li>The classic standby, and if you apply with short, feathery strokes, it looks great, and quicker than the powder type of product.</li>
            <li>These pencils go on very smoothly, and the color is so natural.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a smooth sale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried sooooo many other pencils of every brand name even the cheap ones!</li>
            <li>Sure it costs a little more</li>
            <li>Someone cautioned me that they would be old and crumble easily.  </li>
            <li>The product came quickly, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li>This is the only eyebrow pencil I have used for twenty five years or more.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>These are the only eyebrow pencils I have ever found that perfectly match my deep red hair.  </li>
            <li>Since coloring my hair red and with thinning eyebrows with lots of white in them, this red eyebrow pencil was perfect.</li>
            <li>What are the redheads of the world to do without it!!;)</li>
            <li>She said that it was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>she was super surprised when I sent these as a gift.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked a little old but it made me feel kind of lucky as I am told they are not manufactured anymore.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product did arrive fast.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product and, as usual, with the service of Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like these pencils, just the color I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>Auburn is only available online...</li>
            <li>each, which is way too much but redheads don&#x27;t have a lot of choices</li>
            <li>So I brought this because of the rating and fast shipping and the price.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a blonde brow pencil as well to get a more natural color and look.</li>
            <li>BIG THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that I guess it would be an okay product.</li>
            <li>I need a medium to dark auburn eyebrow pencil to better match my hair color.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair light auburn and these are the only natural looking eyebrow pencils that I have found.  </li>
            <li>The price is slightly high .  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these if you like this brand.</li>
            <li>Item as describe, shipping was to high.</li>
            <li>but your price is high........</li>
            <li>so few choices for us gingers:)</li>
            <li>All of the other colors are available.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find it even if I had to pay above the going rate for other colors that haven&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I was going store to store looking for this product and only here on Amazon could I find the only pencil for True Redheads.</li>
            <li>I love my Maybelline brow and eye pencils in auburn because I am a redhead and they are impossible to find in stores any more.  </li>
            <li>--most people are now making brown, black only.</li>
            <li>There certainly are enough redheads in the world who would purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am now a mature woman.</li>
            <li>old.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sell this color in stores anymore, though I&#x27;ve been seeing more redheads lately.</li>
            <li>I guess the profit margin just wasn&#x27;t big enough, and redheads didn&#x27;t matter enough for them to make these available anymore.</li>
            <li>Since it appears  to have been discontinued by Maybelline, it must be old inventory that is being sold.</li>
            <li>I found the color was more of a true red than the red color that usually reflects red hair.</li>
            <li>This shade of this wonderful pencil is impossible to find anymore!</li>
            <li>I can build the color to be as dense and dark, or light and thin, easily.  </li>
            <li>I keep the point super sharp to lightly feather in strokes to replace thin spots.  </li>
            <li>As a redhead this is the only color that looks even close to natural.  </li>
            <li>Do not know if it is do to possibly old product, but definitely can see the difference.</li>
            <li>They are the only color that looks natural and matches my hair color.</li>
            <li>This product has been around for years, but for some strange reason Auburn is no longer carried in the stores where you would normally expect to find it; Ulta, CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.  </li>
            <li>Suddenly Maybelline quit making Auburn and now only does blonde, light brown, brown and black...</li>
            <li>Though they were more expensive than other colors in Walmart they were worth the price to find what I needed.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead with blonde eyebrows and this is the only major brand that carries auburn.</li>
            <li>but they are 3 times as much as all the other colors....why?</li>
            <li>The pencils are very hard and the product does not apply easily.</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than any other product that I have seen that is made just for those with red hair.</li>
            <li>no other company makes this same exact shad and we have to pay more than ten times the price to get these is crap.</li>

            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil I have used for twenty five years or more.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> These are the only eyebrow pencils I have ever found that perfectly match my deep red hair.  </li>
            <li> Since coloring my hair red and with thinning eyebrows with lots of white in them, this red eyebrow pencil was perfect.</li>
            <li> What are the redheads of the world to do without it!!;)</li>
            <li> She said that it was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> she was super surprised when I sent these as a gift.</li>
            <li> The packaging looked a little old but it made me feel kind of lucky as I am told they are not manufactured anymore.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product did arrive fast.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and, as usual, with the service of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like these pencils, just the color I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> Auburn is only available online...</li>
            <li> each, which is way too much but redheads don&#x27;t have a lot of choices</li>
            <li> So I brought this because of the rating and fast shipping and the price.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a blonde brow pencil as well to get a more natural color and look.</li>
            <li> BIG THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that I guess it would be an okay product.</li>
            <li> I need a medium to dark auburn eyebrow pencil to better match my hair color.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair light auburn and these are the only natural looking eyebrow pencils that I have found.  </li>
            <li> The price is slightly high .  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these if you like this brand.</li>
            <li> Item as describe, shipping was to high.</li>
            <li> but your price is high........</li>
            <li> so few choices for us gingers:)</li>
            <li> All of the other colors are available.  </li>
            <li> So glad to find it even if I had to pay above the going rate for other colors that haven&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was going store to store looking for this product and only here on Amazon could I find the only pencil for True Redheads.</li>
            <li> I love my Maybelline brow and eye pencils in auburn because I am a redhead and they are impossible to find in stores any more.  </li>
            <li> --most people are now making brown, black only.</li>
            <li> There certainly are enough redheads in the world who would purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am now a mature woman.</li>
            <li> old.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this color in stores anymore, though I&#x27;ve been seeing more redheads lately.</li>
            <li> I guess the profit margin just wasn&#x27;t big enough, and redheads didn&#x27;t matter enough for them to make these available anymore.</li>
            <li> Since it appears  to have been discontinued by Maybelline, it must be old inventory that is being sold.</li>
            <li> I found the color was more of a true red than the red color that usually reflects red hair.</li>
            <li> This shade of this wonderful pencil is impossible to find anymore!</li>
            <li> I can build the color to be as dense and dark, or light and thin, easily.  </li>
            <li> I keep the point super sharp to lightly feather in strokes to replace thin spots.  </li>
            <li> As a redhead this is the only color that looks even close to natural.  </li>
            <li> Do not know if it is do to possibly old product, but definitely can see the difference.</li>
            <li> They are the only color that looks natural and matches my hair color.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for years, but for some strange reason Auburn is no longer carried in the stores where you would normally expect to find it; Ulta, CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly Maybelline quit making Auburn and now only does blonde, light brown, brown and black...</li>
            <li> Though they were more expensive than other colors in Walmart they were worth the price to find what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead with blonde eyebrows and this is the only major brand that carries auburn.</li>
            <li> but they are 3 times as much as all the other colors....why?</li>
            <li> The pencils are very hard and the product does not apply easily.</li>
            <li> The price was much lower than any other product that I have seen that is made just for those with red hair.</li>
            <li> no other company makes this same exact shad and we have to pay more than ten times the price to get these is crap.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I was very frustrated with the lack of availability of ANY brow makeup in auburn.  </li>
            <li> and i hate that they were discontinued because their new one is not the same color and more money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as the colour is too light for me, and unfortunately I bought two of them, so I guess I will have to move them on.</li>
            <li> The product wears all day long, but it will smudge if you slip up and touch your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> May daughter and I have used them for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to find a red eyebrow stick at a retail store, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because I usually feel that I am missing out because I use a product that is for light brown hair as I have been unable to find anything geared for redheads that is affordable.</li>
            <li> Sad that Maybellne quit making this color pencil and replaced it with some god-awfull auburn color that is nothing like the original auburn.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because I was a little disapointed that it was so red.</li>
            <li> However, the previous Amazon price of $9.99 was over double the price in stores</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and did not care for any.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find Auburn pencil in the stores, all other colors.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t apply well and the color is not right.</li>
            <li> have at least 12 brow pencils from here to there that haven&#x27;t a clue on what red pigment is for redheads</li>
            <li> (Browns are made with pigments that just aren&#x27;t as creamy as, for instance, black.)  </li>
            <li> Brownish black mascaras are black on me and look hideous.</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> They seemed dried out and didn&#x27;t apply as well.  </li>
            <li> This Auburn shade is not available in stores.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and the wrong makeup looks like halloween on us.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and have been using these eyebrow pencils for years, but have had trouble finding them in stores.  </li>
            <li> Versatile and I like it, still not sure why they D/C it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have been looking in my area for these for several years and unable to find them.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, this Auburn brow libber use to be redder before than used in past years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several because I am afraid they will run out.</li>
            <li> We poor redheads suffer the consequences.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> My mother was heart broken when they discontinued this color...</li>
            <li> they cost way too much--it is impossible to find an AUBURN pencil like the one (previously) made by Maybelline.  </li>
            <li> frustrating when it happens as difficult to remove</li>
            <li> Hate that Maybelline discontinued this color auburn, for us redheads, Have tried other brands, but none worked.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and have a difficult time finding eyebrow pencils in an auburn color.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why it is so difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive getting it through Amazon because of the shipping charges...</li>
            <li> I was so sad that they are being discontinued.  </li>
            <li> but I am force to buy it because its the only pencil I like, too bad is not on the stores!!!!</li>
            <li> I am an auburn haired person and could never find brow liner that wasn&#x27;t horrible, I had previously bought this at a store years ago-</li>
            <li> I had been desperately looking for these color</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; auburn colored eye brow pencil!</li>
            <li> very difficult to find auburn powders and pencils.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I was afraid Maybelline had discontinued them until I found them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I HATE WHEN THEY DO THAT</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> I had been desperately looking for these color and I was so happy when I saw that amazon.com had them I did not doubt for a second to order them. They arrived in great conditions and on time for that special date....BIG THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> The company, Maybelline, that makes the auburn pencil discontinued it. I  bought about 10-12/ 5-12 dollar pencils none were even close. I was estatic that yall had them.. ty ty ty ty ty ty</li>
            <li> Why are stores discontinuing this color? I am a natural redhead with blonde eyebrows and this is the only major brand that carries auburn. Thank god this seller has some left, I ordered a ton in case they are gone forever.</li>
            <li> Best brow color ever&lt;br /&gt;The auburn color is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Why why why did you stop making - selling this color brow pencil&lt;br /&gt;I have at least 12 brow pencils from here to there that haven&#x27;t a clue on what red pigment is for redheads&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m begging ya to bring the Maybelline auburn ( red) brow pencil</li>
            <li> This pencil is the perfect color - it looks totally natural for people who have auburn or red hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this product available to me.  It has virtually disappeared from the store shelves.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil I have used for twenty five years or more. The Auburn color is perfect for my skin and hair color. The problem is I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere. I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon. Sure it costs a little more but I don&#x27;t care I Love It and I Need It. I knew I could find it here. Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love these Maybelline Auburn eyebrow pencils. I have used them since I was a teenager and I am now a mature woman. Suddenly Maybelline quit making Auburn and now only does blonde, light brown, brown and black...We poor redheads suffer the consequences. I was so happy to find these and I am still on a hunt for more.&lt;br /&gt;These are the \\&quot;expression\\&quot; in my face!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this auburn Maybelline pencil since I&#x27;ve been 14 yrs. old.  It is the best color of auburn that I have ever tried that  matches my red hair.  I&#x27;ve using this pencil for 53 years.  I&#x27;m so happy I can still purchase it.  The price is slightly high .  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this eyebrow pencil in auburn but Maybelline discontinued it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something comparable.  Believe me,  I&#x27;ve tried many others; inexpensive and expensive.  I&#x27;m thrilled I found it because this is the best!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this color in stores anymore, though I&#x27;ve been seeing more redheads lately. It&#x27;s a good color and matches up to my strawberry blonde and my daughters cherry red hair. Versatile and I like it, still not sure why they D/C it in stores.</li>
            <li> I hope Amazon never stops carrying this product. I was going store to store looking for this product and only here on Amazon could I find the only pencil for True Redheads. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love my Maybelline brow and eye pencils in auburn because I am a redhead and they are impossible to find in stores any more.  I like the fact that there are two in the package so I&#x27;m not always running out and searching for more.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001DMPAVI Maybelline Expert Eyes Twin Brow &amp; Eye Pencils, Auburn]]  I color my hair light auburn and these are the only natural looking eyebrow pencils that I have found.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I had searched every store possible, only to find out that Maybelline discontinued this product. I was not happy. The only local stores I can find any auburn pencil in are beauty supply stores, such as Sally&#x27;s and Bestway and the pencils they have are overpriced for the quality you get. They don&#x27;t apply well and the color is not right. I color my hair a vibrant red shade and this pencil matches perfect!! So glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> I actually use it as a lip liner with my orange. coral, and copper, bronze lip colors</li>
            <li> So glad to find the original Maybelline auburn.  As with any brownish colors, I generally warm this pencil before application.  (Browns are made with pigments that just aren&#x27;t as creamy as, for instance, black.)  Most importantly, I was very frustrated with the lack of availability of ANY brow makeup in auburn.  Maybelline now has come out with an auburn pencil, but it&#x27;s not the same color.  I don&#x27;t know why they pulled this one from the shelves.  I guess the profit margin just wasn&#x27;t big enough, and redheads didn&#x27;t matter enough for them to make these available anymore.</li>
            <li> As Maybelline no longer manufactures Expert Eyes Twin Brow and Eye Pencil in auburn, I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s easy to apply and exactly the color I want. Why Maybelline stopped making this product I have no idea. They need to bring it back.</li>
            <li> They seemed dried out and didn&#x27;t apply as well.  Since it appears  to have been discontinued by Maybelline, it must be old inventory that is being sold.</li>
            <li> yes i ordered three packs and i hate that they were discontinued because their new one is not the same color and more money. no other company makes this same exact shad and we have to pay more than ten times the price to get these is crap.</li>
            <li> Snapped these up when I heard they were discontinuing the &amp;#34;Auburn&amp;#34; shade. The classic standby, and if you apply with short, feathery strokes, it looks great, and quicker than the powder type of product.</li>
            <li> These are the only eyebrow pencils I have ever found that perfectly match my deep red hair.  Two pencils last me about one year of daily eyebrow filling in.  The product applies well and evenly.  I keep the point super sharp to lightly feather in strokes to replace thin spots.  I like that I can build the color to be as dense and dark, or light and thin, easily.  The product wears all day long, but it will smudge if you slip up and touch your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Sad that Maybellne quit making this color pencil and replaced it with some god-awfull auburn color that is nothing like the original auburn.  However, the previous Amazon price of $9.99 was over double the price in stores and NOW IT IS over $13.  Gouge?</li>
            <li> This product did arrive fast. I was happy with the price. The packaging looked a little old but it made me feel kind of lucky as I am told they are not manufactured anymore. The price was much lower than any other product that I have seen that is made just for those with red hair. The product was great, I had no problem with quality or anything else. I gave it 4 stars only because I was a little disapointed that it was so red. It&#x27;s funny because I usually feel that I am missing out because I use a product that is for light brown hair as I have been unable to find anything geared for redheads that is affordable. I was really glad to be able to try this product yet the color was too red for me to be comfortable with. I found the color was more of a true red than the red color that usually reflects red hair. It&#x27;s worth a try but I don&#x27;t think it would be for everyone.</li>
            <li> MY ALL TIME FAVORITE EYEBROW PENCIL CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THEY DISCONTINUED THIS COLOR! UGG I HATE WHEN THEY DO THAT</li>
            <li> I cannot believe Maybelline discontinued this color.  As a redhead this is the only color that looks even close to natural.  Thank goodnees for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using maybelline eyebrow pencils for over 30 years, wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and have a difficult time finding eyebrow pencils in an auburn color.  These pencils go on very smoothly, and the color is so natural.  I love them!</li>
            <li> Since coloring my hair red and with thinning eyebrows with lots of white in them, this red eyebrow pencil was perfect. I have not been able to find them anywhere else and so I am happy to find it here. Just what you would expect in an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> My favorite, prefect coverage every time. It&#x27;s not cakey and it&#x27;s the perfect color for many shades of red hair. Why would they ever discontinue it?!</li>
            <li> Have used for  years.</li>
            <li> Hate that Maybelline discontinued this color auburn, for us redheads, Have tried other brands, but none worked. Impossible to find a red eyebrow stick at a retail store, so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for years, but for some strange reason Auburn is no longer carried in the stores where you would normally expect to find it; Ulta, CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.  I can&#x27;t imagine why it is so difficult to find.  All of the other colors are available.  There certainly are enough redheads in the world who would purchase this product.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  This is the best product of its kind and Amazon is the only place I can find it.  Very satisfied with the product and, as usual, with the service of Amazon.</li>
            <li> As a redhead, I have used this color of eye brow pencil for years.  Then Maybelline discontinued it and this was the only place I could find this color.  Someone cautioned me that they would be old and crumble easily.  Not true.  They are in pristine condition and I love them.</li>
            <li> I put color in my hair and had looked everywhere for eyebrow pencils to match my hair and these are perfect !!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as the colour is too light for me, and unfortunately I bought two of them, so I guess I will have to move them on.</li>
            <li> I have been looking in my area for these for several years and unable to find them.  I finally thought maybe I should try AMAZON.COM, I seem to find most things I&#x27;m looking for there and lo and behold there they were</li>
            <li> This color is the best one that I have ever found(red-headed 60+ yr olds have a unique coloring)I&#x27;m glad to have found it . It is a bit expensive getting it through Amazon because of the shipping charges...This Auburn shade is not available in stores.</li>
            <li> This eye pencil is great. I use it with a blonde brow pencil as well to get a more natural color and look. The pencil sharpens great. Two pencils in one is a great deal. I will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Auburn Eyebrow Pencil</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!...I wish it was still sold n store....</li>
            <li> I use Auburn eye brow pencil and Maybelline has discontinued the color. It could not be found in retails stores, so I went on line. I tried other brands and did not care for any. The price was a bit inflated, but I did not mind and it was not outrageous. My delivery came quickly, packaged appropriately and all is well. I probably have enough to last until I go gray!</li>
            <li> This shade of this wonderful pencil is impossible to find anymore! I&#x27;m so glad you have this item.  I ordered 2 sets and plan to order more!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years. Was saddened that Maybelline as well as most cosmetic companies have quit producing auburn eyebrow pencil, even as many hair color companies continue or expand their assortment of red tints.</li>
            <li> I am an auburn haired person and could never find brow liner that wasn&#x27;t horrible, I had previously bought this at a store years ago- now I can get at amazon</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil color that works for me.  Being able to get this discontinued color is great!!  I would recommend it for anyone who is between blonde and brunette--blonde doesn&#x27;t work and brown doesn&#x27;t work, but auburn is perfect!  The product came quickly, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Auburn eye pencils for years with no luck.  I had even been told by several cosmetic counters that the color had been discontinued.  Just imagine my surprise when I searched your site and, low and behold, there they were.  Thanks again for your most excellent and fast service.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for me I will be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the color &amp;#34;Auburn&amp;#34; in any stores so I thought I&#x27;d try Amazon and there it was!  I&#x27;m so happy I found it!!  Always pleased with Maybelline products!!</li>
            <li> The product is very good and glad you had it as maybelline has stopped producing it apparantly and my wife is a red head and still loves this color.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this Auburn brow libber use to be redder before than used in past years.  Do not know if it is do to possibly old product, but definitely can see the difference.</li>
            <li> very difficult to find auburn powders and pencils.&lt;br /&gt;Love them but they are 3 times as much as all the other colors....why?</li>
            <li> It was perfect for me. I can&#x27;t find Auburn pencil in the stores, all other colors. Gave up ordered on internet.</li>
            <li> Timeless - consistant, true to color as it has been for decades</li>
            <li> I really like these pencils, just the color I wanted and needed. Product glides on perfectly and is not waxy feeling. Has staying power also. Glad there are two in a pack,but I will be ordering more. I highly recommend these if you like this brand.</li>
            <li> perfect color matching my colored hair-easy to use..sometimes red &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; flakes off onto skin around eyes..frustrating when it happens as difficult to remove</li>
            <li> Auburn is only available online...and that is my favorite shade. I am delighted to be able to get it, I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this... Can&#x27;t believe maybelline would discontinue such a product! What are the redheads of the world to do without it!!;)</li>
            <li> The pencils are very hard and the product does not apply easily. Other than that I guess it would be an okay product.</li>
            <li> I wish Maybelline never discontinued this color! Thanks for a smooth sale.</li>
            <li> The auburn color is too light.  I need a medium to dark auburn eyebrow pencil to better match my hair color.  This is for more of a light reddish brown.</li>
            <li> I like this color, but maybelline doesn&#x27;t make it anymore thus it is now $10 each, which is way too much but redheads don&#x27;t have a lot of choices--most people are now making brown, black only.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years, but haven&#x27;t been able to find auburn in the stores.  So glad to find it even if I had to pay above the going rate for other colors that haven&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pencils for almost 20 years.  They are perfect for any shade of red or auburn hair.  They are the perfect shade for those with fair/freckled skin.  They stay on even in the water and after sweating.  I was so sad that they are being discontinued.  I was so happy to see them here.  I hope that I can find a product that can come close to replacing them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I also know we need it in our stores until women quit wanting to having their hair colored red or auburn.  I have mentioned before about being told how this lady could tell when a woman had colored her hair auburn.  That comment was:  Her eyebrows are always brown.  That is not how I want mine to be.  I want it to tie in with or blend with my coloring of make up and clothing.  Why do auburns have to be left out.  The basic hair colors will give the retailers a big clue as to what is selling.  Therefore their model stock needs to reflect their customers needs for colors of products that adds to how they/we present ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;Sarah M. Robinson</li>
            <li> Item as describe, shipping was to high.</li>
            <li> So glad I found these! My mother was heart broken when they discontinued this color... she was super surprised when I sent these as a gift.</li>
            <li> If you have auburn or reddish hair this is the one and only place to find these anymore.  May daughter and I have used them for a long time.  I was afraid Maybelline had discontinued them until I found them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Auburn color for over forty years and have never found any auburn eyebrow pencils that work better. However Maybelline is discontinuing this product so I paid three times the cost . The regular price is $2.96 and I paid $8.96 which ticked me off. But I bit the bullet and bought enough to last the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; auburn colored eye brow pencil! This one is and I love it!!</li>
            <li> love it!!!! but your price is high........but I am force to buy it because its the only pencil I like, too bad is not on the stores!!!!</li>
            <li> Love Maybelline Expert Brow pencils.  Very easy to apply, long lasting and this color Auburn is perfect for my hair and complexion match</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy that this product could still be located. She said that it was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom; she loves them!</li>
            <li> I could not find auburn pencils anywhere. These came in a timely manner. Though they were more expensive than other colors in Walmart they were worth the price to find what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and the wrong makeup looks like halloween on us. I tried sooooo many other pencils of every brand name even the cheap ones! Horrible! Thank goodness Amazon had these available. I ordered several because I am afraid they will run out. These are as great! Maybelline messed up when they discontinued it!! Now if I can just find a really good waterproof mascara in auburn or brown that is really, for real a GOOD or even GREAT mascara. Brownish black mascaras are black on me and look hideous. Amazon, I am going to keep looking. Thank you for having what I needed!!</li>
            <li> Got my pencils today----I am very happy---even tho&#x27; they cost way too much--it is impossible to find an AUBURN pencil like the one (previously) made by Maybelline.  I&#x27;m sure us redheads will be out of luck soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for now---THANKS!!!!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this...so few choices for us gingers:)</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and have been using these eyebrow pencils for years, but have had trouble finding them in stores.  They are the only color that looks natural and matches my hair color.</li>
            <li> We redheads need brow color, why did Maybelline stop producing this shade is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I colored my hair auburn which is my original color and my eyebrows were too light.  So I brought this because of the rating and fast shipping and the price.  OH my so worth it. My friend who is my best and worst critic says it matches my hair perfectly and you don&#x27;t see my eyebrows before you see me.</li>
