            <li> I can go to Wal Mart, KMart, Shop Ko, and Target and buy them for half the price you have listed.</li>
            <li> These things suck, they don&#x27;t look anything like the package or smell or taste a little bit like skittles</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>

            <li> Kids loved these for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used them as a kid, and now that my lips are chapped I thought of it. Everyone loves lip smackers</li>
            <li> These things suck, they don&#x27;t look anything like the package or smell or taste a little bit like skittles</li>
            <li> These lip balms actually taste like Skittles!!  They taste really good AND they really make my lips feel moisturized (until I lick it off O_O).</li>
            <li> Total honesty here: I wasn&#x27;t cool enough to kiss girls in middle school. But if I was, this is what I imagine it would have been like. Beats the &amp;#34;wax flavor&amp;#34; of many lip balms. Seems to do the job I need it to.</li>
            <li> Love these skittles lip balms they taste amazing the flavors are such an eye opener I really love everything except one thing the caps are so hard to put back on they always slip but other than that I love these</li>
            <li> Very useful as a stocking stuffer; delicious flavors.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my daughter, and for my work with pediatrics!! Great flavors to choose from!</li>
            <li> It was for my granddaughter. She loved the colors!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my wife; given she goes through chapstick like nobody&#x27;s business. We have tried two chapsticks already and they smell and taste just like Skittles! In fact, the kiss-to-chapstick ratio has dramatically increased since she started using the Lip Smackers. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but this is actually a very good lip gloss! It stays on a pretty long time compared to others I&#x27;ve tried and keeps your lips moist and soft. If the weather&#x27;s warm, the stick can get a little too soft and make the plastic container sticky -- but that&#x27;s my only complaint. I really like this stuff! It&#x27;s a real bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Got them for my boyfriend and he loved it. Super fast and a great buy. I recommend this product for people of any age. The Chapstick is the best and it also smells great. The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one on, but I like them so far!. They look good, smell good, and they stay on for a long time!!! I really like them!</li>
            <li> Bonnie  bell  chap stick  great  flavors  ,great  for kids and adults ,it  came on time, i  love it.  it  is  good for the winter and the spring and summer and  fall for your lips,</li>
            <li> I bought these for  &amp;#34;throwback&amp;#34;-themed favor bags. They were a HUGE hit, and everyone loved them. Just as good as I remembered them from middle school :)</li>
            <li> These are the best when it comes to lip balm, but ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THE PRICE? I can go to Wal Mart, KMart, Shop Ko, and Target and buy them for half the price you have listed. Shame on you Bonnie Bell!</li>
            <li> They smell good and they are very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Just great, It was like I was expected, great smell, great color :)</li>
            <li> This product is the best!! It tastes and smells so real. Especially the lime and banana. I would so by again</li>
