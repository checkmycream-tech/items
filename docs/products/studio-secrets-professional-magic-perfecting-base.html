            <li>I love Loreal products!!!!</li>
            <li>However, if you arent in that predicament this is the BEST product I have ever used for the purpose of &#x27;concealing&#x27; blemishes that are existent.  </li>

            <li>When I purchased it I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be so wonderful!</li>
            <li>This product is not the best primer on the market.  </li>

            <li>but when I took it off at the end of the day I had SO MANY PIMPLES!!!!!</li>
            <li>But I guess the best way to describe it is that it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re editing a picture</li>
            <li>This primer worked perfect with my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>What a great find for a drugstore brand primer!</li>
            <li>As a helpful tip, I&#x27;ve learned at the MAC cosmetics counter that the ring finger is best for application as it applies the lightest pressure when using it.</li>
            <li>Excellent my wife loves</li>

            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments about how great my make up looks when I use this.</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m so happy</li>

            <li>I love this Cream!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>It was very nice.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my gym bag &amp; it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels, and then my foundation just went on flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Really great makeup for a good price.</li>
            <li>Excellent, love it.  </li>
            <li>Nice to find a drug store product that works so well!</li>
            <li>so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that.</li>
            <li>Great product with amazing coverage.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after researching good primers and came across this.</li>
            <li>Loved the product.</li>
            <li>It even looks good with powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Really good primer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d end up forgetting primer for good.</li>
            <li>but it is good.</li>
            <li>It took the shine away, and looked good.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and leaves your complexion looking flawless.  </li>
            <li>It did make my skin feel good and silky...</li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t good was the skin break-out</li>
            <li>this product is good, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look good when I opened it.</li>
            <li>For your information I am 28, not a lot of sun damage with fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth leaving face flawless.</li>
            <li>I do not have good skin.  </li>
            <li>I have no clue what type of the skin the people have who gave this product good reviews.</li>
            <li>However, I had a good start with this product and am still using it for 2 weeks already without breaking out.</li>
            <li>Good control on my oily skin from running my make-up away.</li>
            <li>and I loved the way it smoothed my skin.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>super happy with this product!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very good, cheap primer</li>
            <li>Love this goes great between my moisturizer and sunscreen .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very interesting and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before  and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice, silky texture, and good coverage.</li>
            <li>One of the best primer I am using right now.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth flawless look this gives me!!</li>
            <li>for sure!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Just wish they would give me more for my money!</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I was really glad when I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on so much better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I had tried a couple other and this is the best product and the best price.  </li>
            <li>I am 47, and I love what this product does to my skin!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the feel!</li>
            <li>so this works perfectly to fill the large pores so that my tinted moisturizer doesn&#x27;t fill in and harden.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this is the best part; it feels like rubbing pure silky goodness into your face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I cannot say the finish is just as amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>The product itself is nice.  </li>
            <li>If you have nice skin with no acne, then buy this, but if you plan on using foundation and concealer and stuff, skip it and find another primer.</li>
            <li>I honestly could not tell the difference while using the product.</li>
            <li>It absolutely makes for a flawless look and lasts alllll day!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Again, my makeup applied wonderfully and I didn&#x27;t have much oil breakthrough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard so much about primer being the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use a lot to cover your face, and it really does feel great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will work for those who don&#x27;t require a plethora of effective.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets is a product every woman should own.</li>
            <li>even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li>make-up goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having issues finding a foundation I liked, so</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own brand of this.</li>
            <li>Till now, nice touch.</li>
            <li>It primes your skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have it smoothed over while I wait for anti age creams to take effect.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have it smoothed over while I wait for anti age creams to take effect.</li>
            <li>We even went to the beach for a full day and my makeup was still great.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cover the fine lines like DHC&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good primer for years as I don&#x27;t want concealer to get into my fine lines</li>
            <li>This is by far the best primer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>4 Stars for this amazing product :)</li>
            <li>Excellent primer for my 50+ year old skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is meant for naturally greasy skin which is why some have not had the best of luck with it.</li>
            <li>On my best skin days, this makes my skin look luminous and young.  </li>
            <li>Use it on pores to make them disappear, blur fine lines and crepey areas, great as a smooth highlight on your chin, remove lip creases, lessen nasolabial or glabela lines, .</li>
            <li>After putting on Bare Minerals, my face looks flawless!</li>
            <li>it feels very smooth on face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the day, I touched my face and it felt very smooth, like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It made my skin very smooth looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>It hides your pours and makes your face look very smooth, it even softens wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Feels very light weight.</li>
            <li>It also creates a very smooth surface to apply cover-up to.</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned</li>
            <li>In my opinion it rubs on very smoothly and has not clumped up or balled up on my face one bit.</li>
            <li>but it does an amazing job filling in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t conceal all of my pores and fine lines, but does an amazing job keeping that oil at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Huge impact!</li>
            <li>This worked OK</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many primers so I don&#x27;t have tons to compare this to</li>
            <li>and I have not been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the matt finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product glides on smoothly and feels nice on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too Faced is pricey, but it works better than the Loreal.    </li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice smooth silky face primer when I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>But the product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love it and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li>It will give you a great start, and it is gentle with your skin.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get much better for under $10.</li>
            <li>Love the texture.</li>
            <li>I do not know the magic is .</li>
            <li>I have used Smashbox&#x27;s, which I love</li>
            <li>The best product to actually do what it says it will.</li>
            <li>The results are magical and I can&#x27;t believe what a difference there is between before and after.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews on this product, and hearing many people suffered breakouts from it worried me.</li>
            <li>I love that this primer makes me look semi poreless which I love</li>
            <li>I love this perfecting base/primer for a couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied it mostly under my eyes and saw no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Most of my beauty products are Reviva.</li>
            <li>Without makeup, my skin didn&#x27;t look much different, but my makeup applied perfectly</li>
            <li>Okay, I had never used a primer before.</li>
            <li>but it surely didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Nice satiny smooth finish, under make up or alone.  </li>
            <li>Then even the cheapie foundations look a lot better on your skin.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Eye wrinkles look better.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product for reducing the size of my pores and creating a smooth surface before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>SOME HOW DIFUSES FOUDATION BETTER,</li>
            <li>Additionally, my foundation now does a better job of covering up imperfections and discolorations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say lotion helps more.</li>
            <li>So I personally love this primer</li>
            <li>And it makes much more easier to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>It closes my pores, gives my skin a smooth matte finish, even hides blackheads!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>They would clog my pores and I would start to get acne, or when I would sweat it would start streaking, so I  just gave up on most makeup all together.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I would still say that it is better than most of this type of product.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay... leaves residue on your face.</li>
            <li>I usually love this stuff</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite primer,</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since it came out, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It does everything it says it will do and more.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I needed to look for something more afforable.  </li>
            <li>I think they need to come up with a better dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I used a makeup sponge to apply this primer, and it works much better than using my fingers.  </li>
            <li>, i waited till my order was more than $25</li>
            <li>The results are simply stunning...</li>
            <li>The jar is not the most convenient and sanitary form to retrieve product&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite primers for summer time when my makeup tends to melt off my face.</li>
            <li>The makeup just sits on top and stay put</li>
            <li>I need to play around with it some more though.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It worked for more than 9 hours.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s more than just a primer.</li>
            <li>i had tried so many, i figured i&#x27;d give this a go as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love the texture of this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this a while back after hearing about how wonderful primer can be for your makeup routine.  </li>
            <li>Much more product for the money as well.  </li>
            <li>and I am okay.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly and my makeup applies nicely over top.</li>
            <li>Better than smashbox&#x27;s primer in my opinion..</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase the primer with an instore coupon</li>
            <li>so use this mostly on the drier bits of my face, eyelids, cheeks, nose area.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it makes you look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am still self concious about my skin, but Loreal products make me feel a lot better about it.</li>
            <li>Minimizes pores, keeps oily skin matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li>and I love this one.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like the awkwardness of the jar -- it probably would&#x27;ve been better if they put this in a tube.</li>
            <li>It works better for me as a primer, and it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This stays on better than powder.</li>
            <li>I have used and love this product but one purchased here appeared to have been opened.</li>
            <li>Just make sure on the cleansing part at the end of the day as makeup tends to stick on more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have found cheapy primers that work much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>** better be magical\\</li>
            <li>&quot;    I am quite pleased with it, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture of it...</li>
            <li>Still, this is my favorite primer.  </li>
            <li>15 minutes after I apply my foundation you still have to wear powder on top</li>
            <li>Love this suff.</li>
            <li>It covers up my texture issues and most of my pore issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make sure this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s in a jar, I have to be more concerned about bacteria.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>decided to read up on reviews on Amazon #love Amazon# for primers</li>
            <li>Love that girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite.</li>
            <li>and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment.</li>
            <li>Love that stuff</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MORE THING..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>However, for light skin this is nice under my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my complexion.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day, my face looks as good as it does right after I&#x27;ve applied my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased the primer because I needed help to keep my T zone from having that oily skin look and the primer works great.</li>
            <li>and I feel this is a Great product for any age not just older women.</li>
            <li>Skin feels SOOOO SOFT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is great for my skin, specially for my nose because it get pretty oily.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t resemble the original L&#x27;Oreal primer at all!</li>
            <li>Then apply product to your moistorized face. &#x3D;] Should blend fairly easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>It just smoothes everything out so nicely, that often, I&#x27;ll just wear this with a quick powder to run out for errands.</li>
            <li>and it goes on so much more easily.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my dry parts of the face look flawless and not cakey</li>
            <li>I get told so much how beautiful my skin is and how lucky I am.</li>
            <li>I use this under a light foundation or powder for a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Right after application my skin looks pretty good, a nice glow etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works fine for some, but with my reaction, it makes me nervous to try a face primer</li>
            <li>This is the first primer I have ever tried, so there might be better ones out there, but for the price, I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>The product arrived in very good condition, shipping was fast and was exactly what I had imagined.</li>
            <li>After it sets, the skin feels hydrated, smooth and a bit more even (it fills in wrinkles and pores).  </li>
            <li>THIS IS GREAT FOR AFRICA AMERICAN/BLACK, MATURE, AND WOMEN WITH SKIN CONDITIONS.</li>
            <li>your makeup will even go on more smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I feel like if this primer was thinned out and easier to smooth over an area it could work better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing is that I got no breakouts whatsoever, and I am very prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Loved the product SO much.</li>
            <li>Overall seems a good product!</li>
            <li>I did the best I could with it, but refused to leave the house that day due to embarrassment over the streaky, unblended crapola I was wearing.</li>
            <li>My concealer smooths on easily over it and my mineral powder settles onto my face evenly.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly.</li>
            <li>the product arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>You could easily go without a foundation after application of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>People have commented about my skin looking so good, which is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>I use a mineral makeup foundation and saw no difference in the fine lines under my eyes when using the Loreal primer.      </li>
            <li>look of fine lines &amp; pores.</li>
            <li>it just smooths over any fine lines and they are almost invisible after application.</li>
            <li>It smoothes the skin by filling in fine lines or pores.</li>
            <li>It makes my fine lines look smoother and my face looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise fine</li>
            <li>However, now that my face is aging, I have been looking for a product to help lock in the moisturizer to keep the elasticity in my face, smooth/improve the surface/texture of my skin, and minimize fine lines.</li>
            <li>If anything, it made my skin become oily more quickly than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does go on very smooth and immediately makes the skin feel nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It fills in the fine line and wrinkles thus helping you appear more youthful and fresh.</li>
            <li>It did nothing to disguise or smooth the extremely fine lines under my eyes, nor did it do anything to smooth my pore-filled nose.</li>
            <li>I also have huge pores and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and huge pores.</li>
            <li>My makeup stayed in place and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy which is a HUGE plus for me.    </li>
            <li>Huge mistake.</li>
            <li>It feels light.</li>
            <li>So that my makeup would have an all over smooth look.  </li>
            <li>This helps even out my skin tone a bit and does a great job of making my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of Estee Lauder and also bought Reviva&#x27;s Primer.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-wasn&#x27;t smooth</li>
            <li>There are light reflectors in it</li>
            <li>There is no way I would walk out the house with just this on and no base or powder.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>But overall, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Does not apply evenly or smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tick but goes on the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, it feels like silk and it helps your makeup stay in place, but I noticed that if you rub it too much when applying, the product begins to bead up</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so smooth after I put on.</li>
            <li>This primer turns my face into a smooth, poreless, canvas for my makeup.</li>
            <li>The primer should work as a light layer/base in between your face and makeup.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my skin, instead it makes it feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and smooths out the lines.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how much it softens the lines ON my lips too...</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel SO smooth</li>
            <li>It allows makeup (liquid, MAC) to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was velvety smooth and kept my make-up from creasing and my t-zone from getting oily.</li>
            <li>It DOES NOT allow make-up to go on smoothly without build up.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and you can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy, just wish you could buy it in a bigger jar.</li>
            <li>know skin products come and go, but if this one is ever discontinued I hope I get advanced notice</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and</li>
            <li>Face feels smooth and</li>
            <li>My skin feels immediately gloriously smooth.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I would also welcome a larger jar!</li>
            <li>It really smoothed out my face nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great product wish it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and helps the makeup stay on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This one fills and smooth without color or oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>makes your skin smooth and your make up will stick if its powder or liquid</li>
            <li>It gives a silky smooth feel, helps my makeup stay in place and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully smooth cream that makes your skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li>My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores</li>
            <li>I prefer a primer that is easier to smooth on.  </li>
            <li>This primer feels wonderful, and provides an excellent base under concealers.</li>
            <li>How is this good for acne prone or sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>And it is perfect as a base upon which to apply your foundation for a flawless looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is really light and can be used after my day cream has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>My makeup slid right off and my skin was so incredibly oily that I had to not only wash my face to get it off</li>
            <li>It glides right on after this Magic stuff.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face looking clean and youthfulwhile filling in pores and fine lines like it says.</li>
            <li>great product and better price from other primers.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this little drug store product!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite beauty product!  </li>
            <li>I did not give it 5 stars because this is my first time buying and using a makeup primer, there may be something greater out there.  </li>
            <li>Definately worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>I saved a small plastic spatula that is used for tasting samples and it is perfect to get the primer out of the container.  </li>
            <li>For the Amazon price, it is absolutely worth a try!</li>
            <li>It was love at first application.</li>
            <li>Great for the skin, love it so much, in fact this is the only product she use before she goes to work.</li>
            <li>I have used many at much higher price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the product goes, when used properly, its EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li>face feels super smooth and silky after application.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a good choice for anyone who wears foundation or eye shadow, as it really does improve wear and make the application process a whole lot easier.great product</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a good choice for anyone who wears foundation or eye shadow, as it really does improve wear and make the application process a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try a face primer because my face is super sensitive but this primer is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I love it good stuff, it really performs well and better than expected.</li>
            <li>Is it a magic bullet for wrinkles or large pores?  </li>
            <li>I find that it works best if my moisturizer has had a little bit of time to fully absorb first.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have tried (and there have been many) that truly does a good job at minimizing the appearance of my large pores.</li>
            <li>Lol first of all I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny the bottle was.  </li>
            <li>After a full day of wearing and a nap, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After actually USING this product, it does appear to be good.  </li>
            <li>my make up didn&#x27;t slide off my face, and it held true all day.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure not to use too much and always moisturize before.</li>
            <li>I used the anti-redness primer over my chin, cheeks and chin which are now very ruddy, and then came in with this product under my eyes, and around my crowsfeet, and along the top of the cheekbone.  </li>
            <li>It does matte your skin in preparation for foundation but is not an overall good product.</li>
            <li>It looks good while on the face and my make up looks air brushed</li>
            <li>It is true what they say &amp;</li>
            <li>and i was able to order this product, otherwise needed to pay too much for shipping</li>
            <li>I apply my gentle cleanser with an exfoliating brush at the end of the day to be sure it all comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>onto my story: I let the primer soak for 2 minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream in Sand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely.</li>
            <li>but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>My nose tends to be clogged no matter how many pore strips or exfoliants or how much I steam it.</li>
            <li>This is true buy</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great drug store primer.</li>
            <li>It definitely does smooth out skin and gives it a nice surface for makeup to be applied to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally did buy it because I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I recently developed rosacea, and my formerly fair skin has changed so much</li>
            <li>just make sure to smooth  in completely before applying make.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just lucky to have found this product.</li>
            <li>After all day wearing, I still have some shine to my face, but that&#x27;s pretty normal with the kind of foundation I use and the skin type I have.</li>
            <li>I would say that even if you don&#x27;t have pores or soft lines to soften, you&#x27;d love this product on your face for how it feels and for how smooth your makeup will go on and look.  </li>
            <li>I tried it today for the very first time.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light texture, and truly makes the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>So I only need a small amount, it goes on wonderfully and has a very smooth feeling after you apply it.</li>
            <li>cheaper alternative would be the Black Radiance Shine Control primer which I have heard great things about -</li>
            <li>I think this would be good for someone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and nice but doesn&#x27;t keep me matte for long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat dry skin, but use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!!</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, clear and utterly smooth.  </li>
            <li>Did not do much for my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Mix a little bit with my foundation and it blends greatly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have 40 something mature, combination skin and wanted something to help smooth the fine lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>It provides a silky smooth surface, even concealing fine lines giving a soft lifting effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores aren&#x27;t very noticeable, but I do have light scars all over.</li>
            <li>This made my makeup look great, but after using it a few days in a row, made me break out.</li>
            <li>This really does smooth out your skin before applying make-up.  </li>
            <li>It really fills in your pores and makes your face look and feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my make-up look smooth and helps the make up stay on all day.  </li>
            <li>as well so this has help calm the melting of the eye brows.  </li>
            <li>It feels really light, and my foundation goes on very evenly over</li>
            <li>really helps my concealer go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this primer and am thankful to Amazon for carrying it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It creates a nice matte surface, and it is just sticky enough to hold makeup.  </li>
            <li>, my skin looks better if I decide to go all natural.</li>
            <li>Love it and unscented for the chemically sensitive</li>
            <li>This is a nice product but consistently, shortly after applying it I felt nausea.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So I ordered from Amazon, and it arrived fresh</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When products claim they have a noticeable difference, rarely is it all that noticeable.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>for $10 i figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some old acne scarring and it made my face look great for the big day!</li>
            <li>my forehead and my laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep my make up fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I also have a 2 year old who loves touching my face</li>
            <li>I told her Loreal, and she remarked that my skin looked very fresh, smooth, and natural.  </li>
            <li>so I would say this product would be great for dry normal skin</li>
            <li>this is the first primer/base that i have totally fallen in love with!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, i dont care, as long as the product in question looks okay</li>
            <li>Minimize pores, improve skin texture, create great CANVAS for smooth long lasting makeup.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I ordered this after watching a recommendation from AllThatGlitters21 on YouTube, and she is so right</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I have 5 jars right now.</li>
            <li>&quot; right</li>
            <li>it blends right in.  </li>
            <li>and she is right</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;oreal was on sale, which is good because at my local store it was normally $14.99 a jar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and requires only a minute to dry.&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>This base is suppose to provide a more smooth and flawless look whereas a primer is to help keep your makeup in tact longer.</li>
            <li>The second time I applied it, I actually applied it twice just to see if I liked it better thicker.</li>
            <li>today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g.</li>
            <li>I especially dislike foundation on older women because it ages us even more, with the way it settles into fine lines.</li>
            <li>For those of you with oily skin with large pores, give it a shot!</li>
            <li>It makes my 60ish, dry skin look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and, while this looks great when you put it on, the shine still  comes through in a few hours.</li>
            <li>as for this product it really does smooth the skin and the make up stays longer much longer, but it doesn&#x27;t minimize the look of the pores at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, goes on smoothly and really evens out one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>I was worried when this arrived because the jar is small, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot for an all day beautiful complexion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily, prefer to go easy on my skin unless it&#x27;s a special occasion.  </li>
            <li>I have lines from years of constant squinting due to extreme light sensitivity in my eyes, and this covers those fine squint lines perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have lines from years of constant squinting due to extreme light sensitivity in my eyes, and this covers those fine squint lines perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I very much like this.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and makes your skin look flawless before applying makeup....</li>
            <li>When my make up is on, my makeup looks VERY natural!!!</li>
            <li>so getting the product out of this tiny jar can be a challenge. :)</li>
            <li>I used a moderate amount the first time since I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it covered.  </li>
            <li>is the first primer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very creamy but goes on feeling like nothing!</li>
            <li>It make my make up stay exactly where I put it and with my oily skin</li>
            <li>First off, let me just say this product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Having said that a jar will last more than a year, this product does not expire so,</li>
            <li>It did make my face feel soft and smooth, and It seemed to even the surface of my skin, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>My guess is there are better products for the same price.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put it on sparingly.</li>
            <li>but it really does a wonder job on your face!  </li>
            <li>But, after a couple of hours I noticed I was touching up my makeup with powder more often than usual.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t lie when it says \\&quot;Magic\\&quot;... it really is!</li>
            <li>and I use this product not only for me but also for my clients; results are absolutely stunning...</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day I tried putting it on with no moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It actually seemed more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this product was because I saw it on tv.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for eyes - can&#x27;t say about face though since I never tried it :)</li>
            <li>First time using primer</li>
            <li>I first opened the pot and dipped my finger in</li>
            <li>The next time I used even more sparingly and just in the T-zone area where my makeup tends to &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; in the heat.</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth after putting it on, so soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it.</li>
            <li>possibly even more if you&#x27;re picking up at another retailer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To conclude, I would absolutely recommend this primer!</li>
            <li>It may help to add that I have a healthy, relatively good-looking complexion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In countries that hot  </li>
            <li>For the higher end, try Scindinavia.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my first time using it</li>
            <li>Frankly, I wasn&#x27;t so sure I was for the whole primer thing in general.</li>
            <li>I love it and when I run out I plan on buying a larger size.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So, while I love eye makeup and lip color, I have simply used moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets is the first makeup primer I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I use an eye brow pencil to fill in my brows and when I get hot they look \\&quot;hot\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This primer leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I had purchased my first one at Ulta.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it really is top notch.</li>
            <li>my first thought was \\&quot;Omg</li>
            <li>the winter, when the climate is drier, I use a moisturizer first.  </li>
            <li>At first I was unsure what was making me break</li>
            <li>First time using a primer</li>
            <li>so well I&#x27;m willing to pay it).</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm for a smooth and soft coverage.</li>
            <li>If your skin is like mine (blotchy), put this on first followed by the rest of your makeup.</li>
            <li>its worth the buy and will make you photo ready.</li>
            <li>still my one &amp; only favorite primer.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about this primer, but mine arrived in a box that looked beat up, and the product inside was dried up and rubbery.</li>
            <li>Very light, spreads smoothly and a little amount covers a lot of area.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this and oil of olay products the last couple of months and at 43 years old, my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would use a light touch because it is thick, but for mature skin it is the next best thing to botox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and let me know if this information was helpful by checking that box here.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft and really has helped with my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a synthetic flat top brush but haven&#x27;t yet with this</li>
            <li>I now own this Primer, an Eyeliner Pencil and Mascara that I can&#x27;t use due to nausea and irritation when I apply them.</li>
            <li>For the last several months, I have been using Avon&#x27;s Magix primer with good results, but I thought I would try the L&#x27;Oreal primer since I have used L&#x27;Oreal foundation for years.  </li>
            <li>This product works great for smoothing out my skin and creating a good base for me to work from.</li>
            <li>I have very rotten skin, but when I wash my face regularly and apply this immediately and then put on my makeups, my skin tends to do better.</li>
            <li>Although I did not expect it to work miracles on some of the fine lines I&#x27;ve developed by my nose and eyes, my makeup looks airbrushed and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, feels good and makes a nice base for makeup.</li>
            <li>However, it does just as good if not better job.  </li>
            <li>and my makeup free skin actually looked a little better with two light coats.</li>
            <li>It seems to sort of lessen itself after a few hours, so maybe the staying power isnt as good as high end stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>A nice lightweight primer that conceals my pores and slightly mattifying.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought every single one before they were gone because I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have large pores.</li>
            <li>I never had problems with large pore before, after using this product</li>
            <li>FYI, I do not have wrinkles but have large pores and acne scarring that</li>
            <li>I dab it on the large pores on my nose, rub it in and then apply it to the rest of my face with a lighter application.</li>
            <li>the hell we&#x27;re calling that junk you spread all over your face to hide zits and even out skin tones and hide large pores.</li>
            <li>I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too</li>
            <li>Not only does it control my shine, but it minimizes my pores and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Imperfections, such as fine lines and visible pores are minimized or even disappear.</li>
            <li>A wonderful makeup base, goes on easily and really helps appearance of skin.</li>
            <li>As a primer newbie I feel pretty lucky to have found this second product with much higher quality and ease of application.</li>
            <li>This really does cover large pores.</li>
            <li>When I use this with moisteriser  under and a little mineral veil over my skin looks nice without looking like I am &#x27;madeup.&#x27;</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much cheaper works way better.&lt;br /&gt;(monistat</li>
            <li>and I REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li>Well even the primer jar seemed like it wasn&#x27;t exactly really.  </li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to this thing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face look clearer, keeps my makeup on the whole day and you don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>but it costs about 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend checking out this primer!</li>
            <li>if you use too much it just makes your make up clump up.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth surface to your skin prior to applying any foundation.</li>
            <li>I really like that even by itself (without foundation)</li>
            <li>My liquid foundation looked very streaky when I used it with this primer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s just that the products (primarily covergirl)</li>
            <li>it made my forehead look really wrinkly and it just didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>It really work to minimize imperfections.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a women on color and this works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like it just as much as the Smashbox primer</li>
            <li>I really like this product , it goes on really well .</li>
            <li>I will probably go through it fast.</li>
            <li>This really did the trick and has given me an almost-poreless complexion and has kept the shine away.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>That feeling is thanks to silicone (dimethicone) in the primer.</li>
            <li>This primer works really really well, and it does not have the silicone lubricant feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I apply it alone over my sunscreen with absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li>The whole time I&#x27;m thinking to myself</li>
            <li>but Didn&#x27;t really notice anything change When I used the product under my fiundation and when I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>It really does blur out your imperfections</li>
            <li>But in real life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very oily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need as much foundation</li>
            <li>I do not have to reach for my powder or touch up my make up as much as I used to</li>
            <li>This is a very oily and greasy product.</li>
            <li>It is also very sticky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it is supposed to work, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me, under makeup or otherwise.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really understand the difference it makes, but after reading about them I figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>i will absolutely be buying this again</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i had heard so much about smashbox&#x27;s photo finish that i was going to order it.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have to use as much tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>At times it feels like I have to pull at my skin to smooth it over, which I will not continue to do because of the potential damage.  </li>
            <li>The formula itself is creamy and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>but I tried it 3 times just to be sure that I see absolutely no difference when using this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and makeup goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What really made me a believer is after a teeth cleaning under the super-bright dentist chair overhead lamp, the hygienist asked me what makeup I use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same price per ounce, but it feels thicker and heavier and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup (bareMinerals) go on quite as smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have to wait a couple minutes for it to settle in, and then I&#x27;m ready to put on the foundation stuff.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much but this works well.  </li>
            <li>or it gets really shiny but</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t take much at all,  </li>
            <li>It really did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much so one jar</li>
            <li>My face stays dewy, not oily, and I don&#x27;t need as much foundation with it.</li>
            <li>I get as much stuck under my nails as I get on my face.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper</li>
            <li>A product that actually keeps my face shine free.</li>
            <li>like I had a really crappy mask on.</li>
            <li>There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so</li>
            <li>, it works really well.</li>
            <li>have very oily, acne-prone skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I want very lightened skin.</li>
            <li>It also seemingly helps my eyeshadow stay in place a bit longer on my VERY oily lids.</li>
            <li>very affordable &amp;</li>
            <li>Perfecting base is an excellent product, makes my skin so smooth and without blemish.</li>
            <li>Works well i have acne and for the most part it covers it up with out irritating my skin and causing more acne</li>
            <li>this was honestly just a waste of money, my face still ends up oily after minutes of application.</li>
            <li>Ive been trying different makeup primers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Z pore from Kohl&#x27;s for about the last 6 years and loved it but saw this stuff and was curious.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot and humid climate.  </li>
            <li>and it spreads easily, a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It somewhat is, but I have found other mattifying primers in the market that work much better.</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased a different primer from another company which was in a tube and liquid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I like more other like photoready primer of Revlon.</li>
            <li>The next day, I used a little more and while it did make my skin feel smooth, it also became \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; under my eyes and started settling very noticeably into the creases of my skin.   </li>
            <li>I am going to try and write the most in depth review about this product especialy since I know how hard it it to find a worthy primer.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face really smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li>Whenever I apply this first I get a lot of compliments about how young I look.  </li>
            <li>My skin is combination -- very oily in my T-zone and normal everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Light weight primer that provided amazing mattifying results but did not conceal my pores as well as the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Perfecting Base.</li>
            <li>Worn under various foundations rangeing from $5.00 to $65.00, and its worked beneath them all for making it last better.w many pore strips or exfoliants or how much I steam it.</li>
            <li>Second, this was not a bad price at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is my new face primer!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for an all over smooth effect to blend in my dry places with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions, I started with a clean face, put my regular moisturizer on (also put on lightly, since my skin isn&#x27;t real dry).  </li>
            <li>I can say for sure that this does not cause me allergies at all, and I am allergic to half this planet.</li>
            <li>My makeup sponges also can&#x27;t fit into the thin top well.</li>
            <li>If anything, powder was more difficult to apply because the creases were more defined.</li>
            <li>My face does look smooth and soft in the pictures with the primer on...not as red and blotchy.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a larger size because I tend to use it up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to write a review of L&#x27;loreal Magic Perfecting base.</li>
            <li>This primer does enough for me that I can use it alone, without foundation, and instantly feel better about my appearance.  </li>
            <li>Worn under various foundations rangeing from $5.00 to $65.00, and its worked beneath them all for making it last better.</li>
            <li>It really helps to smooth out large pores and tiny red lines.</li>
            <li>If I sweat a whole lot then that&#x27;s pretty  much the only time it doesn&#x27;t keep it in place.</li>
            <li>Right after application, my skin looked much smoother and my pores appeared smaller.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this if you have never had a primer before.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this primer.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations of the product because it had seen a video.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for women of all races and skin pigments.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend that you use this before putting on your foundation, etc.</li>
            <li>I find it an excellent base under concealers for anyone who constantly gets the creasing in fine lines.</li>
            <li>I originally picked it up during the winter when my face was dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I will never use any other primer after finding this one!!</li>
            <li>but so far, after using this for 2 days, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It does have a light pink color, but this color dissipates upon application.</li>
            <li>so I was quite surprised at how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>I work in a temperature controlled environment and do not have much to comment on as far as withstanding heat, etc.  </li>
            <li>and this really smooths out my concealer and foundation allowing me to have a soft look.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, an essential for your make up routine.</li>
            <li>In fact, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to blot like I normally do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely ever get a zit, maybe one in a blue moon, and I have never had a reaction to a product from makeup</li>
            <li>I was using the Bare Minerals primer, but did not want to pay the higher price.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth and really does take away the look of minimal wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I can apply my foundation just as I normally do.</li>
            <li>didnt gave more becouse few reasons</li>
            <li>they normally recommend that you moisturize before applying a primer, but i don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I put on a thin layer, it didn&#x27;t feel good...</li>
            <li>probably bought this product when it first coma out, a year or so ago, since then I have to deal with very large pores</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind you will need to consider your skin type, moisturizer, foundation+all over face products prior to making a decision on which primer is right for you.</li>
            <li>Just got this product, it looks no way close to a new product, very old and most probably not genuine if not already opened and used by someone else.</li>
            <li>I used a good quality make up brush which was clogged up and very difficult to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>today I used Maybelline Primer #so far my favorite# after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it....</li>
            <li>far as acne, most new primers will give me a mild breakout--redness and small bumps--for seven to ten days.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>I received this on New Years Eve.</li>
            <li>My new Fav and cheaper than tarte,urban decay or it cosmetics.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  </li>
            <li>so this OCM is totally new to me.</li>
            <li>Then I put on my foundation, again, not as much as I usually do, it was all very light, I also use two kinds, liquid and not so liquid (it&#x27;s like a cream?</li>
            <li>Other primers such as the Monistat one have broken me out or felt really oily on my skin, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>When it first goes on, especially in the summer and with oily skin, you will think it is just going to melt right off or flake off, but it instantly smooths.</li>
            <li>much!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 with pores that have gotten bigger and pretty normal skin.</li>
            <li>best primer base fast shipping</li>
            <li>The primer tends to look a big flaky in this area after trying multiple methods to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula, but the texture isn&#x27;t as smooth as my first jar.</li>
            <li>Face felt very soft</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, oily, african-american skin.</li>
            <li>I get a small amount on my fingertip and it easily covers my whole face, including my eye</li>
            <li>When you find a beauty product that consistently delivers on its promises, you come back to it.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>at the end of the day I still looked like my old self!  </li>
            <li>I would put it everywhere if I could...getting old is not for sissies!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
            <li>I was surprised!</li>
            <li>This is one produce that does exactly what it should--I can&#x27;t praise it enough.  </li>
            <li>Work in small areas making sure the product is not drying too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I first have to get the primer out with a brush then apply the brush to my fingers, and finally my face.</li>
            <li>But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil.</li>
            <li>There are certain primers that seem to absorb into your skin and other kinds that create a smooth canvas layer above your skin...</li>
            <li>but it spreads out nicely and a little of this does go a long way.    </li>
            <li>Would not be able to use this everyday, jar very small for the price, it does cover more then</li>
            <li>I was in a rush to buy a new primer when I ran out of my old stuff</li>
            <li>Sometimes apply lightly by itself with no make up just to absorb the oil on my face for days i wanna go make-up less..</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised at how well this worked for me as there are some mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>good!Only need a little bit of pores and fine lines of sight</li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel very smooth and velvet-y, although I found that it was extremely hard to remove my makeup after using this.</li>
            <li>The only positive I can say is that it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>It makes my pores appear smaller, my skin much smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes much less noticeable after application.</li>
            <li>So it kind of sucks would not recommend it at all !</li>
            <li>I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>I do wish it would come in a larger pot, and was priced a little bit more affordably.</li>
            <li>So the next day, I tried using a little bit more and ended up with a completely gunky, sticky nose and and cheek area.</li>
            <li>and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk.</li>
            <li>I am a 39 year old female with oily skin that has never broken out or had any acne even in my teens,</li>
            <li>It is unlike others Ive tried, not like a clear primer.</li>
            <li>I have very non sensitive facial skin however, so I cannot attest to whether it causes acne.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at this since I toss and move about while I am asleep.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout</li>
            <li>BUT, when i received this primer today, it seemed like it was a decade old.  </li>
            <li>I guess the box just must&#x27;ve been old or abuse.  </li>
            <li>it made no difference when used, as far as covering up darker color under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the primer, but so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as</li>
            <li>And it can make your face break out if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s saying a lot for a 64-yr old.</li>
            <li>I tried a brush, my fingers and even directly applying the concealer to my skin from the bottle but every time id go to blend it, the concealer just wiped away.</li>
            <li>but I really like my makeup and am not about to get different makeup just to use this primer.</li>
            <li>Im in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>thick&lt;br /&gt;Although, it does work as far as keeping make up on.</li>
            <li>It was a complete disaster.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a professional make up artist</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a drug store brand worked this well.</li>
            <li>When did I get old?  </li>
            <li>It was so soft.</li>
            <li>It still felt soft but a tad greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did take some pictures with my face natural and some with just the primer on.</li>
            <li>Beware if you are sensitive or have allergies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tempting to use it all over your face as it gives a completely airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t burn or anything to put on.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li>Had a piece of hair in it &amp; just looked old.</li>
            <li>Your face will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom..</li>
            <li>My foundation/bronzer/blush/highlighter stay on my face until the end of my work day and it allows for seamless blending of my blush, highlighter, and bronzer.</li>
            <li>completely poreless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This primer doesn&#x27;t make my pores go away completely</li>
            <li>Second, it is so slippery that I couldn&#x27;t get the makeup to stick to it very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of L&#x27;loreal products and find you really get a quality product at drug store prices.</li>
            <li>I am 64 and have some soft lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li>My skin is supper sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and there are no problems with breakouts or redness.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I really had no idea that there even was such a product, but I was hunting for one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31years old</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how it camouflages  pore size.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars so far because it is winter, lets see how this works during the summer in the heat.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of acne blemishes, and I break out frequently.  </li>
            <li>On a younger person it would really cover.</li>
            <li>The lines around by eyes are minimized and my skin feels soooooo soft.</li>
            <li>After applying makes your skin feel really soft</li>
            <li>I really wish they had this in a larger quantity.  </li>
            <li>leaves the skin really soft and matte.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend this primer to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, my skin ALWAYS looks at least a bit better when I use it.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t feel soft..</li>
            <li>I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin.</li>
            <li>Its gritty but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li>is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers.</li>
            <li>I love that it fills the &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; on my face without feeling heavy and helps makeup last longer.  </li>
            <li>I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years</li>
            <li>one of the best base products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best base I have come across to date.</li>
            <li>The consistency is a bit weird, you have to rub it in good.</li>
            <li>This cream is the perfect base for makeup.  </li>
            <li>Its good, but i was not exceptionally impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the softness of the skin after applying this base.</li>
            <li>It makes a perfect base before adding makeup.</li>
            <li>It truly works magic, suddenly it seems my face glowed after a slight cover!</li>
            <li>But what I discovered is that it glides on easily and really very little of the primer is needed.</li>
            <li>you have ever had sensitive burning skin with the wrong kind of soap or lotion, I&#x27;d avoid this particular product like the plague.</li>
            <li>) A little goes a long way so for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t wear make up every day, a jar lasts for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>Great base, especially in the winter when you need a \\&quot;Full Face\\&quot;, no tan whatsoever and</li>
            <li>I am going to have to buy more soon, though, as it&#x27;s such a small bottle</li>
            <li>I have pretty big pores on my inner cheeks and on my nose.  </li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;d get this at a drugstore, but my local drugstore is notorious for having old, expired products on their shelves.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put my makeup on without using this first, it really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It dissolves right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Four stars only because it does not do well on damp areas or in high humidity situations.  </li>
            <li>Then a recent high def photo, taken by a dentist, and shown to me on a plasma TV had me running for the hills.  </li>
            <li>Price was too high for me to be using the primer on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This base makes a nice smooth flawless looking base for makeup.  </li>
            <li>IT REMIND ME OF THE CLARINS INSTANT SMOOTH PRIMER JUST HALF THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>It really helps my eye makeup stay put all day long.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and really like it.  </li>
            <li>However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted, delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, this is good as to the fact that not much comes in the container</li>
            <li>I also found that in certain places, the foundation and the primer balled up together and made a flaky look, making my make up very noticeable when usually my foundation is very natural.</li>
            <li>My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes on smoothly, fills little lines and pores.  </li>
            <li>so it is hard to get the product out easily.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and live in Hawaii, one of the mose humid palces on Earth especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I began trying several primers recently&amp; this one I really like.</li>
            <li>Multiple large, deep pimples that took several weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li>After I finally \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; my makeup, it still looked more obvious than usual.</li>
            <li>My skin is-oily beneath with a dry surface, light coloured Italian skin, 39 yrs old,I live in very extreme weather.</li>
            <li>My skin is-oily beneath with a dry surface, light coloured Italian skin, 39 yrs old,I live in very extreme weather.</li>
            <li>New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer, Clear, 0.85 Fluid Ounce</li>
            <li>Applying my makeup over it certainly did not give a look I expected, or wanted.</li>
            <li>First of all, all you need is a *tiny* dab (a little goes a LONG way!), and a small amount easily spreads over your whole face.</li>
            <li>I have large pores but don&#x27;t usually try new things as I have a professional line of skin care I use..</li>
            <li>like L&#x27;OREAL products in general, but this one did not work for me.</li>
            <li>The outside packaging was faded and the box seemed it was old.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily  have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I barely recognize myself in the mirror anymore.  </li>
            <li>It will ball up when applying if your&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>i definitely have combination/oily skin and have been looking for something to keep the oils in control because near the end of the day my face will be so shiny.</li>
            <li>I found this to be much thicker than I expected...</li>
            <li>Concealed my pores but barely mattifying.</li>
            <li>Be back with a complete review.</li>
            <li>I like the balmy way it feels on the outside corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white in the tub but comes out completely transparent on my face.</li>
            <li>recently purchased Arbonne primer and, wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>I used it for several months and then stopped using it in early summer.</li>
            <li>In the summer, I put it on bare skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica</li>
            <li>This is thick going on but melts into your face, giving it a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>primer is quite thick and not as light and creamy as it appears in print advertisements.</li>
            <li>Too thick, does not apply smoothly and does not prime the skin...  Do not recomend ,,,,,,</li>
            <li>This is thick and smooth, filling in pores and making my skin softer before applying make up.</li>
            <li>because I think I only paid $7 for this base but so far it&#x27;s been holding up pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It feels thick and heavy right out of the package, but smooths over skin and becomes a light undercoat for my foundation.  </li>
            <li>After spending hundreds of dollars on different primers, this will definitely be my new daily primer.</li>
            <li>My pores are far less noticeable and my foundation doesn&#x27;t &#x27;settle in the cracks&#x27; as much.</li>
            <li>No more large pores..!!  </li>
            <li>Weird how such a seemingly subtle makeup application can lead to flawless results and loads of compliments!</li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry, in case that helps in your decision whether to buy L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested... here is my comparison to other primers I have tried on the market (based on personal experience and skin type):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure enough, over the next several days I got several more deep, painful pimples.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on and appears to immediately &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the skin at least a little bit.</li>
            <li>Both of these things are exactly what I need to counteract my lines, dark circles, acne scars, and larger pores.  </li>
            <li>I love how silky and smooth my face feels when I apply this base.  </li>
            <li>First I moisturize and then I dab my finger and just use a little</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the price I paid for the primer is higher than on Amazon, by the time one adds in the shipping, it comes out to about the same or even less.</li>
            <li>I have some dark/red spots but not more than you would expect on someone who is only 20 and has had mild acne.    </li>
            <li>which is much preferred to an average person&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I barely used it only because it got buried in the kit</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and no acne for a long time.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;use a primer\\&quot; \\&quot;use a primer\\&quot; in beauty articles, because after a few hours, the oils in my skin start to mix with my makeup, and on hot days...</li>
            <li>This is a notch higher than the makeup I use everyday.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not a huge fan of supporting Loreal or their unethical treatments/chemicals, sometimes duty calls and I have to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I have a very dark complexion, acne prone skin, acne scars, open pores and very very oily</li>
            <li>I have finger nails (not very long) and the product always gets stuck under them.</li>
            <li>Once my moisturizer is completely dry (as stated on the primer&#x27;s instructions), I&#x27;ll dip my clean ring finger into the primer jar and dab small amounts of this primer around my face.</li>
            <li>Felt super thick and chalky/cakey.</li>
            <li>I wish there were another size available as tiny little half ounce jars of things</li>
            <li>However, makeup goes on a whole lot easier, and I actually use less of my cream foundation.</li>
            <li>but it settles into every little crease in your face and makes you look a lot older!</li>
            <li>could see this Base becoming a part of my regular makeup routine for years, and originally I went in thinking none of them would work</li>
            <li>I actually had a little trial size of this in a magazine that I tried and after using it I went straight out and bought two of them (with a coupon).</li>

            <li> but when I took it off at the end of the day I had SO MANY PIMPLES!!!!!</li>
            <li> But I guess the best way to describe it is that it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re editing a picture</li>
            <li> This primer worked perfect with my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> What a great find for a drugstore brand primer!</li>
            <li> As a helpful tip, I&#x27;ve learned at the MAC cosmetics counter that the ring finger is best for application as it applies the lightest pressure when using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
            <li> It made my skin look flawless under my makeup just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face practically flawless ( well in my eyes).</li>
            <li> this works perfect for the nights out.</li>
            <li> I must say that this is the best one I have ever found.</li>
            <li> It gives me flawless skin.</li>
            <li> My foundation still adjust perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect face primer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> As a primer it is good - but the over all benefits to my skin have been fantanstic!!</li>
            <li> But for me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the skin before to applicate the foundation.</li>
            <li> but this had my face flawless all day.</li>

            <li> I get the best effect from this product in the spring and fall when my skin isn&#x27;t trying to deal with dryness or oiliness.  </li>
            <li> Loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li> The finish is so wonderful</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed!!</li>
            <li> I thought because of the cost it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> The BEST for day use cream#.</li>
            <li> Then I mix Revlon Colorstay foundation with my Dermalogica foundation and that creates the perfect makeup for my combination skin and oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> If your skin is perfect (flawless), then you don&#x27;t need to wear anything else.</li>
            <li> For me that is great!</li>
            <li> The part it does best with is my nose&amp; undereye areas.</li>

            <li> Great stuff.  </li>
            <li> Great for concealing acne scars.</li>
            <li> Also great to wear alone.</li>

            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> I have never used primer before but thought I should give it a try, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great make up primer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the great reviews</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great antishine product.</li>
            <li> I was amazed because I thought she had great skin herself, and I do not like my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments about how great my make up looks when I use this.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> But great for pictures.&lt;br /&gt;MY</li>
            <li> however I do love it on my eyes!!</li>
            <li> I love this Cream!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li> It was very nice.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my gym bag &amp; it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels, and then my foundation just went on flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> Really great makeup for a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent, love it.  </li>
            <li> Nice to find a drug store product that works so well!</li>
            <li> so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that.</li>
            <li> Great product with amazing coverage.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after researching good primers and came across this.</li>
            <li> Loved the product.</li>
            <li> It even looks good with powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Really good primer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d end up forgetting primer for good.</li>
            <li> but it is good.</li>
            <li> It took the shine away, and looked good.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and leaves your complexion looking flawless.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin feel good and silky...</li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t good was the skin break-out</li>
            <li> this product is good, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look good when I opened it.</li>
            <li> For your information I am 28, not a lot of sun damage with fair skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth leaving face flawless.</li>
            <li> I do not have good skin.  </li>
            <li> I have no clue what type of the skin the people have who gave this product good reviews.</li>
            <li> However, I had a good start with this product and am still using it for 2 weeks already without breaking out.</li>
            <li> Good control on my oily skin from running my make-up away.</li>
            <li> and I loved the way it smoothed my skin.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very good, cheap primer</li>
            <li> Love this goes great between my moisturizer and sunscreen .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very interesting and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before  and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice, silky texture, and good coverage.</li>
            <li> One of the best primer I am using right now.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth flawless look this gives me!!</li>
            <li> for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Just wish they would give me more for my money!</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I was really glad when I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on so much better!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I had tried a couple other and this is the best product and the best price.  </li>
            <li> I am 47, and I love what this product does to my skin!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the feel!</li>
            <li> so this works perfectly to fill the large pores so that my tinted moisturizer doesn&#x27;t fill in and harden.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this is the best part; it feels like rubbing pure silky goodness into your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say the finish is just as amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice.  </li>
            <li> If you have nice skin with no acne, then buy this, but if you plan on using foundation and concealer and stuff, skip it and find another primer.</li>
            <li> I honestly could not tell the difference while using the product.</li>
            <li> It absolutely makes for a flawless look and lasts alllll day!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Again, my makeup applied wonderfully and I didn&#x27;t have much oil breakthrough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard so much about primer being the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> You do not need to use a lot to cover your face, and it really does feel great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will work for those who don&#x27;t require a plethora of effective.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets is a product every woman should own.</li>
            <li> even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> make-up goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues finding a foundation I liked, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own brand of this.</li>
            <li> Till now, nice touch.</li>
            <li> It primes your skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have it smoothed over while I wait for anti age creams to take effect.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have it smoothed over while I wait for anti age creams to take effect.</li>
            <li> We even went to the beach for a full day and my makeup was still great.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cover the fine lines like DHC&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good primer for years as I don&#x27;t want concealer to get into my fine lines</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> 4 Stars for this amazing product :)</li>
            <li> Excellent primer for my 50+ year old skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is meant for naturally greasy skin which is why some have not had the best of luck with it.</li>
            <li> On my best skin days, this makes my skin look luminous and young.  </li>
            <li> Use it on pores to make them disappear, blur fine lines and crepey areas, great as a smooth highlight on your chin, remove lip creases, lessen nasolabial or glabela lines, .</li>
            <li> After putting on Bare Minerals, my face looks flawless!</li>
            <li> it feels very smooth on face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the day, I touched my face and it felt very smooth, like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It made my skin very smooth looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> It hides your pours and makes your face look very smooth, it even softens wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Feels very light weight.</li>
            <li> It also creates a very smooth surface to apply cover-up to.</li>
            <li> I am very light skinned</li>
            <li> In my opinion it rubs on very smoothly and has not clumped up or balled up on my face one bit.</li>
            <li> but it does an amazing job filling in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t conceal all of my pores and fine lines, but does an amazing job keeping that oil at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Huge impact!</li>
            <li> This worked OK</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many primers so I don&#x27;t have tons to compare this to</li>
            <li> and I have not been satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the matt finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product glides on smoothly and feels nice on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too Faced is pricey, but it works better than the Loreal.    </li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice smooth silky face primer when I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> But the product is okay.</li>
            <li> I love it and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> It will give you a great start, and it is gentle with your skin.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get much better for under $10.</li>
            <li> Love the texture.</li>
            <li> I do not know the magic is .</li>
            <li> I have used Smashbox&#x27;s, which I love</li>
            <li> The best product to actually do what it says it will.</li>
            <li> The results are magical and I can&#x27;t believe what a difference there is between before and after.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews on this product, and hearing many people suffered breakouts from it worried me.</li>
            <li> I love that this primer makes me look semi poreless which I love</li>
            <li> I love this perfecting base/primer for a couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied it mostly under my eyes and saw no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Most of my beauty products are Reviva.</li>
            <li> Without makeup, my skin didn&#x27;t look much different, but my makeup applied perfectly</li>
            <li> Okay, I had never used a primer before.</li>
            <li> but it surely didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Nice satiny smooth finish, under make up or alone.  </li>
            <li> Then even the cheapie foundations look a lot better on your skin.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Eye wrinkles look better.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product for reducing the size of my pores and creating a smooth surface before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> SOME HOW DIFUSES FOUDATION BETTER,</li>
            <li> Additionally, my foundation now does a better job of covering up imperfections and discolorations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say lotion helps more.</li>
            <li> So I personally love this primer</li>
            <li> And it makes much more easier to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> It closes my pores, gives my skin a smooth matte finish, even hides blackheads!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> They would clog my pores and I would start to get acne, or when I would sweat it would start streaking, so I  just gave up on most makeup all together.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I would still say that it is better than most of this type of product.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... leaves residue on your face.</li>
            <li> I usually love this stuff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite primer,</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it came out, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it will do and more.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I needed to look for something more afforable.  </li>
            <li> I think they need to come up with a better dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I used a makeup sponge to apply this primer, and it works much better than using my fingers.  </li>
            <li> , i waited till my order was more than $25</li>
            <li> The results are simply stunning...</li>
            <li> The jar is not the most convenient and sanitary form to retrieve product&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite primers for summer time when my makeup tends to melt off my face.</li>
            <li> The makeup just sits on top and stay put</li>
            <li> I need to play around with it some more though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It worked for more than 9 hours.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s more than just a primer.</li>
            <li> i had tried so many, i figured i&#x27;d give this a go as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back after hearing about how wonderful primer can be for your makeup routine.  </li>
            <li> Much more product for the money as well.  </li>
            <li> and I am okay.</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly and my makeup applies nicely over top.</li>
            <li> Better than smashbox&#x27;s primer in my opinion..</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase the primer with an instore coupon</li>
            <li> so use this mostly on the drier bits of my face, eyelids, cheeks, nose area.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it makes you look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am still self concious about my skin, but Loreal products make me feel a lot better about it.</li>
            <li> Minimizes pores, keeps oily skin matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> and I love this one.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the awkwardness of the jar -- it probably would&#x27;ve been better if they put this in a tube.</li>
            <li> It works better for me as a primer, and it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This stays on better than powder.</li>
            <li> I have used and love this product but one purchased here appeared to have been opened.</li>
            <li> Just make sure on the cleansing part at the end of the day as makeup tends to stick on more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have found cheapy primers that work much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> ** better be magical\\</li>
            <li> &quot;    I am quite pleased with it, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture of it...</li>
            <li> Still, this is my favorite primer.  </li>
            <li> 15 minutes after I apply my foundation you still have to wear powder on top</li>
            <li> Love this suff.</li>
            <li> It covers up my texture issues and most of my pore issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make sure this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s in a jar, I have to be more concerned about bacteria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> decided to read up on reviews on Amazon #love Amazon# for primers</li>
            <li> Love that girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite.</li>
            <li> and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment.</li>
            <li> Love that stuff</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MORE THING..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> However, for light skin this is nice under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day, my face looks as good as it does right after I&#x27;ve applied my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased the primer because I needed help to keep my T zone from having that oily skin look and the primer works great.</li>
            <li> and I feel this is a Great product for any age not just older women.</li>
            <li> Skin feels SOOOO SOFT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin, specially for my nose because it get pretty oily.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t resemble the original L&#x27;Oreal primer at all!</li>
            <li> Then apply product to your moistorized face. &#x3D;] Should blend fairly easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> It just smoothes everything out so nicely, that often, I&#x27;ll just wear this with a quick powder to run out for errands.</li>
            <li> and it goes on so much more easily.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my dry parts of the face look flawless and not cakey</li>
            <li> I get told so much how beautiful my skin is and how lucky I am.</li>
            <li> I use this under a light foundation or powder for a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Right after application my skin looks pretty good, a nice glow etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works fine for some, but with my reaction, it makes me nervous to try a face primer</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I have ever tried, so there might be better ones out there, but for the price, I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> The product arrived in very good condition, shipping was fast and was exactly what I had imagined.</li>
            <li> After it sets, the skin feels hydrated, smooth and a bit more even (it fills in wrinkles and pores).  </li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR AFRICA AMERICAN/BLACK, MATURE, AND WOMEN WITH SKIN CONDITIONS.</li>
            <li> your makeup will even go on more smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I feel like if this primer was thinned out and easier to smooth over an area it could work better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good thing is that I got no breakouts whatsoever, and I am very prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Loved the product SO much.</li>
            <li> Overall seems a good product!</li>
            <li> I did the best I could with it, but refused to leave the house that day due to embarrassment over the streaky, unblended crapola I was wearing.</li>
            <li> My concealer smooths on easily over it and my mineral powder settles onto my face evenly.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly.</li>
            <li> the product arrived very quick.</li>
            <li> easy to apply</li>
            <li> You could easily go without a foundation after application of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> People have commented about my skin looking so good, which is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I use a mineral makeup foundation and saw no difference in the fine lines under my eyes when using the Loreal primer.      </li>
            <li> look of fine lines &amp; pores.</li>
            <li> it just smooths over any fine lines and they are almost invisible after application.</li>
            <li> It smoothes the skin by filling in fine lines or pores.</li>
            <li> It makes my fine lines look smoother and my face looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise fine</li>
            <li> However, now that my face is aging, I have been looking for a product to help lock in the moisturizer to keep the elasticity in my face, smooth/improve the surface/texture of my skin, and minimize fine lines.</li>
            <li> If anything, it made my skin become oily more quickly than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does go on very smooth and immediately makes the skin feel nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It fills in the fine line and wrinkles thus helping you appear more youthful and fresh.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to disguise or smooth the extremely fine lines under my eyes, nor did it do anything to smooth my pore-filled nose.</li>
            <li> I also have huge pores and oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and huge pores.</li>
            <li> My makeup stayed in place and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy which is a HUGE plus for me.    </li>
            <li> Huge mistake.</li>
            <li> It feels light.</li>
            <li> So that my makeup would have an all over smooth look.  </li>
            <li> This helps even out my skin tone a bit and does a great job of making my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of Estee Lauder and also bought Reviva&#x27;s Primer.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-wasn&#x27;t smooth</li>
            <li> There are light reflectors in it</li>
            <li> There is no way I would walk out the house with just this on and no base or powder.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> But overall, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Does not apply evenly or smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tick but goes on the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, it feels like silk and it helps your makeup stay in place, but I noticed that if you rub it too much when applying, the product begins to bead up</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so smooth after I put on.</li>
            <li> This primer turns my face into a smooth, poreless, canvas for my makeup.</li>
            <li> The primer should work as a light layer/base in between your face and makeup.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin, instead it makes it feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, and smooths out the lines.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how much it softens the lines ON my lips too...</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin feel SO smooth</li>
            <li> It allows makeup (liquid, MAC) to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was velvety smooth and kept my make-up from creasing and my t-zone from getting oily.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT allow make-up to go on smoothly without build up.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and you can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, just wish you could buy it in a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> know skin products come and go, but if this one is ever discontinued I hope I get advanced notice</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and</li>
            <li> Face feels smooth and</li>
            <li> My skin feels immediately gloriously smooth.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I would also welcome a larger jar!</li>
            <li> It really smoothed out my face nicely.  </li>
            <li> Great product wish it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and helps the makeup stay on throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This one fills and smooth without color or oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> makes your skin smooth and your make up will stick if its powder or liquid</li>
            <li> It gives a silky smooth feel, helps my makeup stay in place and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully smooth cream that makes your skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores</li>
            <li> I prefer a primer that is easier to smooth on.  </li>
            <li> This primer feels wonderful, and provides an excellent base under concealers.</li>
            <li> How is this good for acne prone or sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> And it is perfect as a base upon which to apply your foundation for a flawless looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is really light and can be used after my day cream has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> My makeup slid right off and my skin was so incredibly oily that I had to not only wash my face to get it off</li>
            <li> It glides right on after this Magic stuff.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face looking clean and youthfulwhile filling in pores and fine lines like it says.</li>
            <li> great product and better price from other primers.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this little drug store product!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty product!  </li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because this is my first time buying and using a makeup primer, there may be something greater out there.  </li>
            <li> Definately worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> I saved a small plastic spatula that is used for tasting samples and it is perfect to get the primer out of the container.  </li>
            <li> For the Amazon price, it is absolutely worth a try!</li>
            <li> It was love at first application.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin, love it so much, in fact this is the only product she use before she goes to work.</li>
            <li> I have used many at much higher price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the product goes, when used properly, its EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> face feels super smooth and silky after application.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a good choice for anyone who wears foundation or eye shadow, as it really does improve wear and make the application process a whole lot easier.great product</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a good choice for anyone who wears foundation or eye shadow, as it really does improve wear and make the application process a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try a face primer because my face is super sensitive but this primer is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> I love it good stuff, it really performs well and better than expected.</li>
            <li> Is it a magic bullet for wrinkles or large pores?  </li>
            <li> I find that it works best if my moisturizer has had a little bit of time to fully absorb first.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have tried (and there have been many) that truly does a good job at minimizing the appearance of my large pores.</li>
            <li> Lol first of all I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny the bottle was.  </li>
            <li> After a full day of wearing and a nap, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After actually USING this product, it does appear to be good.  </li>
            <li> my make up didn&#x27;t slide off my face, and it held true all day.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure not to use too much and always moisturize before.</li>
            <li> I used the anti-redness primer over my chin, cheeks and chin which are now very ruddy, and then came in with this product under my eyes, and around my crowsfeet, and along the top of the cheekbone.  </li>
            <li> It does matte your skin in preparation for foundation but is not an overall good product.</li>
            <li> It looks good while on the face and my make up looks air brushed</li>
            <li> It is true what they say &amp;</li>
            <li> and i was able to order this product, otherwise needed to pay too much for shipping</li>
            <li> I apply my gentle cleanser with an exfoliating brush at the end of the day to be sure it all comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> onto my story: I let the primer soak for 2 minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream in Sand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely.</li>
            <li> but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> My nose tends to be clogged no matter how many pore strips or exfoliants or how much I steam it.</li>
            <li> This is true buy</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great drug store primer.</li>
            <li> It definitely does smooth out skin and gives it a nice surface for makeup to be applied to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally did buy it because I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I recently developed rosacea, and my formerly fair skin has changed so much</li>
            <li> just make sure to smooth  in completely before applying make.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just lucky to have found this product.</li>
            <li> After all day wearing, I still have some shine to my face, but that&#x27;s pretty normal with the kind of foundation I use and the skin type I have.</li>
            <li> I would say that even if you don&#x27;t have pores or soft lines to soften, you&#x27;d love this product on your face for how it feels and for how smooth your makeup will go on and look.  </li>
            <li> I tried it today for the very first time.  </li>
            <li> It is a very light texture, and truly makes the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> So I only need a small amount, it goes on wonderfully and has a very smooth feeling after you apply it.</li>
            <li> cheaper alternative would be the Black Radiance Shine Control primer which I have heard great things about -</li>
            <li> I think this would be good for someone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and nice but doesn&#x27;t keep me matte for long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin, but use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, clear and utterly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Did not do much for my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Mix a little bit with my foundation and it blends greatly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have 40 something mature, combination skin and wanted something to help smooth the fine lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> It provides a silky smooth surface, even concealing fine lines giving a soft lifting effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores aren&#x27;t very noticeable, but I do have light scars all over.</li>
            <li> This made my makeup look great, but after using it a few days in a row, made me break out.</li>
            <li> This really does smooth out your skin before applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> It really fills in your pores and makes your face look and feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my make-up look smooth and helps the make up stay on all day.  </li>
            <li> as well so this has help calm the melting of the eye brows.  </li>
            <li> It feels really light, and my foundation goes on very evenly over</li>
            <li> really helps my concealer go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this primer and am thankful to Amazon for carrying it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It creates a nice matte surface, and it is just sticky enough to hold makeup.  </li>
            <li> , my skin looks better if I decide to go all natural.</li>
            <li> Love it and unscented for the chemically sensitive</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but consistently, shortly after applying it I felt nausea.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So I ordered from Amazon, and it arrived fresh</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When products claim they have a noticeable difference, rarely is it all that noticeable.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> for $10 i figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some old acne scarring and it made my face look great for the big day!</li>
            <li> my forehead and my laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep my make up fresh looking.</li>
            <li> I also have a 2 year old who loves touching my face</li>
            <li> I told her Loreal, and she remarked that my skin looked very fresh, smooth, and natural.  </li>
            <li> so I would say this product would be great for dry normal skin</li>
            <li> this is the first primer/base that i have totally fallen in love with!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, i dont care, as long as the product in question looks okay</li>
            <li> Minimize pores, improve skin texture, create great CANVAS for smooth long lasting makeup.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I ordered this after watching a recommendation from AllThatGlitters21 on YouTube, and she is so right</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I have 5 jars right now.</li>
            <li> &quot; right</li>
            <li> it blends right in.  </li>
            <li> and she is right</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal was on sale, which is good because at my local store it was normally $14.99 a jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and requires only a minute to dry.&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> This base is suppose to provide a more smooth and flawless look whereas a primer is to help keep your makeup in tact longer.</li>
            <li> The second time I applied it, I actually applied it twice just to see if I liked it better thicker.</li>
            <li> today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g.</li>
            <li> I especially dislike foundation on older women because it ages us even more, with the way it settles into fine lines.</li>
            <li> For those of you with oily skin with large pores, give it a shot!</li>
            <li> It makes my 60ish, dry skin look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and, while this looks great when you put it on, the shine still  comes through in a few hours.</li>
            <li> as for this product it really does smooth the skin and the make up stays longer much longer, but it doesn&#x27;t minimize the look of the pores at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, goes on smoothly and really evens out one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I was worried when this arrived because the jar is small, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot for an all day beautiful complexion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, prefer to go easy on my skin unless it&#x27;s a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> I have lines from years of constant squinting due to extreme light sensitivity in my eyes, and this covers those fine squint lines perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have lines from years of constant squinting due to extreme light sensitivity in my eyes, and this covers those fine squint lines perfectly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I very much like this.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and makes your skin look flawless before applying makeup....</li>
            <li> When my make up is on, my makeup looks VERY natural!!!</li>
            <li> so getting the product out of this tiny jar can be a challenge. :)</li>
            <li> I used a moderate amount the first time since I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it covered.  </li>
            <li> is the first primer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very creamy but goes on feeling like nothing!</li>
            <li> It make my make up stay exactly where I put it and with my oily skin</li>
            <li> First off, let me just say this product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Having said that a jar will last more than a year, this product does not expire so,</li>
            <li> It did make my face feel soft and smooth, and It seemed to even the surface of my skin, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> My guess is there are better products for the same price.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I put it on sparingly.</li>
            <li> but it really does a wonder job on your face!  </li>
            <li> But, after a couple of hours I noticed I was touching up my makeup with powder more often than usual.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t lie when it says \\&quot;Magic\\&quot;... it really is!</li>
            <li> and I use this product not only for me but also for my clients; results are absolutely stunning...</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first day I tried putting it on with no moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed more noticeable.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product was because I saw it on tv.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for eyes - can&#x27;t say about face though since I never tried it :)</li>
            <li> First time using primer</li>
            <li> I first opened the pot and dipped my finger in</li>
            <li> The next time I used even more sparingly and just in the T-zone area where my makeup tends to &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; in the heat.</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth after putting it on, so soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> possibly even more if you&#x27;re picking up at another retailer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To conclude, I would absolutely recommend this primer!</li>
            <li> It may help to add that I have a healthy, relatively good-looking complexion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In countries that hot  </li>
            <li> For the higher end, try Scindinavia.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my first time using it</li>
            <li> Frankly, I wasn&#x27;t so sure I was for the whole primer thing in general.</li>
            <li> I love it and when I run out I plan on buying a larger size.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So, while I love eye makeup and lip color, I have simply used moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets is the first makeup primer I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I use an eye brow pencil to fill in my brows and when I get hot they look \\&quot;hot\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This primer leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and I had purchased my first one at Ulta.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it really is top notch.</li>
            <li> my first thought was \\&quot;Omg</li>
            <li> the winter, when the climate is drier, I use a moisturizer first.  </li>
            <li> At first I was unsure what was making me break</li>
            <li> First time using a primer</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;m willing to pay it).</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm for a smooth and soft coverage.</li>
            <li> If your skin is like mine (blotchy), put this on first followed by the rest of your makeup.</li>
            <li> its worth the buy and will make you photo ready.</li>
            <li> still my one &amp; only favorite primer.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this primer, but mine arrived in a box that looked beat up, and the product inside was dried up and rubbery.</li>
            <li> Very light, spreads smoothly and a little amount covers a lot of area.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this and oil of olay products the last couple of months and at 43 years old, my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would use a light touch because it is thick, but for mature skin it is the next best thing to botox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and let me know if this information was helpful by checking that box here.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and really has helped with my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a synthetic flat top brush but haven&#x27;t yet with this</li>
            <li> I now own this Primer, an Eyeliner Pencil and Mascara that I can&#x27;t use due to nausea and irritation when I apply them.</li>
            <li> For the last several months, I have been using Avon&#x27;s Magix primer with good results, but I thought I would try the L&#x27;Oreal primer since I have used L&#x27;Oreal foundation for years.  </li>
            <li> This product works great for smoothing out my skin and creating a good base for me to work from.</li>
            <li> I have very rotten skin, but when I wash my face regularly and apply this immediately and then put on my makeups, my skin tends to do better.</li>
            <li> Although I did not expect it to work miracles on some of the fine lines I&#x27;ve developed by my nose and eyes, my makeup looks airbrushed and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, feels good and makes a nice base for makeup.</li>
            <li> However, it does just as good if not better job.  </li>
            <li> and my makeup free skin actually looked a little better with two light coats.</li>
            <li> It seems to sort of lessen itself after a few hours, so maybe the staying power isnt as good as high end stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> A nice lightweight primer that conceals my pores and slightly mattifying.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought every single one before they were gone because I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have large pores.</li>
            <li> I never had problems with large pore before, after using this product</li>
            <li> FYI, I do not have wrinkles but have large pores and acne scarring that</li>
            <li> I dab it on the large pores on my nose, rub it in and then apply it to the rest of my face with a lighter application.</li>
            <li> the hell we&#x27;re calling that junk you spread all over your face to hide zits and even out skin tones and hide large pores.</li>
            <li> I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too</li>
            <li> Not only does it control my shine, but it minimizes my pores and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Imperfections, such as fine lines and visible pores are minimized or even disappear.</li>
            <li> A wonderful makeup base, goes on easily and really helps appearance of skin.</li>
            <li> As a primer newbie I feel pretty lucky to have found this second product with much higher quality and ease of application.</li>
            <li> This really does cover large pores.</li>
            <li> When I use this with moisteriser  under and a little mineral veil over my skin looks nice without looking like I am &#x27;madeup.&#x27;</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s much cheaper works way better.&lt;br /&gt;(monistat</li>
            <li> and I REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li> Well even the primer jar seemed like it wasn&#x27;t exactly really.  </li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to this thing.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face look clearer, keeps my makeup on the whole day and you don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> but it costs about 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend checking out this primer!</li>
            <li> if you use too much it just makes your make up clump up.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth surface to your skin prior to applying any foundation.</li>
            <li> I really like that even by itself (without foundation)</li>
            <li> My liquid foundation looked very streaky when I used it with this primer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s just that the products (primarily covergirl)</li>
            <li> it made my forehead look really wrinkly and it just didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> It really work to minimize imperfections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a women on color and this works very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like it just as much as the Smashbox primer</li>
            <li> I really like this product , it goes on really well .</li>
            <li> I will probably go through it fast.</li>
            <li> This really did the trick and has given me an almost-poreless complexion and has kept the shine away.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> That feeling is thanks to silicone (dimethicone) in the primer.</li>
            <li> This primer works really really well, and it does not have the silicone lubricant feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I apply it alone over my sunscreen with absolutely nothing else.</li>
            <li> The whole time I&#x27;m thinking to myself</li>
            <li> but Didn&#x27;t really notice anything change When I used the product under my fiundation and when I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I really like this primer.</li>
            <li> It really does blur out your imperfections</li>
            <li> But in real life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need as much foundation</li>
            <li> I do not have to reach for my powder or touch up my make up as much as I used to</li>
            <li> This is a very oily and greasy product.</li>
            <li> It is also very sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is supposed to work, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me, under makeup or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand the difference it makes, but after reading about them I figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> i will absolutely be buying this again</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i had heard so much about smashbox&#x27;s photo finish that i was going to order it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to use as much tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> At times it feels like I have to pull at my skin to smooth it over, which I will not continue to do because of the potential damage.  </li>
            <li> The formula itself is creamy and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> but I tried it 3 times just to be sure that I see absolutely no difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and makeup goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What really made me a believer is after a teeth cleaning under the super-bright dentist chair overhead lamp, the hygienist asked me what makeup I use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same price per ounce, but it feels thicker and heavier and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup (bareMinerals) go on quite as smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have to wait a couple minutes for it to settle in, and then I&#x27;m ready to put on the foundation stuff.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much but this works well.  </li>
            <li> or it gets really shiny but</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t take much at all,  </li>
            <li> It really did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much so one jar</li>
            <li> My face stays dewy, not oily, and I don&#x27;t need as much foundation with it.</li>
            <li> I get as much stuck under my nails as I get on my face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper</li>
            <li> A product that actually keeps my face shine free.</li>
            <li> like I had a really crappy mask on.</li>
            <li> There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so</li>
            <li> , it works really well.</li>
            <li> have very oily, acne-prone skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I want very lightened skin.</li>
            <li> It also seemingly helps my eyeshadow stay in place a bit longer on my VERY oily lids.</li>
            <li> very affordable &amp;</li>
            <li> Perfecting base is an excellent product, makes my skin so smooth and without blemish.</li>
            <li> Works well i have acne and for the most part it covers it up with out irritating my skin and causing more acne</li>
            <li> this was honestly just a waste of money, my face still ends up oily after minutes of application.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying different makeup primers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Z pore from Kohl&#x27;s for about the last 6 years and loved it but saw this stuff and was curious.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot and humid climate.  </li>
            <li> and it spreads easily, a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It somewhat is, but I have found other mattifying primers in the market that work much better.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased a different primer from another company which was in a tube and liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like more other like photoready primer of Revlon.</li>
            <li> The next day, I used a little more and while it did make my skin feel smooth, it also became \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; under my eyes and started settling very noticeably into the creases of my skin.   </li>
            <li> I am going to try and write the most in depth review about this product especialy since I know how hard it it to find a worthy primer.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face really smooth for a long time.</li>
            <li> Whenever I apply this first I get a lot of compliments about how young I look.  </li>
            <li> My skin is combination -- very oily in my T-zone and normal everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Light weight primer that provided amazing mattifying results but did not conceal my pores as well as the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Perfecting Base.</li>
            <li> Worn under various foundations rangeing from $5.00 to $65.00, and its worked beneath them all for making it last better.w many pore strips or exfoliants or how much I steam it.</li>
            <li> Second, this was not a bad price at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my new face primer!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an all over smooth effect to blend in my dry places with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions, I started with a clean face, put my regular moisturizer on (also put on lightly, since my skin isn&#x27;t real dry).  </li>
            <li> I can say for sure that this does not cause me allergies at all, and I am allergic to half this planet.</li>
            <li> My makeup sponges also can&#x27;t fit into the thin top well.</li>
            <li> If anything, powder was more difficult to apply because the creases were more defined.</li>
            <li> My face does look smooth and soft in the pictures with the primer on...not as red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a larger size because I tend to use it up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to write a review of L&#x27;loreal Magic Perfecting base.</li>
            <li> This primer does enough for me that I can use it alone, without foundation, and instantly feel better about my appearance.  </li>
            <li> Worn under various foundations rangeing from $5.00 to $65.00, and its worked beneath them all for making it last better.</li>
            <li> It really helps to smooth out large pores and tiny red lines.</li>
            <li> If I sweat a whole lot then that&#x27;s pretty  much the only time it doesn&#x27;t keep it in place.</li>
            <li> Right after application, my skin looked much smoother and my pores appeared smaller.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this if you have never had a primer before.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this primer.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations of the product because it had seen a video.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for women of all races and skin pigments.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend that you use this before putting on your foundation, etc.</li>
            <li> I find it an excellent base under concealers for anyone who constantly gets the creasing in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I originally picked it up during the winter when my face was dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I will never use any other primer after finding this one!!</li>
            <li> but so far, after using this for 2 days, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It does have a light pink color, but this color dissipates upon application.</li>
            <li> so I was quite surprised at how much I like this product.</li>
            <li> I work in a temperature controlled environment and do not have much to comment on as far as withstanding heat, etc.  </li>
            <li> and this really smooths out my concealer and foundation allowing me to have a soft look.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, an essential for your make up routine.</li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to blot like I normally do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely ever get a zit, maybe one in a blue moon, and I have never had a reaction to a product from makeup</li>
            <li> I was using the Bare Minerals primer, but did not want to pay the higher price.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth and really does take away the look of minimal wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I can apply my foundation just as I normally do.</li>
            <li> didnt gave more becouse few reasons</li>
            <li> they normally recommend that you moisturize before applying a primer, but i don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer, it didn&#x27;t feel good...</li>
            <li> probably bought this product when it first coma out, a year or so ago, since then I have to deal with very large pores</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind you will need to consider your skin type, moisturizer, foundation+all over face products prior to making a decision on which primer is right for you.</li>
            <li> Just got this product, it looks no way close to a new product, very old and most probably not genuine if not already opened and used by someone else.</li>
            <li> I used a good quality make up brush which was clogged up and very difficult to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> today I used Maybelline Primer #so far my favorite# after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it....</li>
            <li> far as acne, most new primers will give me a mild breakout--redness and small bumps--for seven to ten days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I received this on New Years Eve.</li>
            <li> My new Fav and cheaper than tarte,urban decay or it cosmetics.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  </li>
            <li> so this OCM is totally new to me.</li>
            <li> Then I put on my foundation, again, not as much as I usually do, it was all very light, I also use two kinds, liquid and not so liquid (it&#x27;s like a cream?</li>
            <li> Other primers such as the Monistat one have broken me out or felt really oily on my skin, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> When it first goes on, especially in the summer and with oily skin, you will think it is just going to melt right off or flake off, but it instantly smooths.</li>
            <li> much!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 with pores that have gotten bigger and pretty normal skin.</li>
            <li> best primer base fast shipping</li>
            <li> The primer tends to look a big flaky in this area after trying multiple methods to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula, but the texture isn&#x27;t as smooth as my first jar.</li>
            <li> Face felt very soft</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily, african-american skin.</li>
            <li> I get a small amount on my fingertip and it easily covers my whole face, including my eye</li>
            <li> When you find a beauty product that consistently delivers on its promises, you come back to it.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> at the end of the day I still looked like my old self!  </li>
            <li> I would put it everywhere if I could...getting old is not for sissies!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
            <li> I was surprised!</li>
            <li> This is one produce that does exactly what it should--I can&#x27;t praise it enough.  </li>
            <li> Work in small areas making sure the product is not drying too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I first have to get the primer out with a brush then apply the brush to my fingers, and finally my face.</li>
            <li> But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil.</li>
            <li> There are certain primers that seem to absorb into your skin and other kinds that create a smooth canvas layer above your skin...</li>
            <li> but it spreads out nicely and a little of this does go a long way.    </li>
            <li> Would not be able to use this everyday, jar very small for the price, it does cover more then</li>
            <li> I was in a rush to buy a new primer when I ran out of my old stuff</li>
            <li> Sometimes apply lightly by itself with no make up just to absorb the oil on my face for days i wanna go make-up less..</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at how well this worked for me as there are some mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> good!Only need a little bit of pores and fine lines of sight</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel very smooth and velvet-y, although I found that it was extremely hard to remove my makeup after using this.</li>
            <li> The only positive I can say is that it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> It makes my pores appear smaller, my skin much smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes much less noticeable after application.</li>
            <li> So it kind of sucks would not recommend it at all !</li>
            <li> I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> I do wish it would come in a larger pot, and was priced a little bit more affordably.</li>
            <li> So the next day, I tried using a little bit more and ended up with a completely gunky, sticky nose and and cheek area.</li>
            <li> and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk.</li>
            <li> I am a 39 year old female with oily skin that has never broken out or had any acne even in my teens,</li>
            <li> It is unlike others Ive tried, not like a clear primer.</li>
            <li> I have very non sensitive facial skin however, so I cannot attest to whether it causes acne.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at this since I toss and move about while I am asleep.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout</li>
            <li> BUT, when i received this primer today, it seemed like it was a decade old.  </li>
            <li> I guess the box just must&#x27;ve been old or abuse.  </li>
            <li> it made no difference when used, as far as covering up darker color under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the primer, but so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as</li>
            <li> And it can make your face break out if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s saying a lot for a 64-yr old.</li>
            <li> I tried a brush, my fingers and even directly applying the concealer to my skin from the bottle but every time id go to blend it, the concealer just wiped away.</li>
            <li> but I really like my makeup and am not about to get different makeup just to use this primer.</li>
            <li> Im in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> thick&lt;br /&gt;Although, it does work as far as keeping make up on.</li>
            <li> It was a complete disaster.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a drug store brand worked this well.</li>
            <li> When did I get old?  </li>
            <li> It was so soft.</li>
            <li> It still felt soft but a tad greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did take some pictures with my face natural and some with just the primer on.</li>
            <li> Beware if you are sensitive or have allergies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tempting to use it all over your face as it gives a completely airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t burn or anything to put on.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Had a piece of hair in it &amp; just looked old.</li>
            <li> Your face will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom..</li>
            <li> My foundation/bronzer/blush/highlighter stay on my face until the end of my work day and it allows for seamless blending of my blush, highlighter, and bronzer.</li>
            <li> completely poreless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This primer doesn&#x27;t make my pores go away completely</li>
            <li> Second, it is so slippery that I couldn&#x27;t get the makeup to stick to it very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of L&#x27;loreal products and find you really get a quality product at drug store prices.</li>
            <li> I am 64 and have some soft lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li> My skin is supper sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and there are no problems with breakouts or redness.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I really had no idea that there even was such a product, but I was hunting for one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31years old</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how it camouflages  pore size.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars so far because it is winter, lets see how this works during the summer in the heat.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne blemishes, and I break out frequently.  </li>
            <li> On a younger person it would really cover.</li>
            <li> The lines around by eyes are minimized and my skin feels soooooo soft.</li>
            <li> After applying makes your skin feel really soft</li>
            <li> I really wish they had this in a larger quantity.  </li>
            <li> leaves the skin really soft and matte.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this primer to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, my skin ALWAYS looks at least a bit better when I use it.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t feel soft..</li>
            <li> I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Its gritty but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li> is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers.</li>
            <li> I love that it fills the &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; on my face without feeling heavy and helps makeup last longer.  </li>
            <li> I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years</li>
            <li> one of the best base products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best base I have come across to date.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit weird, you have to rub it in good.</li>
            <li> This cream is the perfect base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> Its good, but i was not exceptionally impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the softness of the skin after applying this base.</li>
            <li> It makes a perfect base before adding makeup.</li>
            <li> It truly works magic, suddenly it seems my face glowed after a slight cover!</li>
            <li> But what I discovered is that it glides on easily and really very little of the primer is needed.</li>
            <li> you have ever had sensitive burning skin with the wrong kind of soap or lotion, I&#x27;d avoid this particular product like the plague.</li>
            <li> ) A little goes a long way so for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t wear make up every day, a jar lasts for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> Great base, especially in the winter when you need a \\&quot;Full Face\\&quot;, no tan whatsoever and</li>
            <li> I am going to have to buy more soon, though, as it&#x27;s such a small bottle</li>
            <li> I have pretty big pores on my inner cheeks and on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;d get this at a drugstore, but my local drugstore is notorious for having old, expired products on their shelves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put my makeup on without using this first, it really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It dissolves right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Four stars only because it does not do well on damp areas or in high humidity situations.  </li>
            <li> Then a recent high def photo, taken by a dentist, and shown to me on a plasma TV had me running for the hills.  </li>
            <li> Price was too high for me to be using the primer on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This base makes a nice smooth flawless looking base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> IT REMIND ME OF THE CLARINS INSTANT SMOOTH PRIMER JUST HALF THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It really helps my eye makeup stay put all day long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and really like it.  </li>
            <li> However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted, delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, this is good as to the fact that not much comes in the container</li>
            <li> I also found that in certain places, the foundation and the primer balled up together and made a flaky look, making my make up very noticeable when usually my foundation is very natural.</li>
            <li> My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes on smoothly, fills little lines and pores.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard to get the product out easily.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and live in Hawaii, one of the mose humid palces on Earth especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I began trying several primers recently&amp; this one I really like.</li>
            <li> Multiple large, deep pimples that took several weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li> After I finally \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; my makeup, it still looked more obvious than usual.</li>
            <li> My skin is-oily beneath with a dry surface, light coloured Italian skin, 39 yrs old,I live in very extreme weather.</li>
            <li> My skin is-oily beneath with a dry surface, light coloured Italian skin, 39 yrs old,I live in very extreme weather.</li>
            <li> New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer, Clear, 0.85 Fluid Ounce</li>
            <li> Applying my makeup over it certainly did not give a look I expected, or wanted.</li>
            <li> First of all, all you need is a *tiny* dab (a little goes a LONG way!), and a small amount easily spreads over your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have large pores but don&#x27;t usually try new things as I have a professional line of skin care I use..</li>
            <li> like L&#x27;OREAL products in general, but this one did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The outside packaging was faded and the box seemed it was old.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily  have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I barely recognize myself in the mirror anymore.  </li>
            <li> It will ball up when applying if your&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> i definitely have combination/oily skin and have been looking for something to keep the oils in control because near the end of the day my face will be so shiny.</li>
            <li> I found this to be much thicker than I expected...</li>
            <li> Concealed my pores but barely mattifying.</li>
            <li> Be back with a complete review.</li>
            <li> I like the balmy way it feels on the outside corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white in the tub but comes out completely transparent on my face.</li>
            <li> recently purchased Arbonne primer and, wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I used it for several months and then stopped using it in early summer.</li>
            <li> In the summer, I put it on bare skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica</li>
            <li> This is thick going on but melts into your face, giving it a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> primer is quite thick and not as light and creamy as it appears in print advertisements.</li>
            <li> Too thick, does not apply smoothly and does not prime the skin...  Do not recomend ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> This is thick and smooth, filling in pores and making my skin softer before applying make up.</li>
            <li> because I think I only paid $7 for this base but so far it&#x27;s been holding up pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It feels thick and heavy right out of the package, but smooths over skin and becomes a light undercoat for my foundation.  </li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on different primers, this will definitely be my new daily primer.</li>
            <li> My pores are far less noticeable and my foundation doesn&#x27;t &#x27;settle in the cracks&#x27; as much.</li>
            <li> No more large pores..!!  </li>
            <li> Weird how such a seemingly subtle makeup application can lead to flawless results and loads of compliments!</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry, in case that helps in your decision whether to buy L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re interested... here is my comparison to other primers I have tried on the market (based on personal experience and skin type):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure enough, over the next several days I got several more deep, painful pimples.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on and appears to immediately &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the skin at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> Both of these things are exactly what I need to counteract my lines, dark circles, acne scars, and larger pores.  </li>
            <li> I love how silky and smooth my face feels when I apply this base.  </li>
            <li> First I moisturize and then I dab my finger and just use a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the price I paid for the primer is higher than on Amazon, by the time one adds in the shipping, it comes out to about the same or even less.</li>
            <li> I have some dark/red spots but not more than you would expect on someone who is only 20 and has had mild acne.    </li>
            <li> which is much preferred to an average person&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I barely used it only because it got buried in the kit</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and no acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;use a primer\\&quot; \\&quot;use a primer\\&quot; in beauty articles, because after a few hours, the oils in my skin start to mix with my makeup, and on hot days...</li>
            <li> This is a notch higher than the makeup I use everyday.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a huge fan of supporting Loreal or their unethical treatments/chemicals, sometimes duty calls and I have to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have a very dark complexion, acne prone skin, acne scars, open pores and very very oily</li>
            <li> I have finger nails (not very long) and the product always gets stuck under them.</li>
            <li> Once my moisturizer is completely dry (as stated on the primer&#x27;s instructions), I&#x27;ll dip my clean ring finger into the primer jar and dab small amounts of this primer around my face.</li>
            <li> Felt super thick and chalky/cakey.</li>
            <li> I wish there were another size available as tiny little half ounce jars of things</li>
            <li> However, makeup goes on a whole lot easier, and I actually use less of my cream foundation.</li>
            <li> but it settles into every little crease in your face and makes you look a lot older!</li>
            <li> could see this Base becoming a part of my regular makeup routine for years, and originally I went in thinking none of them would work</li>
            <li> I actually had a little trial size of this in a magazine that I tried and after using it I went straight out and bought two of them (with a coupon).</li>
            <li> then L&#x27;Oreal Perfecting Base - very nice.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel extremely velvety soft, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Okay, i usually dislike when i read negative reviews on here, thinking the people are too picky or obnoxious.</li>
            <li> I have a small laugh lines around my eye&#x27;s but not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My make up looks so much better when I use this base first.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t use as much as I normally do, the little wrinkles on my bottom eye lid made everything start to goup up along the wrinkle line.  </li>
            <li> I notice that small lines are indeed less apparent, although I don&#x27;t feel that the primer didn&#x27;t really makes the large pores on my nose less visible.</li>
            <li> You apply it on the highly porous parts of your skin and wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon whenever I go to special gatherings.</li>
            <li> Pores and small lines were really minimized.</li>
            <li> The primer WILL ball up into small lumps if you either use too much product or over rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how fast you&#x27;d go through it if you did.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s as revolutionary a product as what a flat iron could have done for the 80s.</li>
            <li> And it makes my makeup last all day long without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> This jar is going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;TZONE:&lt;br /&gt;Apply over your entire face.</li>
            <li> You have to use just a little dab of this product at a time and then spread it as far as it will go or it will build up and leave white streaks on you face.</li>
            <li> It was light pink and very thick, but it wasn&#x27;t oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> If i use regular run of the mill soap on my face, i get an almost burning dry sensation when I get out of the shower, but I haven&#x27;t felt that in years since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> days after using this, I noticed that everywhere on my face that I had applied the product (around my nose, middle of my forehead, and chin), was extremely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need much of the product, so the jar should last you at least a month.</li>
            <li> When I noticed my skin started feeling dry again, I pulled this product back out.</li>
            <li> I probably will not buy again for two reasons: the product is thick, doesn&#x27;t spread well and makes me feel like I am really rubbing and pulling on my face to spread it, and second, I do not like the jar.</li>
            <li> This is not the worst primer I have ever used, and certainly not the best.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concern at first as I have oily and acne-prone skin that it will be a waste of money that will only be used a few times if I develop breakouts.</li>
            <li> I usually keep things that are halfway decent because I could use them as backups, or give them to someone I know if they want it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little self conscious throughout my day because I work in customer service.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of makeup, but unfortunately I struggle with acne (age 24) and have a bit to cover up -- acne as well as bad pores, and not so great texture on parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am usually not sensitive around my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> After not much luck of finding one in every department store within a 100 miles, I finally found this....</li>
            <li> My makeup stays on twice as long when I use this.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I&#x27;m not completely matte, but I am dewy.</li>
            <li> Not completely mattifying but doesn&#x27;t make me into a greaseball either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As long as you have a cover up that matches your skin tone</li>
            <li> All day long my skim was like velvet.</li>
            <li> The castor oil is kicking butt ladies on sebum and now my pores aren&#x27;t grey specks in need of extractions from a cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than others, and it is not clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is caky and thick and didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> This has a very matte, thick texture, almost buttery.</li>
            <li> This is a really good makeup base.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, even though the company claims that it is non-comedogenic, when I use it to disguise the large pores on the sides of my nose, I always end up with a small whitehead or two, something that I NEVER get with any other product.</li>
            <li> The container of primer is very small and if you were to use large quantities rather than dot it on your face you would have to end up buying it</li>
            <li> and I must say, it not only makes my makeup last longer but also my face is less oily.</li>
            <li> She broke out a week and half later in same spot</li>
            <li> a 5hr period you may only need one slight touch up may be only on your t zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since you don&#x27;t need much in a single application, one of these has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I still use it, but only under my eyes, which is a big disappointment, since my main reason for purchasing it was to disguise large pores and keep down the shine on my nose.</li>
            <li> : Use a facial mositorizer, and place a little bit of loreal product on back of hand.</li>
            <li> I may have a small blemish or two during the month, but this break out was epic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To provide a little background, I am in my mid 20s, have oily asian skin which has also resulted into enlarged pores on my cheeks by my nose.</li>
            <li> Other than it&#x27;s a very tiny container</li>
            <li> This is my fifth jar, and it goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> If you have very long finger nails, it&#x27;s going to get in them, but then again, so is everything else that you touch.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is very thick and at first it is tough to gauge how much will be necessary.</li>
            <li> That dry soap burn</li>
            <li> My chin was unbearably dry.</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> I also had issues in my nose tzone area with this primer - it would cause a dry flaky patch.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Some areas are oily; some are dry.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be creamier, but was somewhat dry, and caked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for combination skin dry</li>
            <li> are my results: My skin is combo oil and dry.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> its just oily inside, dry surface.</li>
            <li> Secrets base goes on perfectly smooth, and I don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  </li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror and it seemed like every single pore on my face had soaked up every ounce of foundation and powder.  </li>
            <li> It instantly covers up any dark circles or veins that are visible under my eyes.</li>
            <li> (something I do not normally do)</li>
            <li> For ethnic skin this could pose an issue because I can just see it turning dark skin white and looking ashy.</li>
            <li> Applying this base over moisturizer gives my skin a stunning appearance, and allows my natural pink cheeks to show through.</li>
            <li> IT AUTOMATICALLY SMOOTHS YOUR SKIN AND ALLOWS YOUR MAKEUP TO LAST ALL DAY WITH MINIMAL POWDERING!!</li>
            <li> your usual moisturizer,  then apply the primer&lt;br /&gt;its very matte and almost fades into your skin and a little bit goes</li>
            <li> It is not very large</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems as though I needed less makeup and concealer to get the same desired affect on my face.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount so even with daily use</li>
            <li> I love this product because shockingly it does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> Helps make blemishes look less red too</li>
            <li> The product is just too small that won&#x27;t last a month for daily applications.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these and says there the same as in the store for less money.</li>
            <li> The product was not old, and was not hard or anything like the other bad reviews, it looked new, fresh and was not at all hard to put on, but the results were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, I found it to have a strange consistency.</li>
            <li> my face was to slippery for it to go on....and too slippery for me to even pull my eye back a little to apply my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> But I wish the product was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> and I swear that my skin has actually improved a little since using this stuff.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars instead of a five was because it was a little pricy for what you get and since you have to stick you fingers into the jar to get the product out, I always seem to get the stuff under my nails and it just seems wasteful to me.</li>
            <li> Maybe made my skin a little smoother for initial application of makeup, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> This base is absolutely AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> It hides my pores and gives me an amazing base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> This product is way below what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using a sample of it for the last few months and have had no reactions to it.</li>
            <li> my face still looks nice and smooth every time i use L&#x27;oreals paris studio secret base!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel wet</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it should last a few months.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in time and what expected</li>
            <li> Was missing inner lid and product was &amp;#34;disturbed&amp;#34; in container.</li>
            <li> so I do not have anything to compare it to, but it wasn&#x27;t as I expected.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re not much into the makeup look like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the base all over my face and eye lids for smooth application of cream eye shadow (natural pallette).</li>
            <li> Brandt and creates a nice base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is kind of a smoother before applying a makeup base.  </li>
            <li> After trying a few other brands that were way more expensive, I gave L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Magic Perfecting Base a try.</li>
            <li> Over the years I would try different foundations and makeups to try to tame the shine but they never really blended well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> However, a little bit goes a long way, and since it&#x27;s in a pot, it&#x27;s a little bit easier to control and not overuse compared to similar products that come in tubes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;s not as expensive as Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish, you&#x27;ve come to the right spot.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way being it is so creamy.</li>
            <li> But I figured maybe a little goes a long way, and it does for those who like it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> One of my go to primers, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it glides on the skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the price for such a teeny little container.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small and you need tiny fingers to get in.</li>
            <li> I applied it after moisturizer, like the other two.</li>
            <li> Although very small container a tiny amount goes a long way...</li>
            <li> my pores were extremely noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> #34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Just put it on one side of your face and don&#x27;t do the other and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> It beats the expensive name brand hot shots out there.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and thought that this MIGHT help with foundation application or oil control or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so people say I look 25 and one person carded me the other day when I bought some liquor and thought I was 19.</li>
            <li> Those who have larger pores have blackheads usually.</li>
            <li> With the moisturizer and base, I can easily blend the small amount of color, and not hide the natural color or skin.</li>
            <li> I would suggest trying this very carefully before going big.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment: 50$ down the drain...literally!</li>
            <li> I spent less time buffing my foundation (I use mineral powder foundation from Monave) and a goat hair kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> the primer has been applied, I will focus on my eye makeup, allowing the primer to dry for a few minutes before applying my liquid MAC foundation.</li>
            <li> I tired this years ago, and it made it way back to the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> The foundation wouldn&#x27;t apply properly and just mixed with the layer of muck that sat on my poor face.</li>
            <li> Also, the product made my eyes swell up a little and water all day long like a slight allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as it was highly recommended to me, unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can leave a small area of white residue that I need to rub off before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> IMO, it provides the same effect of the Magic Perfecting Base - a smooth silky base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for some people but for me it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> the cream was not fresh,  but usable.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product, and</li>
            <li> I have never liked wearing foundation for several reasons: I don&#x27;t like how it feels or</li>
            <li> I started using it religiously the past few months</li>
            <li> For me, on average, this has a four hour effect when I use it solo.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t made for the purpose of keeping your makeup on longer, it&#x27;s more of, well a perfecting base, like it says on the jar.</li>
            <li> I have been using Too Faced Primed &amp; Poreless (Sephora) for almost a year now and thought I&#x27;d give the Magic Perfecting Base by Loreal a try since it was on sale</li>
            <li> i love to use this as a base before applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Still searching for a product that will provide a better primer base for my makeup.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the magic perfecting base for about a year.</li>
            <li> I hate that most primers are very slippery and very thin.</li>
            <li> My skin actually looked worse (pores and lines magnified) and my makeup applied dry and smudgy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get rid of them but does tone then down.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look matte and helps keep down the oily shine.  </li>
            <li> perhaps the air from the past couple of days made my face dry?</li>
            <li> I usually have moderately dry skin, but my t-zone can be oily at times.  </li>
            <li> but if you have oily skin like I do  you would have to keep using powder foundation or oil absorbing pads which I am very tired of</li>
            <li> I had originally read about this base in a magazine, so I had absolutely no idea what to expect other than \\&quot;silky skin.\\</li>
            <li> Comes in a small jar,  but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it made my skin feel smooth, but after a few hours my skin had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> using this, you also end up needing to use less foundation.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> and it is a lot less money.</li>
            <li> and I need less of it using this product.</li>
            <li> AND NIGHT.I ALSO HAVE TO USE LESS FOUNDATION WHEN I USE IT</li>
            <li> I work with kids for half of the day once i get home</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly scented, which seemed to bother some reviewers</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on this website but found it half price on an auction site.  </li>
            <li> It was softer, less oily and my pores were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Some of her acne was serious and left holes.</li>
            <li> But at the end of the day, slightly masky again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so yes it does have a slight lightening effect on skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve gotten to where even if I don&#x27;t put on anything afterward, I generally wear this stuff at the very least.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing this up with tiny amt of Ponds cold cream before to hide&amp; also moisten up very dry patches of peeling skin at my nose and mixed</li>
            <li> I tried mixing this up with tiny amt of Ponds cold cream before to hide&amp; also moisten up very dry patches of peeling skin at my nose and mixed</li>
            <li> a mess, not used but thrown away</li>
            <li> The primer is cakey and a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> It is a mess.</li>
            <li> This covers the mess well.</li>
            <li> This covers the mess well.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin with a bit of ruddiness in some parts, coupled with dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> My one complaint to L&#x27;Oreal would be their overuse of cardboard packaging for such a small item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base become white on the face after  hot temperatur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little spatula would have been helpful.  </li>
            <li> and i have little wrinkles</li>
            <li> it seemed like it would clump up a little.</li>
            <li> In the summer, it it sometimes all I need with a little blush and lipstick and I have a little tan.  </li>
            <li> Now I can push botox off for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> I apply my makeup at 7:30AM and by 1PM I will still need to do a little blotting in my tzone area although my pores still look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I had been using DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat and thought I would try to find something a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used primers that cost as little as $5.00 to ones that were over $70.00.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price !</li>
            <li> So I received this little beauty yesterday and immediately tried it out....</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than I like but it does the trick and evens out my face</li>
            <li> Just a little of this and a bit of mineral powder</li>
            <li> Then I dabbed ever so little of this stuff on all over my trouble zones</li>
            <li> /&gt;The people who write bad reviews on this product are clearly the ones who over-use.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a little.</li>
            <li> I have used a few primers before</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> However, after a few hours, I had \\&quot;the shine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday under my foundation.  </li>
            <li> these.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Loreal base applied smoothly.</li>
            <li> Must reapply after a few hours.</li>
            <li> A 3 season item, not for summer as too heavy.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I have trouble with this primer in one of my tzone areas between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy products on my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out and it doesn&#x27;t have harsh scents UPDATE:</li>
            <li> And as much as I hate to admit it, I probably fit that category.</li>
            <li> When applying it makes your face feel greasy but then after a few minutes it goes away.</li>
            <li> I have never understood why I would want to cover up the natural pinkness in my skin, then add fake color with blush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup, but I&#x27;m not comfortable wearing none at all.  </li>
            <li> This is now a part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> This is a thick primer with a pink tint.  </li>
            <li> I realized it was happening a few days after I would wear this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive base products from department stores, but none for me is as good as L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> It is a waxy substance and not breathable..it doesn&#x27;t even wash off your fingers in just plain water so makes sense why it would plug pores.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for how small the jar is</li>
            <li> Perfecting Base is right!  </li>
            <li> I live in a very cold and dry climate now (</li>
            <li> My nails get a little longer so it gets hard to scoop this out.</li>
            <li> for the hard to spread consistency there is too little product.</li>
            <li> Very little goes a lonnnnnng way.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little product.</li>
            <li> I wear it alone everyday and hardly ever use face powder now.</li>
            <li> If you eat fast food and bad foods, no matter what you put on your face for acne won&#x27;t work because its all coming from the inside.....</li>
            <li> i usually dont even use foundation when using this product</li>
            <li> I usually use a eye pencil to line my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I got it on sale and use just a small amount per application and for the difference it makes</li>
            <li> If you are a prime member I would order it on here, it is 10 bucks in stores if not more.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s quite a small amount for a product that retails in the $10-$12 range.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try anyway and blended a small amount on my face as directed.</li>
            <li> I am not prone to acne, I am in my late 40&#x27;s and the &amp;#34;zit years&amp;#34; are long behind me.</li>
            <li> so I usually walk around shining all day.</li>
            <li> As a rule of thumb with makeup application, always work with small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> No More:</li>
            <li> really sorry  for my english  </li>
            <li> It is a small jar</li>
            <li> I use a lip pencil as lipstick usually with a gloss</li>
            <li> My loyalties are usually with Clinique or Philosophy</li>
            <li> I ordered this just to try it out since I know it is small.</li>
            <li> I dab a small spot of lip color on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Usually I use it before applying makeup and it hold up for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but this is one of the things I cannot go without.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart when I was too lazy to drive to Ulta or Sephora for Prime Time.</li>
            <li> I usually have to powder my face every couple of hours</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small jar</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin, and it&#x27;s taken me awhile to find products that won&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick after an hour.</li>
            <li> look how small this is, this s</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, Sonya Dakar, Oil of Olay, Almay, Aveeno, and Andalou Naturals.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It does not break me out and its slick without being oily.</li>
            <li> One thing I did do, is I used the L&#x27;Oreal primer in the small jar for my eyelids and it was alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually apply it after I use soap #evening primrose and borage#</li>
            <li> After reading the directions, it says to dab your face with small dots of the cream and blend it in with a circular motion.</li>
            <li> This is only the 2nd base I have ever used</li>
            <li> I usually use a Biore strip to pull then up but after 5 days of using the castor oil method of cleansing for oily skin, I tried Biore strips today and hardly anything surfaced.</li>
            <li> i was really looking forward to this primer for under my foundation but was disappointed after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit slick and thick.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to go crazy and use everywhere as that can give a slightly washed out look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not high end or even mediocre.</li>
            <li> To my ladies and gentlemen having a hard time using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is gummy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> and it was so hard to order it</li>
            <li> I found the product thick and hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the least of your worries.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Duh</li>
            <li> why i gave it 4 stars, is that the jar is so tiny and it can be kinda awkward to get out.</li>
            <li> at least bi-weekly.  </li>
            <li> It felt like thick putty and balled up as I was trying to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works like this, the others are either too heavy or to thin.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to pile on my makeup after using this product and it seemed like it decreased the coverage of my everyday use makeup.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind this is a thick, creamy primer and not a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> For my taste, it was too matte and thick.  </li>
            <li> I knew it had to be the perfecting base, as every other makeup item I had used the same night as the primer were products I&#x27;ve been using for months, and have had no reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> trust me all you need is a small amount !</li>
            <li> My cheeks looked horrible as well, imagine putting makeup on an old zit or sore that has that dry flaky skin around it.  </li>
            <li> I have bad skin, but generally makeup covers my flaws.</li>
            <li> It does come in a very small size</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in a very small jar</li>
            <li> Very small jar though.</li>
            <li> I find that they do NOT help to keep my make up on and just helps it to slide off even when using a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount and allow time for it to set before applying any make up over it.</li>
            <li> The jar it comes in is very small and quite pricey</li>
            <li> I have some serious sun damage (brown spots), wrinkles, and I break out once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, which makes it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a primer before, it may feel a little weird to the touch, as it almost feels slippery (although not greasy).</li>
            <li> Also, after a short time it had a bad scent.</li>
            <li> When you tried to apply it, it was thick and broke into pieces, like it was outdated.</li>
            <li> It hurts to even touch my chin and right under my nose, where the breakout seems to be the worst.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product did was make me look sick, my skin have an un-natural ashy appearance and it enhanced any dryness I had on my skin.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout like crazy and it made me look extremely cakey.</li>
            <li> I at least want to use it up, but it really did an awful job compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This primer comes in a small glass pot containing a mere .5 ounce.  </li>
            <li> I only used it twice :( won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Nars and those expensive brands from Sephora</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be disappointed that the advertized benefits would not meet expectations, but I was shocked that this product does exactly as promised --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still addicted to my smashbox primer</li>
            <li> I use this base on my eyes only.</li>
            <li> If you have some extra money to spend, I&#x27;d recommend Lancome&#x27;s La Base Pro as a primer.</li>
            <li> La Base Pro also keeps my makeup lasting longer than a setting spray does, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my secret make up weapon.</li>
            <li> The base  box is only 2/3 full&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I am now totally addicted.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I get broken capillaries on my cheeks in winter</li>
            <li> Well, I gave this prodcut a few tries, and each time I looked worst than the day before.</li>
            <li> While my foundation stayed on, my skin looked dull, dry and horrible.</li>
            <li> This is a decent base for makeup if you like to use a base, which I do.  </li>
            <li> I took it back for a refund - very disappointed in this product.   </li>
            <li> It is not a lot, but it is a little annoying</li>
            <li> but once you apply it it becomes little pieces of the base.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was way too expensive for the amount of product and the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-redhead and always have problems with freckles and pores and a weird combination T-zone thing happening.</li>
            <li> but i got a sample of the hourglass primer ( EXPENSIVE)</li>
            <li> , I was a bit shocked on the thick consistency.</li>
            <li> I do agree it is difficult to get it out of the jar without getting it under your fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m applying this wrong, but when I put it on it smears and flakes off.</li>
            <li> I use my face feel uncomfortable, I won&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> While it is a bit expensive it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> the overly fake \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look of foundation, the way it rubs off or melts off on clothes, etc.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is too expensive for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, but it just sat on my skin all sticky and never &#x27;set.</li>
            <li> It looked really weird when I received it .  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on the expensive brands until I tried the drug store ones.</li>
            <li> very small!!</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical about foundations and face creams because I break out if the quality is not great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very ugly , not worth one dollar</li>
            <li> When I ordered the perfecting base I expected a creamy base.</li>
            <li> I now have SEVEN \\&quot;underground\\&quot; very painful zits... and ONLY where I had applied the L&#x27;Oreal base.</li>
            <li> Flakes.. SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid my skin would look a bit chalky or cakey wearing this product</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might ball up, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Something about this product made it very difficult to apply my foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> It was almost impossible</li>
            <li> its impossible to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use it for an eye primer now and it isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> The product made me feel oily and it felt like it was bad for my face.</li>
            <li> what is in this product that made my face freak out this badly, but boy, I am never using this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one thing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Never before I had a make op product that was SO bad.</li>
            <li> so I ran to Walmart and they sell this bad boy for $10.95....</li>
            <li> Bad goods, is produced in 2012.After</li>
            <li> bad product.</li>
            <li> Grr:(</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will probably use it because I bought it, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you try to save some money... :(</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed with my purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This base works well</li>
            <li> This base doesn&#x27;t correct flaws like it says it does.  </li>
            <li> but HATE the fact that it breaks me out.</li>
            <li> It is a base</li>
            <li> Then when I put my base or powder on....</li>
            <li> I put my foundation on, then use this base before I powder &amp; then I apply my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> LOREAL PERFECTING BASE MAKES MY MAKE</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a makeup base before.</li>
            <li> The base I received was like clay.</li>
            <li> and the base was a gift for my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought this and find the pot annoying (I don&#x27;t want to dip my fingers in it, I also don&#x27;t want to buy a brush just for primer).</li>
            <li> Also, I find that my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease when I use this as a base.</li>
            <li> i absolutely  hate this one by Loreal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if the L&#x27;Oreal Base would interfere with that.  </li>
            <li> as a makeup primer and ended up buying that when I was 3/4 of the way done with this base.</li>
            <li> I put this on before any base or foundation or liquid powder or whatever</li>
            <li> Base foundation primer</li>
            <li> I hate oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for mineral make-up powder (Glo Perfecting Powder) &amp; blusher.  </li>
            <li> she wore this base.</li>
            <li> I hate foundation because it&#x27;s cakey.</li>
            <li> and I hate looking at them,</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal for this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff was awful!  </li>
            <li> but again this is a base, not a primer!</li>
            <li> but it made it LOOK terrible.</li>
            <li> Looks awful.  </li>
            <li> This primer is probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever used and now understand why it&#x27;s a drugstore primer.</li>
            <li> I tried using it once, and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Its was awful.</li>
            <li> I am attaching a picture so you can see how horrible this product is.</li>
            <li> On my worst skin days, this still makes my eyes look</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely terrible!!!</li>
            <li> the worst break out</li>
            <li> This  is truly a skin perfecting base!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It just works the best.</li>
            <li> This worked OK but I found using something else that&#x27;s much cheaper works way better.&lt;br /&gt;(monistat chafing gel)</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice.  The jar is tiny so it is hard to get the product out easily.  I have allergy prone skin and it did not cause any issues which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found to put on yur face before applying makeup!</li>
            <li> It works well for what its intended to do. it feels very smooth on face.&lt;br /&gt;I have nails so getting the product out of this tiny jar can be a challenge. :)</li>
            <li> To my ladies and gentlemen having a hard time using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the product not blend into skin easily?&lt;br /&gt;Fix: Use a facial mositorizer, and place a little bit of loreal product on back of hand. Allow product to sit for about 20 seconds. Then apply product to your moistorized face. &#x3D;] Should blend fairly easily into the skin. Worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, when used properly, its EXCELLENT! When my make up is on, my makeup looks VERY natural!!! Very impressed with this little drug store product!</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching good primers and came across this. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a primer, however. It isn&#x27;t made for the purpose of keeping your makeup on longer, it&#x27;s more of, well a perfecting base, like it says on the jar. It does make your skin feel very smooth and velvet-y, although I found that it was extremely hard to remove my makeup after using this. I washed my face three times and I was still finding makeup left when I went over my skin with toner and a cotton ball. If you have nice skin with no acne, then buy this, but if you plan on using foundation and concealer and stuff, skip it and find another primer.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t arrived at time and as I was on vacation in USA I didn&#x27;t had time to return the item because I came back to my country.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many primers so I don&#x27;t have tons to compare this to but so far, after using this for 2 days, I really like it. I have used a few primers before and I have not been satisfied. I like how this glides over my moisturzed face. My concealer smooths on easily over it and my mineral powder settles onto my face evenly. It feels light. I love the matt finish. I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought two today on a bogo 1/2 price sale at Ulta.  I&#x27;ve also seen it for sale at Rite Aid &amp; CVS.</li>
            <li> I bought this when looking for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Eye De Crease.  Figured I would give it a try.  I&#x27;m a woman of color, African American, medium skin tone and this works well.  I was afraid my skin would look a bit chalky or cakey wearing this product but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  After a full day of wearing and a nap, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product glides on smoothly and feels nice on skin.&lt;br /&gt;It seems as though I needed less makeup and concealer to get the same desired affect on my face.  I spent less time buffing my foundation (I use mineral powder foundation from Monave) and a goat hair kabuki brush.  Sometimes I use a synthetic flat top brush but haven&#x27;t yet with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I napped (we have a toddler and I&#x27;m a stay at home mom) and my makeup appeared to be the same.  I was surprised at this since I toss and move about while I am asleep.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day, I touched my face and it felt very smooth, like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;When Baby and I hugged throughout the day, I didn&#x27;t leave makeup on her clothes as I sometimes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this product.  I wish there were another size available as tiny little half ounce jars of things just seems wasteful to me.  All of that packaging for something so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I also have seborrheic dermatitis (though it is greatly controlled) and no flaking or skin irritation so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and would buy it again.  I did not give it 5 stars because this is my first time buying and using a makeup primer, there may be something greater out there.  I&#x27;ll update after using the product over an extended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I REALLY like it.  I forgot to wear it one day and there is a noticeable difference in makeup when I don&#x27;t wear this product.  We even went to the beach for a full day and my makeup was still great.  At the end of the day, my face looks as good as it does right after I&#x27;ve applied my makeup.  That&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  So, Great product.  I will buy it again.  I just wish it came in a bigger jar.after I&#x27;ve applied my makeup.  That&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  So, Great product.  I will buy it again.  I just wish it came in a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> I have been using Too Faced Primed &amp; Poreless (Sephora) for almost a year now and thought I&#x27;d give the Magic Perfecting Base by Loreal a try since it was on sale and I had a coupon.  This stuff was awful!  It felt like thick putty and balled up as I was trying to apply it.  I used a moderate amount the first time since I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it covered.  I use a mineral makeup foundation and saw no difference in the fine lines under my eyes when using the Loreal primer.      The next day, I used a little more and while it did make my skin feel smooth, it also became \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; under my eyes and started settling very noticeably into the creases of my skin.   I took it back for a refund - very disappointed in this product.   Too Faced is pricey, but it works better than the Loreal.    I have 40 something mature, combination skin and wanted something to help smooth the fine lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a bigger bottle! It&#x27;s just so darn tiny.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first primer I&#x27;ve tried. I was planning to buy Maybelline&#x27;s version, but it was sold out (as was Cover Girl&#x27;s). The L&#x27;oreal was on sale, which is good because at my local store it was normally $14.99 a jar. Too much!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 with pores that have gotten bigger and pretty normal skin. I have some serious sun damage (brown spots), wrinkles, and I break out once in awhile. I use this after I moisturize &amp; before my foundation (Cover Girl Aqua Smoothing).&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel like silk! My pores are far less noticeable and my foundation doesn&#x27;t &#x27;settle in the cracks&#x27; as much. It did not make me break out and you only have to use a tiny bit each day.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again...for sure!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice smooth silky face primer when I decided to try this product. The price was right so I went ahead.  I was hoping for an all over smooth effect to blend in my dry places with the rest of my face. So that my makeup would have an all over smooth look.  I found the product thick and hard to blend in. The bottle is small and you need tiny fingers to get in. A little spatula would have been helpful.  Sorry I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. But if your skin is all over the same texture it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was on Marie Clairs must have beauty products. I honestly could not tell the difference while using the product. Maybe it works for some people but for me it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Okay, i usually dislike when i read negative reviews on here, thinking the people are too picky or obnoxious. BUT, when i received this primer today, it seemed like it was a decade old.  The outside packaging was faded and the box seemed it was old.  That&#x27;s fine, i dont care, as long as the product in question looks okay right? Well even the primer jar seemed like it wasn&#x27;t exactly really.  As if either someone had replaced the product with something else in the jar.  I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, so i dont know what it&#x27;s like, but even the letters on the jar seem like they&#x27;re falling/rubbing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this item, but they will charge me shipping and all that jig.  Sigh.  Was really looking forward to this thing.  Bigger sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After actually USING this product, it does appear to be good.  It definitely does smooth out skin and gives it a nice surface for makeup to be applied to.  I guess the box just must&#x27;ve been old or abuse.  But the product is okay. (: Yay.</li>
            <li> For me, it compares to the most expensive out there. I love it and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This product is way below what I expected. It&#x27;s sticky, feels grimmy and goopy (if that&#x27;s a word) on my face.  I don&#x27;t like it at all and I am taking it back.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;s not as expensive as Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish, you&#x27;ve come to the right spot.  This primer is perfect when set with power or spray.  It creates a nice matte surface, and it is just sticky enough to hold makeup.  I highly recommend using this if you have never had a primer before.  It will give you a great start, and it is gentle with your skin.  Can&#x27;t get much better for under $10.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product permits those of us with a...less than perfect complexion look a lot better.  When you find a beauty product that consistently delivers on its promises, you come back to it.  The convenience of being able to get it on Amazon makes it a win-win!!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without this. It makes my face look clearer, keeps my makeup on the whole day and you don&#x27;t use much. Well worth the money, an essential for your make up routine.</li>
            <li> Love this goes great between my moisturizer and sunscreen . It instantly covers up any dark circles or veins that are visible under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This base works well but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the container. My nails get a little longer so it gets hard to scoop this out. My makeup sponges also can&#x27;t fit into the thin top well. I wish this was wider and flatter... The product itself its great, though. Love the texture. Very creamy but goes on feeling like nothing!</li>
            <li> I love that it fills the &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; on my face without feeling heavy and helps makeup last longer.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Face felt very soft</li>
            <li> This helps even out my skin tone a bit and does a great job of making my makeup last all day. You only need a small amount so even with daily use one container lasted me several months. I have tried a more expensive primer by Smashbox and this product worked just as well for me.</li>
            <li> I must be beyond help.....it made no difference when used, as far as covering up darker color under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I like L&#x27;OREAL products in general, but this one did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I do not know the magic is .</li>
            <li> I discovered primer about a year or so ago.  I now won&#x27;t put on make up without using a primer.  Why a primer?  Your make up will go on smoother, and stay on longer.  I leave the house around 7 am, and get back home around 8 or 9 pm.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to touch up make up, or even to re-apply later in the day.  I live in a hot and humid climate.  I highly recommend this primer.  I have used Smashbox&#x27;s, which I love but it costs about 3 times as much.  I thought for the price point this primer was wonderful, my make up didn&#x27;t slide off my face, and it held true all day.  I would highly recommend checking out this primer!</li>
            <li> I bought the L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets Face Primer when it was on sale and I had a coupon, so I paid about $8 for the o.5 ounce product.  For the last several months, I have been using Avon&#x27;s Magix primer with good results, but I thought I would try the L&#x27;Oreal primer since I have used L&#x27;Oreal foundation for years.  I have oily skin and I am looking for something which will help prevent my makeup from \\&quot;melting off\\&quot; by mid-day.  I tried it today for the very first time.  Right after application, my skin looked much smoother and my pores appeared smaller.  However, after a few hours, I had \\&quot;the shine\\&quot;.  I will continue to use the primer, but so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the Avon Magix primer, which costs around $8 for 1.0 ounce and also has the benefit of SPF of 20.</li>
            <li> This base doesn&#x27;t correct flaws like it says it does.  And it can make your face break out if you have sensitive and/or acne prone skin.  Also, if you use this you must put powder over your makeup or else you could end up looking slimey.  This was way too expensive for the amount of product and the brand.</li>
            <li> Too pasty, not smoothe</li>
            <li> The BEST primer/pore hider/wrinkle filler I&#x27;ve found!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually had a little trial size of this in a magazine that I tried and after using it I went straight out and bought two of them (with a coupon). I LOVE this product and it lasts a very long time. You have to remember to use it sparingly. When it first goes on, especially in the summer and with oily skin, you will think it is just going to melt right off or flake off, but it instantly smooths. It make my make up stay exactly where I put it and with my oily skin it keeps the oily shine away for longer. It even looks good with powder foundation. BUT, remember to use sparingly, if you use too much it just makes your make up clump up.</li>
            <li> The best product to actually do what it says it will. I&#x27;m a fair-redhead and always have problems with freckles and pores and a weird combination T-zone thing happening. First I moisturize and then I dab my finger and just use a little where ever I need it. The results are magical and I can&#x27;t believe what a difference there is between before and after. Just make sure not to use too much and always moisturize before. Now I quite often skip foundation after and just use some concealer under eyes, add some mascara and I&#x27;m done. I don&#x27;t know how we lived without this stuff. I think it&#x27;s as revolutionary a product as what a flat iron could have done for the 80s. Huge impact!</li>
            <li> i notice no difference using this product then not using any product at all</li>
            <li> First off, let me just say this product does exactly what it says it does. It provides a smooth surface to your skin prior to applying any foundation. It literally glides on to the skin. I haven&#x27;t encountered any breakouts from this product being I have VERY sensitive skin. After reading a lot of reviews on this product, and hearing many people suffered breakouts from it worried me. I&#x27;m glad I finally did buy it because I&#x27;m satisfied. It does not change the color of your foundation or your concealer. Also, a little goes a long way being it is so creamy. The texture feels  wonderful on the skin. I find it an excellent base under concealers for anyone who constantly gets the creasing in fine lines. Every product works differently on different skin types. I&#x27;m still addicted to my smashbox primer and i still use it but again this is a base, not a primer! Their two completely different products. This base is suppose to provide a more smooth and flawless look whereas a primer is to help keep your makeup in tact longer. I hope this review helped and to anyone in doubt, just give it a try. I give it a 10!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and makes your skin look flawless before applying makeup....and that&#x27;s saying a lot for a 64-yr old.</li>
            <li> I love that this primer makes me look semi poreless which I love beacause I have large pores. Really good primer.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it would, I just thought it would be bigger, it&#x27;s smaller than a golf ball. I should have read the dimensions or ounces which is only 0.5 oz.</li>
            <li> This helps my makeup stay fresher looking longer.  I can tell the difference when I ran out, etc.  I really like that even by itself (without foundation), my skin looks better if I decide to go all natural.</li>
            <li> I was using this stuff off &amp; on until I realized that it was breaking me out. I actually do like it but HATE the fact that it breaks me out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin! I gave it two stars because I like it but makes me break out. Grr:(</li>
            <li> I love this perfecting base/primer for a couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) A little goes a long way so for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t wear make up every day, a jar lasts for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Having said that a jar will last more than a year, this product does not expire so, yeah, that&#x27;s the least of your worries.&lt;br /&gt;3.) It&#x27;s very easy to apply and requires only a minute to dry.&lt;br /&gt;4.) It erases my pores so well that my face looks dreamy after all the make up has been applied.&lt;br /&gt;5.) I love Loreal products!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product with amazing coverage.  Four stars only because it does not do well on damp areas or in high humidity situations.  However, if you arent in that predicament this is the BEST product I have ever used for the purpose of &#x27;concealing&#x27; blemishes that are existent.  It absolutely makes for a flawless look and lasts alllll day!</li>
            <li> I applied it mostly under my eyes and saw no change whatsoever. If anything, powder was more difficult to apply because the creases were more defined. Also, the product made my eyes swell up a little and water all day long like a slight allergic reaction. I am usually not sensitive around my eyes at all. Will give this to a friend to try, if she doesn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as it was highly recommended to me, unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. It did make my face feel soft and smooth, and It seemed to even the surface of my skin, but that&#x27;s about it. Something about this product made it very difficult to apply my foundation and concealer. It seemed like my concealer was just wiping away every time I applied it. I tried a brush, my fingers and even directly applying the concealer to my skin from the bottle but every time id go to blend it, the concealer just wiped away. My liquid foundation looked very streaky when I used it with this primer. I also found that in certain places, the foundation and the primer balled up together and made a flaky look, making my make up very noticeable when usually my foundation is very natural. It&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s just that the products (primarily covergirl) I use don&#x27;t work well with this primer but I really like my makeup and am not about to get different makeup just to use this primer. I would also say that this primer is pretty pricey for such a small bottle of &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; makeup. My guess is there are better products for the same price.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday under my foundation.  It feels thick and heavy right out of the package, but smooths over skin and becomes a light undercoat for my foundation.  It makes my 60ish, dry skin look and feel amazing.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work, to be honest. I have acne-prone, oily skin that also tends to flake. My pores aren&#x27;t very noticeable, but I do have light scars all over. I wanted to try a primer and this one gets great reviews everywhere. I got a free sample of Estee Lauder and also bought Reviva&#x27;s Primer. Most of my beauty products are Reviva. The EL and the Reviva just didn&#x27;t work for me. My skin actually looked worse (pores and lines magnified) and my makeup applied dry and smudgy. After I finally \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; my makeup, it still looked more obvious than usual. Also, my face was covered in oil before I even left my house 30 min after applying it with both of these.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Loreal base applied smoothly. I applied it after moisturizer, like the other two. It was light pink and very thick, but it wasn&#x27;t oily or greasy at all. The first time I used it, I put it on sparingly. Without makeup, my skin didn&#x27;t look much different, but my makeup applied perfectly AND I didn&#x27;t have to blot my face for the 4 hours I was out in the heat in a car with no a/c. The second time I applied it, I actually applied it twice just to see if I liked it better thicker. I was afraid it might ball up, but it didn&#x27;t and my makeup free skin actually looked a little better with two light coats. Again, my makeup applied wonderfully and I didn&#x27;t have much oil breakthrough. In fact, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to blot like I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing is that I got no breakouts whatsoever, and I am very prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I want to give the Reviva another chance....I at least want to use it up, but it really did an awful job compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;I could see this Base becoming a part of my regular makeup routine for years, and originally I went in thinking none of them would work and I&#x27;d end up forgetting primer for good.</li>
            <li> i was really looking forward to this primer for under my foundation but was disappointed after using it. Im in my early 20&#x27;s and i have little wrinkles but it settles into every little crease in your face and makes you look a lot older! it made my forehead look really wrinkly and it just didn&#x27;t work well AT ALL! i use it for an eye primer now and it isn&#x27;t bad but i got a sample of the hourglass primer ( EXPENSIVE) but it works SO much better!!!! i wouldn&#x27;t buy this again!</li>
            <li> Now, THIS is the STUFF!  Forget anything else out there ladies, this one will do the trick!  I am going to have to buy more soon, though, as it&#x27;s such a small bottle but it really does a wonder job on your face!  Love this stuff!  Just wish they would give me more for my money!</li>
            <li> Okay, I had never used a primer before. So I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the flaws (no pun intented) in the product:&lt;br /&gt;-small container&lt;br /&gt;-pricey&lt;br /&gt;-made ME break out&lt;br /&gt;-wasn&#x27;t smooth&lt;br /&gt;-was thick&lt;br /&gt;Although, it does work as far as keeping make up on. I will now use it on my eyelids for eyeshadow, because of the break outs.</li>
            <li> I Loooooove it.&lt;br /&gt;Reduces look of fine lines &amp; pores. It is creamy and smooths onto the skin efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was cheaper is the only reason for 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my gym bag &amp; it is AMAZING! Skin feels SOOOO SOFT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit slick and thick. The product made me feel oily and it felt like it was bad for my face. I didn&#x27;t notice any change on my makeup. I don&#x27;t know if it works for different skin types but it surely didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> A wonderful makeup base, goes on easily and really helps appearance of skin. Although very small container a tiny amount goes a long way... one of the best base products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> for the hard to spread consistency there is too little product. but it is good.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations of the product because it had seen a video. The product arrived in very good condition, shipping was fast and was exactly what I had imagined. Perfecting base is an excellent product, makes my skin so smooth and without blemish. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily  have sensitive skin.  If i use regular run of the mill soap on my face, i get an almost burning dry sensation when I get out of the shower, but I haven&#x27;t felt that in years since I was a teenager.  I keep hearing about \\&quot;use a primer\\&quot; \\&quot;use a primer\\&quot; in beauty articles, because after a few hours, the oils in my skin start to mix with my makeup, and on hot days... don&#x27;t get me started... After not much luck of finding one in every department store within a 100 miles, I finally found this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, I started with a clean face, put my regular moisturizer on (also put on lightly, since my skin isn&#x27;t real dry).  Then I dabbed ever so little of this stuff on all over my trouble zones, I did not put on on the edges of my face, I put it below my eyes, my T zone, around my nose and chin.  It took the shine away, and looked good.  Then I started to put on my under eye concealer and I started to feel it burn.  That dry soap burn I hadn&#x27;t felt since I was a teenager.  I decided to ignore it, maybe it would go away.  My concealer did not go on too well, I didn&#x27;t use as much as I normally do, the little wrinkles on my bottom eye lid made everything start to goup up along the wrinkle line.  Then I put on my foundation, again, not as much as I usually do, it was all very light, I also use two kinds, liquid and not so liquid (it&#x27;s like a cream? i don&#x27;t know what you call it).  Then I put on my powder.  By now my entire face was burning.  I looked in the mirror and it seemed like every single pore on my face had soaked up every ounce of foundation and powder.  It was a complete disaster.  My cheeks looked horrible as well, imagine putting makeup on an old zit or sore that has that dry flaky skin around it.  That&#x27;s what my entire face looked like!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 30 minutes since I washed my face off with Noxzema, and it&#x27;s still burns. I hope not all primers are like this.  I have no idea how this product has gotten so manystars. The product was not old, and was not hard or anything like the other bad reviews, it looked new, fresh and was not at all hard to put on, but the results were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever had sensitive burning skin with the wrong kind of soap or lotion, I&#x27;d avoid this particular product like the plague.</li>
            <li> Lol first of all I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny the bottle was.  But I figured maybe a little goes a long way, and it does for those who like it.  It does go on very smooth and immediately makes the skin feel nice and soft.  After it sets, the skin feels hydrated, smooth and a bit more even (it fills in wrinkles and pores).  But, after a couple of hours I noticed I was touching up my makeup with powder more often than usual.  My face was getting shiny throughout the day.  I think this would be good for someone with dry skin.  I usually keep things that are halfway decent because I could use them as backups, or give them to someone I know if they want it.  But since I paid a whopping $12.99 for this tiny jar at Target, I decided to return it.</li>
            <li> Was not all that impressed or even noticed a difference- was hoping it would keep my make up in place longer</li>
            <li> This is a great perfecting cream. With or without makeup. Love love love. It really work to minimize imperfections. I&#x27;m a women on color and this works very well. Great price.</li>
            <li> Works well i have acne and for the most part it covers it up with out irritating my skin and causing more acne i usually dont even use foundation when using this product</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! IT REMIND ME OF THE CLARINS INSTANT SMOOTH PRIMER JUST HALF THE PRICE. THIS IS GREAT FOR AFRICA AMERICAN/BLACK, MATURE, AND WOMEN WITH SKIN CONDITIONS. IT AUTOMATICALLY SMOOTHS YOUR SKIN AND ALLOWS YOUR MAKEUP TO LAST ALL DAY WITH MINIMAL POWDERING!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> Great. Love it and unscented for the chemically sensitive</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t lie when it says \\&quot;Magic\\&quot;... it really is! It provides a silky smooth surface, even concealing fine lines giving a soft lifting effect.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional make up artist and I use this product not only for me but also for my clients; results are absolutely stunning... it is incredible the way skin is transformed by this product! I love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a drug store brand worked this well. I use it just under the eye area and it&#x27;s like &#x27;spackle&#x27; it just smooths over any fine lines and they are almost invisible after application. There are light reflectors in it and it&#x27;s well done for a budget item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use a light touch because it is thick, but for mature skin it is the next best thing to botox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and let me know if this information was helpful by checking that box here.</li>
            <li> Nice satiny smooth finish, under make up or alone.  It does help foundation go on smoother.  I doesn&#x27;t help the foundation stay on like a primer though.  A small amount goes a long way, this is good as to the fact that not much comes in the container</li>
            <li> Only used it once. It came very quickly. It is a base so I used it under foundation. It is what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after watching a recommendation from AllThatGlitters21 on YouTube, and she is so right, this stuff is wonderful! I recently developed rosacea, and my formerly fair skin has changed so much I barely recognize myself in the mirror anymore.  Then a recent high def photo, taken by a dentist, and shown to me on a plasma TV had me running for the hills.  When did I get old?  I used this in conjunction with the Loreal&#x27; anti-redness primer.  I used the anti-redness primer over my chin, cheeks and chin which are now very ruddy, and then came in with this product under my eyes, and around my crowsfeet, and along the top of the cheekbone.  I love the way it feels, and then my foundation just went on flawlessly.  I looked in the mirror all day to keep checking on it (something I do not normally do) and it wore so well, at the end of the day I still looked like my old self!  I would put it everywhere if I could...getting old is not for sissies!</li>
            <li> First off...the product arrived very quick. It was wrapped in bubble wrap. Second, this was not a bad price at all. I checked the prices in stores and it was cheaper here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard so much about primer being the best thing since sliced bread. Maybe it is for some. For me, I rate it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried putting it on with no moisturizer. It did feel like silk on my face. It was so soft. There is no way I would walk out the house with just this on and no base or powder. No way. It wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;that\\&quot; great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second day I tried it with moisturizer. It still felt soft but a tad greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed about both days was this.....it was the after makeup. I usually use a eye pencil to line my eyes. It was almost impossible b/c my face was to slippery for it to go on....and too slippery for me to even pull my eye back a little to apply my eye makeup. Then when I put my base or powder on....it seemed like it would clump up a little. It actually seemed more noticeable. Then afterwards, my face felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did take some pictures with my face natural and some with just the primer on. My face does look smooth and soft in the pictures with the primer on...not as red and blotchy. For that reason, I do give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I had originally read about this base in a magazine, so I had absolutely no idea what to expect other than \\&quot;silky skin.\\&quot;  I am always very skeptical about foundations and face creams because I break out if the quality is not great.  This base is absolutely AMAZING.  You can wear it by itself or with makeup.  But in my opinion you wont need to wear it with anything else!  It is a very light texture, and truly makes the skin very soft.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and nice but doesn&#x27;t keep me matte for long.</li>
            <li> Felt super thick and chalky/cakey. I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> This primer feels wonderful, and provides an excellent base under concealers. It makes my pores appear smaller, my skin much smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes much less noticeable after application. HOWEVER, even though the company claims that it is non-comedogenic, when I use it to disguise the large pores on the sides of my nose, I always end up with a small whitehead or two, something that I NEVER get with any other product. I still use it, but only under my eyes, which is a big disappointment, since my main reason for purchasing it was to disguise large pores and keep down the shine on my nose.</li>
            <li> i love to use this as a base before applying foundation. It smoothes the skin by filling in fine lines or pores. It&#x27;s also great if you get greasy eyelids as the day goes on...keeps your eyeshadow in place. using this, you also end up needing to use less foundation.&lt;br /&gt;i started using it a couple years ago and it remains part of regime when i do my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is thick going on but melts into your face, giving it a smooth surface. Then even the cheapie foundations look a lot better on your skin. I like it just as much as the Smashbox primer and it is a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Great base, especially in the winter when you need a \\&quot;Full Face\\&quot;, no tan whatsoever and you need all the help you can get in the way of make up.  In the summer, it it sometimes all I need with a little blush and lipstick and I have a little tan.  I read over a number of the reviews and have come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s all a matter of personal skin.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product except.......I wish we had a choice for a larger container.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product was because I saw it on tv. When I purchased it I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be so wonderful! When ever I go to the store they&#x27;re always sold out so I was really glad when I found this on Amazon! It took only 3 days to get delived!! Im in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this base on my eyes only. It really helps my eye makeup stay put all day long. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face under my powder though simply because I worry about clogging my pores &amp; get a zit from it however I do love it on my eyes!! I put my foundation on, then use this base before I powder &amp; then I apply my eye makeup. I can leave it on all night &amp; I wake up and it&#x27;s still there!! If I sweat a whole lot then that&#x27;s pretty  much the only time it doesn&#x27;t keep it in place. I would definitely recommend this for eyes - can&#x27;t say about face though since I never tried it :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product , it goes on really well . I will purchase this again. I did think the jar would be bigger. I will probably go through it fast.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but consistently, shortly after applying it I felt nausea.  I asked on a website to review makeup and a number of women stated that they get reactions to Loreal&#x27;s products.  Beware if you are sensitive or have allergies.  I now own this Primer, an Eyeliner Pencil and Mascara that I can&#x27;t use due to nausea and irritation when I apply them.</li>
            <li> I love this Cream!! It conceals my pores and my wrinkles. I wear it alone everyday and hardly ever use face powder now. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a fussy person when it comes to makeup. I&#x27;ve never quite learned how to apply every thing correctly but this makes such a difference in how my makeup does look. It&#x27;s a little pricey for how small the jar is but I got it on sale and use just a small amount per application and for the difference it makes, it&#x27;s worth it. I feel like it evens out the makeup application and I need less of it using this product. I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer I have ever used.  It goes on smooth and leaves your complexion looking flawless.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Very light, spreads smoothly and a little amount covers a lot of area.  Whenever I apply this first I get a lot of compliments about how young I look.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works like this, the others are either too heavy or to thin.</li>
            <li> First time using primer and I am hooked.  Eye wrinkles look better.  Now I can push botox off for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> This product is not the best primer on the market.  It will ball up when applying if your&#x27;re not careful. Still searching for a product that will provide a better primer base for my makeup.</li>
            <li> You have to use just a little dab of this product at a time and then spread it as far as it will go or it will build up and leave white streaks on you face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at how well this worked for me as there are some mixed reviews. It made my skin very smooth looking and feeling. I like the matte finish, perfect for under make-up or alone. Pores and small lines were really minimized. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Other primers such as the Monistat one have broken me out or felt really oily on my skin, but this one is perfect. i definitely have combination/oily skin and have been looking for something to keep the oils in control because near the end of the day my face will be so shiny. This really did the trick and has given me an almost-poreless complexion and has kept the shine away. If you are a prime member I would order it on here, it is 10 bucks in stores if not more. Great purchase. It does come in a very small size though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Not giving it 5 starts only because of the size.</li>
            <li> best primer base fast shipping</li>
            <li> It truly works magic, suddenly it seems my face glowed after a slight cover! I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> a mess, not used but thrown away</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have any complaints. It feels nice going on and appears to immediately &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; the skin at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about this primer, but mine arrived in a box that looked beat up, and the product inside was dried up and rubbery.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination -- very oily in my T-zone and normal everywhere else. I rarely ever get a zit, maybe one in a blue moon, and I have never had a reaction to a product from makeup before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as I was going out later that night and wanted my makeup to last without having to constantly blot/re-powder my face. I didn&#x27;t find that this primer helped my makeup stay on longer whatsoever. It made my skin feel extremely velvety soft, but that&#x27;s about it. If anything, it made my skin become oily more quickly than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days after using this, I noticed that everywhere on my face that I had applied the product (around my nose, middle of my forehead, and chin), was extremely dry and flaky. I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal - perhaps the air from the past couple of days made my face dry? The next day, three days after using the product, I noticed a crop of red dots all over my forehead. The tip of my nose was red and scaly. My chin was unbearably dry. I knew it had to be the perfecting base, as every other makeup item I had used the same night as the primer were products I&#x27;ve been using for months, and have had no reaction to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to a week later. I now have SEVEN \\&quot;underground\\&quot; very painful zits... and ONLY where I had applied the L&#x27;Oreal base. I have no idea what is in this product that made my face freak out this badly, but boy, I am never using this again. I would rather all my foundation melt off than be left with the skin I have at the moment. It hurts to even touch my chin and right under my nose, where the breakout seems to be the worst. I&#x27;m sure this product works fine for some, but with my reaction, it makes me nervous to try a face primer ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/2012: If you have some extra money to spend, I&#x27;d recommend Lancome&#x27;s La Base Pro as a primer. I have been using a sample of it for the last few months and have had no reactions to it. La Base Pro also keeps my makeup lasting longer than a setting spray does, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheaper alternative would be the Black Radiance Shine Control primer which I have heard great things about - I plan on picking that up next to see how it performs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product one time, and I won&#x27;t be using it again. I have bad skin, but generally makeup covers my flaws. I felt like I had to pile on my makeup after using this product and it seemed like it decreased the coverage of my everyday use makeup. I was very disappointed. It did make my skin feel good and silky... but it made it LOOK terrible.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for reducing the size of my pores and creating a smooth surface before applying makeup. I literally get compliments on my makeup and complexion every time I apply this under my makeup. I just wish it came in a larger size because I tend to use it up fairly quickly. Hat&#x27;s off to Loreal!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your skin feel silky and smooth. My makeup stays on twice as long when I use this.  Comes in a small jar,  but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> LOREAL PERFECTING BASE MAKES MY MAKE UP GLIDE ON SMOOLY AND FLAWLESSLY. IT ALSO MAKES MY POORES DISAPEAR AND ADDS AN EXTRA LAYER OF LOCKED IN MOISTURE THAT KEEPS MY FACE LOOKING DEWEY ALL DAY AND NIGHT.I ALSO HAVE TO USE LESS FOUNDATION WHEN I USE IT BECAUSE IT IS SO HYDRARING WITH OUT BEING GREESY. IT MAKES MY SKIN LOOK LIKE I HAVE NO MAKE UP ON- IT SOME HOW DIFUSES FOUDATION BETTER, AND YOU ONLY USE A TINY, TINY BIT TO COVER YOUR ENTIRE FACE. I  LOVE IT !!!  CORDIALLY, MARIA</li>
            <li> This primer comes in a small glass pot containing a mere .5 ounce.  Yes, it&#x27;s quite a small amount for a product that retails in the $10-$12 range. However, a little bit goes a long way, and since it&#x27;s in a pot, it&#x27;s a little bit easier to control and not overuse compared to similar products that come in tubes. My one complaint to L&#x27;Oreal would be their overuse of cardboard packaging for such a small item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer is quite thick and not as light and creamy as it appears in print advertisements. It does have a light pink color, but this color dissipates upon application. I have pale skin with a bit of ruddiness in some parts, coupled with dark undereye circles. It doesn&#x27;t have any effect on these discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the pot and dipped my finger in, I was a bit shocked on the thick consistency. But what I discovered is that it glides on easily and really very little of the primer is needed. I get a small amount on my fingertip and it easily covers my whole face, including my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels super smooth and silky after application. If you&#x27;ve never used a primer before, it may feel a little weird to the touch, as it almost feels slippery (although not greasy). That feeling is thanks to silicone (dimethicone) in the primer. I notice that small lines are indeed less apparent, although I don&#x27;t feel that the primer didn&#x27;t really makes the large pores on my nose less visible. However, makeup goes on a whole lot easier, and I actually use less of my cream foundation. Additionally, my foundation now does a better job of covering up imperfections and discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel that my makeup lasts a bit longer, especially with eye shadow. Before my eye shadow would disappear before lunchtime and now it lasts 3-4 hours longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality primer, comparable to department store brands or those you would find in stores such as Sephora.  I do wish it would come in a larger pot, and was priced a little bit more affordably. But overall, it&#x27;s a great product and I think it&#x27;s a good choice for anyone who wears foundation or eye shadow, as it really does improve wear and make the application process a whole lot easier.great product and I think it&#x27;s a good choice for anyone who wears foundation or eye shadow, as it really does improve wear and make the application process a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> I was using the Bare Minerals primer, but did not want to pay the higher price. This primer works really really well, and it does not have the silicone lubricant feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I never had problems with large pore before, after using this product my pores were extremely noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;I probably bought this product when it first coma out, a year or so ago, since then I have to deal with very large pores....I don&#x27;t recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty big pores on my inner cheeks and on my nose.  Because I have a bit of rosacea, I&#x27;ve started to use foundation on my cheeks and a bit on my nose but the foundation tends to get sucked into the pores.  Looks awful.  I tried this hoping it would keep the foundation from getting into the pores.  It didn&#x27;t help at all.  I&#x27;d say lotion helps more.</li>
            <li> This made my makeup look great, but after using it a few days in a row, made me break out. I have acne prone, oily skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a makeup base before. I found this to be much thicker than I expected... Almost wax like. I decided to give it a try anyway and blended a small amount on my face as directed. I used a good quality make up brush which was clogged up and very difficult to clean afterwards. I then applied my make up  and it did stay all day even in our Palm Springs, CA heat. What wasn&#x27;t good was the skin break-out I had several days later. I am not prone to acne, I am in my late 40&#x27;s and the &amp;#34;zit years&amp;#34; are long behind me. I may have a small blemish or two during the month, but this break out was epic! Multiple large, deep pimples that took several weeks to clear up. I didn&#x27;t use again for several weeks. The next time I used even more sparingly and just in the T-zone area where my makeup tends to &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; in the heat. Sure enough, over the next several days I got several more deep, painful pimples. Coincidence? I don&#x27;t care to find out... I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> this product is gummy and hard to use. It does not go on as well as a liquid and just sits on the surface of the skin. I will never purchase this again</li>
            <li> great product and better price from other primers. just make sure to smooth  in completely before applying make. Best used with mineral foundations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive base products from department stores, but none for me is as good as L&#x27;Oreal. Normally I&#x27;d get this at a drugstore, but my local drugstore is notorious for having old, expired products on their shelves. So I ordered from Amazon, and it arrived fresh and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> So I personally love this primer it&#x27;s one of my favorites but I&#x27;m only giving this two stars because I received mine it was not only open but USED! There were even makeup fingerprints on the container! I obviously returned this item and demanded a refund.</li>
            <li> One of the best primer I am using right now. Minimize pores, improve skin texture, create great CANVAS for smooth long lasting makeup. And it makes much more easier to remove makeup. After 3 times use, immediately changed to 1 month subscribe.</li>
            <li> This primer is probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever used and now understand why it&#x27;s a drugstore primer. It&#x27;s definitely not high end or even mediocre. The primer is cakey and a sticky mess. Does not apply evenly or smoothly. It does matte your skin in preparation for foundation but is not an overall good product. Would not recommend and will not purchase again. In fact, I threw it away after about 5 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 now and started using this on the occasional night out.  I don&#x27;t do a lot of make up and often I just use this and no foundation.  It makes my skin soft and smooth and really does take away the look of minimal wrinkles.  A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to use a ton and can make it last.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I have ever tried, so there might be better ones out there, but for the price, I love this stuff!  It makes my fine lines look smoother and my face looks healthier.  My foundation goes on so much better!  Oh, and my pores look a lot smaller!  Definately worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> This is the best base I have come across to date. It closes my pores, gives my skin a smooth matte finish, even hides blackheads! Will keep buying always!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all...... Too thick, does not apply smoothly and does not prime the skin...  Do not recomend ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and it&#x27;s my secret make up weapon. It&#x27;s tempting to use it all over your face as it gives a completely airbrushed effect. Use it on pores to make them disappear, blur fine lines and crepey areas, great as a smooth highlight on your chin, remove lip creases, lessen nasolabial or glabela lines, . Just be careful not to go crazy and use everywhere as that can give a slightly washed out look. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have naturally oily skin so I usually walk around shining all day. Then when I put on sun screen you could probably fry an egg on my face. Over the years I would try different foundations and makeups to try to tame the shine but they never really blended well with my skin tone. They would clog my pores and I would start to get acne, or when I would sweat it would start streaking, so I  just gave up on most makeup all together. Then this stuff was invented. I am in love with this product. Not only does it control my shine, but it minimizes my pores and fine lines and wrinkles. I apply it alone over my sunscreen with absolutely nothing else. I get told so much how beautiful my skin is and how lucky I am. The whole time I&#x27;m thinking to myself I&#x27;m just lucky to have found this product. I sleep in it. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I don&#x27;t have one thing bad to say. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Use it after moisturizing and before putting on foundation. You do not need to use a lot to cover your face, and it really does feel great! My face felt smooth after putting it on, so soft. I was surprised! And it does make your makeup go on a bit easier. I did notice it helped cover up pores, but they don&#x27;t necessarily vanish if you&#x27;ve got larger ones like myself. Still, it made a vast improvement. After all day wearing, I still have some shine to my face, but that&#x27;s pretty normal with the kind of foundation I use and the skin type I have. I also have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t burn or anything to put on. Also it has no smell from what I noticed.</li>
            <li> The container is such a rip off for what you get. It&#x27;s tick but goes on the skin smooth. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> But for nine dollars, I surmise I was incorrect to expect more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will work for those who don&#x27;t require a plethora of effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite products.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to go wrong with it. It creates the illusion of a perfect, even skin tone, and it makes your make up look 10x better.&lt;br /&gt;The people who write bad reviews on this product are clearly the ones who over-use.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a little. Duh</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product but Didn&#x27;t really notice anything change When I used the product under my fiundation and when I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This really does cover large pores. Must reapply after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and, while this looks great when you put it on, the shine still  comes through in a few hours. Having said that, I would still say that it is better than most of this type of product.</li>
            <li> This is one produce that does exactly what it should--I can&#x27;t praise it enough.  I am almost 70--with this product, which seems invisible when on--I don&#x27;t have to wear any foundation. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> When I ordered the perfecting base I expected a creamy base. The base I received was like clay. When you tried to apply it, it was thick and broke into pieces, like it was outdated. I couldn&#x27;t send it back, because I don&#x27;t have the box that it came in. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> its such a creamy texture ! easy to apply and it works wonders! i love it. I work with kids for half of the day once i get home my face still looks nice and smooth every time i use L&#x27;oreals paris studio secret base! trust me all you need is a small amount ! and yuala! a little goes a long way! super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> this was honestly just a waste of money, my face still ends up oily after minutes of application. dont buy. bleh</li>
            <li> A 3 season item, not for summer as too heavy.  Otherwise fine but would rather know that up front.  3 star for fall, winter, spring; 0 stars for summer.</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon whenever I go to special gatherings. This is a notch higher than the makeup I use everyday.</li>
            <li> It feels on the skin like a plaster mask. I tried using it once, and it was horrible. Never before I had a make op product that was SO bad.</li>
            <li> One of the best inexpensive primers I have ever used</li>
            <li> I broke out after just one use of this product. It looks good while on the face and my make up looks air brushed but when I took it off at the end of the day I had SO MANY PIMPLES!!!!! Its was awful. I wanted to cry!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... leaves residue on your face. I wouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I usually love this stuff it&#x27;s my favorite primer,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this base. It keeps my face really smooth for a long time. No make up is needed after putting this on!</li>
            <li> Perfecting Base is right!  This product is now a staple in my bag of makeup tricks and skin care.  Watch the video that is on the product site and you will see how to apply it.  Very little goes a lonnnnnng way.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. When products claim they have a noticeable difference, rarely is it all that noticeable. This is ! I use it around my eyes. Firms &amp; brightens.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer. It really does blur out your imperfections, it&#x27;s not going to make them disappear. But I guess the best way to describe it is that it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re editing a picture and you use the smoothing effect on your skin.. But in real life. I&#x27;m also very oily. So it mattifies my skin well. At the end of the day I&#x27;m not completely matte, but I am dewy. Not oily, dewy.</li>
            <li> this product is good, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But I wish the product was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> This really does smooth out your skin before applying make-up.  Is it a magic bullet for wrinkles or large pores?  No, but I am definitely seeing marginal improvement in the appearance of my skin.  I have never worn it alone, I use it under my foundation along with a wrinkle filler, but it says you can use it alone.  FYI, I do not have wrinkles but have large pores and acne scarring that I &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; with these products.  Overall, I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Made my makeup go on easier but didn&#x27;t notice that it made my makeup last any longer then if I didn&#x27;t use a base.&lt;br /&gt;It also made my break out. Would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty product!  I have been using it for a couple of months now. Before using this product I would occassionally have to blot my face to keep the shine away.  When I wear this I never have to blot my face and after working a 13-14 hour shift and my make up looks like I just put it on.  I don&#x27;t need as much foundation and sometimes I don&#x27;t put any foundation on at all and my skin looks beautiful. I was trying to hide it from my teenage daughter but she has discovered it and loves it as well.  I do agree it is difficult to get it out of the jar without getting it under your fingernails.  I saved a small plastic spatula that is used for tasting samples and it is perfect to get the primer out of the container.  I have been using this and oil of olay products the last couple of months and at 43 years old, my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it came out, and I love it. It hides your pours and makes your face look very smooth, it even softens wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try a face primer because my face is super sensitive but this primer is absolutely the best. It is true what they say &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;! So I only need a small amount, it goes on wonderfully and has a very smooth feeling after you apply it. It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel wet or like you have anything on and I can apply my foundation just as I normally do. I mainly purchased the primer because I needed help to keep my T zone from having that oily skin look and the primer works great. I do not have to reach for my powder or touch up my make up as much as I used to and I&#x27;m not constantly worried if I am shinny!  I absolutely love this product and I will never use any other primer after finding this one!! Thank you L&#x27;Oreal and keep making this primer!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and really like it.  I use it before putting on foundation and it evens out my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for about 2 weeks.  This is a very nice product.  It goes on nicely, it feels like silk and it helps your makeup stay in place, but I noticed that if you rub it too much when applying, the product begins to bead up and it looks like your skin is peeling off.  So, when I apply my foundation I am wiping off the \\&quot;beads or peeling skin\\&quot; periodically.  It is not a lot, but it is a little annoying and I&#x27;m a little self conscious throughout my day because I work in customer service.</li>
            <li> Loved the product SO much. It does everything it says it will do and more. My skin has never looked so smooth after I put on. You could easily go without a foundation after application of this stuff. L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets is a product every woman should own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shisedo&#x27;s primer which is about 3x the price of this primer.  With that being said, I needed to look for something more afforable.  This product is thicker and sticker than the Shisedo brand.  However, it does just as good if not better job.  My makeup lasts all day and my skin looks great.  I have combination skin and live in Hawaii, one of the mose humid palces on Earth especially in the summer.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the jar it comes in.  I think they need to come up with a better dispenser.  I used a makeup sponge to apply this primer, and it works much better than using my fingers.  I will definitely be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This primer worked perfect with my skin! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is a very oily and greasy product. My makeup slid right off and my skin was so incredibly oily that I had to not only wash my face to get it off but also put on a mask to absorb the excess oil even after I scrubbed my face. How is this good for acne prone or sensitive skin? Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I use it under MAC liquid foundation and it prolongs its wear. When used under powder foundation (Tarte) it lessens shine. Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look good when I opened it. Had a piece of hair in it &amp; just looked old.</li>
            <li> I very much like this. Just put it on one side of your face and don&#x27;t do the other and you&#x27;ll see the difference. It just smoothes everything out so nicely, that often, I&#x27;ll just wear this with a quick powder to run out for errands. And it is perfect as a base upon which to apply your foundation for a flawless looking skin.  Your face will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.. which is much preferred to an average person&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> the cream was not fresh,  but usable. so i kept it. and it was so hard to order it, i waited till my order was more than $25 and i was able to order this product, otherwise needed to pay too much for shipping</li>
            <li> What a great find for a drugstore brand primer! This primer turns my face into a smooth, poreless, canvas for my makeup. Although I did not expect it to work miracles on some of the fine lines I&#x27;ve developed by my nose and eyes, my makeup looks airbrushed and vibrant. My foundation/bronzer/blush/highlighter stay on my face until the end of my work day and it allows for seamless blending of my blush, highlighter, and bronzer. Also as a side note, buy this from Amazon! I was in a rush to buy a new primer when I ran out of my old stuff so I ran to Walmart and they sell this bad boy for $10.95.... possibly even more if you&#x27;re picking up at another retailer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To provide a little background, I am in my mid 20s, have oily asian skin which has also resulted into enlarged pores on my cheeks by my nose. In the winter timer, I have combination skin, oily t-zone areas but dry cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face, I apply a gel moisturizer. Once my moisturizer is completely dry (as stated on the primer&#x27;s instructions), I&#x27;ll dip my clean ring finger into the primer jar and dab small amounts of this primer around my face. As a helpful tip, I&#x27;ve learned at the MAC cosmetics counter that the ring finger is best for application as it applies the lightest pressure when using it. Please keep in mind this is a thick, creamy primer and not a moisturizer. There are certain primers that seem to absorb into your skin and other kinds that create a smooth canvas layer above your skin... The primer WILL ball up into small lumps if you either use too much product or over rub it into your skin. The primer should work as a light layer/base in between your face and makeup. As a rule of thumb with makeup application, always work with small areas at a time. Do not dab the primer all over your face and then rub it in. Work in small areas making sure the product is not drying too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the primer has been applied, I will focus on my eye makeup, allowing the primer to dry for a few minutes before applying my liquid MAC foundation. The results are simply stunning... completely poreless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the following:&lt;br /&gt;- For some reason I have trouble with this primer in one of my tzone areas between my eyebrows. The primer tends to look a big flaky in this area after trying multiple methods to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;- The primer claims to be a mattifying primer. It somewhat is, but I have found other mattifying primers in the market that work much better. I apply my makeup at 7:30AM and by 1PM I will still need to do a little blotting in my tzone area although my pores still look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;- The jar is not the most convenient and sanitary form to retrieve product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested... here is my comparison to other primers I have tried on the market (based on personal experience and skin type):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Benefit POREfessional: Concealed my pores but barely mattifying. My skin was one big greaseball by the end of the day. Did not do much for my fine lines. Wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;- Dr. Brandt Pores No More: Light weight primer that provided amazing mattifying results but did not conceal my pores as well as the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Perfecting Base. It&#x27;s slightly scented, which seemed to bother some reviewers but I didn&#x27;t mind it. Price was too high for me to be using the primer on a daily basis. I also had issues in my nose tzone area with this primer - it would cause a dry flaky patch.&lt;br /&gt;- Smashbox Photofinish Primer: One of my go to primers, a little goes a long way. IMO, it provides the same effect of the Magic Perfecting Base - a smooth silky base for my foundation. This primer doesn&#x27;t make my pores go away completely but it does an amazing job filling in my fine lines. Not completely mattifying but doesn&#x27;t make me into a greaseball either.&lt;br /&gt;- Too Faced Primed and Poreless: A nice lightweight primer that conceals my pores and slightly mattifying. A bit cheaper than Dr.Brandt and creates a nice base for my foundation. Also one of my go to primers.&lt;br /&gt;- Estee Lauder Mattifying Primer: One of my all time favorite primers for summer time when my makeup tends to melt off my face. It doesn&#x27;t conceal all of my pores and fine lines, but does an amazing job keeping that oil at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I would absolutely recommend this primer! For those of you with oily skin with large pores, give it a shot! For the Amazon price, it is absolutely worth a try! After spending hundreds of dollars on different primers, this will definitely be my new daily primer. Just keep in mind you will need to consider your skin type, moisturizer, foundation+all over face products prior to making a decision on which primer is right for you. I have not tried this primer with powder foundation, BB cream, tinted moisturizer, etc so I cannot say the finish is just as amazing. 4 Stars for this amazing product :)</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin, instead it makes it feel really smooth. The makeup just sits on top and stay put so it doesn&#x27;t just settle in my pores or lines. Really great makeup for a good price. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m applying this wrong, but when I put it on it smears and flakes off. It is a mess. Would not order again</li>
            <li> This base makes a nice smooth flawless looking base for makeup.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love how silky and smooth my face feels when I apply this base.  I don&#x27;t use it daily, prefer to go easy on my skin unless it&#x27;s a special occasion.  I&#x27;ve bought this at the drug store before, Amazon had it at a great price though, would buy here again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing the commercials and its low price.  Its consistency is very thick and at first it is tough to gauge how much will be necessary. It only seemed to help two of the times I used it.  It is also very sticky. The product did not serve its purpose as a primer at all beyond those two times, all it did was leave a film over my skin. I broke out because of it.   It may help to add that I have a healthy, relatively good-looking complexion.  I have some dark/red spots but not more than you would expect on someone who is only 20 and has had mild acne.    I recommend the primer that Rimmel sells, if you&#x27;re looking for something that works well and is inexpensive.    I used that for months until I ran out and plan to buy it again. My skin is normal to dry, in case that helps in your decision whether to buy L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I had been using DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat and thought I would try to find something a little cheaper. It just doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cover the fine lines like DHC&#x27;s product.  I&#x27;m going back to DHC, which you can get on Amazon, even though it $21 a tube.  It lasts a long time, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Makes my face look like porcelain perfection.</li>
            <li> Bad goods, is produced in 2012.After I use my face feel uncomfortable, I won&#x27;t buy.I don&#x27;t think I will use.</li>
            <li> Great for concealing acne scars. Doesn&#x27;t get rid of them but does tone then down.</li>
            <li> Excellent primer for my 50+ year old skin. I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy products on my skin so this works perfectly to fill the large pores so that my tinted moisturizer doesn&#x27;t fill in and harden. Also great to wear alone.</li>
            <li> I give 2 stars only becouse the color.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt gave more becouse few reasons&lt;br /&gt;1. The base  box is only 2/3 full&lt;br /&gt;2. The base become white on the face after  hot temperatur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In countries that hot  its impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really sorry  for my english  and the base was a gift for my mother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good primer for years as I don&#x27;t want concealer to get into my fine lines and I also want it to stay put for the day. I bought this and find the pot annoying (I don&#x27;t want to dip my fingers in it, I also don&#x27;t want to buy a brush just for primer). Second, it is so slippery that I couldn&#x27;t get the makeup to stick to it very well.  I think if you&#x27;ve never used a primer, you&#x27;ll think this is great. If you&#x27;re used to primers, this isn&#x27;t very good. It balls up as well.  If you&#x27;re looking for a very good, cheap primer I suggest Rimmel&#x27;s for about 6 bucks.  For the higher end, try Scindinavia.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look flawless under my makeup just as advertised. It is a small jar but you don&#x27;t need much of the product, so the jar should last you at least a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this primer and it&#x27;s my first time using it and i like the feel it has on my face. I need to play around with it some more though. Be back with a complete review.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Fills in my big pores and the creases around my lips. At 67 makeup looks like &#x27;makeup&#x27; on my skin. When I use this with moisteriser  under and a little mineral veil over my skin looks nice without looking like I am &#x27;madeup.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is supposed to work, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for me, under makeup or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use this under a light foundation or powder for a very smooth finish. My friends think I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done every time I use it. It&#x27;s light, and smooths out the lines. I like the balmy way it feels on the outside corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I had never used a primer before, so I didn&#x27;t really understand the difference it makes, but after reading about them I figured I&#x27;d try it. It was love at first application. First of all, all you need is a *tiny* dab (a little goes a LONG way!), and a small amount easily spreads over your whole face. It&#x27;s white in the tub but comes out completely transparent on my face. The consistency of this is the best part; it feels like rubbing pure silky goodness into your face. And it makes my makeup last all day long without having to reapply. I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff. The only complaint I have is the price for such a teeny little container. But since you don&#x27;t need much in a single application, one of these has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of L&#x27;loreal products and find you really get a quality product at drug store prices. I am so happy to write a review of L&#x27;loreal Magic Perfecting base. I love this product because shockingly it does exactly what it claims to do.  It really fills in your pores and makes your face look and feel so smooth.  your makeup will even go on more smoothly and evenly.  I am 64 and have some soft lines around my lips.  I have actually used this on and around my lips and it&#x27;s amazing how much it softens the lines ON my lips too...I use a lip pencil as lipstick usually with a gloss and it goes on so much more easily.  it&#x27;s in a very small jar but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it should last a few months.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday so I&#x27;m not sure how fast you&#x27;d go through it if you did.  I would say that even if you don&#x27;t have pores or soft lines to soften, you&#x27;d love this product on your face for how it feels and for how smooth your makeup will go on and look.  great product.</li>
            <li> This product has got me hook, line and sinker.  Excellent, love it.  Leaves my face practically flawless ( well in my eyes). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying different makeup primers and this is by far my favorite. It beats the expensive name brand hot shots out there. my makeup stays on a lot longer then it use to, it makes my skin feel SO smooth and it spreads easily, a lot goes a long way. this works perfect for the nights out. i will absolutely be buying this again</li>
            <li> My skin is supper sensitive. I also have huge pores and oily skin. So, I have been searching for something that can help me with these issues. I have used primers that cost as little as $5.00 to ones that were over $70.00. I must say that this is the best one I have ever found. It gives me flawless skin. It hides my pores and gives me an amazing base for my foundation. I can&#x27;t live without this product. That&#x27;s why I have 5 jars right now. I can&#x27;t risk running out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily, african-american skin. I love this product. It allows makeup (liquid, MAC) to go on smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t migrate and cause creases. This is only the 2nd base I have ever used but I like the way it works.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on reviews and the price.  I had tried a couple other and this is the best product and the best price.  It really makes my make-up look smooth and helps the make up stay on all day.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Frankly, I wasn&#x27;t so sure I was for the whole primer thing in general. After trying a few other brands that were way more expensive, I gave L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Magic Perfecting Base a try. I am now totally addicted. It really helps to smooth out large pores and tiny red lines. I use it even when I don&#x27;t wear foundation. I have sensitive skin and there are no problems with breakouts or redness. Nice to find a drug store product that works so well!</li>
            <li> as for this product it really does smooth the skin and the make up stays longer much longer, but it doesn&#x27;t minimize the look of the pores at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time and what expected</li>
            <li> Love this product. Helps reduce shine and gives you a great base for foundation or powder. Helps make blemishes look less red too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the magic perfecting base for about a year. I had read about it on a blog and thought I would give it a shot. I don&#x27;t put my makeup on without using this first, it really makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Lasts about 4-5 hrs on a reg day. a humid day 3</li>
            <li> I received this on New Years Eve. I decided to use it to set my make-up. It was velvety smooth and kept my make-up from creasing and my t-zone from getting oily. It worked for more than 9 hours. It does it&#x27;s job and keeps a matte face for hours. Love it!!!  My new Fav and cheaper than tarte,urban decay or it cosmetics. You have to try it. I didn&#x27;t break out and it doesn&#x27;t have harsh scents UPDATE:EVERY TIME I USE THIS I RUB A TINY AMOUNT AND IT ALWAYS CHAFS AND Flakes.. SUCKS!!! It DOES NOT allow make-up to go on smoothly without build up.  I will stick to urban decay spray primer and eyelid primer even if it does cost $30 for face primer and$13-$20 for eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> I have been using samples of DHC&#x27;s velvet skin coat (which I ADORE) and I was hoping that this would be comparable. It&#x27;s not. This stuff is grainy, pasty and not-very-nice. I will probably use it because I bought it, but I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you try to save some money... :(</li>
            <li> I have never used primer before but thought I should give it a try, it works great. It goes on so smooth and you can tell a difference. Even when I forget to take my makeup off, it does not break out my skin which is very surprising. It also seems to have helped with the oiliness of my skin. This is a great buy, just wish you could buy it in a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> The containers were worn down&amp;the primer inside didn&#x27;t resemble the original L&#x27;Oreal primer at all! Huge disappointment: 50$ down the drain...literally! Never again with this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different brands of makeup primers, skin perfectors or whatever you choose to call them. They all work basically the same. But this one stands above the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no L&#x27;Oreal brand loyalty. My loyalties are usually with Clinique or Philosophy so I was quite surprised at how much I like this product. And it&#x27;s more than just a primer. It creates a beautiful surface and even seems to improve skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not for everyone. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s sort of a middle-aged person product. And as much as I hate to admit it, I probably fit that category. But it does seem to make pores appear smaller, even out color and skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know skin products come and go, but if this one is ever discontinued I hope I get advanced notice so I can stock up.</li>
            <li> this is the first primer/base that i have totally fallen in love with! i had heard so much about smashbox&#x27;s photo finish that i was going to order it. before i got a chance to do so, i saw this while in wal-mart. i had tried so many, i figured i&#x27;d give this a go as well. for $10 i figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love the texture of this product. it glides on the skin and a little goes a long way. i don&#x27;t have to use as much tinted moisturizer. they normally recommend that you moisturize before applying a primer, but i don&#x27;t. i find that my makeup still stays on through out the day. when i wash my face before bed i see all of the evidence on my white wash cloth!&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint about this product, and why i gave it 4 stars, is that the jar is so tiny and it can be kinda awkward to get out. i wish that it came in a pump instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back after hearing about how wonderful primer can be for your makeup routine.  For your information I am 28, not a lot of sun damage with fair skin.  I usually have moderately dry skin, but my t-zone can be oily at times.  I have not changed my skin care routine which is wash and moisture prior to use. Right after application my skin looks pretty good, a nice glow etc.  However, after around three hours there are blotches of makeup where the dots of primer were applied (it is not the makeup as it does not do this sans primer).  I absolutely smooth this product over my face, but the consistency can be thick and gummy which makes it difficult to smooth over an entire area.  At times it feels like I have to pull at my skin to smooth it over, which I will not continue to do because of the potential damage.  I feel like if this primer was thinned out and easier to smooth over an area it could work better.  The container of primer is very small and if you were to use large quantities rather than dot it on your face you would have to end up buying it at least bi-weekly.  I work in a temperature controlled environment and do not have much to comment on as far as withstanding heat, etc.  Also, the color is pinkish which could impact the way it looks on varying skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased Arbonne primer and, wow, what a difference.  Easy to apply, clear and utterly smooth.  Much more product for the money as well.  I didn&#x27;t buy it on this website but found it half price on an auction site.  For my skin, application and quality I would look into a different product such as Arbonne.  As a primer newbie I feel pretty lucky to have found this second product with much higher quality and ease of application.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth. Feels very light weight. I only apply once and I am okay. Does make your skin feel velvety.</li>
            <li> I like how this stuff makes my skin feel. Applies smoothly and my makeup applies nicely over top. Mix a little bit with my foundation and it blends greatly on my skin. I recommend! I have Discoid Lupus and I swear that my skin has actually improved a little since using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin, love it so much, in fact this is the only product she use before she goes to work.</li>
            <li> very small!! I was expecting a bigger one. Overall seems a good product!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  It goes on so smoothly and even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase... regularly used daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now. I originally picked it up during the winter when my face was dry and flaky. I used it for several months and then stopped using it in early summer. When I noticed my skin started feeling dry again, I pulled this product back out. This product works great for smoothing out my skin and creating a good base for me to work from. The formula itself is creamy and very lightweight. It dissolves right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of a five was because it was a little pricy for what you get and since you have to stick you fingers into the jar to get the product out, I always seem to get the stuff under my nails and it just seems wasteful to me. I wish they would come out with a pump form of this. Other than that, this is a great drug store primer.</li>
            <li> LIke product.  Face feels smooth and make-up goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> I actually found this at Dollar tree for $1. I got one to try out. I wish I would have bought every single one before they were gone because I LOVE this stuff. I put it on before makeup and it INSTANTLY smooths my skin. I have never broke out from it or had any problems with it. Other than it&#x27;s a very tiny container so there just isn&#x27;t enough!! I would get this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is kind of a smoother before applying a makeup base.  Very interesting and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> good!Only need a little bit of pores and fine lines of sight</li>
            <li> This is thick and smooth, filling in pores and making my skin softer before applying make up. This is the only product I have tried (and there have been many) that truly does a good job at minimizing the appearance of my large pores. My only complaint is that it can leave a small area of white residue that I need to rub off before applying makeup. I dab it on the large pores on my nose, rub it in and then apply it to the rest of my face with a lighter application. After putting on Bare Minerals, my face looks flawless!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to a year and I like it very much. I even use it when I use no makeup, after the mosturizer, to help w the apperance of the skin. Very good value.</li>
            <li> This is a great make up primer. Helps my makeup stay on longer and and last even in humid heat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just to try it out since I know it is small. While it is a bit expensive it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. When applying it makes your face feel greasy but then after a few minutes it goes away. I don&#x27;t think this product is meant for naturally greasy skin which is why some have not had the best of luck with it. I love it and when I run out I plan on buying a larger size. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and reside in south florida.  I apply after moisturizing my skin then apply my makeup. Makes my makeup last longer without having to re-apply and worry about my face looking oily 2hrs after makeup. Sometimes apply lightly by itself with no make up just to absorb the oil on my face for days i wanna go make-up less.. a must have for me.  You cant beat the price! Better than smashbox&#x27;s primer in my opinion..</li>
            <li> I am 47, and I love what this product does to my skin! I have never liked wearing foundation for several reasons: I don&#x27;t like how it feels or the overly fake \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look of foundation, the way it rubs off or melts off on clothes, etc. I have never understood why I would want to cover up the natural pinkness in my skin, then add fake color with blush. I especially dislike foundation on older women because it ages us even more, with the way it settles into fine lines. So, while I love eye makeup and lip color, I have simply used moisturizer on my face. However, now that my face is aging, I have been looking for a product to help lock in the moisturizer to keep the elasticity in my face, smooth/improve the surface/texture of my skin, and minimize fine lines. I really had no idea that there even was such a product, but I was hunting for one. I thought I would be disappointed that the advertized benefits would not meet expectations, but I was shocked that this product does exactly as promised -- exceedingly well. My skin feels immediately gloriously smooth. There is a visible difference. Imperfections, such as fine lines and visible pores are minimized or even disappear. The substance fills in the lines and pores, smoothing out the surface of my skin, and remains this way for the entire day and evening. It&#x27;s truly amazing. I don&#x27;t need foundation. Applying this base over moisturizer gives my skin a stunning appearance, and allows my natural pink cheeks to show through. I dab a small spot of lip color on my cheeks. With the moisturizer and base, I can easily blend the small amount of color, and not hide the natural color or skin. I use the base all over my face and eye lids for smooth application of cream eye shadow (natural pallette). I am on my second jar. Like another reviewer, I would also welcome a larger jar!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the great reviews but I tried it 3 times just to be sure that I see absolutely no difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. While I&#x27;m not a huge fan of supporting Loreal or their unethical treatments/chemicals, sometimes duty calls and I have to get the job done. This is a great antishine product. Usually I use it before applying makeup and it hold up for quite some time. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding and I gotta say, it was a miracle!  It really smoothed out my face nicely.  I have some old acne scarring and it made my face look great for the big day!</li>
            <li> Great product wish it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased a different primer from another company which was in a tube and liquid. Since it didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for me it just sat in my makeup kit. Somewhere along the line, about a year ago, I bought this product. I barely used it only because it got buried in the kit and I would forget. I started using it religiously the past few months and I must say, it not only makes my makeup last longer but also my face is less oily. Used to be I could touch my skin after about an hour after applying makeup and I could feel the oil. Now, using this primer under my foundation, I don&#x27;t. I have a silky texture to my skin and no visible shine.&lt;br /&gt;I also started using a L&#x27;oreal liquid foundation about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;Though the price I paid for the primer is higher than on Amazon, by the time one adds in the shipping, it comes out to about the same or even less. I was able to purchase the primer with an instore coupon so I paid a bit over $10 total.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so use this mostly on the drier bits of my face, eyelids, cheeks, nose area. My foundation (Loreal matte)  goes on smoother and stays on longer and I don&#x27;t have any flakiness where this primer is applied. Also, I find that my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease when I use this as a base. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula, but the texture isn&#x27;t as smooth as my first jar. It doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly. But still works.</li>
            <li> For the price it does its job. The consistency is a bit weird, you have to rub it in good. Very small jar though.</li>
            <li> I am attaching a picture so you can see how horrible this product is. I have use primers/bases before and i absolutely  hate this one by Loreal. The texture feels silky but once you apply it it becomes little pieces of the base. Please refer to the picture</li>
            <li> Excellent, can say better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31years old and I feel this is a Great product for any age not just older women. It&#x27;s so smooth leaving face flawless.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Studio Secrets is the first makeup primer I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t hide all of my flaws (sigh, I have a LOT) but it enhances the appearance of my skin.  I was pleasantly surprised with how it camouflages  pore size.  My skin is much softer and makeup goes on smoother.  I use a \\&quot;self adjusting\\&quot; foundation.  One that goes on white and adjusts to my skin tone.  I didn&#x27;t know if the L&#x27;Oreal Base would interfere with that.  It DOESN&#x27;T. My foundation still adjust perfectly.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s very creamy and easy to spread.  I even used it without foundation one day.  Moisturizer and then L&#x27;Oreal Perfecting Base - very nice.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect because I think I only paid $7 for this base but so far it&#x27;s been holding up pretty good.  I use an eye brow pencil to fill in my brows and when I get hot they look \\&quot;hot\\&quot; as well so this has help calm the melting of the eye brows.  I give it 4 stars so far because it is winter, lets see how this works during the summer in the heat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but this is one of the things I cannot go without. I absolutely love how it makes you look.</li>
            <li> I do not have good skin.  Some areas are oily; some are dry.  I have a lot of acne blemishes, and I break out frequently.  I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup, but I&#x27;m not comfortable wearing none at all.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive primer, and it had a tendency to flake when I put foundation on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studio Secrets base goes on perfectly smooth, and I don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  It feels really light, and my foundation goes on very evenly over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really made me a believer is after a teeth cleaning under the super-bright dentist chair overhead lamp, the hygienist asked me what makeup I use.  I told her Loreal, and she remarked that my skin looked very fresh, smooth, and natural.  I was amazed because I thought she had great skin herself, and I do not like my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still self concious about my skin, but Loreal products make me feel a lot better about it.</li>
            <li> This cream is the perfect base for makeup.  It goes on smoothly, and helps the makeup stay on throughout the day.  I order several of these at a time, have to always have one on hand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is caky and thick and didn&#x27;t really do much for me. I only used it twice :( won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price !</li>
            <li> Minimizes pores, keeps oily skin matte for most of the day. Use it every day. This is my fifth jar, and it goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> bad product. make my skin break out. do not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This is the perfect face primer. I put it on after I moisturize my face and then start applying my makeup and this really smooths out my concealer and foundation allowing me to have a soft look. I love it!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! This primer leaves my skin smooth and soft. My make up looks so much better when I use this base first. It fills in the fine line and wrinkles thus helping you appear more youthful and fresh. This is now a part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have used many at much higher price.  This one fills and smooth without color or oily feeling.  I highly recommend for women of all races and skin pigments.  I am African American medium skintone and I love this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart when I was too lazy to drive to Ulta or Sephora for Prime Time. It&#x27;s about the same price per ounce, but it feels thicker and heavier and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup (bareMinerals) go on quite as smoothly. It did give the same staying power for me. I also didn&#x27;t like the awkwardness of the jar -- it probably would&#x27;ve been better if they put this in a tube. I didn&#x27;t like getting it under my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up hearing about [[ASIN:B0012ZNSWE Monistat SootTing Care CTafing Relief Powder-Gel, 1.5-Ounce Tube]] as a makeup primer and ended up buying that when I was 3/4 of the way done with this base. It works better for me as a primer, and it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce. I ended up using the rest of the L&#x27;Oreal as a primer for my eyeshadow instead.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I had purchased my first one at Ulta. I just decided to order another one on Amazon when I ran out and the quality was totally different. it was frothy and did not feel the same on my face at all. Highly disappointed with my purchase on Amazon. Do recommend the cream, but not this seller.</li>
            <li> Would not be able to use this everyday, jar very small for the price, it does cover more then I thought.  On a younger person it would really cover.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I do not use it all over my face.  I put is around my eyes, my forehead and my laugh lines. It is great. The lines around by eyes are minimized and my skin feels soooooo soft. As a primer it is good - but the over all benefits to my skin have been fantanstic!!</li>
            <li> I love this. really helps my concealer go on smoothly. I have a jar in purse, one in travel case and one at home.</li>
            <li> I put this on before any base or foundation or liquid powder or whatever the hell we&#x27;re calling that junk you spread all over your face to hide zits and even out skin tones and hide large pores. I put this on, and it smooths out my lines. I have to wait a couple minutes for it to settle in, and then I&#x27;m ready to put on the foundation stuff. It glides right on after this Magic stuff. Seriously. I have very rotten skin, but when I wash my face regularly and apply this immediately and then put on my makeups, my skin tends to do better. So I&#x27;ve gotten to where even if I don&#x27;t put on anything afterward, I generally wear this stuff at the very least. It&#x27;s great, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m pale-skinned, so I can&#x27;t speak for how well it works on darker skin tones. But for me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Its good, but i was not exceptionally impressed.</li>
            <li> After applying makes your skin feel really soft I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the softness of the skin after applying this base.</li>
            <li> I tired this years ago, and it made it way back to the local drugstore. I&#x27;ve been having issues finding a foundation I liked, so thought perhaps trying a primer underneath would help. I have somewhat dry skin, but use a good moisturizer. Well, I gave this prodcut a few tries, and each time I looked worst than the day before. It&#x27;s very thick, which makes it hard to apply. The only thing this product did was make me look sick, my skin have an un-natural ashy appearance and it enhanced any dryness I had on my skin. While my foundation stayed on, my skin looked dull, dry and horrible. I have no clue what type of the skin the people have who gave this product good reviews.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much but this works well.  You just rub it on the face after applying makeup.  This stays on better than powder.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!! It is perfect for the skin before to applicate the foundation. I like more other like photoready primer of Revlon. And I use just a llittle is enough.</li>
            <li> Base foundation primer I&#x27;ve had to date.  Helps to keep my make up fresh looking.</li>
            <li> smooths out my complexion and enhances make up application.</li>
            <li> I have used and love this product but one purchased here appeared to have been opened. Was missing inner lid and product was &amp;#34;disturbed&amp;#34; in container.</li>
            <li> This is my new face primer! I&#x27;ve used Z pore from Kohl&#x27;s for about the last 6 years and loved it but saw this stuff and was curious. I hate that most primers are very slippery and very thin. I find that they do NOT help to keep my make up on and just helps it to slide off even when using a very small amount. Yuck. This stuff is thick and sticky. Helps hold my make up on and covers those pores up. Does wonders under my eye too!  I use a very small amount and allow time for it to set before applying any make up over it. I noticed that CVS has it&#x27;s own brand of this. Hummmmm, I wonder if it works as well?</li>
            <li> I was a bit concern at first as I have oily and acne-prone skin that it will be a waste of money that will only be used a few times if I develop breakouts.However, I had a good start with this product and am still using it for 2 weeks already without breaking out. Just make sure on the cleansing part at the end of the day as makeup tends to stick on more. All in all, it was not greasy. Good control on my oily skin from running my make-up away. The product is just too small that won&#x27;t last a month for daily applications.</li>
            <li> I saw a commerical for this and read some reveiws and decided to try it out. I have oily skin and huge pores. Within one use I noticed a difference in my skin. It was softer, less oily and my pores were less noticeable. I usually have to powder my face every couple of hours or it gets really shiny but with this I didn&#x27;t have to once. Now i sometimes dont even wear foundation which i would never leave the house without putting it on. I also have a 2 year old who loves touching my face but I never let her because of my oily skin but now I let her all the time because of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very ugly , not worth one dollar</li>
            <li> One of my fav primers!</li>
            <li> Awesomeness. I usually buy Nars and those expensive brands from Sephora but this had my face flawless all day. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really wish they had this in a larger quantity.  This stuff is amazing. It leaves your face looking clean and youthfulwhile filling in pores and fine lines like it says. I actually bought this thinking it was something else but I&#x27;m glad I did. I will keep buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> I used this after it was recommended by someone I watch on YouTube. It&#x27;s a small jar but it really doesn&#x27;t take much at all,  I&#x27;ve had t&lt;br /&gt;this for about 4 months now. You instantly see a difference when you apply it. I always get compliments about how great my make up looks when I use this.</li>
            <li> very good product I use this every day but today I am stopping just because I have oily skin this is a very good product makes your skin smooth and your make up will stick if its powder or liquid but if you have oily skin like I do  you would have to keep using powder foundation or oil absorbing pads which I am very tired of so I would say this product would be great for dry normal skin I wish they had something like this for oily skin ugh I hate oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had been reading a lot about this product, and I finally convinced myself to give it a try.  It really did nothing for me.  Maybe made my skin a little smoother for initial application of makeup, but that&#x27;s about it.  I have found cheapy primers that work much better than this one.</li>
            <li> amazing! leaves the skin really soft and matte.</li>
            <li> This is a decent base for makeup if you like to use a base, which I do.  You don&#x27;t have to use much so one jar goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 years.  A tiny bit goes on smoothly, fills little lines and pores.  I use it as a base for mineral make-up powder (Glo Perfecting Powder) &amp; blusher.  I&#x27;m seventy and this is the perfect make-up for me - it evens my skin tone and I never look &amp;#34;made-up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just got this product, it looks no way close to a new product, very old and most probably not genuine if not already opened and used by someone else. Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin, and it&#x27;s taken me awhile to find products that won&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick after an hour. This primer has been one that I come back to time and time again simply because it works. My face stays dewy, not oily, and I don&#x27;t need as much foundation with it. I use this daily and it really is top notch.</li>
            <li> This is not the worst primer I have ever used, and certainly not the best. I like the way it feels on my skin and it helps my makeup stay. However, I do not see any of the \\&quot;magic perfecting\\&quot; and it is difficult to apply using only my fingers out of the jar. I have finger nails (not very long) and the product always gets stuck under them. I first have to get the primer out with a brush then apply the brush to my fingers, and finally my face. In my opinion, this product is too expensive for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> I love it good stuff, it really performs well and better than expected. I will be ordering more. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So I received this little beauty yesterday and immediately tried it out....my first thought was \\&quot;Omg look how small this is, this s*** better be magical\\&quot;    I am quite pleased with it, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture of it...kinda like a mousse feel to it but it spreads out nicely and a little of this does go a long way.    My makeup stayed in place and it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy which is a HUGE plus for me.    Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it made my skin feel smooth, but after a few hours my skin had a bad reaction to it. I wouldnt recommend this primer to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on and cant tell a difference between when I get out of the shower and after putting this on. Overpriced for not doing anything. I would not buy again and would not recommend. Very disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal for this product.</li>
            <li> I am 47 with combination skin; I am still prone to acne on my chin and nose.  This primer does enough for me that I can use it alone, without foundation, and instantly feel better about my appearance.  This is a thick primer with a pink tint.  Both of these things are exactly what I need to counteract my lines, dark circles, acne scars, and larger pores.  On my best skin days, this makes my skin look luminous and young.  On my worst skin days, this still makes my eyes look \\&quot;awake\\&quot; right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is not something that has all day staying power.  For me, on average, this has a four hour effect when I use it solo.  With foundation, I feel like I can get six hours out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as acne, most new primers will give me a mild breakout--redness and small bumps--for seven to ten days.  This product was no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter, when the climate is drier, I use a moisturizer first.  In the summer, I put it on bare skin.  I get the best effect from this product in the spring and fall when my skin isn&#x27;t trying to deal with dryness or oiliness.  Still, this is my favorite primer.  In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, Sonya Dakar, Oil of Olay, Almay, Aveeno, and Andalou Naturals.  Bottom line, my skin ALWAYS looks at least a bit better when I use it.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely terrible!!! It made me breakout like crazy and it made me look extremely cakey. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and really has helped with my fine lines. I use this along with my night cream with Retnol-A and my wrinkles are almost gone! I love that this is really light and can be used after my day cream has been absorbed. I don&#x27;t go anywhere now without this!</li>
            <li> I saw this, tried it and I loved the way it smoothed my skin. Huge mistake. I have large pores but don&#x27;t usually try new things as I have a professional line of skin care I use.. At first I was unsure what was making me break out.&lt;br /&gt; I am 59 years old and no acne for a long time. I realized it was happening a few days after I would wear this product. I got cleared up and tried it again..the worst break out I&#x27;ve had in 15 yrs. I had my daughter try it and low and behold she broke out. My friend said she would test it. She broke out a week and half later in same spot she wore this base. Some of her acne was serious and left holes. I have never seen her break out like this.&lt;br /&gt; It is a waxy substance and not breathable..it doesn&#x27;t even wash off your fingers in just plain water so makes sense why it would plug pores.&lt;br /&gt; I would suggest trying this very carefully before going big.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from a drug store but wanted to warn the shoppers on here. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it! Also, after a short time it had a bad scent. Like the other reviews, I found it to have a strange consistency.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a drugstore after reading hundreds of glowing reviews all over the internet. I have extremely oily skin and thought that this MIGHT help with foundation application or oil control or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put on a thin layer, it didn&#x27;t feel good... it didn&#x27;t feel soft.. it didn&#x27;t feel silky. It did nothing to disguise or smooth the extremely fine lines under my eyes, nor did it do anything to smooth my pore-filled nose. So the next day, I tried using a little bit more and ended up with a completely gunky, sticky nose and and cheek area. I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff to blend in, I couldn&#x27;t get it to soak in. I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, but it just sat on my skin all sticky and never &#x27;set.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I tried using foundation over it (RCS for combo/oily skin) and it was a disaster. The foundation wouldn&#x27;t apply properly and just mixed with the layer of muck that sat on my poor face. I did the best I could with it, but refused to leave the house that day due to embarrassment over the streaky, unblended crapola I was wearing.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It gives a silky smooth feel, helps my makeup stay in place and doesn&#x27;t break me out. Although I do like the product I probably will not buy again for two reasons: the product is thick, doesn&#x27;t spread well and makes me feel like I am really rubbing and pulling on my face to spread it, and second, I do not like the jar. I get as much stuck under my nails as I get on my face. If they could correct the jar and thickness issue I would def. purchase again.</li>
            <li> i regret buying this product it didnt seem to work at all with me i tried it several times but nothing</li>
            <li> First time using a primer so I do not have anything to compare it to, but it wasn&#x27;t as I expected. I thought it would be creamier, but was somewhat dry, and caked. Applying my makeup over it certainly did not give a look I expected, or wanted.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!! It&#x27;s for combination skin dry/oily I know because I have combination skin and it makes my dry parts of the face look flawless and not cakey and I don&#x27;t get oily till like 8 hours later which with out it I get oily 15 minutes after I apply my foundation you still have to wear powder on top</li>
            <li> It looked really weird when I received it .  I tried it out and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference . So it kind of sucks would not recommend it at all !</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It doesn&#x27;t take much, goes on smoothly and really evens out one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time as promised and the product is as described. I have used this product before  and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully smooth cream that makes your skin feel like velvet. It makes a perfect base before adding makeup.</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin, specially for my nose because it get pretty oily. I would recommend this if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love this suff. Fast shipper</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of makeup, but unfortunately I struggle with acne (age 24) and have a bit to cover up -- acne as well as bad pores, and not so great texture on parts of my face. I hate foundation because it&#x27;s cakey. I finally found this and it does wonders. It covers up my texture issues and most of my pore issues. It also creates a very smooth surface to apply cover-up to. As long as you have a cover up that matches your skin tone well, you don&#x27;t need foundation over this, if you&#x27;re not much into the makeup look like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only use a very tiny amount! A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make sure this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I apply my gentle cleanser with an exfoliating brush at the end of the day to be sure it all comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;-- The jar it comes in is very small and quite pricey (however it works so well I&#x27;m willing to pay it). I imagine the jar will last me about 3 months - but remember what I said about only using a tiny bit!&lt;br /&gt;--The jar itself. Because it&#x27;s in a jar, I have to be more concerned about bacteria. Though the advantage of it being in a jar is I can get every last bit. Couldn&#x27;t say the same for a pump.</li>
            <li> This is a really good makeup base.  It helps my foundation stay on longer.  I am very light skinned so I do not notice a color...it blends right in.  It makes my skin look matte and helps keep down the oily shine.  It is not very large but I use it sparingly.  I have it on order each month.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!! A product that actually keeps my face shine free. The finish is so wonderful I don&#x27;t even need to wear a foundation if I don&#x27;t want to. This  is truly a skin perfecting base!! A little bit goes a long way. I was worried when this arrived because the jar is small, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot for an all day beautiful complexion.  I have not had any breakouts from this product.  I love the smooth flawless look this gives me!! I am thoroughly impressed!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This review is from: Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer, Clear, 0.85 Fluid Ounce (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 and had not purchased make up in ages and when I found out about primers I felt like I had to try several to know which one would work for me. I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on the expensive brands until I tried the drug store ones. I bought Neutrogena&#x27;s primer, Maybelline&#x27;s primer and L&#x27;Oreals primer. I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years so people say I look 25 and one person carded me the other day when I bought some liquor and thought I was 19. My background in skin care: Facials since I was 12. I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started this shopping spree and sampling different product lines was me purchasing Estee Lauders Double Wear Maximum Cover Camouflage Make Up in Creamy Vanilla at Dillards. I thought because of the cost it would be awesome. I live in a very cold and dry climate now (Montana# and I get broken capillaries on my cheeks in winter and I hate looking at them, but when I applied Estee Lauders foundation by the end of my work day is was as though all the foundation separated and made my pores look humongous and any dryness was so visible I was so embarrassed as I work in retail and I knew people were looking at me like I had a really crappy mask on. I didn&#x27;t want to take back the Estee Lauder make up so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest. So now that you know I am not a novice to skin care, this is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to read up on reviews on Amazon #love Amazon# for primers and so I bought 3 brands and have experimented in different ways. I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked. She is a crack up. Love that girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my results: My skin is combo oil and dry. I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin. However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women. My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows. I have a small laugh lines around my eye&#x27;s but not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s shine control: Its gritty but nothing to really complain about. Just use enough moisturizer before hand, give it 4-5 minutes to let the moisturizer sink in to your skin and then apply Neutrogenas primer. I waited another 3-4 minutes before I applied foundation. I used Lancombs foundation in matte and Neutrogena&#x27;s rice protein powder afterwards. Results: My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores and so I felt it was too masky again. Then I used Neutrogena Primer with Colorstay Foundation per Ally and same thing, my poors are too big. I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next was Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Primer. I always moisturize my face with Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream #The BEST for day use cream#. Then after 5 minutes applied Maybellines primer and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk. It was very nice. Because I know that acne is 90% diet and 10% hormonal or hygene I don&#x27;t care about the silicones because they don&#x27;t break my face out because I eat well. If you eat fast food and bad foods, no matter what you put on your face for acne won&#x27;t work because its all coming from the inside..... onto my story: I let the primer soak for 2 minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream in Sand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely. That was a joy and it seemed to bring out the best in the foundation. Then I applied Neutrogena&#x27;s rice powder setting powder and went to work. End of day it was so-so, still a tad masky but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation. But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite. This is a neat primer because its like stucko. You apply it on the highly porous parts of your skin and wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27; and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment. Then I decided to use Colorstay again and this was so-so. It could be the Colorstay, have no idea yet. But at the end of the day, slightly masky again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g. Love that stuff but Dermalogica does not make it anymore. The company is sending me samples of a newer version of their foundation line. There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so today I used Maybelline Primer #so far my favorite# after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it.... And Viola! I found the Holy Grail. All day long my skim was like velvet. The foundation did not separate around the circumference of my pores and my face was &#x27;dewey&#x27; and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers. Maybelline Instant Age Rewind will be my primer of choice. It does not break me out and its slick without being oily. You have to try it to know. Then I mix Revlon Colorstay foundation with my Dermalogica foundation and that creates the perfect makeup for my combination skin and oil. I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that. By the end of the day, my skin looks radiant. One thing I did do, is I used the L&#x27;Oreal primer in the small jar for my eyelids and it was alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per [...] she recommends Maybelline eye concealer that is the Brightener and she is right, it works really well. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica I think you will be ecstatic by the results. Its trial and error. But now I&#x27;m so happy my capillaries don&#x27;t show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE THING.. I also implemented the Oil Cleansing Method this week for washing my face. Google that and do what she says. It&#x27;s amazing. Those who have larger pores have blackheads usually. I swear to God, the castor oil #mixed with 1 drop of essential oil of Orange# will dissolve the sebum, blackheads and your pores will eventually shrink alittle. But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil. I usually apply it after I use soap #evening primrose and borage# so this OCM is totally new to me. After day 5 of that method, I have zero blackheads. I usually use a Biore strip to pull then up but after 5 days of using the castor oil method of cleansing for oily skin, I tried Biore strips today and hardly anything surfaced. The castor oil is kicking butt ladies on sebum and now my pores aren&#x27;t grey specks in need of extractions from a cosmetologist. I&#x27;ve never been happier about getting rid of blackheads in my life. Had I known castor oil dissolved blackheads 28 years ago when I went thru puberty I would have been doing that all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope this helps y&#x27;all on the primers and what I mixed with foundation so you don&#x27;t have to buy the entire drug store to find out what works.&lt;br /&gt;TTFNworks.&lt;br /&gt;TTFN</li>
            <li> Love the feel! It looks great and feels oh so good on my face!</li>
            <li> After reading some complaints about the jar and the texture of this cream, I decided I&#x27;d try it anyway. If you have very long finger nails, it&#x27;s going to get in them, but then again, so is everything else that you touch. After reading the directions, it says to dab your face with small dots of the cream and blend it in with a circular motion. It takes very little product. Worked like a charm for a smooth and soft coverage. This jar is going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily, acne-prone skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. It keeps my foundation on all day, instead of sliding off. I don&#x27;t even have to use blotting papers. I&#x27;m very happy with this. People have commented about my skin looking so good, which is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this primer and am thankful to Amazon for carrying it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Till now, nice touch.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. Highly recommend that you use this before putting on your foundation, etc. If your skin is perfect (flawless), then you don&#x27;t need to wear anything else. If your skin is like mine (blotchy), put this on first followed by the rest of your makeup. It primes your skin quite nicely. Very highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on smoothly, feels good and makes a nice base for makeup. I have extremely dry skin and this helps.</li>
            <li> For my taste, it was too matte and thick.  I prefer a primer that is easier to smooth on.  The only positive I can say is that it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. Weird how such a seemingly subtle makeup application can lead to flawless results and loads of compliments!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted, delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This is Alana reviewing on Kevins acct.I am a 39 year old female with oily skin that has never broken out or had any acne even in my teens, its just oily inside, dry surface. My foundation seems to always disappear totally somehow within 3 hours. No matter which type Im using- It could be cheaper 5 dollar Wet n Wild stuff, or $60 Teint Visionnaire by Lancome, it will still be gone by noon. I began trying several primers recently&amp; this one I really like.It is thicker than others, and it is not clear so yes it does have a slight lightening effect on skin.For me that is great! I want very lightened skin. For ethnic skin this could pose an issue because I can just see it turning dark skin white and looking ashy.However, for light skin this is nice under my makeup. This has a very matte, thick texture, almost buttery.It is unlike others Ive tried, not like a clear primer.I have very non sensitive facial skin however, so I cannot attest to whether it causes acne.I can say for sure that this does not cause me allergies at all, and I am allergic to half this planet. In my opinion it rubs on very smoothly and has not clumped up or balled up on my face one bit.This has not clogged my pores in any way either. I have used this as of this week, for4 months now.I have placed it on my face after my moisturizers and anti age cream, and underneath my foundation or concealer.It helps me to keep on such make ups.It also seemingly helps my eyeshadow stay in place a bit longer on my VERY oily lids. My foundations still tend to need re application later in my day. However it is no longer gone by noon with the help of this primer.The texture might put some people off.I love the texture.It seems to sort of lessen itself after a few hours, so maybe the staying power isnt as good as high end stuff.For the price I paid, it does what I want it to do and accomplishes it without adding to my oil issues.The part it does best with is my nose&amp; undereye areas.My nose tends to be clogged no matter how many pore strips or exfoliants or how much I steam it. This covers the mess well.I have lines from years of constant squinting due to extreme light sensitivity in my eyes, and this covers those fine squint lines perfectly on my skin. Its nice to have it smoothed over while I wait for anti age creams to take effect. I tried mixing this up with tiny amt of Ponds cold cream before to hide&amp; also moisten up very dry patches of peeling skin at my nose and mixed it did work. All in all this is one of the nicer drugstore priced primers I have tried&amp; am still using it daily unless I find a nicer one someplace. My skin is-oily beneath with a dry surface, light coloured Italian skin, 39 yrs old,I live in very extreme weather.Worn under various foundations rangeing from $5.00 to $65.00, and its worked beneath them all for making it last better.w many pore strips or exfoliants or how much I steam it.

            <li> My wife bought these and says there the same as in the store for less money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
            <li> I am going to try and write the most in depth review about this product especialy since I know how hard it it to find a worthy primer. .now it says it makes pores look smaller. This is true buy it wont disappear.  But great for pictures.&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;so I have a very dark complexion, acne prone skin, acne scars, open pores and very very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;apply your usual moisturizer,  then apply the primer&lt;br /&gt;its very matte and almost fades into your skin and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;TZONE:&lt;br /&gt;Apply over your entire face. Then let it set. You may see some sweat breaking through the pores here add another layer.&lt;br /&gt;for your nose and forehead add a third layer to keep the oil fr breaking through&lt;br /&gt;MAKE UP:&lt;br /&gt;at this point you can apply your foundation and powder.&lt;br /&gt;The primer is definitely keep the oil from breaking appart your make up&lt;br /&gt;for a 5hr period you may only need one slight touch up may be only on your t zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall its worth the buy and will make you photo ready.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on my complexion.  Great!</li>
            <li> still my one &amp; only favorite primer. very affordable &amp; it gets the job done</li>
            <li> It made my face break out everywhere, and the results werent that incredible. I wish I would have known beforehand.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice, silky texture, and good coverage. You could almost use it by itself. I find that it works best if my moisturizer has had a little bit of time to fully absorb first. It makes my pores disappear and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than I like but it does the trick and evens out my face so I can go without make up if I want to.</li>
            <li> No more large pores..!!  This is a great base.  Just a little of this and a bit of mineral powder and I&#x27;m done.</li>
