    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best all around moisturizer out there.</li>
            <li>A friend with wonderful skin recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a lot of fancy stuff in it, but for my somewhat oily, but drying-with-age skin it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Works great with epigran.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer - love it</li>
            <li>Years ago I used an azulene cream that I really loved, and since then I&#x27;ll try out an azulene cream once in a while hoping to find something close to what I had used.</li>
            <li>Love it !&lt;</li>
            <li>Instead I believe it takes care of the redness and acne prone skin :) A must have!</li>
            <li>This product came in oilier and not as effective on my skin.</li>
            <li>I guess the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is an okay cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dr. Grandel products for over 20 years and the PhytoCare Azulene Cream is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is very good over more aggressive facial treatments.</li>
            <li>this is a good product, but not as good as my last tube (which lasted forever).  </li>
            <li>great for very sensitive and blemish prone skin.</li>
            <li>Good product has somewhat of a perfume smell but diminishes fast.-  </li>
            <li>the prior formulation smelled great and spread more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>have fine skin, travel a lot, and this product gives me the moisture I need.</li>
            <li>So excited to find this online</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did much to calm my skin though.</li>
            <li>It helps with any hints of rosasia or redness of the face and is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but I felt like it left a bit of a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>have very dry skin especially in the winter and the cream helps a lot  and it smells good too</li>
            <li>It it little pricey, but good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This system has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>I use it after a glycolic acid peel and it&#x27;s very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>Dr. Grandel&#x27;s Azulene Cream is the skin care product for me as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>this formulation has a different scent (not bad; milder) and is creamier.</li>
            <li>I suggest always having this on hand, even if it isn&#x27;t your main moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far one of my favorite face moisturizers for the past 12 years.</li>
            <li>There is something relaxing and soothing about just applying it, and when my skin has been super sensitive to any foreign substance, it welcomed the Azulene Cream.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to break outs and this always soothes my skin and nerve clogs my pores.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after a friend recommended it because I have sensitive skin with a tendency for breakouts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Cerave&#x27;s (still highly recommended) cleanser and daily moisturizer duo.</li>
            <li>It usually took two weeks for me to see fantastic results but with this product, Bioelement&#x27;s cleanser and Cerave&#x27;s daily moisturizer it&#x27;s healed in three days.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really moisturizing and has a slight blue tint so it almost eliminates the redness problem.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer - love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my friend&#x27;s mom, who works at a spa, recommended this to me.  I have uneven skin tone, due to redness on my cheek.  This cream helped soothing, and reduced redness on my cheek.  Also, very moisturizing.  It it little pricey, but good for sensitive skin.  I also recommend this to everyone to use after they do face exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cream. I started using it 4 years ago after I started seeing a esthetician to help treat my roseca and I haven&#x27;t looked back! I put it on before bed every night. It&#x27;s pricey but the pro size lasts me a year!</li>
            <li> I have very dry eczema skin and this product worked for me in three days along with the Bioelements cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Cerave&#x27;s (still highly recommended) cleanser and daily moisturizer duo. It usually took two weeks for me to see fantastic results but with this product, Bioelement&#x27;s cleanser and Cerave&#x27;s daily moisturizer it&#x27;s healed in three days. It was a miracle product. Because my skin flakes, the small bit of &#x27;&#x27;grease&#x27;&#x27; helps my makeup glide on in the morning and keeps my skin hydrated. At night, it works as a repair system. The cream is thicker in consistency but glides on like butter. It really only takes a very small bit to work its magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product from the woman who does my eyebrows, she and her niece have eczema and use this product and the Bioelements cleanser I mentioned above. This product has worked for all three ladies. She gave me a small trail size in a container used for condiments and it lasted me a month. The price is a little high, but if you were to spend your money on one thing, it should always be skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded a picture of the product-- the bottle is the size of my hand (I am 4&#x27;11 and have tiny hands so please estimate). I estimate this will last for a while. Please, give it a try.</li>
            <li> great for very sensitive and blemish prone skin. This even works of sin being treated with accutane.</li>
            <li> This is the best all around moisturizer out there. I have sensitive skin prone to break outs and this always soothes my skin and nerve clogs my pores. Works great with epigran.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. One of these lasts about 6 months using it morning and night. I have keratosis pilaris on my cheeks which makes them look really red. This stuff is really moisturizing and has a slight blue tint so it almost eliminates the redness problem. The only warning I have is that this cream is pretty thick especially for day time use. I usually mix it with some sunscreen to thin it out for the day and use it as is during the night. This system has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> So excited to find this online but when I started using it, I realized that the cream doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency than the one I get from my aesthetician. Her product is more expensive and comes in from Germany. This product came in oilier and not as effective on my skin. I guess the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li> This is the only facial lotion I use. It helps with any hints of rosasia or redness of the face and is very gentle on my skin. A little goes a long way so start out with a pea size per area.</li>
            <li> I use it after a glycolic acid peel and it&#x27;s very soothing to the skin. I like the feel and the texture. Great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after a friend recommended it because I have sensitive skin with a tendency for breakouts. It was okay, but I felt like it left a bit of a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used an azulene cream that I really loved, and since then I&#x27;ll try out an azulene cream once in a while hoping to find something close to what I had used. This is an okay cream. The texture is thick but it is not greasy. I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did much to calm my skin though.</li>
            <li> A friend with wonderful skin recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine skin, travel a lot, and this product gives me the moisture I need.</li>
            <li> Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin especially in the winter and the cream helps a lot  and it smells good too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far one of my favorite face moisturizers for the past 12 years. Calming, soothing, hydrating, moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause acne. Instead I believe it takes care of the redness and acne prone skin :) A must have!</li>
            <li> I like this cream to use whem my cheeks turn a little red seems to sooth and diminish the redness.  I only use when needed dut to cost of product.  Cream absorbs well and does the trick.  I also have a gel mask I use with Azulene I like and in combination they take the redness out of my cheeks in 1 to 2 days of use.  Good product has somewhat of a perfume smell but diminishes fast.-  that is why I have it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, but not as good as my last tube (which lasted forever).  the prior formulation smelled great and spread more smoothly.  this formulation has a different scent (not bad; milder) and is creamier.</li>
            <li> Dr. Grandel&#x27;s Azulene Cream is the skin care product for me as long as it is available.  It lasts and lasts for someone who is not a lavish user.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Grandel products for over 20 years and the PhytoCare Azulene Cream is my favorite. There isn&#x27;t a lot of fancy stuff in it, but for my somewhat oily, but drying-with-age skin it is perfect. Not greasy and my skin seems to absorb it well. There is something relaxing and soothing about just applying it, and when my skin has been super sensitive to any foreign substance, it welcomed the Azulene Cream. I suggest always having this on hand, even if it isn&#x27;t your main moisturizer. It is very good over more aggressive facial treatments.</li>
            <li> My face is prone to pimples or redness due to swimming, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps in soothing out and reducing redness. Will recommend.</li>
