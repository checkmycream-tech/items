            <li>makes the skin smooth, dries fast too and perfect when mixed with rose water.</li>
            <li>If you have light skin, it may appear redder then a darker skin tone.</li>

            <li>It makes my skin smooth when I use it</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>It did however tie-dye some of my laundry bright yellow.</li>
            <li>It is very fine powder, very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a great face pack to treat moderate acne with a very oily skin type.</li>
            <li>This Multani Mati is good for both Dry as well as Oily Skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Very good mask to use at least once a week.</li>
            <li>I mixed it using rose water which is suppose to work better, but so far it hasn&#x27;t done the trick for me.</li>
            <li>It has turned about 30% darker than earlier and more importantly, my hair is getting thicker and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This has been so useful and inexpensive to me.</li>
            <li>Try using this mask powder mixed with rose water to help soften skin.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it two times and can notice the difference when applying mask add 1 tsp Turmeric powder, 1 tsp rose water</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Let dry (15-20 minutes) and then rinse with warm water then cool.  </li>
            <li>Rinse it off with warm water and pat it dry.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to use a nice face wash such as clean and clear to remove excess &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; off your face.</li>
            <li>The drawing action as the mask dries, encourages deep acne to come to the surface more easily.</li>
            <li>I first used this product upon receiving it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell when the mask is on or off ;)</li>
            <li>Seller was fast too!</li>
            <li>In the last 3 months I&#x27;ve probably gone through as many skincare routines and nothing has helped.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonight, and I promise that I&#x27;m not lying when I say that I noticed an immediate difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I used rose water to mix the mask into a paste as suggested by other users.</li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t apply a certain amount just add some but not to much so mask won&#x27;t be to watery)</li>
            <li>My skincare routine is very stringent, but I do not have to wear any foundation at all, just lipstick and eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin, this may help you.</li>
            <li>I got this faster than expected...best to order from herbal beauty their delivery is extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Multani Mati is a key ingredient to healthy and clear skin.</li>
            <li>(even mixed it with essential oils, manuka honey and/or rose water).</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if these are continuous benefits, but I&#x27;m excited to find out.</li>
            <li>But plain water is good enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try this with rose water and other powders such as orange peel.</li>
            <li>I use it daily to keep acne away, and it does have a mild lightening effect (which is natural)</li>
            <li>It seems to leave my skin feeling balanced (not oily or dry) and fresh.</li>
            <li>as well due to the fact that my acne is mild to severe.</li>
            <li>and I actually had whiteheads and other clogged pore material come to the surface to be easily cleaned off.</li>
            <li>I use it with coconut oil and my skin is finally clear.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I am exploring natural ways to care for my body, including my skin.</li>
            <li>and they are not gone completely</li>
            <li>and my face is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>feel the product could have been placed in an insulated envelope or perhaps a box, no one wants to receive a package and have the entire contents spill out onto them which again could have happened in transit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d encourage anyone on the fence to go ahead and try this, even though it&#x27;s going to take commitment to do this everyday, but it seems, so far, that the benefits will most definitely outweigh whatever work you have to put into making the mixture daily.</li>
            <li>I wished I found this first instead of going through all the other products that claim to clear up breakouts.</li>
            <li>If you have a dry skin type, you may use 2% to whole milk to make your paste.</li>
            <li>cleans pores like no other</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this on a daily basis but it does make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing to be concerned about as the moisturizer with calm it down for ten minutes or so.</li>
            <li>The water here is so hard and chlorinated that my once flawless, even a tad oily skin has been dry and flaky, my pores wide open, and I&#x27;ve developed a  serious case of whiteheads on my chin that has left that area and around my mouth darker than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>It had a glow that has been missing for the last few months, and the texture looks and feels better.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It had a glow that has been missing for the last few months, and the texture looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last for much long.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to wash your face with soap afterward as this will over dry your skin, use your facial scrub weekly when using this mask.    </li>
            <li> However after rinsing the mask off a few hours later my skin turned an instant tan orange.</li>
            <li> A half a teaspoon is all you need for each use, which makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li> The product is the same multani miti that I have used previously in India.</li>
            <li> If you have milk allergies, and you have very dry skin, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> It is and I got the expected result after using it.</li>
            <li> If I leave it one for a few minutes there is an OBVIOUS improvement when I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Other liquids such as green tea, milk, and mineral water will give the skin additional benefits as well.  </li>
            <li> and when I ordered it, I was not sure if it will be the same.</li>
            <li> The envelope which contained the box because it was not insulated the box was badly damaged fortunately for me the contents did not burst and spill</li>
            <li> I mixed with a small amount of sandalwood powder and milk to make a thin mixture, which I then left on for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just use less than a teaspoon of the powder mixed with the liquid of your choice, or even plain water, to make a thin paste, or less water to make a thicker mask and apply it to your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy preventing a mess being made when mixing/rinsing/storing this product.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for 15 minutes or until you see that it has dried.  </li>
            <li> Will destroy your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this mask to anyone who suffers from oily skin as well as those who have hyperpigmentation and acne.  </li>
            <li> It was the packaging that I was not pleased with.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with Dr Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap and rub the resulting past on the inflamed areas.</li>
            <li> I spread a thin layer of the mixture over my face and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Apply thin layer to skin.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product because I am exploring natural ways to care for my body, including my skin. I first used this product upon receiving it. I checked the package over and it was sealed and had a good \\&quot;use by\\&quot; date on it, 2015.  I made the paste according to the directions, using only distilled water because my skin is oily, so I didn&#x27;t need to use milk. I spread a thin layer of the mixture over my face and let it sit for a few minutes. When I rinsed it off, my face was glowing and I actually had whiteheads and other clogged pore material come to the surface to be easily cleaned off. My skin looks and feels smoother, softer, and more radiant. I&#x27;d like to try this with rose water and other powders such as orange peel. Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> I have been using product for last 3 months and i noticed a good change in my hair color.  It has turned about 30% darker than earlier and more importantly, my hair is getting thicker and shiny.  This has been so useful and inexpensive to me.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Can&#x27;t tell when the mask is on or off ;)</li>
            <li> The product is the same multani miti that I have used previously in India. One pack can be used in one use for 3-5 face masks.</li>
            <li> love this product it cleans and scrubs like nothing out there that i tried! makes the skin smooth, dries fast too and perfect when mixed with rose water.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this mask to anyone who suffers from oily skin as well as those who have hyperpigmentation and acne.  This is suitable for all ethnicities.  I have been a faithful user of this mask for 3 months.  My skincare routine is very stringent, but I do not have to wear any foundation at all, just lipstick and eyeliner.  Try using this mask powder mixed with rose water to help soften skin.  Other liquids such as green tea, milk, and mineral water will give the skin additional benefits as well.  I use it daily to keep acne away, and it does have a mild lightening effect (which is natural) so over time you will see any hyperpigmentation begin to fade.  My skin is not as oily as it used to be.  Just use less than a teaspoon of the powder mixed with the liquid of your choice, or even plain water, to make a thin paste, or less water to make a thicker mask and apply it to your face and neck.  Leave it on for 15 minutes or until you see that it has dried.  You will notice that your skin feels like it is getting tighter as the mask dries.  Rinse it off with warm water and pat it dry.  If you mix the mask powder with sandalwood, it will also help with discoloration. You may want to use a moisturizer after your mask.  There is no need to wash your face with soap afterward as this will over dry your skin, use your facial scrub weekly when using this mask.    I hope you get great results, definatey give this a try.  In 2-3 weeks you will get results.</li>
            <li> Useless. Will destroy your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great face pack to treat moderate acne with a very oily skin type. The drawing action as the mask dries, encourages deep acne to come to the surface more easily. It helps unclog pores and even lightens darker skin and freckles. Be warned, this earth mask can be drying to the skin. If you have a dry skin type, you may use 2% to whole milk to make your paste. If you have milk allergies, and you have very dry skin, this may not be for you. If you have very oily skin, this may help you. I add rosewater into the pack for added softness. But plain water is good enough. Everybody should use moisturizer after each and every use. Your face may have redness after washing. This means that this pack brings blood to your skin to speed up healing. It&#x27;s nothing to be concerned about as the moisturizer with calm it down for ten minutes or so. If you have light skin, it may appear redder then a darker skin tone. Very good mask to use at least once a week. A half a teaspoon is all you need for each use, which makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and this helped me with my blackheads which i suffer from on my cheek bones.  I mix this with Sandalwood powder and rosewater for a great mask and keeps my face looking and feeling clean, healthy and smooth.  Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on a daily basis but it does make my skin feel soft. I have acne marks and they are not gone completely but they are smaller now. I would recommend to use a nice face wash such as clean and clear to remove excess &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; off your face. Overall I will be purchasing this again since it doesn&#x27;t make my face burn or irritated.</li>
            <li> I got this faster than expected...best to order from herbal beauty their delivery is extremely fast. This mask is very simple to make and is like clay so it goes on smoothly and I love it, I have been using it for week now and my face is almost completely cleared up. I wished I found this first instead of going through all the other products that claim to clear up breakouts. This is definitely a staple product for me. Multani Mati is a key ingredient to healthy and clear skin.</li>
            <li> Have only used it two times and can notice the difference when applying mask add 1 tsp Turmeric powder, 1 tsp rose water and I personally like to use apple cider vinegar ( I don&#x27;t apply a certain amount just add some but not to much so mask won&#x27;t be to watery) as well due to the fact that my acne is mild to severe. Leave mask on for about 10 min and use a moisturizer afterwards. Just to warn you use gloves or a brush to apply mask because your finger nails will turn yellow if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did not see improvement in my complexion when I used this religiously (even mixed it with essential oils, manuka honey and/or rose water). It did however tie-dye some of my laundry bright yellow. One spec was all it took to ruin a couple articles of clothing. It is not easy preventing a mess being made when mixing/rinsing/storing this product. I think the color of it and it&#x27;s instant liquefacation upon coming in contact with water adds to the difficulty. I suppose I&#x27;m in the minority; works for some, does not work for others.</li>
            <li> cleans pores like no other</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth when I use it but it doesn&#x27;t last for much long.  I mixed it using rose water which is suppose to work better, but so far it hasn&#x27;t done the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I use it with coconut oil and my skin is finally clear. tried everything, and my coworker told me about this and it is a miracle product. Seller was fast too! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> It was the packaging that I was not pleased with.  The envelope which contained the box because it was not insulated the box was badly damaged fortunately for me the contents did not burst and spill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the product could have been placed in an insulated envelope or perhaps a box, no one wants to receive a package and have the entire contents spill out onto them which again could have happened in transit.</li>
            <li> I use Hesh Multani Mati to make mud masks. The texture is wonderful, there&#x27;s no offensive scent, and my complexion looks great! I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I loved this as a mask.  Just add water, rose water, cucumber water or milk to powder.  Apply thin layer to skin.  Let dry (15-20 minutes) and then rinse with warm water then cool.  Apply favorite moisturizer (mine is coconut oil).  This powder (as a mask) smooths, brightens, and gets rid of acne.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It is good, but I have used a better one before, don&#x27;t remember that brand name. Would appreciate if anyone suggest me a better one.</li>
            <li> I have used this before in India and when I ordered it, I was not sure if it will be the same. It is and I got the expected result after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I mix it with Dr Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap and rub the resulting past on the inflamed areas. If I leave it one for a few minutes there is an OBVIOUS improvement when I wash it off. Love love LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I have encorporated it into my skin care regimen  and notice a softness in skin texture. I use it twice a week and would recommend. The only downside is the smell but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Just used it once till now and as of now it is good and I have no complains. So far so good</li>
            <li> I used rose water to mix the mask into a paste as suggested by other users. However after rinsing the mask off a few hours later my skin turned an instant tan orange. It has taken over two scrubbing sessions to remove most of the orange skin. Stick to another mask.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;mix it with rose water and use it as a mask/scrub.&lt;br /&gt;my face glows after i rinse.</li>
            <li> I moved to Georgia at the end of July, and since day one my skin has been rebelling. The water here is so hard and chlorinated that my once flawless, even a tad oily skin has been dry and flaky, my pores wide open, and I&#x27;ve developed a  serious case of whiteheads on my chin that has left that area and around my mouth darker than the rest of my face. In the last 3 months I&#x27;ve probably gone through as many skincare routines and nothing has helped. I was skyping with a friend in Mumbai, and he mentioned it so after reading the glowing reviews on Amazon, decided to get it. I used it for the first time tonight, and I promise that I&#x27;m not lying when I say that I noticed an immediate difference in my skin. It had a glow that has been missing for the last few months, and the texture looks and feels better. Only time will tell if these are continuous benefits, but I&#x27;m excited to find out. I mixed with a small amount of sandalwood powder and milk to make a thin mixture, which I then left on for 10 minutes. I&#x27;d encourage anyone on the fence to go ahead and try this, even though it&#x27;s going to take commitment to do this everyday, but it seems, so far, that the benefits will most definitely outweigh whatever work you have to put into making the mixture daily.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been great! I have used it about twice per week for about 3 weeks. It seems to leave my skin feeling balanced (not oily or dry) and fresh. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause dryness. After applying, leave it on until it dries and then wash it off. Some people commented on it coloring their skin, but I never had that problem. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping with pimples at all, but it is deifinitely not causing any.</li>
            <li> I used it with water, I used it with milk. It works well with any. It is very fine powder, very soft. I would buy again from the seller. Now I am looking for Hesh Sandal Powder, but I do not find it. This Multani Mati is good for both Dry as well as Oily Skin. Only you need to choose Water or Milk.</li>
