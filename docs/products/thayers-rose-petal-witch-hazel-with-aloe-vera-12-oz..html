            <li>By far, this is the best Witch Hazel I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I bought more to share with mom and sister in law since they liked it too when they tried it.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice as well, and I feel like my oil is more under control since I started using it</li>
            <li>I also like the lavender toner, but rose is my favorite.</li>

            <li>I use it every night and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial toner I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also refreshing to spritz some on when coming in from being out in the heat.</li>
            <li>Love this refreshing toner.</li>
            <li>I used this product many years ago but could not find it in any drug stores.</li>
            <li>I love Thayers toners.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for in a face cleaner?  </li>
            <li>This is the  WH I use as an ingredient in many homemade products, never again will I use whatever you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of roses and it is so soothing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing because they love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 months now and my face and skin is significantly better.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the smell of roses.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The smell alone is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve used it more than just one, but I have to say, I&#x27;m already hooked.</li>
            <li>I bought rose petal toner because aloe vera wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how many of this I&#x27;ve bought, never disappoint me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even better.  </li>
            <li>Love this toner.</li>
            <li>Awesome scent too, a definite must from now on! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>About a week in (during the most humid time of year</li>
            <li>I got even more breakouts..</li>
            <li>but like the smell and feel :)</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle from SB Naturals (seller) and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I began using the product, originally purchased for rosacea (works there too!)</li>
            <li>I just got this today and was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, safe packaging and good value.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing after a good slick shave with a safety razor, and the rose petal scent/extract has a wonderful, yet completely gender-neutral scent.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is very gentle, nice smelling product and a pretty good deal too.</li>
            <li>This amazing scent with it&#x27;s skin softening and moisturising properties comes freshly squeezed from the tear ducts of angels</li>
            <li>I use it more as a light perfume than toner</li>
            <li>Love this product, the fragrance is beautiful, my face feels so clean after each use, will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>Can not say enough good about this solution!</li>
            <li>My first time using this kind, recommended by a friend</li>
            <li>Very good toner for sensitive skin, after used feel very refresh!</li>
            <li>I also feel positive about Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal product since it doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemically-strong toner.</li>
            <li>Light and cleansing without drying</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li>Wonder rose fragrance, gentle make-up remover, skin toner.  </li>
            <li>system he came up with has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using papaya soap as a primary cleanser in the shower and coconut oil as an end-of-the-day cleanser.</li>
            <li>so I just used it under my eyes (not like I get wrinkles lol ) and use it on my eyebrows simply just for the moisture.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the soft some of rose.  </li>
            <li>This makes your face feel so soft and smooth and it is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Reduced my acne significantly .</li>
            <li>Great value and not harsh like pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Smells glorious and leaves my skin squeaky clean without dryness.</li>
            <li>my skin feels clean</li>
            <li>or so (I&#x27;ve been told some people can still smell the hint of rose every once in a while at work) and my skin is ridiculously soft and comfortable after a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, don&#x27;t be thrown off by the pink label, women love this scent on you (unless they have allergies that get irritated by roses).</li>
            <li>It does not leave my skin feeling dry, and is great for morning cleansing or anytime</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all skin types and won&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I spritz some on after washing my face and it moisturizes so no need to use a special moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite of all the toners out there.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to purchase this because it&#x27;s so good for the skin</li>
            <li>I have been attempting to find a good shaving routine for about 50 years and finally arrived at one.</li>
            <li>Quick ship.  </li>
            <li>Following a perfect shave (with the above-mentioned encoutrements), my post-shave routine; tiny pool of Thayer&#x27;s in one hand, spread amongst both palms, then applied breezily to all shaved areas of the face....will ensure no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;&#x27; feeling or irritation.  </li>
            <li>If I have to get up at night I grab a quick pad with Thayers and use it.  </li>
            <li>I even tried adding some lavender and tea tree essential oil to a bottle, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help and masked the rose smell I enjoy.</li>
            <li>only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle around the eyes, ( no burning), easily removes residual mascara without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty, too!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li>I use this after cleansing and it helps with getting off any final makeup residue, although there isn&#x27;t much of that as I use a good soap.</li>
            <li>It feels powerful but all toners are like that.</li>
            <li>This is alcohol free, lightly scented with natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Now when I apply I take the cap off completely and put a cotton ball on top as you would with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s Aloe Vera and Rose Witch Hazel for several years</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Cleanses, reduces redness, smells nice and is super refreshing, especially if you&#x27;ve had a long day and need a cool off.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I cleanse my face</li>
            <li>each day after waking up and right before bed.</li>
            <li>I am very blemish-y and toner helps even my complexion and keep my face clean.</li>
            <li>really leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed without over drying and even seems to help a bit with acne.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice way to clean my face/cool down.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin nicely hydrated and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin while toning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and with it being an organic product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have adopted this routine, I find that I have a very very close shave and</li>
            <li>It smells like roses, minimizes my pores, and leaves my skin soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Hot Water, check.  </li>
            <li>but if I run out of my favorite, I&#x27;ll definitely use this in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li>This is a  toner for everyone from the driest skin to very oily skin!  </li>
            <li>The first bottle seemed to vanish</li>
            <li>Some of them seemed to work at first</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li>I have been using Thayers as a facial toner for many years.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Skin is more even and pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>Skin loves it; glows, is soft and kept ph balanced and blemish free.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>The delivery was pretty fast</li>
            <li>I have  been using this item for many years (8+)  and must say that it plays a role in keeping my skin (combination - dry) well moisturized and very youthful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s products for a couple of weeks now, and I really enjoy the scent, feel, and overall skin results.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the time, it never feels like I&#x27;m really doing anything</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t seem to need a moisturizer much anymore.east 2 disposable pads.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t seem to need a moisturizer much anymore.</li>
            <li>Who knew there would be so much added fragrance?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and won&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li>Now I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and actually have better, smoother skin using a regime of totally natural and inexpensive products.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and ready for the moisturizer I use next.</li>
            <li>I was using Clinique&#x27;s #2 toner on my face, which works pretty well on my oily skin (mostly combo) face, but this product feels less drying!</li>
            <li>I like this stuff fine, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not the miracle for me that it seems to be for other people.</li>
            <li>It also left a cool, almost tingly feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>and I suffered more acne in the last 2 years than I ever did as a teen.</li>
            <li>If I do break out I use several times a day and it dries them out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall liked the price compared to other places and no concerns with quality.</li>
            <li>Better for my sensitive skin then the peach am going to try the other fragranced ones aswell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the other Thayer fragranced Witch Hazel products but the scents were too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin cannot handle it -- it really broke me out.</li>
            <li>smooth surface other people kept askong what I did to face thoufht microabrasions and treatments</li>
            <li>I have even had friends ask me what new perfume</li>
            <li>Break outs are less and when I do they are easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>Subtle rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is subtle and the alcohol-free formula feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>I only got the two pack because it was a new product for me, but will buy more in the future (though I probably won&#x27;t run out for several months).</li>
            <li>worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>this product did not dry my skin, is gentle.</li>
            <li>It is a good affordable toner I would buy again in a few years because this thing will last a long time.</li>
            <li>but her face is clear now too.</li>
            <li>This was my solution for balancing trouble skin with wanting a toxic free environment.</li>
            <li>Barbasol Sensitive Skin Shave Cream, check.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and really think it&#x27;s necessary after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a dedicated oil cleanser for over two years now, but I wanted something to help improve my pores and (hopefully) clear up my acne without completely drying my face out.</li>
            <li>The smell makes me feel so classy.</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>but within a few days of using it just gives my skin that extra healthy boost.</li>
            <li>Good product - a bit expensive</li>
            <li>My wife loves the scent on me after a fresh shave, I assume it picks up some of the scent of my shaving soap which combines to enhance and balance each other out.</li>
            <li>I really like how this stuff smells like roses and how it makes my face feel soft but other than that I&#x27;m not seeing any new or  drastic change on my face&#x27;s skin texture.....</li>
            <li>Went back to my normal witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Smell is a little bit stronger when applied but disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>Store bought commercial WH has alcohol in it which may defeat the purpose of natural remedies.  </li>
            <li>It did an okay job clearing acne for awhile, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I tried it with this item and it really did work extremely well.</li>
            <li>(Other favorites include Dr. Woods Shea Vision soap, Acure Organics Brightening Facial Scrub, Kiss My Face Olive &amp; Aloe lotion, and Burts Bees Intense Hydration eye cream).</li>
            <li>It hasnt appeared to clear up any acne (which I&#x27;ve had constantly for 15 yrs), but my pores are noticeably smaller and my overall tone /</li>

            <li> it never dries out your skin, smells wonderful, and really gets all the makeup, dirt and oil off.</li>
            <li> Truly smells of rose.</li>
            <li> My husband even liked it and he doesn&#x27;t like the smell of roses.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is moisturizing; not overly drying like most witch hazels.  </li>
            <li> And it smells nice, too.</li>

            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this product seems to work great!</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best Witch Hazel I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I bought more to share with mom and sister in law since they liked it too when they tried it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice as well, and I feel like my oil is more under control since I started using it</li>
            <li> I also like the lavender toner, but rose is my favorite.</li>

            <li> I love love love it!  </li>

            <li> Glad I bought two bottles :)</li>
            <li> I use it every night and love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial toner I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also refreshing to spritz some on when coming in from being out in the heat.</li>
            <li> Love this refreshing toner.</li>
            <li> I used this product many years ago but could not find it in any drug stores.</li>
            <li> I love Thayers toners.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for in a face cleaner?  </li>
            <li> This is the  WH I use as an ingredient in many homemade products, never again will I use whatever you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of roses and it is so soothing on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing because they love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 months now and my face and skin is significantly better.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the smell of roses.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s made here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve used it more than just one, but I have to say, I&#x27;m already hooked.</li>
            <li> I bought rose petal toner because aloe vera wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how many of this I&#x27;ve bought, never disappoint me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even better.  </li>
            <li> Love this toner.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent too, a definite must from now on! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> About a week in (during the most humid time of year</li>
            <li> I got even more breakouts..</li>
            <li> but like the smell and feel :)</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle from SB Naturals (seller) and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I began using the product, originally purchased for rosacea (works there too!)</li>
            <li> I just got this today and was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, safe packaging and good value.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing after a good slick shave with a safety razor, and the rose petal scent/extract has a wonderful, yet completely gender-neutral scent.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is very gentle, nice smelling product and a pretty good deal too.</li>
            <li> This amazing scent with it&#x27;s skin softening and moisturising properties comes freshly squeezed from the tear ducts of angels</li>
            <li> I use it more as a light perfume than toner</li>
            <li> Love this product, the fragrance is beautiful, my face feels so clean after each use, will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Can not say enough good about this solution!</li>
            <li> My first time using this kind, recommended by a friend</li>
            <li> Very good toner for sensitive skin, after used feel very refresh!</li>
            <li> I also feel positive about Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal product since it doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemically-strong toner.</li>
            <li> Light and cleansing without drying</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li> Wonder rose fragrance, gentle make-up remover, skin toner.  </li>
            <li> system he came up with has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using papaya soap as a primary cleanser in the shower and coconut oil as an end-of-the-day cleanser.</li>
            <li> so I just used it under my eyes (not like I get wrinkles lol ) and use it on my eyebrows simply just for the moisture.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the soft some of rose.  </li>
            <li> This makes your face feel so soft and smooth and it is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Reduced my acne significantly .</li>
            <li> Great value and not harsh like pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Smells glorious and leaves my skin squeaky clean without dryness.</li>
            <li> my skin feels clean</li>
            <li> or so (I&#x27;ve been told some people can still smell the hint of rose every once in a while at work) and my skin is ridiculously soft and comfortable after a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, don&#x27;t be thrown off by the pink label, women love this scent on you (unless they have allergies that get irritated by roses).</li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin feeling dry, and is great for morning cleansing or anytime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all skin types and won&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I spritz some on after washing my face and it moisturizes so no need to use a special moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Sweet smell.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite of all the toners out there.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to purchase this because it&#x27;s so good for the skin</li>
            <li> I have been attempting to find a good shaving routine for about 50 years and finally arrived at one.</li>
            <li> Quick ship.  </li>
            <li> Following a perfect shave (with the above-mentioned encoutrements), my post-shave routine; tiny pool of Thayer&#x27;s in one hand, spread amongst both palms, then applied breezily to all shaved areas of the face....will ensure no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;&#x27; feeling or irritation.  </li>
            <li> If I have to get up at night I grab a quick pad with Thayers and use it.  </li>
            <li> I even tried adding some lavender and tea tree essential oil to a bottle, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help and masked the rose smell I enjoy.</li>
            <li> only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle around the eyes, ( no burning), easily removes residual mascara without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty, too!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li> I use this after cleansing and it helps with getting off any final makeup residue, although there isn&#x27;t much of that as I use a good soap.</li>
            <li> It feels powerful but all toners are like that.</li>
            <li> This is alcohol free, lightly scented with natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Now when I apply I take the cap off completely and put a cotton ball on top as you would with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s Aloe Vera and Rose Witch Hazel for several years</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Cleanses, reduces redness, smells nice and is super refreshing, especially if you&#x27;ve had a long day and need a cool off.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I cleanse my face</li>
            <li> each day after waking up and right before bed.</li>
            <li> I am very blemish-y and toner helps even my complexion and keep my face clean.</li>
            <li> really leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed without over drying and even seems to help a bit with acne.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice way to clean my face/cool down.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin nicely hydrated and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin while toning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and with it being an organic product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have adopted this routine, I find that I have a very very close shave and</li>
            <li> It smells like roses, minimizes my pores, and leaves my skin soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Hot Water, check.  </li>
            <li> but if I run out of my favorite, I&#x27;ll definitely use this in it&#x27;s place.  </li>
            <li> This is a  toner for everyone from the driest skin to very oily skin!  </li>
            <li> The first bottle seemed to vanish</li>
            <li> Some of them seemed to work at first</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth but not oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Thayers as a facial toner for many years.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Skin is more even and pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> Skin loves it; glows, is soft and kept ph balanced and blemish free.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> The delivery was pretty fast</li>
            <li> I have  been using this item for many years (8+)  and must say that it plays a role in keeping my skin (combination - dry) well moisturized and very youthful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s products for a couple of weeks now, and I really enjoy the scent, feel, and overall skin results.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> the time, it never feels like I&#x27;m really doing anything</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t seem to need a moisturizer much anymore.east 2 disposable pads.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t seem to need a moisturizer much anymore.</li>
            <li> Who knew there would be so much added fragrance?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and won&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li> Now I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and actually have better, smoother skin using a regime of totally natural and inexpensive products.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and ready for the moisturizer I use next.</li>
            <li> I was using Clinique&#x27;s #2 toner on my face, which works pretty well on my oily skin (mostly combo) face, but this product feels less drying!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff fine, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not the miracle for me that it seems to be for other people.</li>
            <li> It also left a cool, almost tingly feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> and I suffered more acne in the last 2 years than I ever did as a teen.</li>
            <li> If I do break out I use several times a day and it dries them out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall liked the price compared to other places and no concerns with quality.</li>
            <li> Better for my sensitive skin then the peach am going to try the other fragranced ones aswell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other Thayer fragranced Witch Hazel products but the scents were too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin cannot handle it -- it really broke me out.</li>
            <li> smooth surface other people kept askong what I did to face thoufht microabrasions and treatments</li>
            <li> I have even had friends ask me what new perfume</li>
            <li> Break outs are less and when I do they are easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Subtle rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is subtle and the alcohol-free formula feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li> I only got the two pack because it was a new product for me, but will buy more in the future (though I probably won&#x27;t run out for several months).</li>
            <li> worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> this product did not dry my skin, is gentle.</li>
            <li> It is a good affordable toner I would buy again in a few years because this thing will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but her face is clear now too.</li>
            <li> This was my solution for balancing trouble skin with wanting a toxic free environment.</li>
            <li> Barbasol Sensitive Skin Shave Cream, check.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and really think it&#x27;s necessary after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated oil cleanser for over two years now, but I wanted something to help improve my pores and (hopefully) clear up my acne without completely drying my face out.</li>
            <li> The smell makes me feel so classy.</li>
            <li> natural</li>
            <li> but within a few days of using it just gives my skin that extra healthy boost.</li>
            <li> Good product - a bit expensive</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent on me after a fresh shave, I assume it picks up some of the scent of my shaving soap which combines to enhance and balance each other out.</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff smells like roses and how it makes my face feel soft but other than that I&#x27;m not seeing any new or  drastic change on my face&#x27;s skin texture.....</li>
            <li> Went back to my normal witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little bit stronger when applied but disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> Store bought commercial WH has alcohol in it which may defeat the purpose of natural remedies.  </li>
            <li> It did an okay job clearing acne for awhile, but not great.  </li>
            <li> I tried it with this item and it really did work extremely well.</li>
            <li> (Other favorites include Dr. Woods Shea Vision soap, Acure Organics Brightening Facial Scrub, Kiss My Face Olive &amp; Aloe lotion, and Burts Bees Intense Hydration eye cream).</li>
            <li> It hasnt appeared to clear up any acne (which I&#x27;ve had constantly for 15 yrs), but my pores are noticeably smaller and my overall tone /</li>
            <li> In a little over two months the red marks are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> (same toner but a little bit different graphics in the packaging print), smells different (mine smells like flowers, theirs smelled like the &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; liquid) and it feels different on the skin too..</li>
            <li> The rose scent is very subtle and hardly noticeable....</li>
            <li> They helped but were never able to return my face and skin to normal.</li>
            <li> I use it after washing my face so my face soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> No flaking from dry skin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x60;t leave you with that dry puckered feeling to your skin.  </li>
            <li> it always comes well wrapped and has never leaked a single drop.</li>
            <li> My face has become less red upon use and it has kept blemishes away!  </li>
            <li> and if I do get a blemish it seems to heal faster and is less likely to leave a mark on my skin.</li>
            <li> My pores do seem smaller and I seem to have less blackheads.</li>
            <li> My face would be dry as a bone for 2 weeks and slick with oil the next 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Your facial skin will feel revitalized in a way that normal cold water (closing of the pores) simply cannot accomplish.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the tightness like with some other things.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face properly, I wipe off my face with a makeup remover cloth and follow with a cotton pad soaked in this</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of witch hazel with alcohol</li>
            <li> I wipe one side of my face with one side then flip it and use the other side.</li>
            <li> I wipe one side of my face with one side then flip it and use the other side.</li>
            <li> We did the whole ProActiv thing for years, and it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> I break out less</li>
            <li> Acne 95% to 98% gone and breakouts less frequency.  </li>
            <li> and my face seems less oily</li>
            <li> BEWARE, you might get fake item even from sellers that are highly rated/ recommended.</li>
            <li> Though, I thought a box AND internal plastic wrapping was a little unnecessary and wasteful.</li>
            <li> Antibiotics are not a good long term solution though.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for probably 10 years.</li>
            <li> and it dried up my sister and mom&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> mine moisturizes, but the 2 pack from seller Oxcom dried up our skin.</li>
            <li> She was having trouble with acne also</li>
            <li> but they just dried my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days morning and night.</li>
            <li> every time i use it i see rashes in few hours</li>
            <li> In my 20&#x27;s I wasted hundreds of dollars on expensive skin care brands including various acne control and anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> I might put some in a little spray bottle to keep in my purse!</li>
            <li> I use it day and night when I wear makeup and on the lazy days where I don&#x27;t put my face on</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or leave a residue and the scent usually dissipates around 10-20 minutes</li>
            <li> It helps get any extra makeup off my face and tones without the uncomfortable tightening/drying you get from toners with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to</li>
            <li> put it in the category of a small miracle.</li>
            <li> On spots where I had tried to dry out a painful zit the skin was dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;Thayers</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds if not more between facials and expensive products for my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IMPORTANT- at each use I use at least 2 disposable pads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep you from breaking out or suffering from razor burn (if you still use those terrible cartridge razors... your grandfather is ashamed) and it makes baby smooth shaven skin</li>
            <li> not good for oily spot prone skin period..</li>
            <li> I have purchased this toner several times before and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I stay away from unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> but it still irritates my eczema unfortunately, therefore I&#x27;m unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Iwe can both now go out with out make up and don&#x27;t feel bad about our skin anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works great!  And I love the smell</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for years. Leaves your skin feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li> L use the product on my face before I moisturize.  I love the soft some of rose.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, the fragrance is beautiful, my face feels so clean after each use, will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> This is the best toner/face cleaner ever. it never dries out your skin, smells wonderful, and really gets all the makeup, dirt and oil off.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this product. Truly smells of rose. I use this as a toner for my face in the morning and absolutely LOVE it! Glad I bought two bottles :)</li>
            <li> I love the product!!! I will only use this as a toner</li>
            <li> I love this stuff &amp;  the 2 pack was a deal!  Sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great!</li>
            <li> I use it every night and love it.  Smells heavenly, no alcohol, and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on using it as my toner for life (please never stop making this)! I use this after cleansing and it helps with getting off any final makeup residue, although there isn&#x27;t much of that as I use a good soap. It smells like roses, minimizes my pores, and leaves my skin soft and smooth feeling. In my 20&#x27;s I wasted hundreds of dollars on expensive skin care brands including various acne control and anti-aging products. Now I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and actually have better, smoother skin using a regime of totally natural and inexpensive products. (Other favorites include Dr. Woods Shea Vision soap, Acure Organics Brightening Facial Scrub, Kiss My Face Olive &amp; Aloe lotion, and Burts Bees Intense Hydration eye cream).</li>
            <li> i like a item.&lt;br /&gt;good.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! The price for package of two was good. Will re-order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s products for a couple of weeks now, and I really enjoy the scent, feel, and overall skin results. I was using Clinique&#x27;s #2 toner on my face, which works pretty well on my oily skin (mostly combo) face, but this product feels less drying! I also feel positive about Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal product since it doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemically-strong toner. My husband even liked it and he doesn&#x27;t like the smell of roses.</li>
            <li> love it; have been using for years!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial toner I have ever used!  Gentle around the eyes, ( no burning), easily removes residual mascara without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used it everyday for probably 10 years. I use it after washing my face so my face soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel w/Aloe &amp; Rose Petal Toner. I spritz some on after washing my face and it moisturizes so no need to use a special moisturizer. It&#x27;s also refreshing to spritz some on when coming in from being out in the heat. Great product!</li>
            <li> great scent. I use it more as a light perfume than toner</li>
            <li> Just as described and received on time!</li>
            <li> Product was as described. My first time using this kind, recommended by a friend and I&#x27;m very glad I got it. Smells wonderful and works. Not drying at all, I&#x27;m fair and oily skin. I didn&#x27;t feel the tightness like with some other things. It was uplifting actually. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s intended. Felt good about the ingredients too. I stay away from unnecessary chemicals. This was my solution for balancing trouble skin with wanting a toxic free environment. Happy so far for sure! Though, I thought a box AND internal plastic wrapping was a little unnecessary and wasteful. Overall liked the price compared to other places and no concerns with quality. Thanks</li>
            <li> It feels powerful but all toners are like that. Doesn&#x27;t leave and redness or anything but does leave my face with a shine after a while. It is a good affordable toner I would buy again in a few years because this thing will last a long time. Especially that it came in two.</li>
            <li> This is great! I use it on my face every night! I highly recommend. I am very blemish-y and toner helps even my complexion and keep my face clean. I also have sensitive skin and this product seems to work great!</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite toner ever! It&#x27;s affordable and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. I put it on right after I cleanse my face and before I put my serum on.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best Witch Hazel I have ever used.  It smells good and is moisturizing; not overly drying like most witch hazels.  I definitely saw a difference in my skin after using this.  My face is cleaner and even my pores seem to have shrunk.  The delivery was pretty fast and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I would order again, however I found that they sell this at my local Vitamin Shoppe, so I will order from there for now on to avoid shipping fees.</li>
            <li> Subtle rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it as part of my aftershave routine and also put some in my hair (along with jojoba oil).</li>
            <li> Love this refreshing toner. It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> one of the best priced effective products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love to use this as my toner, work amazing and smells great.  Very fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Came as promised, two to a pack. Smells glorious and leaves my skin squeaky clean without dryness. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My complexion has improved dramatically. I order this item once a month. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product many years ago but could not find it in any drug stores. It smells great &amp; is on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Helped control my breakouts and evened my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love Thayers toners. I used to use drugstore toners that had alcohol in them and they don&#x27;t do your skin any favors. This toner smells great and reduces the redness on my face.</li>
            <li> Light and cleansing without drying</li>
            <li> Great value and not harsh like pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I have had a diabetes-related skin rash on my forearms for years. Doctors were stumped about what to do. I began using the product, originally purchased for rosacea (works there too!) on my arms and the rash began to disappear. In a little over two months the red marks are almost completely gone.  And it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin while toning.  Of all of the witch hazels, this one was recommended by my daughter who is an aesthetician.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Very refreshing, soothing to my skin. I gave one to my daughter and she is as happy with her bottle as I am with mine.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.  Quick ship.  Quality product.  Wonder rose fragrance, gentle make-up remover, skin toner.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My son had this, of all things! When we stayed with him, I tried it. Then I bought some for myself. Great toner at a great price.</li>
            <li> Better for my sensitive skin then the peach am going to try the other fragranced ones aswell</li>
            <li> Gilette Trac 2 Sensor, check. Gilette Mach 3 Turbo, check.  Barbasol Sensitive Skin Shave Cream, check.  Hot Water, check.  Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with Aloe, Rose Petal Toner, CHECK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel concoction is on my list of Shaving Essentials.  Following a perfect shave (with the above-mentioned encoutrements), my post-shave routine; tiny pool of Thayer&#x27;s in one hand, spread amongst both palms, then applied breezily to all shaved areas of the face....will ensure no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;&#x27; feeling or irritation.  Your facial skin will feel revitalized in a way that normal cold water (closing of the pores) simply cannot accomplish.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years as part of my post-shave routine and it is something I simply cannot do without.  Thank you, Thayer&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this witch hazel to use with essential oils in my skin care and for hand sanitizer.  The smell is beautiful and it works great!  I have a toner that I already adore which is why I haven&#x27;t used this as a toner...but if I run out of my favorite, I&#x27;ll definitely use this in it&#x27;s place.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this product and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My face has become less red upon use and it has kept blemishes away!  I use it day and night when I wear makeup and on the lazy days where I don&#x27;t put my face on I use it whenever my skin feels oily ^.^</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for in a face cleaner?  This is alcohol free, lightly scented with natural oils.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This makes your face feel so soft and smooth and it is very refreshing.  And the price is great for the amount of product you get.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> My favorite toner of all time! Reduced my acne significantly .</li>
            <li> Very good toner for sensitive skin, after used feel very refresh! Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is the witch hazel you want to purchase and use with homemade products and even by itself.  Store bought commercial WH has alcohol in it which may defeat the purpose of natural remedies.  This is the  WH I use as an ingredient in many homemade products, never again will I use whatever you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Miracle water all my life nothing clears skin this does and minimize pores smooth surface other people kept askong what I did to face thoufht microabrasions and treatments I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> what a great product. it smells clean and ethereal, very effective.  I am a regular customer now.  my skin feels clean</li>
            <li> Quick ship, great price!</li>
            <li> excellent product. a bit pricey, but, i like the smell and their aint another brand cheaper, that i can find.</li>
            <li> I have  been using this item for many years (8+)  and must say that it plays a role in keeping my skin (combination - dry) well moisturized and very youthful. Somehow the addition of this to my beauty care regimen in summer or winter shows improvement fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, it never feels like I&#x27;m really doing anything but within a few days of using it just gives my skin that extra healthy boost. If it wasn&#x27;t for this item, I would never ever use a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I read a recipe in a magazine to mix witch hazel with mouthwash in order to cleanse the scalp. I tried it with this item and it really did work extremely well. It&#x27;s an all purpose cleansing item.</li>
            <li> This is a  toner for everyone from the driest skin to very oily skin!  It is so soothing, gives your skin the refreshment it needs without, any of the harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  It is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> smells nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> It makes a great year-round toner. In the summer I keep a bottle in the fridge and it&#x27;s a nice way to clean my face/cool down. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other Thayer fragranced Witch Hazel products but the scents were too strong for my liking. This one is subtle and the alcohol-free formula feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great. Best moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite of all the toners out there. When I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face properly, I wipe off my face with a makeup remover cloth and follow with a cotton pad soaked in this and it takes off all remaining.... stuff. Cleanses, reduces redness, smells nice and is super refreshing, especially if you&#x27;ve had a long day and need a cool off. I use this every day and really think it&#x27;s necessary after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I LOVE this stuff!  It smells amazing and does great things for your skin.  Southern Girls know!!!  Anytime I&#x27;ve ordered it (I can&#x27;t find it locally) it always comes well wrapped and has never leaked a single drop.</li>
            <li> Can not say enough good about this solution! I love love love it!  Sensitive skin?  No problem! It&#x27;s very refreshing and soothing!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle from SB Naturals (seller) and I loved it. I bought more to share with mom and sister in law since they liked it too when they tried it. My second purchase was a 2 pack from seller Oxcom..and it dried up my sister and mom&#x27;s skin. They stopped using it and passed it over to me.  We realized it was different from the one I have when I started using it (same toner but a little bit different graphics in the packaging print), smells different (mine smells like flowers, theirs smelled like the &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; liquid) and it feels different on the skin too..mine moisturizes, but the 2 pack from seller Oxcom dried up our skin. BEWARE, you might get fake item even from sellers that are highly rated/ recommended.</li>
            <li> Must have in my daily facial regime!</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It makes my skin nicely hydrated and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and night. It is hydrating and helps to soothe my skin. I break out less and if I do get a blemish it seems to heal faster and is less likely to leave a mark on my skin. I&#x27;m 36 and have combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third bottle in 8 months. The first bottle seemed to vanish but I was losing a lot of the product during application. Now when I apply I take the cap off completely and put a cotton ball on top as you would with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> This is divine!  Love the smell of roses and it is so soothing on the skin.  My husband came home with a sunburn just in time to try this and it worked great!  Thanks for a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> good product, moisture well and absorb quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and I suffered more acne in the last 2 years than I ever did as a teen. I have spent hundreds if not more between facials and expensive products for my face. Some of them seemed to work at first but then my face almost seemed worsted than before. My doctor even gave me antibiotics. I took them for a month and then stopped taking them. They helped but were never able to return my face and skin to normal. I suffered from a lot of deep acne along my jaw line. My nose and cheeks just hurt all the time. I changed my diet and washed my pillow case 2 times a week and changed laundry soaps. My face would be dry as a bone for 2 weeks and slick with oil the next 2 weeks.  On spots where I had tried to dry out a painful zit the skin was dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;Thayers rose petal Witch Hazel with aloe Vera has worked better than everything !  I use it several times a day. If I have to get up at night I grab a quick pad with Thayers and use it.  My skin feels the same every day now. Soft and smooth but not oily. No flaking from dry skin. Break outs are less and when I do they are easy to deal with. My pores do seem smaller and I seem to have less blackheads. It smells wonderful to me. I have even had friends ask me what new perfume I&#x27;m wearing because they love it.  My youngest daughter who is 17 uses it all the time now also. She was having trouble with acne also but her face is clear now too. Iwe can both now go out with out make up and don&#x27;t feel bad about our skin anymore. I have been using it for about 2 months now and my face and skin is significantly better. Acne 95% to 98% gone and breakouts less frequency.  If I do break out I use several times a day and it dries them out quickly.  Before I would big red lumps or welts under my skin that could take a week or longer before they went away.&lt;br /&gt;* I have used other brands of witch hazel with alcohol but they just dried my skin and it didn&#x27;t show any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT- at each use I use at least 2 disposable pads. I wipe one side of my face with one side then flip it and use the other side. When my face dries. I do it again. I don&#x27;t want to smear the oil and dirt the pad picked up.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I also don&#x27;t seem to need a moisturizer much anymore.east 2 disposable pads. I wipe one side of my face with one side then flip it and use the other side. When my face dries. I do it again. I don&#x27;t want to smear the oil and dirt the pad picked up.

            <li> This amazing scent with it&#x27;s skin softening and moisturising properties comes freshly squeezed from the tear ducts of angels*. Currently, I use this as an after shave skin care, and it has worked wonders. It feels amazing after a good slick shave with a safety razor, and the rose petal scent/extract has a wonderful, yet completely gender-neutral scent. My wife loves the scent on me after a fresh shave, I assume it picks up some of the scent of my shaving soap which combines to enhance and balance each other out. She also uses it as a toner (no way!) each day after waking up and right before bed. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or leave a residue and the scent usually dissipates around 10-20 minutes or so (I&#x27;ve been told some people can still smell the hint of rose every once in a while at work) and my skin is ridiculously soft and comfortable after a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, don&#x27;t be thrown off by the pink label, women love this scent on you (unless they have allergies that get irritated by roses). It&#x27;ll keep you from breaking out or suffering from razor burn (if you still use those terrible cartridge razors... your grandfather is ashamed) and it makes baby smooth shaven skin even softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Also, no angels were hurt in the making of this product.</li>
            <li> We did the whole ProActiv thing for years, and it was expensive.  It did an okay job clearing acne for awhile, but not great.  My son did a ton of &amp;#34;research&amp;#34; on the internet trying to find alternatives to antibiotics/ProActiv.  (He had such severe acne that he was on antibiotics for years.  Antibiotics are not a good long term solution though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system he came up with has been fantastic.  It&#x27;s complicated and involves many different products from different places, but it has worked miracles on his face and back.  This is the step he uses which replaces ProActiv Step 2.  My girls are now on his system and they like this product too.</li>
            <li> Must buy!!! Good for your skin, great scent! :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it! Nice way to hydrate and tone face; I transfer to a spray bottle which I use to spray on my face.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff fine, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not the miracle for me that it seems to be for other people. It helps get any extra makeup off my face and tones without the uncomfortable tightening/drying you get from toners with alcohol. The smell is nice as well, and I feel like my oil is more under control since I started using it (I am on my second bottle). However, I had breakouts when I started using it, and still definitely do. I even tried adding some lavender and tea tree essential oil to a bottle, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help and masked the rose smell I enjoy. Not a miracle cure for acne for me I&#x27;m afraid! I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days morning and night. It hasnt appeared to clear up any acne (which I&#x27;ve had constantly for 15 yrs), but my pores are noticeably smaller and my overall tone / eveness has improved. Plus, I love the smell of roses.</li>
            <li> I have been using Thayers as a facial toner for many years. It leaves my skin clean and ready for the moisturizer I use next.</li>
            <li> I love this as a toner!  It freshens my skin and collects excess dirt and oil without drying.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting.</li>
            <li> This toner is very nice....it doesn&#x60;t leave you with that dry puckered feeling to your skin.  The rose scent is very subtle and hardly noticeable....which is a good thing in my mind.  I can&#x60;t say I&#x60;m WOWED by it, but I&#x60;ve always used good skin care products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is alcohol free but it still irritates my eczema unfortunately, therefore I&#x27;m unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works (no alcohol) &amp; how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Very good product!! This is Third time we ordered it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product. Will purchase again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It does not leave my skin feeling dry, and is great for morning cleansing or anytime you need to feel refreshed throughout the day. The pleasant rose scent of the product is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s Aloe Vera and Rose Witch Hazel for several years and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. It tones without drying. I have very sensitive skin and eyes and it never burns. I use it to remove makeup too. I also like the lavender toner, but rose is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and was so excited to use it! I&#x27;ve been a dedicated oil cleanser for over two years now, but I wanted something to help improve my pores and (hopefully) clear up my acne without completely drying my face out. The second I used this stuff, I was hooked! The smell alone is fantastic! It also left a cool, almost tingly feeling on my face. I love that it&#x27;s made here in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve used it more than just one, but I have to say, I&#x27;m already hooked. The smell makes me feel so classy. I might put some in a little spray bottle to keep in my purse!</li>
            <li> This product is very lightly scented. It is amazing for my skin. I use it as a toner and it has worked beautifully.  I bought rose petal toner because aloe vera wasn&#x27;t available. So glad that I tried it!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how many of this I&#x27;ve bought, never disappoint me.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. Who knew there would be so much added fragrance?  My sensitive skin cannot handle it -- it really broke me out. Went back to my normal witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Great! Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product - a bit expensive</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have purchased this toner several times before and have never been disappointed.  It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and with it being an organic product it&#x27;s even better.  It&#x27;s great for all skin types and won&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I will definitely continue to purchase this because it&#x27;s so good for the skin and it&#x27;s at a very good price.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> On time! Great product!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;all natural&lt;br /&gt;moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;toning&lt;br /&gt;very light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;After only a week my skin is smoother and more supple, as well as more clear and even has more of a glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and at night,&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money and will continue to buy for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it every morning or to take off makeup. It&#x27;s gentle and won&#x27;t sting your eyes. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Smells pretty, too!</li>
            <li> Love this toner. really leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed without over drying and even seems to help a bit with acne. Awesome scent too, a definite must from now on! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> this product did not dry my skin, is gentle. Smell is a little bit stronger when applied but disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works miracles for my kid&#x27;s acne</li>
            <li> I replaced my regimen of witchhazel--&amp;#62;rose water spritz--&amp;#62;aloe with this product. About a week in (during the most humid time of year and my face seems less oily and I find I don&#x27;t want to put make up on. Skin is more even and pores are smaller. I&#x27;m still using papaya soap as a primary cleanser in the shower and coconut oil as an end-of-the-day cleanser. Occasionally, I have to use my prescription benzoyl peroxide for breakouts, but that&#x27;s all hormonal. All in all, this is very gentle, nice smelling product and a pretty good deal too. I only got the two pack because it was a new product for me, but will buy more in the future (though I probably won&#x27;t run out for several months).</li>
            <li> Skin loves it; glows, is soft and kept ph balanced and blemish free. Gently removes any residual dirt plus it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great toner. Smells wonderful. Makes my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> i took it based on reviews.. but this is not for my skin may be.. every time i use it i see rashes in few hours.. i guess its bcz of the ingredients in it. i hope it worked for me coz i have 2 bottles at home which is of no use.</li>
            <li> not good for oily spot prone skin period..this toner has oil in it..I got even more breakouts..so I just used it under my eyes (not like I get wrinkles lol ) and use it on my eyebrows simply just for the moisture. In the meantime I stick to witch hazel with alcohol to close my pores.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, safe packaging and good value. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like how this stuff smells like roses and how it makes my face feel soft but other than that I&#x27;m not seeing any new or  drastic change on my face&#x27;s skin texture..... I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to anyway lol but like the smell and feel :)</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Smells like roses, but then fades away. Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head (I try to stay bald ) 3 to 4 times a week.  My routine is: 1. Proraso pre shave; 2. Proraso shaving cream; a shave in the shower; 3. Thayer&#x27;s; 4. proraso post shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have adopted this routine, I find that I have a very very close shave and almost no cuts dings  or bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in the category of a small miracle. I have been attempting to find a good shaving routine for about 50 years and finally arrived at one.</li>
