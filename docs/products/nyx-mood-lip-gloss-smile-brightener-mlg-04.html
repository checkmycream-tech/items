            <li>I&#x27;m a happy customer</li>
            <li>Warm tones will help to neutralize your yellowing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good gloss</li>
            <li>Great alone or on top of lipstick.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>It was smooth and minty and everything I wanted in a lip gloss!!</li>
            <li>Just is a nice lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Warm toned neutrals, aka oranges, yellows, golds, etc.</li>
            <li>she loved it a lot :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used OVER a lip stain or stick, not just bare.</li>
            <li>I love NYC</li>
            <li>I may give it more stars if I don&#x27;t lose it again and can experience it better.</li>
            <li>I love the attention that is given me</li>
            <li>Nothing over the top or groundbreaking about this versus the thousands of over glosses out there.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Nice smooth gloss, not sticky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t change colors but it is a nice shiny lip gloss that stays put for a good enough amount of time.</li>
            <li>I like it fine.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sister and she said that&lt;br /&gt;it was so smooth and shiny ...</li>
            <li>I has a pleasant peppermint taste/smell to it, and is very sticky, so it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li>if that was what you were going for that would be okay, but i really wanted something that made it look as if my lips were still a natural-ish color</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>my smile in any way.</li>
            <li>and I cut right through the bottom.</li>
            <li>Works, fast shipping, easy transaction - thank you so much</li>
            <li>i like the idea of having a blue undertone to whiten teeth, however this lipgloss had more than just an undertone-</li>
            <li>First off, it never changed colors on me.</li>
            <li>Very glossy!</li>
            <li>thank you so much 5 star and right on time you.</li>
            <li>Very very glossy tho...almost too much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much translucent.</li>
            <li>However, my real beef is with the seller.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really use it as it just spurts out through the cut bottom of the tube, and the seller never responded to my request for replacement.</li>
            <li>I really like this gloss.</li>
            <li>I doubted if this product would really make my teeth look whiter</li>
            <li>Also, it looked really gloopy on the lips.  </li>
            <li>It is very sheer blue and nice to wear.</li>
            <li>Cool tones will only ENHANCE.</li>
            <li>Very sticky, blue-ish clear gloss.</li>
            <li>Does actually give the appearance of a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>Color theory means that this product does the EXACT OPPOSITE of what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Complimentary colors COMPLIMENT each other.</li>
            <li>Because they are opposite of each other on the color wheel, and therefore complimentary colors.</li>
            <li>gloss is not only extremely mediocre in formula, but completely defeats its own purpose.</li>
            <li>It suits any any natural lip tone [coloring a nice, delicate pink on me], and enhances other lip color when worn as an overcoat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively moisturizing as just a lip gloss though if you want to use it bare.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything too different than any other lip gloss, although I can definitely see that it is blue.</li>
            <li> I reordered this because I only got to use it a few times before it fell out of my pocket and disappeared forever.</li>
            <li> Fun idea but not impressed.</li>
            <li> That means that they each make the other color pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels terrible, looks like any other cheap clear gloss.</li>
            <li> This tints your lips ever so slightly.</li>
            <li> Bad packaging ruined the whole purchase.</li>
            <li> Annoyed I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Ewas a little disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> Looks weird by itself.  </li>
            <li> Expensive Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips look like they are very very cold, for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I hate products that don&#x27;t do what they claim to do.  </li>
            <li> ; is totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Omg everyone who said it was a bad product, said they used it on their lips!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Petroleum jelly like substance with a hint of blue.  Looks weird by itself.  Not really enough difference on me to motivate me to buy another tube.</li>
            <li> Meh. Expensive Vaseline. Doesn&#x27;t change colors. Makes my lips look like they are very very cold, for about 2 minutes. Then wayyy too shiny. Not impressed.  Annoyed I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any type of effect whatsoever. I was really disappointed. I love NYC though so don&#x27;t regret trying.</li>
            <li> Ewas a little disappointed in this product but I did like the shine thank you</li>
            <li> i like the idea of having a blue undertone to whiten teeth, however this lipgloss had more than just an undertone- it actually looked blue on your lips! if that was what you were going for that would be okay, but i really wanted something that made it look as if my lips were still a natural-ish color and i didnt just have blue goo on my lips</li>
            <li> Will order again. Teeth look whiter even with no color lipstick</li>
            <li> First off, it never changed colors on me. Just is a nice lip gloss. However, my real beef is with the seller. She didn&#x27;t wrap it and when I cut open the flap of the envelope, the bottom of the tube had gotten stuck in the crease of the flap and I cut right through the bottom. So I can&#x27;t really use it as it just spurts out through the cut bottom of the tube, and the seller never responded to my request for replacement. Bad packaging ruined the whole purchase. It doesn&#x27;t change colors but it is a nice shiny lip gloss that stays put for a good enough amount of time. I just would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a great idea but truly worthless. It&#x27;s sticky and gooey and the color it&#x27;s pretty much translucent. Makes no difference in anything.</li>
            <li> I hate products that don&#x27;t do what they claim to do.  There should be some sort of law against all fraudulent products, regardless of cost.</li>
            <li> I reordered this because I only got to use it a few times before it fell out of my pocket and disappeared forever. It is very sheer blue and nice to wear. I am looking forward to wearing it again. I may give it more stars if I don&#x27;t lose it again and can experience it better.</li>
            <li> This tints your lips ever so slightly. It&#x27;s best used OVER a lip stain or stick, not just bare. It&#x27;s relatively moisturizing as just a lip gloss though if you want to use it bare. The color really only makes a difference over another lip color.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I love the attention that is given me thank you so much 5 star and right on time you.I&#x27;m a happy customer</li>
            <li> Very glossy! I like it fine. Nothing over the top or groundbreaking about this versus the thousands of over glosses out there.&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price point.</li>
            <li> Omg everyone who said it was a bad product, said they used it on their lips! Which it not for ur lips!! ITS FOR YOUR TEETH!</li>
            <li> No whitening effect. Very sticky, blue-ish clear gloss. Feels terrible, looks like any other cheap clear gloss.</li>
            <li> I really like this gloss. It suits any any natural lip tone [coloring a nice, delicate pink on me], and enhances other lip color when worn as an overcoat. However, the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I wouldn&#x27;t say it &amp;#34;brightened&amp;#34; my smile in any way. My teeth did not appear whiter. If you&#x27;re looking for a good, all-purpose gloss, this is the product for you, but if you&#x27;re expecting a &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; enhancement, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product drives me NUTS. Color theory means that this product does the EXACT OPPOSITE of what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about your color wheel. If you have blue eyes, what color eyeshadows are you supposed to wear? Warm toned neutrals, aka oranges, yellows, golds, etc. Why? Because they are opposite of each other on the color wheel, and therefore complimentary colors. Complimentary colors COMPLIMENT each other. That means that they each make the other color pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you have yellow teeth. Should you wear blue based lipsticks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO, OF COURSE NOT. Warm tones will help to neutralize your yellowing! Cool tones will only ENHANCE. A blue based gloss that claims to be a &amp;#34;smile brightener&amp;#34; is totally worthless. Wear corals, oranges, and blue based reds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gloss is not only extremely mediocre in formula, but completely defeats its own purpose.</li>
            <li> I doubted if this product would really make my teeth look whiter but it does! Great alone or on top of lipstick. Nice smooth gloss, not sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good gloss I did not however find it to &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; my teeth.  I like the texture, flavor, and overall smell of this gloss.&lt;br /&gt; It is not a mood gloss either that is for their blush.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister and she said that&lt;br /&gt;it was so smooth and shiny ... she loved it a lot :)</li>
            <li> Love this! It was smooth and minty and everything I wanted in a lip gloss!! Where has this been all my life?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything too different than any other lip gloss, although I can definitely see that it is blue. I has a pleasant peppermint taste/smell to it, and is very sticky, so it stays pretty well. Need to apply with a mirror, or you can wind up with noticeably blue places on your lips.</li>
            <li> Works, fast shipping, easy transaction - thank you so much</li>
            <li> Does actually give the appearance of a brighter smile. Very very glossy tho...almost too much.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any different in terms of teeth whitening effect.  Also, it looked really gloopy on the lips.  Fun idea but not impressed.</li>
