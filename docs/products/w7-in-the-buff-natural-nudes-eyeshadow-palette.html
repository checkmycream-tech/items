            <li>You can&#x27;t see this color at all on my light skin</li>
            <li>I like all the colors but noticed that the light colors do not show up if you use the brush side of the makeup tool provided.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just such a great product.</li>
            <li>In the Buff Lightly Toasted, &amp; In the Night).</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the pricey Naked palettes.</li>
            <li>The shadows and smooth and bendable.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the 3rd pallete of this line and honestly can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li>Love it &amp;#60;3 great for everyday use or for a special occasion .</li>
            <li>but the absolute best of the bunch is the dark matte color.</li>
            <li>Good quality last awhile not all day</li>
            <li>This pallete is as good as the naked 2.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty easy to blend.</li>
            <li>A great stand-in for those other $40+ Nude palettes.</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors!</li>
            <li>AMAZING looks identical to my Naked.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own naked 2</li>
            <li>All in all, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Tried the shadows out on my arm right away</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very low priced and very amazing and will definitely order it again once mine is used up.</li>
            <li>My wife like it very much</li>
            <li>But I really loved it just as much as I loved the other brands such as smash box or naked or two faced.</li>
            <li>This one is not my favorite of the bunch, but it is still really high quality and has a few shades that make it more than worth the price.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, and very pigmented!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t pressed as well as their expensive counterparts  but for the money they are awesome!</li>
            <li>There is some fallout, which is pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colors are great, darker than what I expected but overall</li>
            <li>There is actually a color infront of the 1st color on my arm (light brown) and that color is the first color in pallet which is matte buff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a lovely shade, and very easy to build up to a bold, dark shade, especially if used with a primer.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the shadows is very creamy to the touch.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, sleek packaging, and the colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used this thing so much.</li>
            <li>The case is actually much sturdier than I assumed it would be.</li>
            <li>the shadows are very pigmented</li>
            <li>Easily blend-able and the classic colors of a traditional nude palette make everything from a hint of daytime color to nighttime smoky eyes a breeze, and the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the colors.</li>
            <li>My personal favorites are some of the rich, shimmery taupes and bronzes...</li>
            <li>and it could stand toe to toe with the high end brands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those that does t want to spend $55 on an eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li>Some of the textures are different, and some can be chalky and powdery at times, but what can you really expect for such a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Exact match to Naked.</li>
            <li>I really like the palette and is a great option especially if you aren&#x27;t fully ready to commit to such an expensive product or are just dipping your toes into makeup.</li>
            <li>came early too.</li>
            <li>My palette came completely destroyed and it was dented all over.</li>
            <li>I just find that the palettes are so small and easy to finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like an almost exact dup of my friends urban decay naked palette.</li>
            <li>Being a single mom I often can&#x27;t afford expensive make-up for myself, this product is amazing and it makes me feel like i&#x27;ve splurged when I really haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Received my W7 in The Buff Natural Nudes yesterday which marked 7 days from order instead of the long wait that was given on order.</li>
            <li>This arrived much quicker than expected to my surprise.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected, very pigmented!</li>
            <li>and if I use the swab side it will go on much too dark than I like.</li>
            <li>Very similar to Urban Decay Naked 2 as far as the color range.</li>
            <li>but it arrived earlier than expected and packaged nicely, nothing was broken.</li>

            <li> I love this eyeshadow. Exact match to Naked. Pigmented and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Love the shimmer...came early too.</li>
            <li> My wife like it very much</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors! Good quality last awhile not all day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own naked 2 (I do have naked) but I am very impressed. The colors are pigmented and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Great for travel--it&#x27;s so inexpensive so you take this with you and not worry about losing or breaking it. You need this in your life!</li>
            <li> Received my W7 in The Buff Natural Nudes yesterday which marked 7 days from order instead of the long wait that was given on order. I&#x27;m very happy with my pallet. It came in perfect conditions no damage to any color. Tried the shadows out on my arm right away and I love the colors. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. It comes with it&#x27;s own brush that has two ends and it picks up the product good. There is actually a color infront of the 1st color on my arm (light brown) and that color is the first color in pallet which is matte buff. You can&#x27;t see this color at all on my light skin but it&#x27;s ok. There are three matte colors and the rest are a beautiful shimmery. I deff recommend this pallet and will be buying the other pallets as well.</li>
            <li> Very similar to Urban Decay Naked 2 as far as the color range. Some of the textures are different, and some can be chalky and powdery at times, but what can you really expect for such a cheap product. I really like the palette and is a great option especially if you aren&#x27;t fully ready to commit to such an expensive product or are just dipping your toes into makeup.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing  I have gotten so many compliments while wearing these eyeshadows, they are so nice I am purchasing as birthday gifts for my friends and family :)</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an affordable palette, then I would recommend this one in a heartbeat.  I love how pigmented this is and it could stand toe to toe with the high end brands.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t ask for a better palette. It stays on all day (I do wear it over the nyx milk pencil, so that may help) and doesn&#x27;t crease, even in my hooded eyelids. The consistency of the shadows is very creamy to the touch. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the shipping process, my product arrived in perfect condition and weeks before the estimated arrival date. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to order this as it was not what I am used to purchasing. But I really loved it just as much as I loved the other brands such as smash box or naked or two faced. I am so going to continue to order these products.</li>
            <li> I like the product it has a wide selection I just find that the palettes are so small and easy to finish.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are great, darker than what I expected but overall made well.</li>
            <li> AMAZING looks identical to my Naked. I assure everyone its the best dupe out there and the shadow stay on regardless of what other reviews say!</li>
            <li> Love it, the colors are beautiful and it came way sooner than expected</li>
            <li> i am in love with the colors in this palette! Fast shipping, sleek packaging, and the colors are very pigmented. I am very happy I purchased it and I definantly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this product.. The only thing that sucks is the brush that comes with it... Other than that, I love the colors.</li>
            <li> In the Buff Is great it has a lot of great colors in it and looks great and stays on for ever.</li>
            <li> Great product beautiful colors</li>
            <li> Pretty good colors and a great price compared to most out there. I would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I got this around Christmas (it is now July) and I&#x27;ve used this thing so much. I love the colors (Expecially the matte shades) and this they are exceptionally pigmented. I was on the doubtful side when I purchased and now I&#x27;ve hit pan on two shades! It&#x27;s very low priced and very amazing and will definitely order it again once mine is used up. I just purchased the 3rd pallete of this line and honestly can&#x27;t wait! You will love this pallete</li>
            <li> This product was shipped from the UK. Shipping said it would take several weeks but it arrived earlier than expected and packaged nicely, nothing was broken. I like all the colors but noticed that the light colors do not show up if you use the brush side of the makeup tool provided. You have to use the swab side. I also use one of my own brushes for the darker colors because the one provided doesn&#x27;t work well and if I use the swab side it will go on much too dark than I like. If you are looking for that effect then it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s a great palette for the perfect nude and shimmer look!!</li>
            <li> Great value and nice color selection.  These can be a little powdery/chalky but tapping the brush off helps with the fallout.  I like to use a light/white primer under the colors to get the color on my fair skin with the lightest shades.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, very pigmented!</li>
            <li> This arrived much quicker than expected to my surprise. The colors are very pigmented and go on smoothly. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This pallete is as good as the naked 2. Good pigmentation, sleek packaging and a affordible price.</li>
            <li> love it!! and it came within 4 days!!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the best eye shadow I&#x27;ve used color-wise. And it&#x27;s pretty easy to blend. It&#x27;s just such a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette along with the other metal tinned W7 Palettes (In the Nude, In the Buff Lightly Toasted, &amp; In the Night). This one is not my favorite of the bunch, but it is still really high quality and has a few shades that make it more than worth the price. My personal favorites are some of the rich, shimmery taupes and bronzes... but the absolute best of the bunch is the dark matte color. It&#x27;s such a lovely shade, and very easy to build up to a bold, dark shade, especially if used with a primer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pallet ! Neutral yet popping colors a lot of shimmery ones and about 3 matte ones but for the price i wont complain ! Love it &amp;#60;3 great for everyday use or for a special occasion .</li>
            <li> It looks like an almost exact dup of my friends urban decay naked palette. Being a single mom I often can&#x27;t afford expensive make-up for myself, this product is amazing and it makes me feel like i&#x27;ve splurged when I really haven&#x27;t. Love this item!</li>
            <li> Great palette of naturals and pigment is good!  Highly recommend for those that does t want to spend $55 on an eye shadow palette.</li>
            <li> Waited weeks to receive and the package was empty!</li>
            <li> The actual eyeshadows are great, but the shipping was horrible. My palette came completely destroyed and it was dented all over. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Came in 8 days instead of 26-30+ days and I&#x27;m so happy about that! Packaged well, and very pigmented! Only swatched on 5 fingers. Definitely ordering the other colors!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the pricey Naked palettes. The colors are nice, good pigmentation. They aren&#x27;t pressed as well as their expensive counterparts  but for the money they are awesome! The case is actually much sturdier than I assumed it would be. I bought this on a whim but am so glad I did. I will definitely be checking out their other items in the future!</li>
            <li> A great stand-in for those other $40+ Nude palettes. This has excellent pigmentation and with a good eyeshadow primer it has excellent staying power. Easily blend-able and the classic colors of a traditional nude palette make everything from a hint of daytime color to nighttime smoky eyes a breeze, and the price cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best &#x27;dupes&#x27; for the higher priced palettes out there. The colors are gorgeous. The texture is smooth and highly pigmented. I have 4 of the W7 palettes now. If there are anymore out or others are released, you get I&#x27;ll be buying those too!&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned with this shipping from outside the U.S., I received this in just 6 days from purchase date with no damages!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet. I received it as a gift in December, so I have had time to form an opinion. The shadows and smooth and bendable. Love it!</li>
            <li> The pigments are amazing!!</li>
            <li> The shadows are appropriately pigmented and some of them are GORGEOUS. There is a really nice selection. There is some fallout, which is pretty noticeable. It also creases after wearing for a few hours, even when I use primer. All in all, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are amazing for the price! Beautifully pigmented! The tin case isn&#x27;t the best quality, but oh well, the shadows are great!</li>
            <li> These shadows have a lot of pigment when applying to your eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it every day it is a really good palette the shadows are very pigmented</li>
            <li> Hi! I personally am very happy with this purchase. The colors in this palette has the similar texture and feel as that from Urban Decay palette. The longevity of the colors, I found on my eyelids was great too. The only thing I would say though is the matte colors in this palette are not as pigmented as urban decay ones. Overall, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is just what they say it is.</li>
            <li> Love the colors! They go on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This palette is just beautiful! I can&#x27;t seem to get myself to spend the money on the Naked palettes so I decided to try this one and I just love it! All of the colors are gorgeous and stay on for a longtime wear. I love the shimmer of the shadows, and the matte ones are just as nice! Makes for the perfect smokey eye!!! I was also very happy because I was told this wouldn&#x27;t be shipped until September, but I got it way earlier!!!</li>
            <li> Great eyeshadow. Beautiful bright colors that last all day, and shipping was super fast. Will definately purchase more items.</li>
