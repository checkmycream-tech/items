            <li>It works up a great lather and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>(with top on) pharmacy pill bottle fits the brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush, good value.</li>
            <li>but it is a good value and does what I need, builds a good amount of lather for a great shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant now.  </li>
            <li>Then you can take the remaining 345 dollars, buy a nice razor, a 5-year supply of good DE razorblades, a nice razor and get a GREAT shave!  </li>
            <li>This badger brush is definitely good for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>Works good with the shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;Performs good for what it is.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I thought it was as good as the 60 dollar brushes at the mall.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend for anyone looking for a good priced badger brush that works well.</li>
            <li>Good introductory product.</li>
            <li>If you use your shaving brush as both foam-development-, and foam-delivery-, system (as I do), then this is a good quality for a shaving brush to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good starter brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good lather&lt;</li>

            <li>The Brush makes a really good lather and pushes the lather underneath the hair.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>My son in law loved this.  </li>
            <li>The brush bristles are good, but the adhesive which held the bristles in the handle did not hold well</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is good and the brush softened up after the 1st use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for close to a year, and it is still in just as good of condition as the day it arrived.  </li>
            <li>it is what it is...a good brush and seems to be well made.  </li>
            <li>Good for the money though.</li>
            <li>(I also gave him some good shaving cream as well).</li>
            <li>good buy.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;ve found one fallen out, but it lathers and feels really good on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>You can spend anywhere from $50 on up for a brush and this is a good one for the value.</li>
            <li>After shopping around I found this brush to be fairly priced.  </li>
            <li>Good after 1 year.</li>
            <li>I think this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>If you like shaving with mug and soap, a really good brush is a must.  </li>
            <li>That did a good job&lt;</li>
            <li>It seems of good quality.</li>
            <li>This one is just as good.</li>
            <li>I get a good lather going with my Proraso.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>

            <li>If you choose to place an order, I hope you get one of the good ones.</li>
            <li>This brush is every bit as good and cost a fraction of the one</li>
            <li>Do buy a good scented soap - I suggest one that has menthol as it cools your face as you shave.</li>
            <li>Thought it was a good alternative to the Art of Shaving badger brush, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>it is good quality for the price.  </li>

            <li>It provides a good lather and has a nice volume of bristles extending from the knot.</li>

            <li>My husband is thrilled with this</li>
            <li>It is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>and then swirl it in my ceramic mug until I get nice lather.</li>
            <li>Also got a good deal on Astra DE shaving blades. :-)</li>
            <li>While I have not used it, it is nice looking and is sturdy.</li>
            <li>but It seems like a nice brush.</li>
            <li>: the brush was nice, but after about 4 months started shedding a LOT.</li>
            <li>Nice density on the bristles.</li>
            <li>He is loving this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than I&#x27;d like, and when I received it the bristles were kind of going every which way.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the best gift!</li>
            <li>Really nice brush for the price.</li>

            <li>So was loving this brush (used it for a month) and the knot and the handle separated.</li>
            <li>This was a nice brush from 2 to 12 months.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush a lot.  </li>
            <li>and it looks nice sitting there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the beginning to DE shaving like myself, over time I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better brush once this one kicks the bucket.</li>
            <li>There was no undo odor before the break in but after and since, it retains a nice fragrant aroma even after the shave and cleaning of the brush.</li>
            <li>It soaks up the water well and holds its shape nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, nice weight, stable handle.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, gift to my grandson and husband.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are probably better brushes on the market, but this is a great entry level brush to get someone used to the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush which does lather up well.</li>
            <li>The badger hair is good quality and it does not shed more than it should.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled with this brush.</li>
            <li>BUT to be honest; it does what its suppose to</li>
            <li>It whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see how this type of product could be excellent.</li>
            <li>Bought this based on so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my shaving stand though.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and it lathers the soap well, but I end up with three or four pieces of fiber on your face every time I shave.</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly (from Simply Beautiful) and arrived as described.</li>
            <li>This brush lathers up very nicely and applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It works great with soap as well as creams and makes a rich lather.</li>

            <li>Good brush in general, excellent for the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush, rinses out easily and is really good value</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this brush and to top it off</li>
            <li>Brush looks great but the hair is full of what looks like wood glue.</li>
            <li>Good brush , when paired with taylor of old bond street cream makes a very good lather</li>

            <li>good quality was easy to break in.</li>
            <li>very soft bristles and excellent brush to apply shaving soap</li>
            <li>Excellent lather, very comfortable and easy to use, seems to maintain excellent condition after a few shaves.</li>
            <li>I take this to be a good sign that it is genuine badger hair as advertised.</li>
            <li>But so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with it so far and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Great products, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing; I can build a better lather in a fifth of the time.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely sensitive skin it may not be the best for you.  </li>
            <li>Applies smoothly to your skin, a really good deal for this quality item</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and create an excellent lather.  </li>
            <li>Good way to get started on the cheap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather as nicely as the better ones and hairs come out with each use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best brush I used so far.</li>
            <li>The brush is great and well worth my money.</li>
            <li>While it did shed a good amount at first, it seems to have stopped doing so (for whatever reason) for the time being and is holding together fairly well after months of use.  </li>
            <li>They are also just the right length so that you can get great lather without it dissipating when applied.</li>
            <li>I picked mine up for pocket change over $30, it&#x27;s top quality, beautiful and a brilliant first DE Safety razor (thanks to badger and blade community for the</li>
            <li>Very nice brush and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It works great for the money and while it is not the softest, most luxurious brush, for the money it is 100% worth it.  </li>
            <li>Of my three brushes I own, this has already moved to the top as my favorite.  </li>
            <li>What can I say that hasnt been said, great quality, only 4-5 hairs fell out in the first 2-3 weeks and none since then...feels amazing and is great quality!</li>
            <li>A beautiful brush that works real well</li>
            <li>I wish that the density of the bristles were a bit higher, but I am happy with it for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I happy with my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>While I could probably fix this with some epoxy, I don&#x27;t own any, and obtaining some would probably not be worth it considering this thing costs barely more than a tube of good epoxy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to whip up a great lather with this brush and it holds water well.</li>
            <li>This is a very cheaply made product.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and holds the soap well.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and holds a lather well.</li>
            <li>in all it gives a good lather, dries quickly and cleans easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being from the same company, the fit was naturally perfect and BOTH are equally exceptional items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very good at the price, so far.</li>
            <li>it is very good so far ( one month use till now)...</li>
            <li>This brush is full, high quality, and the perfect stocking stuffer for your handsome lover.</li>
            <li>Much better then Boar Bristle brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;would leave more hair on my face than wiskers.  </li>
            <li>I have been a brush shaver for many years</li>
            <li>Hoping to get more use out of it, but guess not.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for a better brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it but haven&#x27;t been able to find something more durable as an adhesive.  </li>
            <li>This brush looks like it will weather the shower better</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The stiffness and density is great but the hairs fallout quite readily.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely great and lathers soap very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times, and it falls apart more and more each time.</li>
            <li>maybe there s better ones, but i would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>What more do you need in a brush?</li>
            <li>For the price I am happy - I did not want to spend too much money, but wanted to see what &amp;#34;pure badger&amp;#34; is all about.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Husband seems pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed a renaissance of shaving since I discovered the brush and soap with DE razors.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine needing a better product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush?</li>
            <li>Much better than the boar hair brush</li>
            <li>If the knot were secured to the handle better, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Good quality brush and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>but I just use my fingers to lather and it works better for me.</li>
            <li>This brush is okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for a month or two, and it&#x27;s working slightly better than the Escali brush I also have, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>2 more dollars for 100 blade.</li>
            <li>The whole set has exceeded my expectations and they look great</li>
            <li>Ordered this as a beginner brush and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than the kit one from Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer the longer handle to help whip faster to get a better lather.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush after the one my grandpa gave me started to lose more bristles than it had.</li>
            <li>In two shavings, more bristles fell out than I could count.</li>
            <li>top quality as always</li>
            <li>I love using this brush, I just wished I started using it years ago.  </li>
            <li>Problem solved and a much better shave as a bonus.</li>
            <li>The brush lost 3 bristles during this process and after using it for a couple of weeks it hasn&#x27;t lost any more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a badger hair brush for cheap!</li>
            <li>I thought it would never get better</li>
            <li>this lovely brush along with the shaving cream make for the most out standing shave</li>
            <li>Badger is so much better than synthetic or boars hair brushes.</li>
            <li>And it is ecological also - allowing one to dispense with cans of shaving foam and utilization of electrical power!</li>
            <li>sincerely Dexter</li>
            <li>OK starter brush.</li>
            <li>I switched to a $60 model from Parker that was much, much better</li>
            <li>Ok product for the price and value.</li>
            <li>I assumed that one coming in a kit must be of lower quality and that an &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; model must be better.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I love it.</li>
            <li>However, after some time of using it the smell did mostly go away so given time it does get better.</li>
            <li>Every time since then I lose many bristles each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than and better than many boar brushes in this or any price range.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Great brush , the soap and brush make the shave much easier</li>
            <li>Will probably glue it back on, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with the construction quality.</li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you will find a better brush than this for the money.</li>
            <li>excellent quality, I have purchased a number of these from box stores they didn&#x27;t last, this one seems to be way ahead of the others.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood - Top quality.</li>
            <li>I had a boar&#x27;s hair brush when I got this badger brush and the difference is like nigh &amp; day, this one holds so much more lather  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend this to anyone and that it would be even better if used with a stand.</li>
            <li>Glad I went on Amazon and found this one.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and get great lather with the Williams soap I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>, it should be OK.  </li>
            <li>But I think, had the brush been better made, this should not have happened.</li>
            <li>and I like it better each day.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially for its price!</li>
            <li>I will look again for another brush but try and find something made with better quality.</li>
            <li>At this price though, you can afford to buy more than one shaving brush.</li>
            <li>However, it does get better with each use and goes away all together within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Badger brushes are the most desirable because they tend to hold a lot of water which is essential for the best close, razor shave.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave every day at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had never used a shaving brush before, but my friend gifted me a shaving set and along with the SimplyBeautiful shaving brush, my shaving experience has changed.</li>
            <li>suppose there must be better brushes out there.</li>
            <li>The Basic would be one of the best products I&#x27;ve used even if it&#x27;s priced was tripled.</li>
            <li>Much better quality.</li>
            <li>Just remember, we all have different skin sensitivities, and you must try out what works best for you.</li>
            <li>and if I didn&#x27;t know better I would swear they sent my a 50-60$ brush by accident.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfectly serviceable, but i admit that it&#x27;s lighter and smaller than i would prefer.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m losing 10 or more every shave.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the manufacturer could add more glue?</li>
            <li>Produces nice smooth, not frothy, lather with Arko or Proraso.</li>
            <li>For the price, quality, real badger,  and the fact it was shipped from the US, it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>I might be able to force it, but I don&#x27;t want to break my shaving stand.</li>
            <li>I love lathering my face with this brush.</li>
            <li>but I wish I had gotten one that was a bit better.</li>
            <li>but there don&#x27;t seem to be many bristles accumulating in the drain screen.</li>
            <li>Many traditionalists out there would probably not approve of the plastic handle, but I am more utilitarian than most.</li>
            <li>It lathers better than non-beaver brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not something you are going to use for more than a couple of months.</li>
            <li>My room-mate also owns this brush so I was able to test it myself.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, as I wasn&#x27;t sure I would continue shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>The brush is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Well, it wasn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li>so cheap!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of how my baldness started :-).</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>This also occurred with my precious cheaper brush.</li>
            <li>There needs to be a better way for attaching the two pieces rather than a dab of glue.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to those that cost much more</li>
            <li>I got this 6 months ago and love it.</li>
            <li>But I ended up just getting a better brush after learning a bit more about safety razor</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really work up a great lather.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend more than 25 bucks for a badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t want to invest to much money..</li>
            <li>If it were for myself, I would be inclined to spend more and buy a simpson brush but for those on a budget then it works well.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more for my dad, my son, and my brother..</li>
            <li>The 7 dollar having kit at Walmart has a better brush in the kit</li>
            <li>Making a nice lather, and comfortable to hold, this brush is proving to be a better buy than others I&#x27;ve had for twice the price.</li>
            <li>Received the brush in a timely manner and have enjoyed the way it sets up my beard.</li>
            <li>It looks more costly than it is.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I am so glad I kept it.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I could not justify buying a more expensive/quality brush.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using soap and brush to shave for many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However I&#x27;m quite glad</li>
            <li>more visits to Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but seemed to shed a bit.</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>I use about a finger tip amount of Art of Shaving cream, and I can lather up 3 or more times.</li>
            <li>so I feel safe in recommending the quality of the construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe this will get better the more I shave with it.</li>
            <li>It was OK...</li>
            <li>Produced good lather and hold the right amount of water and product for me.</li>
            <li>As good as a shaving brush can get with just the right size and stiffness.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the handle is plastic and doesn&#x27;t look like an elegant antique, but if you are looking for high quality at a great price, this is the brush to buy.  </li>
            <li>After getting all my items together i was very excited on the deal i found for the Badger brush.</li>
            <li>sometimes the old ways are the good ways!</li>
            <li>Great shaving brush at a decent price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smelt nice and clean when in the package</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great product and highly reccommend it</li>
            <li>This brush appeared to be high quality and worked great while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t seem to shed very much and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li>that new brushes sometimes have.&lt;br /&gt;Works great with creams, and although I&#x27;ve used it with soap a stiffer brush would be better.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to do, and the brush has performed perfectly well since then.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, lathers great, nice and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>This brush is a pretty good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes a pretty good lather</li>
            <li>Just as good as brushes priced 2x higher.</li>
            <li>This seems like pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>After first shave it all good.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Pretty good bang for your buck</li>
            <li>Works pretty good (at any price).  </li>
            <li>Quite smooth and easy on the face too!</li>
            <li>Plus the handle is easy to be reused with a better knot when you grow out of this one.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a smaller brush and this fit my need perfectly.</li>
            <li>Brush is very very soft and feels great.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles and for a great price.</li>
            <li>It looks great and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>After prepping the bristles are very soft and work up a great lather.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush lathers up nice bristles very tight in brush good brush for the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great beginner&#x27;s shave brush for determining if you really want to give this kind of shaving a go, but I will be upgrading to a more rugged brush that doesn&#x27;t shed as much as I do.</li>
            <li>For the most part it has been fine.</li>
            <li>For the price its at the pure badger shaving brush is a good starter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line:  Very good feel and quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Both last months, no cans to throw away, and give very good close shaves.</li>
            <li>This brush works perfectly, dries nicely, and sheds very little.</li>
            <li>When I took it out of the box it had a huge scratch on the top of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>honestly, i don&#x27;t know any better, first time buying and using this sort of product, nevertheless, its been about a month</li>
            <li>I fixed it with some superglue, but this is not an uncommon problem for this brush.</li>
            <li>Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm have been giving him great, close, shaves without causing irritation.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles, great lather</li>
            <li>This brush works great for me so far.</li>
            <li>The Escali brush is 100 times better for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li>Great if you lather directly to face.</li>
            <li>Nothing is more satisfying then putting hot lather on your face and working it in with a genuine badger haired brush, the closeness of shave you get is amazing</li>
            <li>I believe this to be an okay brush, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my Escali shaving stand.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s okay for the history buffs, but frankly, the shaving cream available on the market today beats yesteryear&#x27;s, so</li>
            <li>This brush is ver soft and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product, the softness and feel of the brush is just what I expected.</li>
            <li>Most pharmacies will give these bottles for free.</li>
            <li>handle is plastic which is good too, because it won&#x27;t be affected so much by the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of wet-shaving.</li>
            <li>He really loves using this badger brush and getting a good lather with shaving soap.</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s not bad, but you can certainly do better with just a bit more money.</li>
            <li>I bought a Parker brush that I use every day and loved it so much that I bought one of these for my travel kit.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special!  </li>
            <li>if you like the softness then a high end very large knot brush may be ideal for you.</li>
            <li>So I spend less, $12, and I am quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;good brush good value</li>
            <li>This brush is so much better than the boars hair brush I originally used.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard anything from them regarding the brush other than my brother said it was the best shave ever</li>
            <li>It hold water well and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>The brush arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easily create lather, soft/smooth application of soap to face.  </li>
            <li>It cleans fairly easily as well.</li>
            <li>Sheds hairs easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>and easily works up a lather.</li>
            <li>In 3 weeks of use,  I have found it produces a great lather (with Taylors Old Bond Street shaving cream),  it feels comfortable while whisking it around my face,  and is easy to care for.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>had the strong animal odor that this one does.  </li>
            <li>: Been using the brush for a couple of months now, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Bristles feel nice and works up a very good lather, but like some other reviewers, the bristles came unglued from the handle fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth handle just the right size.</li>
            <li>Well, to make a long story quick, these are just wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and it&#x27;s been absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, but first time I used it the hair fell off the handle.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the Escali brush and simple beautiful stand.</li>
            <li>I soaked the brush in some warm water for about an hour before I first used it.  </li>
            <li>it sheds more hair than my bald head, otherwise it is not a bad brush.</li>
            <li>It works up a good lather and the bristles really get your beard ready for a nice shave.</li>
            <li>It also rinses easily and still looks as good as new.</li>
            <li>The badger hair is so smooth against your skin and raises a far superior lather in comparison to the cheap brush.  :-)</li>
            <li>Being new to the art of shaving I wanted to find a good quality, un-emblazoned badger brush that wasn&#x27;t going to break the bank.</li>
            <li>I have had this a while now and holding up just fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li>The brush is just fine now and is quite acceptable.</li>
            <li>It smells fine when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this one just fine.</li>
            <li>The handle is plastic, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>i ordered 2 of them,and its working fine.</li>
            <li>I could have got by just fine with this brush .</li>
            <li>A great shaving brush at a great price - the brush is soft but firm enough to work up an excellent lather.  </li>
            <li>It did fine the 1st shave but after that, the bristles started to fall off after every shave.</li>
            <li>This brush seems fine to me.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and feels fine on the face</li>
            <li>this brush for the price had worked fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine &amp; dandy.</li>
            <li>The brush seems fine; some of the bristles have been coming off with use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care, the beautiful feeling of these soft quality bristles on my face is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I paired this brush with &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving Acrylic Black Brush Stand&amp;#34; it fits perfect.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat that good old Badger hair!</li>
            <li>Easily makes a great lather when used properly, even with a cheapo can of shaving cream!</li>
            <li>Holds a good lather, is soft on my face and easy to wash and maintain.  </li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use and the soft bristles make a good lather.</li>
            <li>This is my very first shaving brush and so far, it does great.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic handle, but the quality of the brush bristles are all I cared about and they are fine and the grip is acceptable.</li>
            <li>Its amazing what a difference pure badger makes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I lathered-and-rinsed it a few times, and since then it&#x27;s fine, and performs wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>Gives a great coating, bristles aren&#x27;t harsh whatsoever and even has quite a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I was able to establish a nice lather, but lost a considerable amount of bristles in the bowl in the process (maybe 5-10).</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Great price badger hair is perfect especially after a few uses.</li>
            <li>but it does a fantastic job at foaming up soaps.</li>
            <li>is that I enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further, the company from where I purchased this seems to genuinely care about their customers and the products they sell - that will keep me coming back!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap kit to try it out and found the boar hair brush a bit lacking.  </li>
            <li>story short, a great entry level brush for the beginner wanting to try out a badger brush.</li>
            <li>after a lot of reading / YouTube research, I found that taking care of the brush is as important as shaving itself...</li>
            <li>For that price, the fact that it performs as well as it does is fantastic and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also used it with African Shea butter (which does not foam) and it did a great job with it as well.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s quite smooth and comfortable and spreads the cream around well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s after I bought the Omega 13109, which is a fantastic brush, by the way.</li>
            <li>It applies cream to the face smoothly, and it cleans up easilly.  </li>
            <li>This Badger hair brush and a bar of shaving soap creates a great lather and the soap will last over a year.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap shaving brush with synthetic bristles before this one and it just did not compare.</li>
            <li>Bristles are smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I already had a great experience with the wooden one, i didn&#x27;t think twice about throwing this one in my travel bag</li>
            <li>the instructor used a shaving brush to apply a light coat of CLP/ CL to a pistol/ revolver surface.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much, I got one for my son.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>The cheap glue that was used stuck to the brush, and not the handle.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one so much I bought another, one for home and office.</li>
            <li>Stands can look nice, but aren&#x27;t really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to do light stipple work with faux painting.  </li>
            <li>Once the brush blooms out, it really loads up nicely.  </li>
            <li>...don&#x27;t go cheap on something you use a RAZOR with...</li>
            <li>Comfortable against the skin during usage.</li>
            <li>Cheap, works well.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li>doesnt fit in my shaving stand though...</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as a step-up from my cheap bore brush.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>In short, this is simply a great brush</li>
            <li>It feels smooth on the face and holds the lather.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily because I wanted a brush with a synthetic handle, as I like to presoak my brush and have had problems with low-mid priced brushes cracking eventually or the knot coming free from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i would get boar hair, the makers of this make this cheap by cut to shape the bristles</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>But it is cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>NOT the cheap plastic feel I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Heavy handle, excellent bristle shape cut,</li>
            <li>I use this brush holder with the Muehle Tortoise Shaving Brush Holder, also available from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have another cheap brush that is working on two years with no signs of faltering any time soon.  </li>
            <li>Really great brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>this brush does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li>sometimes paying for better quality is worth it.</li>
            <li>Builds a great lather and definitely helps you get a smoother and closer shave.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be of good quality</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, build a good lather, and get under your whiskers well.</li>
            <li>But, soft isn&#x27;t always good.</li>
            <li>I understand how SimplyBeautiful is able to give such a good deal on a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>It whips up a good lather, but the hair isn&#x27;t as soft on my face as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison as the badger brush is far superior.</li>
            <li>This basic brush works very well and is probably the best value that I&#x27;ve seen in badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are fairly soft, and the brush helps create a good lather.</li>
            <li>so far so good......</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Soft after breaking it in, good backbone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like a really soft massage, and it lathers the soap so good.</li>
            <li>soft, but has a good bursh</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for a month now and so far it&#x27;s been a good brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is of good quality, yet feels soft on skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, the low price made me suspicious, but with all the good reviews posted here, I figured it was okay to take a chance.</li>
            <li>It does give me a good lather and is fairly soft on the face.</li>
            <li>so I am sure this brush is high quality and it is very soft and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Very nice brush, with minimal initial shedding of hairs, at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>I cannot argue with the price for this brush, and it does a very fine job of applying my Musgo Real shaving cream!</li>
            <li>this brush for all your shaving brush needs as it&#x27;s an excellent product at the right price, just don&#x27;t smell it while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quickly and holds nice shape.</li>
            <li>This brush has no hairs falling out, is very full, cleans up well, and does a super job of lathering the soap; as well as preparing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is good; soft and provides a rich lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now, it won&#x27;t stop shedding bristles and it has a very distinct chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good quality genuine badger hair brush at an economical price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have anything recent to compare it to, but seems very nice.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill, and even before my DE razor arrived, significantly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Glad this item was available online for a very reasonable price compared to specialty shops.</li>
            <li>But, after you get the hang of wet shaving, it&#x27;s best to go for a custom-made or higher quality.</li>
            <li>Excellent little brush!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The contrast is significant.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use in the first place.</li>
            <li>I believe my original brush was Horse</li>
            <li>I wanted a brush to use during a deployment to Afghanistan, and didn&#x27;t want to spend anything significant on something just to use there.</li>
            <li>Probably 50-80 hairs in my shave soap and more on my legs with the first use.</li>
            <li>Although I cannot compare it to an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; Badger Brush, I am very satisfied with my experience thus far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this and originally thought it was the clay I was applying</li>
            <li>I use Weleda shaving cream (don&#x27;t kid yourself, shaving cream will have a significant impact on your experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon first shave, I was struck by an interesting aroma.  </li>
            <li>Excellent small brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>: I originally ordered two of these.</li>
            <li>On my first shave, when I was gathering up a lather with my soap, I noticed it did a way better job than the boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it lost a dozen or more hairs.</li>
            <li>smell when you first start using it, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and will hopefully go away soon.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find one</li>
            <li>shave results in significant loss of hair from the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Rich</li>
            <li>I prefer a brush with a bigger head of bristles so it holds more lather and a better handle with more grip surface.</li>
            <li>It has a hint of scent, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a higher quality one even if you have to pay 50% more.  </li>
            <li>This brush is good in a sense that it lathers very well and that it is a pure badger brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and absorb water very well and also makes a great lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, it is better than nothing - hence two stars, but it sheds a lot, it is made of low quality hair and the results doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to comparably priced boar brushes.</li>
            <li>believe they used the amonia to clean</li>
            <li>Not much I can say about this brush, if you have ever used a badger hair brush, then this is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and certainly more affordable.</li>
            <li>It holds heat well from my shave bowl hot water pre-soak; my shave cream keeps a fair amount of heat throughout my shave, and I normally do one pass with the grain and follow that up with one against the grain.</li>
            <li>This one was significantly cheaper, but it was most certainly a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft!</li>
            <li>im old school for a better, cheaper shave!&lt;br /&gt;i dont buy $300 brushes and 40 pucks of soap!</li>
            <li>Compared to the other brushes that I&#x27;ve had over the years (I&#x27;m 68), this is absolutely the best one.</li>
            <li>This is really a good looking shaving brush, but after using them for over 40 years, this one falls apart more than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Sir Fancy Pants&#x27;s Favorite Pure Silver Badger Blah, Blah?  </li>
            <li>I did not purchase the Simply Beautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush to use as a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to hold and should last many years .</li>
            <li>I think this brush is hard to beat for the price, and even if it isn&#x27;t quite your preference it will be a great travel brush or back-up to toss into your toiletry case!</li>
            <li>The large size and firm bristles create a great lather and condition your beard nicely to prep for a shaze with your safety/straight razor.</li>
            <li>Great little brush,  Nice looking handle and the bristles are very well secured to it.</li>
            <li>Nothing feels more fantastic, smooth, or manly as an old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush and you see others like it from competitors that are priced multiple times higher than this one.</li>
            <li>Still a great value for a beginning wet shaver.</li>
            <li>Bristles are staying in pretty good so far</li>
            <li>Considering the price, this brush is great for the discerning wet shaver.</li>
            <li>it  worked and i believe it will work a lot better as i reacquire the talent and remember it is not the good old days of a soft beard</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money for a GOOD badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft shaving brush.</li>
            <li>After purchasing a safety razor I wanted the full effect.</li>
            <li>Except while priced good this one fell apart after only 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>Good brush overall.</li>
            <li>That is true, a silvertip boar brush will be a softer brush.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away and switching back to a really good Excelsior Boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li>I should have gone the extra $40 and bought a good brush</li>
            <li>Follow initial cleaning recommendations to the letter and you are good to go with a great wet shaving experience.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice weighted feel and the bristles are soft &amp; dense.</li>
            <li>Of course, he doesn&#x27;t really need it, since (as I&#x27;m sure you probably know), badgers don&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brush daily for a couple months now and its been really good.</li>
            <li>Recipient was pleased, now my husband wants one for himself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting a real shaving kit turns shaving from a chore into an enjoyable activity</li>
            <li>I believe those things are true for almost every badger brush.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, soft body of bristles, and it does what you would want a brush to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lifts my beard better as well and does not blossom out as much.</li>
            <li>I have just started shaving with a safety razor and all my research said I need a shaving brush for the full experience.  </li>
            <li>and it stayed there ever since, overall still a good product</li>
            <li>Overall, the product seems to be fairly well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but it seems reslly good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for starting your set up.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush but is a bit scratchy , since I have sensitive skin on one side of my face it doesn&#x27;t work for me after a couple of uses</li>
            <li>It is a true steal at the advertised price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Basic but looks good and does the job.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>The brush is just a bit prickly on the face, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>For the money it is not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>NO bad smell at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not a bad beginner brush.</li>
            <li>compact brush, hasn&#x27;t shed much, tight knot, shave good, woman like, me like!</li>
            <li>The black plastic or resin handle of the brush is smooth, weighty, and attractive.  </li>
            <li>Brush is awesome and very soft keeps its shape even when wet.</li>
            <li>A higher end brush will easily be close to $80 range.</li>
            <li>brush handle seems to be made of a strong material and looks exactly like the photo for the listing.</li>
            <li>After the first month it hasn&#x27;t lost any and is still holding strong and doing its job well.</li>
            <li>It sheds a little bit more than I would like, but again for an inexpensive first brush, I say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money compared to other Badger Shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>Check out some other great shaving products at discount prices here.</li>
            <li>Boy was I excited to have a &amp;#34;real razor&amp;#34; and this led me down a dark decade long rabbit hole under the belief that Gillette&#x27;s multi-bladed face killing monstrosities were the best of the best!</li>
            <li>My first brush, so I&#x27;m not an expert by any means, but it does the job, works well, and has held up just fine.  </li>
            <li>Smells at first, but is fine after a week or two of shaving use.</li>
            <li>It makes lather rapidly and rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li>No bristles falling out, dries quickly after use.</li>
            <li>a Jagger DE89L. All have nearly same price, do the same job, excellent tools.</li>
            <li>and it quickly fluffs out and dries--and not in that clumpy way a lot of brushes do that aren&#x27;t badger.</li>
            <li>Who knows, it may last for many more months.</li>
            <li>While super affordable, I feel like you also lose quality with the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick brush.</li>
            <li>However, if you soak it in a mild dishwashing soap solution for an hour, lather it up with your shaving soap, let it sit overnight, and then rinse well</li>
            <li>I got some william&#x27;s mug soap, clubman aftershave, parker double edged razor and this brush, wallah my shave was 30x more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Though don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did; starting off with Best Badger then regressing to boar bristle and up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the initial quality, the shipment and the low price point to start.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Super Safety Razors Chrome Shaving Brush Stand to go with it.</li>
            <li>i would go a step up and purchase a super badger</li>
            <li>Love the product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend it most highly.</li>
            <li>Wash in warm dish-washing soap and water, rinse, soak for 30 minutes to an hour in the same kind of solution, rinse, and then work up a lather of your favorite shaving soap or cream, and let it dry overnight in the brush.  </li>
            <li>My first shave brush and it is performing as well as the most positive reviews mention.  </li>
            <li>Hairs came out on the very first use and have never stopped coming out.  </li>
            <li>Significantly softer and easily create lather than older brush.  </li>
            <li>, again I this is my very first shaving brush</li>
            <li>My biggest concern about the brush itself is the &amp;#34;pure badger bristles&amp;#34; apparently have some kind of dye in them which turns my lather gray.</li>
            <li>I sometimes feel foolish paying a higher price when there are lower-priced alternatives available.</li>
            <li>It was my first shaving brush and the fact that it was badger hair and was so cheap.</li>
            <li>:  Now, be aware that this is a cheap brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As long as the bristles stay on, it should prove to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The only caveat or problem I&#x27;ve experienced is that it does shed a decent amount.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad its 100% pure, as my badger is really a stickler about purity!  </li>
            <li>I am new to the DE shaving and really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>For less than $12.00 delivered this brush is a great value.  </li>
            <li>After about a month and a half this brush is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>I could say it&#x27;s a great starter brush, but truth be told I&#x27;m a long-standing shaver and use it as a typical go-to brush.</li>
            <li>It is pretty soft and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>Holds a pretty good amount of lather, usually enough for three passes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really very stable and don&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li>but it certainly works just fine</li>
            <li>As stated in other reviews, it did smell funny at first, but a good soak got rid of most of that, and the rest was gone within a couple shaves (it starts smelling like your shaving cream/</li>
            <li>Now that he&#x27;s tried it, he loves wet shaving a lot more than regular ol&#x27; disposable blade shaving, so I&#x27;d say this was a great investment and a good buy for anyone looking to get into wet shaving for fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>I recommend it heartily for the price, but wash it first!  </li>
            <li>For slightly more, there are many other options - look at various shaving forums before buying something like this and feel free to ask them what you should be looking at - you will get honest helpful answers.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it!</li>
            <li>must say that I was pleasantly surprised, if not shocked, at how nice this brush really is though.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I would suggest this to anyone who need a new brush or is just starting to shave with a brush.</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new one (this time an Escali badger-hair brush, which is far superior).</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I was using it right away.  </li>
            <li>It has lost only one single hair since I started using it, and helps make a wonderful lather with the shave stick I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the less the brush is very nice and the handle is glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There has been little to no shedding and it fits great in my Colonel Conk stand.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>I have little to compare it to, but it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>A great little shaving brush for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, affordable little luxury.</li>
            <li>I also generally shave in the shower making it easy to lather up, shave and rinse easily.  </li>
            <li>Cup &amp; brush are the ONLY way to get a decent, warm shave!</li>
            <li>I guess my use of this very good brush will be permanent or at least long-term.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush purchase, and after having this, I see no reason to spend more for some ridiculously overpriced brush that would win the approval of the shaving snobs.  </li>
            <li>it does need  a little finesse with rinsing, but for the price, you can&#x27;t honestly ask for better</li>
            <li>But after reading a few pointers about soaking the brush in soapy dishwater, I noticed the smell diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t complain for how cheap this brush is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thinner, lighter and looks a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>Probably not for everyday use, but great for a travel backup.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Looks good and works as well as many that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as nice and doesn&#x27;t produce the same lather.  </li>
            <li>For the cost, it is easily worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It looks nice and simple with no markings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not the most soft brush, but it works well.</li>
            <li>Perfect brush for a beginner to wet shaving or a veteran as well.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I bought this simply for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read about the importance of using a good shaving brush for wet shaving and it seems badger hair brushes are the way to go.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>After using it for a bit, my advice would be to skip it and go directly to something better.</li>
            <li>Everyone should know animal brush will smell when wet, and you wash it out, and then use a good scent shave soap, and let it sit overnight, to condition it.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as a silver-tip badger but much more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The texture of the brush is soft and my beard hair is exfoliated out from skin to give a closer and a better quality shave.</li>
            <li>But I have been pleasantly surprised and got more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li>in all, nice enough.</li>
            <li>Lathers up fast and almost magical in how fast it does this.</li>
            <li>This brush is a step up and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Almost makes shaving fun.</li>
            <li>He says the lather is nice and thick, the bristles are soft and are holding up great.</li>
            <li>It still smells after I have conditioned it several times by leaving it overnight lathered in nice shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I find it really soft and love using it.</li>
            <li>Love these old fashioned brushes.  </li>
            <li>SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Razor and Brush Stand, Chrome]] for proper storage/drying.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles producing smooth buttery strokes!</li>
            <li>in all, for the money the brush is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush is an excellent choice for those starting a wet shaving routine.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied so far with the ability to lather.</li>
            <li>It will be a good brush as soon as the wet bager smell goes away.</li>
            <li>He was getting break outs, so I bought him this new brush (always keep your brush clean!)</li>
            <li>Very economical and plenty of foam to lather up your face 3-4 times (which you may need with straight edge razor).</li>
            <li>This brush is soft, yet, very effective in stimulating the face prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall I have tried 4-5 other brushes and this is the best of them (under 25$)</li>
            <li>Pretty good shave and better than others more expensive</li>
            <li>It has a decent size knot that will definitely whisk up a good lather every time.</li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much softer on the skin compared to my original brush.</li>
            <li>If your just getting into wet shaving and want an inexpensive (I won&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;) brush to see if it&#x27;s for you or are looking for a good travel brush this one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li>Other than that it does a good job</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It popped right out, glue and all.</li>
            <li>Now the price is right and the brush does the job.</li>
            <li>right when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the right size and easier to control.</li>
            <li>I remember the supplier emailed wanting a review right away.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the bristles can be used in fly tying and you will still be able to your Pure Badger Brush for cleaning, at least until you&#x27;ve tied a whole lot of flies.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, totally great little brush!</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the smell that other (typically older) reviews have commented on.</li>
            <li>Great brush with very little \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of bristles.</li>
            <li>For such an economically priced shaving brush, this little brush is superb - and well made!  </li>
            <li>it being a cheaper solid black brush), it&#x27;s beautifully crafted!</li>
            <li>Just a couple of drops in the middle of the bristles to apply a light protective coating to weapon metal in a easy to control amount.</li>
            <li>This is a great starter brush if you&#x27;re not sure about shaving like this yet.</li>
            <li>Then, you&#x27;ll still have enough left to take your lady (she&#x27;ll love the shave) out to a nice dinner.  </li>
            <li>A lot of sites will state that badger is better than boar in general, and that might be true, when you are looking at brushes costing 5 times as much as this</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t very well give it a 5 star rating without full test results.</li>
            <li>For home use I&#x27;ve only used cheap boar bristle brushes, which I&#x27;ve always felt were good enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: Spend a bit more to get a better quality brush, as you&#x27;ll be buying another in the near future anyway...</li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush and for the price real good,it is fairly soft as from what I understand badger is supposed to be but not too soft</li>
            <li>This is a great price for some one new to wet shaving so go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced right for my first brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen100 % Pure Badger Shaving Brush from $50 - $75 bucks!</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive face then I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price I paid, but after loosing a few bristles in the bugging it&#x27;s been holding great.</li>
            <li>Feels cheaply made for the price I expected more.</li>
            <li>I would like a shaving brush a bit firmer and stronger bristles in the future purchase of my shaving brushes, but it&#x27;s nice to have a reasonably priced and quality product all in one.</li>
            <li>The bristles have not come off, even after a month, and the handle is solid and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Mostly, a good brush also exfoliates (less ingrown hairs, and so bumps)</li>
            <li>Warms quick and holds soap really well.</li>
            <li>Good quality and soft on the skin , Would definitely recommend to all for&lt;br /&gt;comfy shaving .</li>
            <li>The brush works great, but you really need to use it a few times with a fragrant soap before the smell subsides.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>You have to be very gentle rinsing off the brush.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all, a fine product and a bargain, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>Works fine and replaces my old one.  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and this brush has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>Certainly well worth the money.</li>
            <li>While it is not as soft bristle tipped, as a Silver-tip badger brush, this still gives good exfoliation; without going to far (not excessively prickly).</li>
            <li>Initial smell was strong, but quickly went away after soaking overnight.  </li>
            <li>The handle isn&#x27;t fancy but it is a nice glossy black and works adequately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is not floppy, and so it&#x27;s great for hard soaps, or creams/\\&quot;croaps\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fantastic, amazing, special brush.</li>
            <li>It is not as soft as that 30 year old brush but is very full and holds lots of soap as compared to my old brush that has lost so many bristles.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>This brush is awesome, i have used really expensive brushes</li>
            <li>during the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better and more expensive brushes out there, but I must say this brush did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you spend the extra money and get a better quality brush from say &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; or others.</li>
            <li>Pretty much exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for several weeks now am am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Only one thing would make it better.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the brush lasting more than a year</li>
            <li>This is my first brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it maybe 4 or 5 times now and hair is still falling out pretty consistently.</li>
            <li>This brush is a pleasure to use and for the price it is very well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was using a cheaper boar bristle brush of the same size and I like badger better.  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger shaving brush, and it works like a champ produces a lot of lather with the Arko shaving stick.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>It smelled quite gamy first time under the faucet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first brush, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the brush I noticed a foul odor coming from it.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit concerned about the smell of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I will say I didn&#x27;t notice any wet badger smell as I was applying my shaving cream which is nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s such a difference, but my first guess is magic.</li>
            <li>exactly what you expect for the price.  </li>
            <li>Never in my wildest dreams would I have believed that badger hair would be so soft and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to those looking for their first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is significantly better than my last</li>
            <li>(yes I cleaned it first)  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even fix it enough to be able to wrap it</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve bought since switching to safety razors, so I cannot compare it to others.  </li>
            <li>I super glued it back on and works fine now.</li>
            <li>smelled a bit funny to begin with, but that is wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>I washed it, soaked it, and even used a pretty fragrant shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li>Brush smelled alittle funky at first</li>
            <li>with hot water and dish soap WELL, let sit in soapy water for some time....</li>
            <li>but sure enough, within about three or four days it didn&#x27;t smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Simple, Cheap, Prime eligible... go for it!</li>
            <li>This was the first brush I tried when I switched to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>/foams I think has really made a difference in the shave I get!</li>
            <li>Sure a bristle falls out every now and then.. but find me a premium brush that doesn&#x27;t do the same..</li>
            <li>it is the exact brush that I had lost.it leathers well with any soap and retains its shape .I</li>
            <li>I saw others priced higher but decided to try this one out.  </li>
            <li>in all, a very well made product that is well affordable and worth having.</li>
            <li>Pay more for something you&#x27;ll actually still be using in a month</li>
            <li>So then I soaked it, first in hydrogen peroxide, then listerine, then vinegar.  </li>
            <li>The first week I used this brush, it shedded every day.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with using a shaving brush, so I have no frame of reference for judging it.</li>
            <li>After my first shave, life changed forever...</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been spammed by an Amazon vendor.</li>
            <li>first time using a brush and shave cream etc....</li>
            <li>This was my first brush and it never did stop shedding bristles, so rather than trying again with epoxy</li>
            <li>The brush detached from the handle during my first use.</li>
            <li>The first broke on first use</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush and I did choose a badger brush after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>This $12 dollar 100% badger shave brush well its a shave brush, its badger, its just that it requires like everything, conditioning, the first week you use it</li>
            <li>It fell apart after the first time I used it with lighter use that I would use if shaving.</li>
            <li>It sheds a bit and had an odor at first.  </li>
            <li>No frills shaving brush, but it does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
            <li>So, It does shed a bit at first, and it smells like road kill for a while.  </li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush ever</li>
            <li>; I am yet to build my first lather with this brush</li>
            <li>The brush was washed with hair shampoo before the first use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as my first brush.</li>
            <li>this price you can get a solid boar brush from Omega or Semogue that provides a significantly better lather.</li>
            <li>Brush separated from handle in first week.</li>
            <li>Used my brush for the first time, today.</li>
            <li>it does have a smell when you first use it.</li>
            <li>I washed mine with dove dish detergent and hot water to get rid of the badger smell.</li>
            <li>Kinda funny</li>
            <li>bristles fall out every time that I used it for the first couple of months I had</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>This brush has great quality bristles with a very solid acrylic handle that looks like it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li>Beginner to DE shaving, this brush meets the needs and helps me progress and learn on nuances, eventually moving up to &#x27;higher end&#x27; brushes.  </li>
            <li>For the first couple weeks it lost some hare.  </li>
            <li>It lost maybe three or four hairs on the first use and none since.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush</li>
            <li>Would work well enough if you just want to try this type of shave and didn&#x27;t want to spend any more $.  </li>
            <li>I let it sit in shaving soap overnight before first use.</li>
            <li>This piece of garbage fell apart --- the bristle-pack detached from the bottom &#x27;holder&#x27; --- the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>But it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li>First shaving brush for me.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>The brush stunk when I first got it, as you&#x27;d expect being a Badger brush.  </li>
            <li>First use, hairs fell out and became knotted up.  </li>
            <li>Had a bit of a smell when i first got it,  but it has subsided now after 4 uses.</li>
            <li>The brushe broke after my first use.  </li>
            <li>Sheds for the first week of use.</li>
            <li>and it smelled like roadkill on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>(still) it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>After first shaving brush started loss hair and color</li>
            <li>There was some shedding with the first couple of uses, but has since subsided.</li>
            <li>As a first brush, I&#x27;d probably recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>My first badger brush.</li>
            <li>It gives me an even coat of shaving soap over my face, and the bristles feel softer and of better quality than the standard brushes I used to buy at Walmart and beauty supply shops.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after using a boar hair brush for a month or two when I first switched from the foam everyone uses.</li>
            <li>Good product, you will have a few hairs come off of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Detail:  I was looking for a Badger brush for my travel shaving kit and wanted Badger Hair (heavy beard + badger hair &#x3D; good lather) and came across this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and not hard to lather with the brush.</li>
            <li>As a beginner to wet shaving I can say that this brush is perfect, stiff enough and can hold enough water for a great lather.</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t lose many bristles, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water as the boar brush, so I have to make sure it is very wet to get a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend breaking it in a little bit to make sure the brush sheds all the lose hairs, but other than that, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if the brush will hold up as well as hanging it to dry, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Bought this the other day and have only used it a couple of times so far, but it is great!  </li>
            <li>In July however the whole knot of bristles just fell right out of the brush in one piece.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased a Parker brush which is much denser, but this one still produces a nice thick lather and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>In the several weeks I&#x27;ve been using it the brush has created and held a good lather with Williams Shave Soap after a simple dunk in a sink of hot water and a shake off of the excess.</li>
            <li>This is a nice soft brush that is much higher quality than than your standard brush at your drug store.</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush that is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also thinking that I would upgrade to a more expensive brush fairly quickly, but honestly don&#x27;t feel like I need to!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not personally used it, but I have been told it has a nice, soft feel.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is also a good size, especially if you are just starting out with badger brushes.</li>
            <li>It is considerably softer than the old Boar hair one I was using, I may get two more for traveling and a spare.</li>
            <li>Not as good as more expensive badger hair brushes</li>
            <li>After some research I realized this isn&#x27;t an issue with the brush as that&#x27;s what pure badger hair does, but just be aware.</li>
            <li>The price is just an even greater selling point, because what you get is a heavy, durable, fine bristled brush that works very well.</li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>Sheds very little and lathers up so good.</li>
            <li>It‘s compact, yet full enough to foam up and cover my face quickly.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal, dries quick and lathers very well.</li>
            <li>It pretty much started falling apart in about a month.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put much stock in the reviews that are within the first couple of months of ownership.</li>
            <li>It did have an unusual smell when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>my first shaving brush, it makes shaving nicer and with my safety razor really close.</li>
            <li>brush is very prickly (or &amp;#34;skritchy&amp;#34;), even after break-in (I used it for about a month).</li>
            <li>Although it is my first experience with a badger brush, it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have any other wet-shaving brushes to compare it to, but he says it&#x27;s soft and creates a good lather.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash it with mild soap, gently squeeze it out, and store it upside down in a stand.</li>
            <li>This one is smaller than my other brushes, but it seems to soak up more water, and hold more soap than the others.  </li>
            <li>I can rinse easily and leave in the shower for next time.  </li>
            <li>But as a regular guy, it works and it its pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>So far so good, will take some time to season and get rid of &amp;#34; classic wet dog smell&amp;#34; as associated with all badger brushes.</li>
            <li>Thought the brush was a good deal; but with the bristles coming out with each shaving, before long there won&#x27;t be any left.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know for certain that it is badger hair in this brush, but I have no reason to believe that it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I can say for certain</li>
            <li>so I can not say with any degree of accuracy that it is 100 percent pure badger.</li>
            <li>A lot of people will steer people away from Pure Badger because of the brushes being stiffer/prickier.</li>
            <li>I prefer that stiffer feel, so for me, getting a pure badger was a</li>
            <li>This will give you everything you expect in a pure badger brush and you&#x27;ll be spared the arrogance of stores like The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>The item arrived as described and appears to be pure Badger hair</li>
            <li>Certainly have no complaints for the money.  </li>
            <li>- the handle diameter is too large.</li>
            <li>It arrived with a large crack in the handle.</li>
            <li>i certainly would recommend it</li>
            <li>The small handle will allow it to fit in your stand, and the bristles are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>it shed a lot more than before and the knot came loose from the handle.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft and overall seems to be of top notch quality.</li>
            <li>This brush workes fine at firsy, but after using it about a month the hairs starting falling off.  </li>
            <li>Everything was fine until last week</li>
            <li>I sort of pushed them back in and it still works fine, but they still spin around a bit now.</li>
            <li>A plus also is how decently it&#x27;s priced!</li>
            <li>All in all, getting a pretty decent set up</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m assuming it depends on what lot the hair for your particular brush came from), but I have had a LOT of hair loss from my brush!</li>
            <li>For the money, this brush is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>I find the hair just right, so I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great simple option; there is not special branding on it.</li>
            <li>I just bought a more expensive brush, but this one is less costly but more superior in quality.  </li>
            <li>It was time for a replacement, and this little brush really does a nice job.</li>
            <li>This well-priced badger brush -- tho a bit small -- works much better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used, is very soft, and is easy to rinse and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This badger hair shaving brush is very good, although my only complaint is that the hairs keep coming out of the end</li>
            <li>Basic is an accurate description.</li>
            <li>Heck, I may even try a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a newbie to old school shaving, just starting with DE Safety Razors while waiting for my straight edge to arrive :)&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Really like the product.</li>
            <li>This brush is a real deal...</li>
            <li>I like it as much as I like my home-use Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li>but it holds water very well and works very well for the price.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a month</li>
            <li>Sometimes my skin is very itchy afterward.  </li>
            <li>but why spend that much?</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND to my friends!</li>
            <li>Very well made-really works up a lather-makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li>as others have, doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I liked the feel of the brush so much that I cleaned it a second, and then a third time.  </li>
            <li>The odor is just a distant memory now, and I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush does the job at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>I like the heaviness of the handle, but overall the brush has a cheap feel to it and the hairs tend to fall out quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>rinse, then it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>I never noticed much of an odor during any phase of this process but did notice that the water became somewhat discolored.  </li>
            <li>It really holds the lather well.  </li>
            <li>Cheap enough</li>
            <li>but really, I didn&#x27;t need it .</li>
            <li>My mind was going through its rolodex of scents trying to place it, but I don&#x27;t think I really wanted to admit to myself what I was smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to shed much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>(the bristles were still glued together, the whole knot just had fallen out of the brush handle in one piece).  </li>
            <li>it is smooth putting shaving cream on the only thing is it looses a couple ofhairs each time l use it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made, and helps exfoliate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 stars because I&#x27;ve not used it much</li>
            <li>so much that I;m going to buy one for myself.  </li>
            <li>The brush works very well with soap or cream.</li>
            <li>It holds the soap lather very well for a real close shave.</li>
            <li>I just replaced it with a Parker brush which is much nicer in every way.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting money on a bowl and stand straight away.</li>
            <li>Also, you will lose some hairs; but it should not be much of the brush.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve never had one of these before, but this one works very well.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made.  </li>
            <li>The bristles do not appear to be set into the handle very well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was under $12 (after all the boar bristle cost $6.xx after tax at Sally&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it works very well.</li>
            <li>It was heavier than I expected which gave it a more premium feel.</li>
            <li>and it really is soothing and lowers that &#x27;burn&#x27; you get without using one.</li>
            <li>After one year, the product is still very functional.  </li>
            <li>The brush rarely sheds and has remained soft.  </li>
            <li>Seems like real badger</li>
            <li>Since these are gifts, I can&#x27;t very well test them so, once they are tested I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li>I am really gentle with this brush but no matter what I do, each shave I get a bristle or two that come off of it and into my lather.</li>
            <li>I regret not noticing I had been given a 2-day shipping option that cost nearly as much as the brush itself.</li>
            <li>couple shaves smell like you&#x27;re using a wet dog to shave, but after that it gets better</li>
            <li>While I really like how soft and otherwise well made this brush is, I&#x27;d probably try a different one to see if it&#x27;s bristles remain intact better than this one.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t much of a loss if this brush turned out to be one of those &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li>I used it but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>but it works very well</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to spend too much.  </li>
            <li>So i bought this a couple months ago, and I haven&#x27;t really used it that much</li>
            <li>However, despite not seeing much usage, the brush has fallen out of its handle already.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this brush and now understand the advantage of badger hair over synthetic.</li>
            <li>so you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s really about it.</li>
            <li>i really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I expected alot better.</li>
            <li>The brush holds the lather well and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing unusual</li>
            <li>Highly recommend considering the price!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, thanks.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grandson to introduce him to the joys of shaving with real lather.  </li>
            <li>Badger hair works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this for about 6 months and it has shed so much</li>
            <li>It lathers up my shaving puck well and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>The handle is simple, yet stylish, and the badger hair was soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It also fits nicely in the wooden Colonel Conk brush and razor stand I bought, which doesn&#x27;t take larger brushes.  </li>
            <li>I looked at a few all-in-one type starter packages, but they all seem to be either over priced or you have to compromise on quality, so I recommend you piece your own kit together.</li>
            <li>Does not fit the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li>I only use this brush once, it felt good on my face, the bristle are really soft , and only a couple came out.</li>
            <li>I recently moved to the old school brush and soap and love it.</li>
            <li>LOVED my first one (wooden finish) and opted for black this time around.  </li>
            <li>so I was curious and very excited to do so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of shaving with a safety razor, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on my first brush.</li>
            <li>Great price, sheds a little for several shave s 2to 3 hairs, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Spend another 10$ and get a decent pure badger one.</li>
            <li>I have an assortment of shaving soaps and am a wet shaver using a Gillette super speed with shark super chrome DE blades.</li>
            <li>After I let it dry, the whole brush part easily came out of the plastic handle.</li>
            <li>There was a slight smell when I first opened the package but a quick lather with Williams Shaving soap quickly eliminated it.  </li>
            <li>With a little care, it will last nicely!  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this over the Escali brush, due to the majority of the reviews stating much more hair loss from the brush.</li>
            <li>I cannot fault it for doing its job, but it isn&#x27;t better than other budget badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Follow some of the reviews on how to prepare it, but it&#x27;s much better than foam or other premium shave lotions.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, however I was shocked by the odor that hit me the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>You more than likely won&#x27;t regret it, as I didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m generally picky.</li>
            <li>There were a few hairs that were lost in the first 2-3 shaves (1 or 2 hairs per shave at most), but haven&#x27;t seen any loss since then and it&#x27;s been about 2 months.</li>
            <li>Far better than the rough horsehair kind found at the local drug stores and such.</li>
            <li>and it is pretty soft (again, preference thing) much softer than any unbroken in badger that I have used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely and totally satisfied; wish I would have bought this long ago.</li>
            <li>Although it is a small brush I can build up a good lather either directly on face or using a mug.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush along with the Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180 and the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.</li>
            <li>For about a year i used the same cartridge razor and some water to shave every morning, needless to say it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant shave.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have spent a little more for a better product.</li>
            <li>Looks good on black Stand by same company.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very nice, but the brush handle is small in my hand and the brush has a low cost appearance.</li>
            <li>Work the soap into a nice lather then apply in small circles so all of the hair softens/stands up a bit.  </li>
            <li>My legs are located pretty far from my nose</li>
            <li>It started out appropriately stiff for a new brush and softened nicely with use.</li>
            <li>As a user of shaving brushes for many years, I miss my silver tip brush with ivory handle that I had for 35 years, but when my son graduated law school, I passed my brush down to him for a keepsake.</li>
            <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have expected a lot out of a cheap pure badger (lowest badger quality) shaving brush.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s new way of shaving has made him purr!  </li>
            <li>He did not know if he could find a new one, I typed it in on amazon and there it was!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I expect that this new one will hold up just as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to end up buying a new brush very soon.  </li>
            <li>Maybe even black magic.</li>
            <li>, try Dorco razors, they are top notch and cost much less than name brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relegating my boar brush to &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; status and using this one as my main brush.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly decent brush.  </li>
            <li>First let me say I&#x27;m a female, I have a lot of experience with natural/animal cosmetic brushes but this is my first &amp;#34;real badger shaving brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have a more expensive shaving brush, but I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>He has wanted to get into this type of shaving and had this particular brush on his wish list.  </li>
            <li>I super glued it back in place and it seems to have resolved the problem.</li>
            <li>I also did some reading on the web and decided that a brief break-in period for the brush would be adequate</li>
            <li>For the price this is a decent brush.</li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>well so all the main requirements are met.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Straight to the point: I like the brush and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Just gently rinse out most of the dried soap before using.  </li>
            <li>Main reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 star raiting was that the hairs have been falling out</li>
            <li>I like a slightly stiff, very full brush with no shedding, and this brush is exactly that.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have had is that the knot is smaller than I am used to and the handle is small and dainty.</li>
            <li>The brush hold water well, but is stiff enough to make a good lather.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended seller.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who isn&#x27;t using one.</li>
            <li>High quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buyer keep in mind this is a PURE Badger hair brush, complete with badger brush smell.</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little more $$$.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job in exfoliating (not to hard) and placing the shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li>A quick warning of sorts - it might feel a bit &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; at first due to its &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; badger makeup.</li>
            <li>So far very little shedding and it is adapting nicely</li>
            <li>no signs of ever being glued in and a very loose fit.</li>
            <li>It worked better than I expected, spreading evenly and really holding the mask well, I will never go back to applying clay masks by hand.</li>
            <li>I was just using it with normal shaving cream, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>It did shed a few hairs when I used it but not too many.</li>
            <li>left this a long time ago and wanted to elaborate.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, things seemed normal.  </li>
            <li>advice: You are probably looking at this item because you are thinking about starting this type of shaving, so here is my advice (for what its worth).</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>it &#x27;s pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>Initially, it lost a lot of bristles with each shave, but now it seems to be a rare occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m Asian and thus rarely need to shave).</li>
            <li>I hope that they will soften after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>It really is worth the extra money and this one isn&#x27;t priced at snob status prices.</li>
            <li>I own several badger brushes, some of very high quality, and while the SimplyBeautiful brush cannot compete with the most expensive ones, is better than other brushes at double the price.</li>
            <li>but I just wanted to get read of it since its not hard at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I liked this brush but after less than a month of use</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft enough and its fullness allows for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>Handle is a similar shape, I have not noticed much of a difference in the lather as both created a rich lather with multiple applications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;16 Blade Sampler - Mine just arrived, and I am looking forward to finding the right blade for me before buying them in bulk (Feather is looking a likely candidate).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I noticed a little prickliness with the new brush on the first use but it is better the second time.</li>
            <li>appearing cheap due to</li>
            <li>I feels of good quality and besides the initial shedding which I expected, I feel it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving brushes, so I can&#x27;t attest to other badger brushes being smell free.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaving brush.</li>
            <li>almost all new badger brushes, this one smelled a bit and shed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush to help lather shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>I thought that I should have a new brush after years of using another.  </li>
            <li>If this continues I&#x27;ll need a new brush soon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a new brush after all</li>
            <li>and now I have to buy a new brush.</li>
            <li>Very few bristles have fallen out into my soap, which is considerably good since the action of proper lather is quite vigorous.</li>
            <li>A few months aback, I went to my local barber, who is amazing, and decided to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>So much better than artificial or boar&#x27;s bristles, this brush whips a healthy lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23, and have light but coarse facial hair (I am part middle-eastern).</li>
            <li>It had a number of decent reviews, so I was surprised when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it will shed, however if you shake it dry and then stand it on its handle it quickly becomes trained, and the hair stops falling out of the brush.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was unreasonable for me to expect a different brand brush to fit, but a lot of different brands are stated to be &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nice having shaving soap that smells good and a brush that smells like you have the actually animal on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fortunate enough to only have to shave once a week.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and creates a good lather but every shave it leaves behind bristles on my face.  </li>
            <li>The only real drawback to this dense brush is that since it soaks up a lot of lather, it&#x27;s more difficult to clean than other brushes, and it takes longer to dry, especially in high humidity, so if you plan to shave with a brush like this every day, you&#x27;ll need more than one</li>
            <li>I however have a very sensitive face, and this brush feels like angel wings gliding across it.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, lathers well, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft yet sturdy.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy about the handle, but the bristles are very soft and it lathers well.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No bristle loss, and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li>Likewise while I had a number of hairs fall out it was absolutely very far from the amount needed to render the brush unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft tips compared to the boar I am used to.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this natural bristle product.</li>
            <li>This is also easily overlooked by the fact that other brushes cost several times as much.</li>
            <li>I ant make lather with it  and it smelled bad so for what it&#x27;s worth  spen some real money and get a good brush.</li>
            <li>Steer clear!</li>
            <li>My last brush broke at the handle, this one seems pretty well built.</li>
            <li>The first brush - different product, lasted about 6 months.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 15 years and the dollar soap last a year each.</li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush and will be my last.  </li>
            <li>I had recently switched to using shaving creams and brushes when shaving, and this brush was recommended to me and it works very well!  </li>
            <li>Then again it&#x27;s the only badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned ;).</li>
            <li>Just Complete Junk!</li>
            <li>Even for a low price of ten or twelve dollars I expect a brush to last more than 4 months.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I left it soaking in water all the time either, just a 15 minute pre-moisturize with hot water on the bristles alone.</li>
            <li>wow - now I know what a badger smells like!</li>
            <li>I lost a couple bristles on the first wash and cleaning, but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li>when I first saw it, thought I had a grown a giant hair!</li>
            <li>Ii have only used it a few times but  am pleased with the quality of the bristles as they lather very well and hairs do not fall out.</li>
            <li>Pay for quality and get the more expensive badger brush, It will last longer and give you a better shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first shaving brush, and for the money especially, it gives me all i want.</li>
            <li>Again I thought no big deal because it was pretty inexpensive and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews on other similar brushes, I found they had issues with the hair (bristles) coming loose, or there not being enough bristles in the first place, or the handles not being good.</li>
            <li>I have used several different brushes from expensive to cheap and this one is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shedding:  This brush started shedding immediately, which for a new brush isn&#x27;t entirely unexpected.  </li>
            <li>At least, that gives greater control, for normal sized faces.</li>
            <li>Whips up a mean lather and breaks in very quickly!</li>
            <li>The badger bristles are soft enough to be comfortable but tough enough to stand up to regular use and generate a smooth comfortable lather with my Poraso shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It has enough backbone to lather a soft soap, but is still pretty soft on my face.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day it does the job, but I would recommend spending an extra few bucks and getting a higher quality brush that won&#x27;t be scratched when you open it and one which retains the badger hair better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten pretty tired of buying overpriced disposable cartridge razors and thought I&#x27;d try my hand at some good old fashioned wet shaving.</li>
            <li>It is a pure badger brush so the hair is a bit prickly, but I actually like how it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I decided to purchase another shaving brush on Amazon and found this SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger.</li>
            <li>The badger hair is very soft right out of the box and the packaging was rather simple, an unmarked white box containing the brush wrapped in some tissue paper.</li>
            <li>Purchased this amongst many other items for my new found desire to wet shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, great for shaving and no need for an expensive one to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much for a ten dollar badger brush, but this has surprised a bit.</li>
            <li>A clear example of, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Used with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m surprised about this brush</li>
            <li>The bristles have not started coming off yet, and is soft and works well.</li>
            <li>surprised by how well it fluffs-up each time</li>
            <li>It is the lowest end of bager hair but is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but 3 weeks in and its still shedding 3-4 hairs every time I shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still as soft as the day I got it.</li>
            <li>They were also adamant about using a badger hair brush over the others.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the SimplyBeautiful brush.</li>
            <li>He mentioned that he had been looking in stores for an old fashioned shaving brush but couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Not as soft as silvertips</li>
            <li>you want a soft brush, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush to complete a starter manual shaving gift set.</li>
            <li>was surprised it didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;badger stink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Despite the initial odor issue I really would buy another one if this were lost.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this is an $100 brush with a $12 price tag.  </li>
            <li>That one shed hairs like an old dog and it was made of boar bristles</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone starting out with DE or Straight Edge Razor shaving, or just looking for a backup brush.</li>
            <li>It is soft on the face.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Ever-ready brush.</li>
            <li>If not I will return to a boar brush in the future, as they seem to work very well also.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, some did come out when lathering</li>
            <li>Says the brush is soft, holds the soap well, and feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Old Bond Street Shaving Cream:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is an issue with all natural shaving brushes, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and hold water well.</li>
            <li>Bristles have stayed intact and the brush is soft on the face</li>
            <li>last time I used it, I was whipping around my shaving mug, and the whole brush came out....</li>
            <li>I noticed just a hint of a strange smell the first couple of times that I used it</li>
            <li>As for the brush losing bristles, so far the brush lost under 20 bristles.  </li>
            <li>I realize how much of a mistake getting this brush was initially (or the comparable escali</li>
            <li>The smell was nearly completly gone afterwords.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bristles became unglued completely and came off the handle after the 5 shave!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too soft or wimpy.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month so far.</li>
            <li>That was far from the truth with the one I received.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft, and it retains heat</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned one of those premium brushes, although I&#x27;ve had them used when getting an old timey barber shave.</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of water, lathers well, and is surprisingly soft on the face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>It has done its job so far, but it has lost hairs with every usage.  </li>
            <li>, eventually the odor completely disappeared from use.</li>
            <li>I would be surprised if this lasts a year.</li>
            <li>Hold the lather well &amp; is soft on his face.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t go away completely, which is why I won&#x27;t give it five stars.  </li>
            <li>So far it has performed well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and hold lots of soap.  </li>
            <li>Well over the last two months the hairs are falling out fast as ever</li>
            <li>About 6 bristles have come out so far,  but</li>
            <li>there is a bit of &amp;#34;wet dog smell,&amp;#34; but you get that with any natural bristle</li>
            <li>Also, they are too soft for me.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to use the brush a few times which is the only reason I rated 2 stars instead of 1.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li>I works as good as an expensive brush</li>
            <li>it with the italian soap which name i forgot and creates a nice thick lather</li>
            <li>It dries perfectly standing on its base without a stand to hold it upside-down.</li>
            <li>(And it is unbranded, which for me is actually an aesthetic bonus.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some initial shedding of hairs during the first couple of shaves; however, that number has quickly subsided to zero.</li>
            <li>-the handle is a little skinnier than other brushes I have used-it fits nicely in the Art of Shaving Brush Stand I use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>It started shedding right away but after six months the handle actually separated from the actual brush.</li>
            <li>Compared to other brushes, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and arrived in a reasonable amount of time, given that it came via APO.</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or lost a crapload of hair like my other brushes, which is a giant plus.&lt;br /&gt;The light smell doesn&#x27;t even warrant removing a star,</li>
            <li>only gripe I have really, is that it&#x27;s a little on the stiff side for badger hair, but I can live with it since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than most others on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helped tremendously (with the additional use of a safety razor) to cut down on razor burn.</li>
            <li>I actually went and bought this, as far as I can tell, exact brush at a local shaving boutique.  </li>
            <li>The brush was a little prickly at first and lost two or three bristles, all normal while breaking in a new brush.  </li>
            <li>I hot glued it in and it became loose again soon after.</li>
            <li>After the first two or three uses, it stopped shedding loose bristles.  </li>
            <li>Every time I shave, I have to clean a few brush hairs out of the sink.  </li>
            <li>The mark of a cheap cosmetic brush is shedding and that&#x27;s why you buy expensive brushes, well that must be true for shaving brushes as well because this brush sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>Lost a number of hairs during the first shave, then an occasional hair on each subsequent shave.  </li>
            <li>In sum, the Basic is: (1) an excellent brush; and (2) at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>but with decent care it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li>A decent brush, creates lather well, will definitely purchaae again</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews on this item before I purchased it which claimed a slight scent of &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; upon the first few uses, this did not bother me much as I expected the smell (it is real badger hair)</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this a better brush than the boar bristle as long as you keep it very wet when you lather it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m amazed with the high quality of this brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for someone going back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; was of shaving.</li>
            <li>I thought this was normal due to my lack of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give the Pure Badger Shaving Brush a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely spending a little more next time.</li>
            <li>For the same price or less you can get a boar hair brush of fantastic quality.  </li>
            <li>Neither of them will do the job half as well or a fourth as comfortably as this brush.</li>
            <li>There were only a few rogue hairs that were easily trimmed.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had done this a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use it too long before I replaced it with something I&#x27;m much happier with.</li>
            <li>First off, I have no issue at all with this brush as it performed as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I left it in warm water for too long or if it&#x27;s an assembly issue.  </li>
            <li>Both lose occasionally hairs, which is normal of all brushes i would assume...</li>
            <li>The brush gets plenty wet just by rotating it under running hot water for about 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Only one issue and this may be normal for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is a good brush that is replaceable, giftable, and that you won&#x27;t feel guilty for when you think about how much you spent.</li>
            <li>Sure it lost a few bristles the first few shaves as I would expect from even one costing double or triple this one cost.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does leave some of the hairs on your face the first few uses and there is a smell when you wet it at first, but this is normal and fades with time and usage.</li>
            <li>Several reviews mentioned that brand new badger brushes had a foul odor to them that took a while to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>Gentle cleaning with shampoo, rinse, dry, soak, load, lather.</li>
            <li>but that hasn&#x27;t made it any less useful for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>brush lost a few hairs in the first 2-3 uses, but that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>A little disappointed in the length of the bristles, but getting better at making a good lather.</li>
            <li>For the price, I would recommend this brush to anyone who is either just starting to explore wet shaving or on a tight budget who still wants to enjoy the experience of a brush.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush to use with your shaving routine, but some of the bristles come out way too easily and now I am unable to hang it upside down in the stand because the rubber coating around the bristles that fits into the handle doesn&#x27;t stick enough and the bristle head constantly falls out of the handle.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, other than the ones I use for weapons cleaning.</li>
            <li>Definitely needed to be washed before use, but after a few uses now it’s seasoned and ready for my travel set.</li>
            <li>I actually ordered a second after I left the first at a hotel room.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I haven&#x27;t notice any funny oder and I have used it for other a month.</li>
            <li>other than that its doing its job consistently.</li>
            <li>This is a major manufacturer defect.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is also smaller or less full than the Tweezerman brush I have used for a couple of years.    </li>
            <li>The brush has been working just fine since then, so I got another two months out of it at least.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not as nice as a $30 brush, but for the purpose it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>shake it out,  let it dry, and it is as soft and pliable as new.  </li>
            <li>I found it a bit scratch compared to my finest and silver-tip badger brushes but at such a low price its a decent starter.</li>
            <li>As for me, I experienced a lot of shedding (even after a couple uses), a bad odor (bit of a stink), and general discomfort and itchiness from the hairs.</li>
            <li>I have used the mug &amp; brush method of shaving for over 30 years and have found this to be a common problem of cheaply made brushes.</li>
            <li>No big deal, I just used the one that came with the old brush.</li>
            <li>and I only lost about 4 bristles so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, and barely any hairs have come out.&lt;br /&gt;Simple</li>
            <li>brush has by far either the worlds softest bristles or not enough bristles in the knot to offer any stability of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But as a guy who just shaves with an old TracII razor using hotel soap in a coffee cup, this brush is smaller and stiffer than I prefer and it takes longer to work up the lather to a workable level.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s too soft but my last brush was boar</li>
            <li>The adult equivalent of finding out Santa, The Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Kwanzabot don&#x27;t actually exist.</li>
            <li>I, too, broke the brush in by soaking in dishwasher soap and then lathered it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood soap and left it in overnight.</li>
            <li>I received it two days ago, so only used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>This brush is a definite exception to the old adage that \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>unless you really want to go back to the 1950&#x27;s, my recommendation is simply to go with today&#x27;s technology advances and simply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but also scratchy so the scrathy-ness definitely offsets the softness.</li>
            <li>It look like sunburn and red , so if u have sensitive this brush is not for me, I may try synthethic shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only lost a couple bristles so far after using this for about a month.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, on my first wet shave, I discovered I was allergic to that specific badger hair.</li>
            <li>It has, over the last few weeks, lost a few hairs, but lathers nicely and has maintained its shape well.</li>
            <li>Plus after you get it broken in, it smells like your favorite shave soap/cream.</li>
            <li>This shaving brush was nicer than I expected the hard plastic has a glossy black finish, easy to clean, I do not miss using my hand to apply shaving cream anymore,</li>
            <li>I prefer a bigger knot and handle and it was difficult to gauge the scale of this one in the picture before I bought it, so when it comes time to buy a new one I will most likely go bigger, but that might be a while because this one seems to be pretty well made and will last a while.</li>
            <li>Shed bristles from first use until the bristles just came un-glued from the handle all together (even though i stored it hanging bristles down).</li>
            <li>Merkur 20C Long Handle Black Double Edge Safety Razor]]), and I knew it would fit in the brush and razor holder that I wanted to get ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend especially if you&#x27;re new to using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This is a less expensive brush and its quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>one minor quibble is the smell that it has when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>The price was right, but this brush was a waste of time.</li>
            <li>During my first two weeks of use, the brush lost a handful of bristles (certainly less than a dozen), but since then none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loose at least 5 hairs or more</li>
            <li>brush gets wet very easily, and I find soaking it for lengthy times to be unnecessary so far.  </li>
            <li>favorite boar bristle brush has been slowly losing some bristles for a few months, and it&#x27;s now nearly 3 years old, so in the meantime I&#x27;ll just use that one.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be fine for now; it has lost a few bristles, but I would have expected that from a brush at this price.</li>
            <li>This isnt as soft as my other, more expensive one, but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and should last as long as the last one, (37 years).  </li>
            <li>Smells like badger, but no worse than any other animal hair brush, and it</li>
            <li>In the days of my youth, I did use a mug and brush, but have long since grown a beard and shave only my neck and don&#x27;t really need a shaving brush as such.  </li>
            <li>it is real badger, and the hairs dont shed other than one here and there</li>
            <li>Not a single hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the head might come undone from constant contact with water, but it&#x27;s solid so far.  </li>
            <li>however I prefer a much firmer brush, especially for the harder creams, (Proraso), and soaps out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so I understand that could be considered heavy usage but don&#x27;t most people shave everyday?  </li>
            <li>Pure Badger, hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is a tight brush that doesn&#x27;t shed as much as my cheaper (and I do mean cheap)</li>
            <li>i would&#x27;ve given this VERY soft brush 5 stars except for one minor glitch: the shaving bristles separated from the handle after only 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try a great bargain and like the stiffer, (not plastic bristle hard, just stiff as compared to this brush), then try the Tweezerman on here for a little over $11 bucks or so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Several purchasers mentioned an unpleasant odor, but upon unpacking, I gave the brush several good sniffs and was not aware of much if any smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I have since tried a couple of other cheap &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; brushes (one of them was not 100% badger as advertised and the knot fell out of handle after a few months).</li>
            <li>cause other than the experience of a very frothy lather for either personal reasons or just to add to the ritual of shaving I have found no added value in using a brush.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems like it will hold up long term.</li>
            <li>(keep it in a proper stand, only wet the tip, don&#x27;t use too much force with it), but I am still losing some.  </li>
            <li>After several uses, the smell dies out and you barely notice it.</li>
            <li>Lost a few hairs in the first 2 uses, haven&#x27;t noticed anything since.</li>
            <li>It is also small and compact (useful for traveling)</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time with the green Poraso cream/soap.</li>
            <li>I recommend soaking it in hot water for a few minutes before shaving to soften it.</li>
            <li>There was quit a bit of shedding at first and after a few weeks of use I am still getting a hair or two</li>
            <li>The bristles started falling out after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>At first it was just a few hairs here and there</li>
            <li>The few times that I have used it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Lost a few hairs the first couple times I used it, but since then (about 6 weeks)</li>
            <li>I expected the loose pieces to end within the first month or two, but it looks like it is going to keep falling apart until I buy another brush.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush if you are just starting off with wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a decent quality brush with minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>For starting out wet shaving I would highly recommend .I</li>
            <li>He wanted to be able to start wet shaving but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the products himself, so I bought this and a few other necessities he&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>bristles are kinda rough and not many of them either but cheap price.</li>
            <li>A few bristles came out during the first couple weeks, but not enough to effect the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li>It shed only a few bristles in its first month of use.</li>
            <li>handle is a simple black plastic, but that is a large reason why I chose to purchase this one.</li>
            <li>Very similar to the GBS pure badger black shaving brush (almost identical but no stand).  </li>
            <li>I am a new proponent to classical wet shaving</li>
            <li>It is much softer, lathers the soap better and loses far less hairs (actually very few hairs in total).</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with the feel of this brush for the amount of money spent, I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever</li>
            <li>few hairs have fallen out, but that was only really the first few uses, now it i don&#x27;t see any fall out.</li>
            <li>okay, but smelled badly when you get it wet to use, and shed bristles alarmingly quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a very classy look--no extraneous markings, just a quality brush with a beautiful black base.</li>
            <li>noticed that it&#x27;s hard to clean the brush after I shave, but I simply run it under the faucet and squeeze out the excess water and let it air dry in the medicine</li>

            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> My son in law loved this.  </li>
            <li> The brush bristles are good, but the adhesive which held the bristles in the handle did not hold well</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is good and the brush softened up after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for close to a year, and it is still in just as good of condition as the day it arrived.  </li>
            <li> it is what it is...a good brush and seems to be well made.  </li>
            <li> Good for the money though.</li>
            <li> (I also gave him some good shaving cream as well).</li>

            <li> and then I&#x27;ve found one fallen out, but it lathers and feels really good on my face and neck.</li>

            <li> It seems of good quality.</li>
            <li> This one is just as good.</li>

            <li> If you choose to place an order, I hope you get one of the good ones.</li>
            <li> This brush is every bit as good and cost a fraction of the one</li>
            <li> Do buy a good scented soap - I suggest one that has menthol as it cools your face as you shave.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a good alternative to the Art of Shaving badger brush, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> it is good quality for the price.  </li>

            <li> I may not be a shaving connoisseur (read snob), but I do know what feels good and works nicely.  </li>
            <li> It was a good brush to see whether I liked DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> It provides a good lather and has a nice volume of bristles extending from the knot.</li>
            <li> I thought I was taking good care of it too, always drying it and using warm water.</li>
            <li> handle is nice and has a good grip.</li>

            <li> You get a nice lather using barber&#x27;s soap and any razor.</li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled with this</li>
            <li> It is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> and then swirl it in my ceramic mug until I get nice lather.</li>
            <li> Also got a good deal on Astra DE shaving blades. :-)</li>
            <li> While I have not used it, it is nice looking and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> but It seems like a nice brush.</li>
            <li> : the brush was nice, but after about 4 months started shedding a LOT.</li>
            <li> Nice density on the bristles.</li>
            <li> He is loving this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than I&#x27;d like, and when I received it the bristles were kind of going every which way.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the best gift!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush for the price.</li>

            <li> So was loving this brush (used it for a month) and the knot and the handle separated.</li>
            <li> This was a nice brush from 2 to 12 months.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush a lot.  </li>
            <li> and it looks nice sitting there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the beginning to DE shaving like myself, over time I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better brush once this one kicks the bucket.</li>
            <li> There was no undo odor before the break in but after and since, it retains a nice fragrant aroma even after the shave and cleaning of the brush.</li>
            <li> It soaks up the water well and holds its shape nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, nice weight, stable handle.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, gift to my grandson and husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are probably better brushes on the market, but this is a great entry level brush to get someone used to the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush which does lather up well.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is good quality and it does not shed more than it should.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled with this brush.</li>
            <li> BUT to be honest; it does what its suppose to</li>
            <li> It whips up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how this type of product could be excellent.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my shaving stand though.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and it lathers the soap well, but I end up with three or four pieces of fiber on your face every time I shave.</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly (from Simply Beautiful) and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> This brush lathers up very nicely and applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It works great with soap as well as creams and makes a rich lather.</li>
            <li> not fancy but work great, rich lather</li>
            <li> Good brush in general, excellent for the price.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush, rinses out easily and is really good value</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this brush and to top it off</li>
            <li> Brush looks great but the hair is full of what looks like wood glue.</li>
            <li> Good brush , when paired with taylor of old bond street cream makes a very good lather</li>

            <li> good quality was easy to break in.</li>
            <li> very soft bristles and excellent brush to apply shaving soap</li>
            <li> Excellent lather, very comfortable and easy to use, seems to maintain excellent condition after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I take this to be a good sign that it is genuine badger hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> But so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with it so far and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great products, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The difference is amazing; I can build a better lather in a fifth of the time.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely sensitive skin it may not be the best for you.  </li>
            <li> Applies smoothly to your skin, a really good deal for this quality item</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and create an excellent lather.  </li>
            <li> Good way to get started on the cheap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather as nicely as the better ones and hairs come out with each use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best brush I used so far.</li>
            <li> The brush is great and well worth my money.</li>
            <li> While it did shed a good amount at first, it seems to have stopped doing so (for whatever reason) for the time being and is holding together fairly well after months of use.  </li>
            <li> They are also just the right length so that you can get great lather without it dissipating when applied.</li>
            <li> I picked mine up for pocket change over $30, it&#x27;s top quality, beautiful and a brilliant first DE Safety razor (thanks to badger and blade community for the</li>
            <li> Very nice brush and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works great for the money and while it is not the softest, most luxurious brush, for the money it is 100% worth it.  </li>
            <li> Of my three brushes I own, this has already moved to the top as my favorite.  </li>
            <li> What can I say that hasnt been said, great quality, only 4-5 hairs fell out in the first 2-3 weeks and none since then...feels amazing and is great quality!</li>
            <li> A beautiful brush that works real well</li>
            <li> I wish that the density of the bristles were a bit higher, but I am happy with it for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I happy with my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> While I could probably fix this with some epoxy, I don&#x27;t own any, and obtaining some would probably not be worth it considering this thing costs barely more than a tube of good epoxy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to whip up a great lather with this brush and it holds water well.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made product.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth and holds the soap well.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and holds a lather well.</li>
            <li> in all it gives a good lather, dries quickly and cleans easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being from the same company, the fit was naturally perfect and BOTH are equally exceptional items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great price for a 100% Pure Badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Very good at the price, so far.</li>
            <li> it is very good so far ( one month use till now)...</li>
            <li> This brush is full, high quality, and the perfect stocking stuffer for your handsome lover.</li>
            <li> Much better then Boar Bristle brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;would leave more hair on my face than wiskers.  </li>
            <li> I have been a brush shaver for many years</li>
            <li> Hoping to get more use out of it, but guess not.</li>
            <li> Could not ask for a better brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it but haven&#x27;t been able to find something more durable as an adhesive.  </li>
            <li> This brush looks like it will weather the shower better</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The stiffness and density is great but the hairs fallout quite readily.</li>
            <li> It feels absolutely great and lathers soap very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times, and it falls apart more and more each time.</li>
            <li> maybe there s better ones, but i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> What more do you need in a brush?</li>
            <li> For the price I am happy - I did not want to spend too much money, but wanted to see what &amp;#34;pure badger&amp;#34; is all about.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Husband seems pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed a renaissance of shaving since I discovered the brush and soap with DE razors.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine needing a better product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush?</li>
            <li> Much better than the boar hair brush</li>
            <li> If the knot were secured to the handle better, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> but I just use my fingers to lather and it works better for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a month or two, and it&#x27;s working slightly better than the Escali brush I also have, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> 2 more dollars for 100 blade.</li>
            <li> The whole set has exceeded my expectations and they look great</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a beginner brush and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than the kit one from Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer the longer handle to help whip faster to get a better lather.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after the one my grandpa gave me started to lose more bristles than it had.</li>
            <li> In two shavings, more bristles fell out than I could count.</li>
            <li> top quality as always</li>
            <li> I love using this brush, I just wished I started using it years ago.  </li>
            <li> Problem solved and a much better shave as a bonus.</li>
            <li> The brush lost 3 bristles during this process and after using it for a couple of weeks it hasn&#x27;t lost any more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a badger hair brush for cheap!</li>
            <li> I thought it would never get better</li>
            <li> this lovely brush along with the shaving cream make for the most out standing shave</li>
            <li> Badger is so much better than synthetic or boars hair brushes.</li>
            <li> And it is ecological also - allowing one to dispense with cans of shaving foam and utilization of electrical power!</li>
            <li> sincerely Dexter</li>
            <li> OK starter brush.</li>
            <li> I switched to a $60 model from Parker that was much, much better</li>
            <li> Ok product for the price and value.</li>
            <li> I assumed that one coming in a kit must be of lower quality and that an &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; model must be better.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I love it.</li>
            <li> However, after some time of using it the smell did mostly go away so given time it does get better.</li>
            <li> Every time since then I lose many bristles each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than and better than many boar brushes in this or any price range.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great brush , the soap and brush make the shave much easier</li>
            <li> Will probably glue it back on, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with the construction quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing more.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will find a better brush than this for the money.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, I have purchased a number of these from box stores they didn&#x27;t last, this one seems to be way ahead of the others.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood - Top quality.</li>
            <li> I had a boar&#x27;s hair brush when I got this badger brush and the difference is like nigh &amp; day, this one holds so much more lather  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone and that it would be even better if used with a stand.</li>
            <li> Glad I went on Amazon and found this one.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and get great lather with the Williams soap I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> , it should be OK.  </li>
            <li> But I think, had the brush been better made, this should not have happened.</li>
            <li> and I like it better each day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for its price!</li>
            <li> I will look again for another brush but try and find something made with better quality.</li>
            <li> At this price though, you can afford to buy more than one shaving brush.</li>
            <li> However, it does get better with each use and goes away all together within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Badger brushes are the most desirable because they tend to hold a lot of water which is essential for the best close, razor shave.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave every day at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never used a shaving brush before, but my friend gifted me a shaving set and along with the SimplyBeautiful shaving brush, my shaving experience has changed.</li>
            <li> suppose there must be better brushes out there.</li>
            <li> The Basic would be one of the best products I&#x27;ve used even if it&#x27;s priced was tripled.</li>
            <li> Much better quality.</li>
            <li> Just remember, we all have different skin sensitivities, and you must try out what works best for you.</li>
            <li> and if I didn&#x27;t know better I would swear they sent my a 50-60$ brush by accident.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfectly serviceable, but i admit that it&#x27;s lighter and smaller than i would prefer.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m losing 10 or more every shave.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the manufacturer could add more glue?</li>
            <li> Produces nice smooth, not frothy, lather with Arko or Proraso.</li>
            <li> For the price, quality, real badger,  and the fact it was shipped from the US, it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I might be able to force it, but I don&#x27;t want to break my shaving stand.</li>
            <li> I love lathering my face with this brush.</li>
            <li> but I wish I had gotten one that was a bit better.</li>
            <li> but there don&#x27;t seem to be many bristles accumulating in the drain screen.</li>
            <li> Many traditionalists out there would probably not approve of the plastic handle, but I am more utilitarian than most.</li>
            <li> It lathers better than non-beaver brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not something you are going to use for more than a couple of months.</li>
            <li> My room-mate also owns this brush so I was able to test it myself.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, as I wasn&#x27;t sure I would continue shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> The brush is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Well, it wasn&#x27;t okay.</li>
            <li> so cheap!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of how my baldness started :-).</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> This also occurred with my precious cheaper brush.</li>
            <li> There needs to be a better way for attaching the two pieces rather than a dab of glue.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to those that cost much more</li>
            <li> I got this 6 months ago and love it.</li>
            <li> But I ended up just getting a better brush after learning a bit more about safety razor</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t really work up a great lather.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend more than 25 bucks for a badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t want to invest to much money..</li>
            <li> If it were for myself, I would be inclined to spend more and buy a simpson brush but for those on a budget then it works well.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more for my dad, my son, and my brother..</li>
            <li> The 7 dollar having kit at Walmart has a better brush in the kit</li>
            <li> Making a nice lather, and comfortable to hold, this brush is proving to be a better buy than others I&#x27;ve had for twice the price.</li>
            <li> Received the brush in a timely manner and have enjoyed the way it sets up my beard.</li>
            <li> It looks more costly than it is.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I am so glad I kept it.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I could not justify buying a more expensive/quality brush.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using soap and brush to shave for many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However I&#x27;m quite glad</li>
            <li> more visits to Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but seemed to shed a bit.</li>
            <li> I love the brush.</li>
            <li> I use about a finger tip amount of Art of Shaving cream, and I can lather up 3 or more times.</li>
            <li> so I feel safe in recommending the quality of the construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe this will get better the more I shave with it.</li>
            <li> It was OK...</li>
            <li> Produced good lather and hold the right amount of water and product for me.</li>
            <li> As good as a shaving brush can get with just the right size and stiffness.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the handle is plastic and doesn&#x27;t look like an elegant antique, but if you are looking for high quality at a great price, this is the brush to buy.  </li>
            <li> After getting all my items together i was very excited on the deal i found for the Badger brush.</li>
            <li> sometimes the old ways are the good ways!</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush at a decent price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smelt nice and clean when in the package</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly reccommend it</li>
            <li> This brush appeared to be high quality and worked great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t seem to shed very much and works up a good lather.</li>
            <li> that new brushes sometimes have.&lt;br /&gt;Works great with creams, and although I&#x27;ve used it with soap a stiffer brush would be better.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to do, and the brush has performed perfectly well since then.  </li>
            <li> Feels good, lathers great, nice and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a pretty good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes a pretty good lather</li>
            <li> Just as good as brushes priced 2x higher.</li>
            <li> This seems like pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> After first shave it all good.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Pretty good bang for your buck</li>
            <li> Works pretty good (at any price).  </li>
            <li> Quite smooth and easy on the face too!</li>
            <li> Plus the handle is easy to be reused with a better knot when you grow out of this one.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller brush and this fit my need perfectly.</li>
            <li> Brush is very very soft and feels great.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and for a great price.</li>
            <li> It looks great and is very soft.  </li>
            <li> After prepping the bristles are very soft and work up a great lather.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush lathers up nice bristles very tight in brush good brush for the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great beginner&#x27;s shave brush for determining if you really want to give this kind of shaving a go, but I will be upgrading to a more rugged brush that doesn&#x27;t shed as much as I do.</li>
            <li> For the most part it has been fine.</li>
            <li> For the price its at the pure badger shaving brush is a good starter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line:  Very good feel and quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Both last months, no cans to throw away, and give very good close shaves.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly, dries nicely, and sheds very little.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the box it had a huge scratch on the top of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> honestly, i don&#x27;t know any better, first time buying and using this sort of product, nevertheless, its been about a month</li>
            <li> I fixed it with some superglue, but this is not an uncommon problem for this brush.</li>
            <li> Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm have been giving him great, close, shaves without causing irritation.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles, great lather</li>
            <li> This brush works great for me so far.</li>
            <li> The Escali brush is 100 times better for a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> Great if you lather directly to face.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more satisfying then putting hot lather on your face and working it in with a genuine badger haired brush, the closeness of shave you get is amazing</li>
            <li> I believe this to be an okay brush, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my Escali shaving stand.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s okay for the history buffs, but frankly, the shaving cream available on the market today beats yesteryear&#x27;s, so</li>
            <li> This brush is ver soft and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, the softness and feel of the brush is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Most pharmacies will give these bottles for free.</li>
            <li> handle is plastic which is good too, because it won&#x27;t be affected so much by the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of wet-shaving.</li>
            <li> He really loves using this badger brush and getting a good lather with shaving soap.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s not bad, but you can certainly do better with just a bit more money.</li>
            <li> I bought a Parker brush that I use every day and loved it so much that I bought one of these for my travel kit.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special!  </li>
            <li> if you like the softness then a high end very large knot brush may be ideal for you.</li>
            <li> So I spend less, $12, and I am quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;good brush good value</li>
            <li> This brush is so much better than the boars hair brush I originally used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything from them regarding the brush other than my brother said it was the best shave ever</li>
            <li> It hold water well and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easily create lather, soft/smooth application of soap to face.  </li>
            <li> It cleans fairly easily as well.</li>
            <li> Sheds hairs easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> and easily works up a lather.</li>
            <li> In 3 weeks of use,  I have found it produces a great lather (with Taylors Old Bond Street shaving cream),  it feels comfortable while whisking it around my face,  and is easy to care for.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> had the strong animal odor that this one does.  </li>
            <li> : Been using the brush for a couple of months now, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Bristles feel nice and works up a very good lather, but like some other reviewers, the bristles came unglued from the handle fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth handle just the right size.</li>
            <li> Well, to make a long story quick, these are just wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it&#x27;s been absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but first time I used it the hair fell off the handle.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Escali brush and simple beautiful stand.</li>
            <li> I soaked the brush in some warm water for about an hour before I first used it.  </li>
            <li> it sheds more hair than my bald head, otherwise it is not a bad brush.</li>
            <li> It works up a good lather and the bristles really get your beard ready for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> It also rinses easily and still looks as good as new.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is so smooth against your skin and raises a far superior lather in comparison to the cheap brush.  :-)</li>
            <li> Being new to the art of shaving I wanted to find a good quality, un-emblazoned badger brush that wasn&#x27;t going to break the bank.</li>
            <li> I have had this a while now and holding up just fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li> The brush is just fine now and is quite acceptable.</li>
            <li> It smells fine when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this one just fine.</li>
            <li> The handle is plastic, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 of them,and its working fine.</li>
            <li> I could have got by just fine with this brush .</li>
            <li> A great shaving brush at a great price - the brush is soft but firm enough to work up an excellent lather.  </li>
            <li> It did fine the 1st shave but after that, the bristles started to fall off after every shave.</li>
            <li> This brush seems fine to me.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and feels fine on the face</li>
            <li> this brush for the price had worked fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine &amp; dandy.</li>
            <li> The brush seems fine; some of the bristles have been coming off with use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care, the beautiful feeling of these soft quality bristles on my face is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I paired this brush with &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving Acrylic Black Brush Stand&amp;#34; it fits perfect.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat that good old Badger hair!</li>
            <li> Easily makes a great lather when used properly, even with a cheapo can of shaving cream!</li>
            <li> Holds a good lather, is soft on my face and easy to wash and maintain.  </li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and the soft bristles make a good lather.</li>
            <li> This is my very first shaving brush and so far, it does great.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic handle, but the quality of the brush bristles are all I cared about and they are fine and the grip is acceptable.</li>
            <li> Its amazing what a difference pure badger makes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I lathered-and-rinsed it a few times, and since then it&#x27;s fine, and performs wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> Gives a great coating, bristles aren&#x27;t harsh whatsoever and even has quite a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I was able to establish a nice lather, but lost a considerable amount of bristles in the bowl in the process (maybe 5-10).</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Great price badger hair is perfect especially after a few uses.</li>
            <li> but it does a fantastic job at foaming up soaps.</li>
            <li> is that I enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further, the company from where I purchased this seems to genuinely care about their customers and the products they sell - that will keep me coming back!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap kit to try it out and found the boar hair brush a bit lacking.  </li>
            <li> story short, a great entry level brush for the beginner wanting to try out a badger brush.</li>
            <li> after a lot of reading / YouTube research, I found that taking care of the brush is as important as shaving itself...</li>
            <li> For that price, the fact that it performs as well as it does is fantastic and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also used it with African Shea butter (which does not foam) and it did a great job with it as well.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s quite smooth and comfortable and spreads the cream around well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s after I bought the Omega 13109, which is a fantastic brush, by the way.</li>
            <li> It applies cream to the face smoothly, and it cleans up easilly.  </li>
            <li> This Badger hair brush and a bar of shaving soap creates a great lather and the soap will last over a year.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap shaving brush with synthetic bristles before this one and it just did not compare.</li>
            <li> Bristles are smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I already had a great experience with the wooden one, i didn&#x27;t think twice about throwing this one in my travel bag</li>
            <li> the instructor used a shaving brush to apply a light coat of CLP/ CL to a pistol/ revolver surface.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, I got one for my son.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> The cheap glue that was used stuck to the brush, and not the handle.  </li>
            <li> I liked this one so much I bought another, one for home and office.</li>
            <li> Stands can look nice, but aren&#x27;t really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to do light stipple work with faux painting.  </li>
            <li> Once the brush blooms out, it really loads up nicely.  </li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t go cheap on something you use a RAZOR with...</li>
            <li> Comfortable against the skin during usage.</li>
            <li> Cheap, works well.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li> doesnt fit in my shaving stand though...</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a step-up from my cheap bore brush.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> In short, this is simply a great brush</li>
            <li> It feels smooth on the face and holds the lather.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily because I wanted a brush with a synthetic handle, as I like to presoak my brush and have had problems with low-mid priced brushes cracking eventually or the knot coming free from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i would get boar hair, the makers of this make this cheap by cut to shape the bristles</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> But it is cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> NOT the cheap plastic feel I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Heavy handle, excellent bristle shape cut,</li>
            <li> I use this brush holder with the Muehle Tortoise Shaving Brush Holder, also available from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have another cheap brush that is working on two years with no signs of faltering any time soon.  </li>
            <li> Really great brush, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> this brush does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> sometimes paying for better quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> Builds a great lather and definitely helps you get a smoother and closer shave.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be of good quality</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, build a good lather, and get under your whiskers well.</li>
            <li> But, soft isn&#x27;t always good.</li>
            <li> I understand how SimplyBeautiful is able to give such a good deal on a badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> It whips up a good lather, but the hair isn&#x27;t as soft on my face as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison as the badger brush is far superior.</li>
            <li> This basic brush works very well and is probably the best value that I&#x27;ve seen in badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are fairly soft, and the brush helps create a good lather.</li>
            <li> so far so good......</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Soft after breaking it in, good backbone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a really soft massage, and it lathers the soap so good.</li>
            <li> soft, but has a good bursh</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a month now and so far it&#x27;s been a good brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush is of good quality, yet feels soft on skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, the low price made me suspicious, but with all the good reviews posted here, I figured it was okay to take a chance.</li>
            <li> It does give me a good lather and is fairly soft on the face.</li>
            <li> so I am sure this brush is high quality and it is very soft and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Very nice brush, with minimal initial shedding of hairs, at a very good price.  </li>
            <li> I cannot argue with the price for this brush, and it does a very fine job of applying my Musgo Real shaving cream!</li>
            <li> this brush for all your shaving brush needs as it&#x27;s an excellent product at the right price, just don&#x27;t smell it while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quickly and holds nice shape.</li>
            <li> This brush has no hairs falling out, is very full, cleans up well, and does a super job of lathering the soap; as well as preparing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is good; soft and provides a rich lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now, it won&#x27;t stop shedding bristles and it has a very distinct chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good quality genuine badger hair brush at an economical price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have anything recent to compare it to, but seems very nice.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill, and even before my DE razor arrived, significantly improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Glad this item was available online for a very reasonable price compared to specialty shops.</li>
            <li> But, after you get the hang of wet shaving, it&#x27;s best to go for a custom-made or higher quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent little brush!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The contrast is significant.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use in the first place.</li>
            <li> I believe my original brush was Horse</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush to use during a deployment to Afghanistan, and didn&#x27;t want to spend anything significant on something just to use there.</li>
            <li> Probably 50-80 hairs in my shave soap and more on my legs with the first use.</li>
            <li> Although I cannot compare it to an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; Badger Brush, I am very satisfied with my experience thus far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this and originally thought it was the clay I was applying</li>
            <li> I use Weleda shaving cream (don&#x27;t kid yourself, shaving cream will have a significant impact on your experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon first shave, I was struck by an interesting aroma.  </li>
            <li> Excellent small brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> : I originally ordered two of these.</li>
            <li> On my first shave, when I was gathering up a lather with my soap, I noticed it did a way better job than the boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it lost a dozen or more hairs.</li>
            <li> smell when you first start using it, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and will hopefully go away soon.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find one</li>
            <li> shave results in significant loss of hair from the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Rich</li>
            <li> I prefer a brush with a bigger head of bristles so it holds more lather and a better handle with more grip surface.</li>
            <li> It has a hint of scent, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a higher quality one even if you have to pay 50% more.  </li>
            <li> This brush is good in a sense that it lathers very well and that it is a pure badger brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and absorb water very well and also makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, it is better than nothing - hence two stars, but it sheds a lot, it is made of low quality hair and the results doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to comparably priced boar brushes.</li>
            <li> believe they used the amonia to clean</li>
            <li> Not much I can say about this brush, if you have ever used a badger hair brush, then this is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and certainly more affordable.</li>
            <li> It holds heat well from my shave bowl hot water pre-soak; my shave cream keeps a fair amount of heat throughout my shave, and I normally do one pass with the grain and follow that up with one against the grain.</li>
            <li> This one was significantly cheaper, but it was most certainly a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft!</li>
            <li> im old school for a better, cheaper shave!&lt;br /&gt;i dont buy $300 brushes and 40 pucks of soap!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other brushes that I&#x27;ve had over the years (I&#x27;m 68), this is absolutely the best one.</li>
            <li> This is really a good looking shaving brush, but after using them for over 40 years, this one falls apart more than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Sir Fancy Pants&#x27;s Favorite Pure Silver Badger Blah, Blah?  </li>
            <li> I did not purchase the Simply Beautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush to use as a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to hold and should last many years .</li>
            <li> I think this brush is hard to beat for the price, and even if it isn&#x27;t quite your preference it will be a great travel brush or back-up to toss into your toiletry case!</li>
            <li> The large size and firm bristles create a great lather and condition your beard nicely to prep for a shaze with your safety/straight razor.</li>
            <li> Great little brush,  Nice looking handle and the bristles are very well secured to it.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels more fantastic, smooth, or manly as an old fashioned shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush and you see others like it from competitors that are priced multiple times higher than this one.</li>
            <li> Still a great value for a beginning wet shaver.</li>
            <li> Bristles are staying in pretty good so far</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this brush is great for the discerning wet shaver.</li>
            <li> it  worked and i believe it will work a lot better as i reacquire the talent and remember it is not the good old days of a soft beard</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money for a GOOD badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft shaving brush.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a safety razor I wanted the full effect.</li>
            <li> Except while priced good this one fell apart after only 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Good brush overall.</li>
            <li> That is true, a silvertip boar brush will be a softer brush.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away and switching back to a really good Excelsior Boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li> I should have gone the extra $40 and bought a good brush</li>
            <li> Follow initial cleaning recommendations to the letter and you are good to go with a great wet shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice weighted feel and the bristles are soft &amp; dense.</li>
            <li> Of course, he doesn&#x27;t really need it, since (as I&#x27;m sure you probably know), badgers don&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used this brush daily for a couple months now and its been really good.</li>
            <li> Recipient was pleased, now my husband wants one for himself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting a real shaving kit turns shaving from a chore into an enjoyable activity</li>
            <li> I believe those things are true for almost every badger brush.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, soft body of bristles, and it does what you would want a brush to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lifts my beard better as well and does not blossom out as much.</li>
            <li> I have just started shaving with a safety razor and all my research said I need a shaving brush for the full experience.  </li>
            <li> and it stayed there ever since, overall still a good product</li>
            <li> Overall, the product seems to be fairly well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but it seems reslly good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for starting your set up.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush but is a bit scratchy , since I have sensitive skin on one side of my face it doesn&#x27;t work for me after a couple of uses</li>
            <li> It is a true steal at the advertised price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Basic but looks good and does the job.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> The brush is just a bit prickly on the face, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> For the money it is not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> NO bad smell at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad beginner brush.</li>
            <li> compact brush, hasn&#x27;t shed much, tight knot, shave good, woman like, me like!</li>
            <li> The black plastic or resin handle of the brush is smooth, weighty, and attractive.  </li>
            <li> Brush is awesome and very soft keeps its shape even when wet.</li>
            <li> A higher end brush will easily be close to $80 range.</li>
            <li> brush handle seems to be made of a strong material and looks exactly like the photo for the listing.</li>
            <li> After the first month it hasn&#x27;t lost any and is still holding strong and doing its job well.</li>
            <li> It sheds a little bit more than I would like, but again for an inexpensive first brush, I say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money compared to other Badger Shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> Check out some other great shaving products at discount prices here.</li>
            <li> Boy was I excited to have a &amp;#34;real razor&amp;#34; and this led me down a dark decade long rabbit hole under the belief that Gillette&#x27;s multi-bladed face killing monstrosities were the best of the best!</li>
            <li> My first brush, so I&#x27;m not an expert by any means, but it does the job, works well, and has held up just fine.  </li>
            <li> Smells at first, but is fine after a week or two of shaving use.</li>
            <li> It makes lather rapidly and rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li> No bristles falling out, dries quickly after use.</li>
            <li> a Jagger DE89L. All have nearly same price, do the same job, excellent tools.</li>
            <li> and it quickly fluffs out and dries--and not in that clumpy way a lot of brushes do that aren&#x27;t badger.</li>
            <li> Who knows, it may last for many more months.</li>
            <li> While super affordable, I feel like you also lose quality with the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick brush.</li>
            <li> However, if you soak it in a mild dishwashing soap solution for an hour, lather it up with your shaving soap, let it sit overnight, and then rinse well</li>
            <li> I got some william&#x27;s mug soap, clubman aftershave, parker double edged razor and this brush, wallah my shave was 30x more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Though don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did; starting off with Best Badger then regressing to boar bristle and up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the initial quality, the shipment and the low price point to start.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Super Safety Razors Chrome Shaving Brush Stand to go with it.</li>
            <li> i would go a step up and purchase a super badger</li>
            <li> Love the product and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend it most highly.</li>
            <li> Wash in warm dish-washing soap and water, rinse, soak for 30 minutes to an hour in the same kind of solution, rinse, and then work up a lather of your favorite shaving soap or cream, and let it dry overnight in the brush.  </li>
            <li> My first shave brush and it is performing as well as the most positive reviews mention.  </li>
            <li> Hairs came out on the very first use and have never stopped coming out.  </li>
            <li> Significantly softer and easily create lather than older brush.  </li>
            <li> , again I this is my very first shaving brush</li>
            <li> My biggest concern about the brush itself is the &amp;#34;pure badger bristles&amp;#34; apparently have some kind of dye in them which turns my lather gray.</li>
            <li> I sometimes feel foolish paying a higher price when there are lower-priced alternatives available.</li>
            <li> It was my first shaving brush and the fact that it was badger hair and was so cheap.</li>
            <li> :  Now, be aware that this is a cheap brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as the bristles stay on, it should prove to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The only caveat or problem I&#x27;ve experienced is that it does shed a decent amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad its 100% pure, as my badger is really a stickler about purity!  </li>
            <li> I am new to the DE shaving and really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> For less than $12.00 delivered this brush is a great value.  </li>
            <li> After about a month and a half this brush is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> I could say it&#x27;s a great starter brush, but truth be told I&#x27;m a long-standing shaver and use it as a typical go-to brush.</li>
            <li> It is pretty soft and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Holds a pretty good amount of lather, usually enough for three passes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really very stable and don&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li> but it certainly works just fine</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, it did smell funny at first, but a good soak got rid of most of that, and the rest was gone within a couple shaves (it starts smelling like your shaving cream/</li>
            <li> Now that he&#x27;s tried it, he loves wet shaving a lot more than regular ol&#x27; disposable blade shaving, so I&#x27;d say this was a great investment and a good buy for anyone looking to get into wet shaving for fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> I recommend it heartily for the price, but wash it first!  </li>
            <li> For slightly more, there are many other options - look at various shaving forums before buying something like this and feel free to ask them what you should be looking at - you will get honest helpful answers.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> must say that I was pleasantly surprised, if not shocked, at how nice this brush really is though.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I would suggest this to anyone who need a new brush or is just starting to shave with a brush.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one (this time an Escali badger-hair brush, which is far superior).</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I was using it right away.  </li>
            <li> It has lost only one single hair since I started using it, and helps make a wonderful lather with the shave stick I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the less the brush is very nice and the handle is glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There has been little to no shedding and it fits great in my Colonel Conk stand.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> I have little to compare it to, but it works great for me.  </li>
            <li> A great little shaving brush for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, affordable little luxury.</li>
            <li> I also generally shave in the shower making it easy to lather up, shave and rinse easily.  </li>
            <li> Cup &amp; brush are the ONLY way to get a decent, warm shave!</li>
            <li> I guess my use of this very good brush will be permanent or at least long-term.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush purchase, and after having this, I see no reason to spend more for some ridiculously overpriced brush that would win the approval of the shaving snobs.  </li>
            <li> it does need  a little finesse with rinsing, but for the price, you can&#x27;t honestly ask for better</li>
            <li> But after reading a few pointers about soaking the brush in soapy dishwater, I noticed the smell diminished greatly.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t complain for how cheap this brush is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thinner, lighter and looks a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Probably not for everyday use, but great for a travel backup.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Looks good and works as well as many that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as nice and doesn&#x27;t produce the same lather.  </li>
            <li> For the cost, it is easily worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It looks nice and simple with no markings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not the most soft brush, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for a beginner to wet shaving or a veteran as well.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I bought this simply for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about the importance of using a good shaving brush for wet shaving and it seems badger hair brushes are the way to go.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> After using it for a bit, my advice would be to skip it and go directly to something better.</li>
            <li> Everyone should know animal brush will smell when wet, and you wash it out, and then use a good scent shave soap, and let it sit overnight, to condition it.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as a silver-tip badger but much more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The texture of the brush is soft and my beard hair is exfoliated out from skin to give a closer and a better quality shave.</li>
            <li> But I have been pleasantly surprised and got more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li> in all, nice enough.</li>
            <li> Lathers up fast and almost magical in how fast it does this.</li>
            <li> This brush is a step up and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Almost makes shaving fun.</li>
            <li> He says the lather is nice and thick, the bristles are soft and are holding up great.</li>
            <li> It still smells after I have conditioned it several times by leaving it overnight lathered in nice shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I find it really soft and love using it.</li>
            <li> Love these old fashioned brushes.  </li>
            <li> SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Razor and Brush Stand, Chrome]] for proper storage/drying.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles producing smooth buttery strokes!</li>
            <li> in all, for the money the brush is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent choice for those starting a wet shaving routine.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied so far with the ability to lather.</li>
            <li> It will be a good brush as soon as the wet bager smell goes away.</li>
            <li> He was getting break outs, so I bought him this new brush (always keep your brush clean!)</li>
            <li> Very economical and plenty of foam to lather up your face 3-4 times (which you may need with straight edge razor).</li>
            <li> This brush is soft, yet, very effective in stimulating the face prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall I have tried 4-5 other brushes and this is the best of them (under 25$)</li>
            <li> Pretty good shave and better than others more expensive</li>
            <li> It has a decent size knot that will definitely whisk up a good lather every time.</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much softer on the skin compared to my original brush.</li>
            <li> If your just getting into wet shaving and want an inexpensive (I won&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;) brush to see if it&#x27;s for you or are looking for a good travel brush this one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does a good job</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> The price was right, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It popped right out, glue and all.</li>
            <li> Now the price is right and the brush does the job.</li>
            <li> right when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the right size and easier to control.</li>
            <li> I remember the supplier emailed wanting a review right away.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the bristles can be used in fly tying and you will still be able to your Pure Badger Brush for cleaning, at least until you&#x27;ve tied a whole lot of flies.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, totally great little brush!</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the smell that other (typically older) reviews have commented on.</li>
            <li> Great brush with very little \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of bristles.</li>
            <li> For such an economically priced shaving brush, this little brush is superb - and well made!  </li>
            <li> it being a cheaper solid black brush), it&#x27;s beautifully crafted!</li>
            <li> Just a couple of drops in the middle of the bristles to apply a light protective coating to weapon metal in a easy to control amount.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter brush if you&#x27;re not sure about shaving like this yet.</li>
            <li> Then, you&#x27;ll still have enough left to take your lady (she&#x27;ll love the shave) out to a nice dinner.  </li>
            <li> A lot of sites will state that badger is better than boar in general, and that might be true, when you are looking at brushes costing 5 times as much as this</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t very well give it a 5 star rating without full test results.</li>
            <li> For home use I&#x27;ve only used cheap boar bristle brushes, which I&#x27;ve always felt were good enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Spend a bit more to get a better quality brush, as you&#x27;ll be buying another in the near future anyway...</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush and for the price real good,it is fairly soft as from what I understand badger is supposed to be but not too soft</li>
            <li> This is a great price for some one new to wet shaving so go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced right for my first brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen100 % Pure Badger Shaving Brush from $50 - $75 bucks!</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive face then I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price I paid, but after loosing a few bristles in the bugging it&#x27;s been holding great.</li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made for the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> I would like a shaving brush a bit firmer and stronger bristles in the future purchase of my shaving brushes, but it&#x27;s nice to have a reasonably priced and quality product all in one.</li>
            <li> The bristles have not come off, even after a month, and the handle is solid and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Mostly, a good brush also exfoliates (less ingrown hairs, and so bumps)</li>
            <li> Warms quick and holds soap really well.</li>
            <li> Good quality and soft on the skin , Would definitely recommend to all for&lt;br /&gt;comfy shaving .</li>
            <li> The brush works great, but you really need to use it a few times with a fragrant soap before the smell subsides.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> You have to be very gentle rinsing off the brush.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast with no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all, a fine product and a bargain, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> Works fine and replaces my old one.  </li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and this brush has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Certainly well worth the money.</li>
            <li> While it is not as soft bristle tipped, as a Silver-tip badger brush, this still gives good exfoliation; without going to far (not excessively prickly).</li>
            <li> Initial smell was strong, but quickly went away after soaking overnight.  </li>
            <li> The handle isn&#x27;t fancy but it is a nice glossy black and works adequately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is not floppy, and so it&#x27;s great for hard soaps, or creams/\\&quot;croaps\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fantastic, amazing, special brush.</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as that 30 year old brush but is very full and holds lots of soap as compared to my old brush that has lost so many bristles.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, i have used really expensive brushes</li>
            <li> during the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better and more expensive brushes out there, but I must say this brush did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you spend the extra money and get a better quality brush from say &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; or others.</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for several weeks now am am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Only one thing would make it better.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the brush lasting more than a year</li>
            <li> This is my first brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it maybe 4 or 5 times now and hair is still falling out pretty consistently.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pleasure to use and for the price it is very well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was using a cheaper boar bristle brush of the same size and I like badger better.  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger shaving brush, and it works like a champ produces a lot of lather with the Arko shaving stick.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> It smelled quite gamy first time under the faucet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the brush I noticed a foul odor coming from it.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit concerned about the smell of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I will say I didn&#x27;t notice any wet badger smell as I was applying my shaving cream which is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s such a difference, but my first guess is magic.</li>
            <li> exactly what you expect for the price.  </li>
            <li> Never in my wildest dreams would I have believed that badger hair would be so soft and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to those looking for their first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is significantly better than my last</li>
            <li> (yes I cleaned it first)  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even fix it enough to be able to wrap it</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve bought since switching to safety razors, so I cannot compare it to others.  </li>
            <li> I super glued it back on and works fine now.</li>
            <li> smelled a bit funny to begin with, but that is wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> I washed it, soaked it, and even used a pretty fragrant shaving cream with it.</li>
            <li> Brush smelled alittle funky at first</li>
            <li> with hot water and dish soap WELL, let sit in soapy water for some time....</li>
            <li> but sure enough, within about three or four days it didn&#x27;t smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Simple, Cheap, Prime eligible... go for it!</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I tried when I switched to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> /foams I think has really made a difference in the shave I get!</li>
            <li> Sure a bristle falls out every now and then.. but find me a premium brush that doesn&#x27;t do the same..</li>
            <li> it is the exact brush that I had lost.it leathers well with any soap and retains its shape .I</li>
            <li> I saw others priced higher but decided to try this one out.  </li>
            <li> in all, a very well made product that is well affordable and worth having.</li>
            <li> Pay more for something you&#x27;ll actually still be using in a month</li>
            <li> So then I soaked it, first in hydrogen peroxide, then listerine, then vinegar.  </li>
            <li> The first week I used this brush, it shedded every day.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with using a shaving brush, so I have no frame of reference for judging it.</li>
            <li> After my first shave, life changed forever...</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been spammed by an Amazon vendor.</li>
            <li> first time using a brush and shave cream etc....</li>
            <li> This was my first brush and it never did stop shedding bristles, so rather than trying again with epoxy</li>
            <li> The brush detached from the handle during my first use.</li>
            <li> The first broke on first use</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I did choose a badger brush after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> This $12 dollar 100% badger shave brush well its a shave brush, its badger, its just that it requires like everything, conditioning, the first week you use it</li>
            <li> It fell apart after the first time I used it with lighter use that I would use if shaving.</li>
            <li> It sheds a bit and had an odor at first.  </li>
            <li> No frills shaving brush, but it does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
            <li> So, It does shed a bit at first, and it smells like road kill for a while.  </li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush ever</li>
            <li> ; I am yet to build my first lather with this brush</li>
            <li> The brush was washed with hair shampoo before the first use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as my first brush.</li>
            <li> this price you can get a solid boar brush from Omega or Semogue that provides a significantly better lather.</li>
            <li> Brush separated from handle in first week.</li>
            <li> Used my brush for the first time, today.</li>
            <li> it does have a smell when you first use it.</li>
            <li> I washed mine with dove dish detergent and hot water to get rid of the badger smell.</li>
            <li> Kinda funny</li>
            <li> bristles fall out every time that I used it for the first couple of months I had</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> This brush has great quality bristles with a very solid acrylic handle that looks like it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> Beginner to DE shaving, this brush meets the needs and helps me progress and learn on nuances, eventually moving up to &#x27;higher end&#x27; brushes.  </li>
            <li> For the first couple weeks it lost some hare.  </li>
            <li> It lost maybe three or four hairs on the first use and none since.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush</li>
            <li> Would work well enough if you just want to try this type of shave and didn&#x27;t want to spend any more $.  </li>
            <li> I let it sit in shaving soap overnight before first use.</li>
            <li> This piece of garbage fell apart --- the bristle-pack detached from the bottom &#x27;holder&#x27; --- the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> But it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush</li>
            <li> First shaving brush for me.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> The brush stunk when I first got it, as you&#x27;d expect being a Badger brush.  </li>
            <li> First use, hairs fell out and became knotted up.  </li>
            <li> Had a bit of a smell when i first got it,  but it has subsided now after 4 uses.</li>
            <li> The brushe broke after my first use.  </li>
            <li> Sheds for the first week of use.</li>
            <li> and it smelled like roadkill on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> (still) it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> After first shaving brush started loss hair and color</li>
            <li> There was some shedding with the first couple of uses, but has since subsided.</li>
            <li> As a first brush, I&#x27;d probably recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> My first badger brush.</li>
            <li> It gives me an even coat of shaving soap over my face, and the bristles feel softer and of better quality than the standard brushes I used to buy at Walmart and beauty supply shops.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after using a boar hair brush for a month or two when I first switched from the foam everyone uses.</li>
            <li> Good product, you will have a few hairs come off of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Detail:  I was looking for a Badger brush for my travel shaving kit and wanted Badger Hair (heavy beard + badger hair &#x3D; good lather) and came across this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad and not hard to lather with the brush.</li>
            <li> As a beginner to wet shaving I can say that this brush is perfect, stiff enough and can hold enough water for a great lather.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t lose many bristles, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water as the boar brush, so I have to make sure it is very wet to get a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend breaking it in a little bit to make sure the brush sheds all the lose hairs, but other than that, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if the brush will hold up as well as hanging it to dry, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Bought this the other day and have only used it a couple of times so far, but it is great!  </li>
            <li> In July however the whole knot of bristles just fell right out of the brush in one piece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased a Parker brush which is much denser, but this one still produces a nice thick lather and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> In the several weeks I&#x27;ve been using it the brush has created and held a good lather with Williams Shave Soap after a simple dunk in a sink of hot water and a shake off of the excess.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft brush that is much higher quality than than your standard brush at your drug store.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush that is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also thinking that I would upgrade to a more expensive brush fairly quickly, but honestly don&#x27;t feel like I need to!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not personally used it, but I have been told it has a nice, soft feel.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is also a good size, especially if you are just starting out with badger brushes.</li>
            <li> It is considerably softer than the old Boar hair one I was using, I may get two more for traveling and a spare.</li>
            <li> Not as good as more expensive badger hair brushes</li>
            <li> After some research I realized this isn&#x27;t an issue with the brush as that&#x27;s what pure badger hair does, but just be aware.</li>
            <li> The price is just an even greater selling point, because what you get is a heavy, durable, fine bristled brush that works very well.</li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> Sheds very little and lathers up so good.</li>
            <li> It‘s compact, yet full enough to foam up and cover my face quickly.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal, dries quick and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> It pretty much started falling apart in about a month.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put much stock in the reviews that are within the first couple of months of ownership.</li>
            <li> It did have an unusual smell when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> my first shaving brush, it makes shaving nicer and with my safety razor really close.</li>
            <li> brush is very prickly (or &amp;#34;skritchy&amp;#34;), even after break-in (I used it for about a month).</li>
            <li> Although it is my first experience with a badger brush, it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have any other wet-shaving brushes to compare it to, but he says it&#x27;s soft and creates a good lather.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash it with mild soap, gently squeeze it out, and store it upside down in a stand.</li>
            <li> This one is smaller than my other brushes, but it seems to soak up more water, and hold more soap than the others.  </li>
            <li> I can rinse easily and leave in the shower for next time.  </li>
            <li> But as a regular guy, it works and it its pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> So far so good, will take some time to season and get rid of &amp;#34; classic wet dog smell&amp;#34; as associated with all badger brushes.</li>
            <li> Thought the brush was a good deal; but with the bristles coming out with each shaving, before long there won&#x27;t be any left.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know for certain that it is badger hair in this brush, but I have no reason to believe that it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can say for certain</li>
            <li> so I can not say with any degree of accuracy that it is 100 percent pure badger.</li>
            <li> A lot of people will steer people away from Pure Badger because of the brushes being stiffer/prickier.</li>
            <li> I prefer that stiffer feel, so for me, getting a pure badger was a</li>
            <li> This will give you everything you expect in a pure badger brush and you&#x27;ll be spared the arrogance of stores like The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> The item arrived as described and appears to be pure Badger hair</li>
            <li> Certainly have no complaints for the money.  </li>
            <li> - the handle diameter is too large.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a large crack in the handle.</li>
            <li> i certainly would recommend it</li>
            <li> The small handle will allow it to fit in your stand, and the bristles are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> it shed a lot more than before and the knot came loose from the handle.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft and overall seems to be of top notch quality.</li>
            <li> This brush workes fine at firsy, but after using it about a month the hairs starting falling off.  </li>
            <li> Everything was fine until last week</li>
            <li> I sort of pushed them back in and it still works fine, but they still spin around a bit now.</li>
            <li> A plus also is how decently it&#x27;s priced!</li>
            <li> All in all, getting a pretty decent set up</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m assuming it depends on what lot the hair for your particular brush came from), but I have had a LOT of hair loss from my brush!</li>
            <li> For the money, this brush is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> I find the hair just right, so I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great simple option; there is not special branding on it.</li>
            <li> I just bought a more expensive brush, but this one is less costly but more superior in quality.  </li>
            <li> It was time for a replacement, and this little brush really does a nice job.</li>
            <li> This well-priced badger brush -- tho a bit small -- works much better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used, is very soft, and is easy to rinse and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This badger hair shaving brush is very good, although my only complaint is that the hairs keep coming out of the end</li>
            <li> Basic is an accurate description.</li>
            <li> Heck, I may even try a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a newbie to old school shaving, just starting with DE Safety Razors while waiting for my straight edge to arrive :)&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> This brush is a real deal...</li>
            <li> I like it as much as I like my home-use Tweezerman brush.</li>
            <li> but it holds water very well and works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a month</li>
            <li> Sometimes my skin is very itchy afterward.  </li>
            <li> but why spend that much?</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND to my friends!</li>
            <li> Very well made-really works up a lather-makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li> as others have, doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I liked the feel of the brush so much that I cleaned it a second, and then a third time.  </li>
            <li> The odor is just a distant memory now, and I love the brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush does the job at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> I like the heaviness of the handle, but overall the brush has a cheap feel to it and the hairs tend to fall out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> rinse, then it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> I never noticed much of an odor during any phase of this process but did notice that the water became somewhat discolored.  </li>
            <li> It really holds the lather well.  </li>
            <li> Cheap enough</li>
            <li> but really, I didn&#x27;t need it .</li>
            <li> My mind was going through its rolodex of scents trying to place it, but I don&#x27;t think I really wanted to admit to myself what I was smelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to shed much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> (the bristles were still glued together, the whole knot just had fallen out of the brush handle in one piece).  </li>
            <li> it is smooth putting shaving cream on the only thing is it looses a couple ofhairs each time l use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made, and helps exfoliate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 stars because I&#x27;ve not used it much</li>
            <li> so much that I;m going to buy one for myself.  </li>
            <li> The brush works very well with soap or cream.</li>
            <li> It holds the soap lather very well for a real close shave.</li>
            <li> I just replaced it with a Parker brush which is much nicer in every way.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting money on a bowl and stand straight away.</li>
            <li> Also, you will lose some hairs; but it should not be much of the brush.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve never had one of these before, but this one works very well.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made.  </li>
            <li> The bristles do not appear to be set into the handle very well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was under $12 (after all the boar bristle cost $6.xx after tax at Sally&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it works very well.</li>
            <li> It was heavier than I expected which gave it a more premium feel.</li>
            <li> and it really is soothing and lowers that &#x27;burn&#x27; you get without using one.</li>
            <li> After one year, the product is still very functional.  </li>
            <li> The brush rarely sheds and has remained soft.  </li>
            <li> Seems like real badger</li>
            <li> Since these are gifts, I can&#x27;t very well test them so, once they are tested I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I am really gentle with this brush but no matter what I do, each shave I get a bristle or two that come off of it and into my lather.</li>
            <li> I regret not noticing I had been given a 2-day shipping option that cost nearly as much as the brush itself.</li>
            <li> couple shaves smell like you&#x27;re using a wet dog to shave, but after that it gets better</li>
            <li> While I really like how soft and otherwise well made this brush is, I&#x27;d probably try a different one to see if it&#x27;s bristles remain intact better than this one.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t much of a loss if this brush turned out to be one of those &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li> I used it but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> but it works very well</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to spend too much.  </li>
            <li> So i bought this a couple months ago, and I haven&#x27;t really used it that much</li>
            <li> However, despite not seeing much usage, the brush has fallen out of its handle already.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this brush and now understand the advantage of badger hair over synthetic.</li>
            <li> so you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s really about it.</li>
            <li> i really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I expected alot better.</li>
            <li> The brush holds the lather well and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual</li>
            <li> Highly recommend considering the price!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson to introduce him to the joys of shaving with real lather.  </li>
            <li> Badger hair works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about 6 months and it has shed so much</li>
            <li> It lathers up my shaving puck well and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> The handle is simple, yet stylish, and the badger hair was soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It also fits nicely in the wooden Colonel Conk brush and razor stand I bought, which doesn&#x27;t take larger brushes.  </li>
            <li> I looked at a few all-in-one type starter packages, but they all seem to be either over priced or you have to compromise on quality, so I recommend you piece your own kit together.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand</li>
            <li> I only use this brush once, it felt good on my face, the bristle are really soft , and only a couple came out.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to the old school brush and soap and love it.</li>
            <li> LOVED my first one (wooden finish) and opted for black this time around.  </li>
            <li> so I was curious and very excited to do so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of shaving with a safety razor, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on my first brush.</li>
            <li> Great price, sheds a little for several shave s 2to 3 hairs, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Spend another 10$ and get a decent pure badger one.</li>
            <li> I have an assortment of shaving soaps and am a wet shaver using a Gillette super speed with shark super chrome DE blades.</li>
            <li> After I let it dry, the whole brush part easily came out of the plastic handle.</li>
            <li> There was a slight smell when I first opened the package but a quick lather with Williams Shaving soap quickly eliminated it.  </li>
            <li> With a little care, it will last nicely!  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this over the Escali brush, due to the majority of the reviews stating much more hair loss from the brush.</li>
            <li> I cannot fault it for doing its job, but it isn&#x27;t better than other budget badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Follow some of the reviews on how to prepare it, but it&#x27;s much better than foam or other premium shave lotions.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, however I was shocked by the odor that hit me the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> You more than likely won&#x27;t regret it, as I didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m generally picky.</li>
            <li> There were a few hairs that were lost in the first 2-3 shaves (1 or 2 hairs per shave at most), but haven&#x27;t seen any loss since then and it&#x27;s been about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Far better than the rough horsehair kind found at the local drug stores and such.</li>
            <li> and it is pretty soft (again, preference thing) much softer than any unbroken in badger that I have used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely and totally satisfied; wish I would have bought this long ago.</li>
            <li> Although it is a small brush I can build up a good lather either directly on face or using a mug.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush along with the Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180 and the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.</li>
            <li> For about a year i used the same cartridge razor and some water to shave every morning, needless to say it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant shave.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have spent a little more for a better product.</li>
            <li> Looks good on black Stand by same company.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very nice, but the brush handle is small in my hand and the brush has a low cost appearance.</li>
            <li> Work the soap into a nice lather then apply in small circles so all of the hair softens/stands up a bit.  </li>
            <li> My legs are located pretty far from my nose</li>
            <li> It started out appropriately stiff for a new brush and softened nicely with use.</li>
            <li> As a user of shaving brushes for many years, I miss my silver tip brush with ivory handle that I had for 35 years, but when my son graduated law school, I passed my brush down to him for a keepsake.</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have expected a lot out of a cheap pure badger (lowest badger quality) shaving brush.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s new way of shaving has made him purr!  </li>
            <li> He did not know if he could find a new one, I typed it in on amazon and there it was!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I expect that this new one will hold up just as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to end up buying a new brush very soon.  </li>
            <li> Maybe even black magic.</li>
            <li> , try Dorco razors, they are top notch and cost much less than name brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relegating my boar brush to &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; status and using this one as my main brush.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent brush.  </li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;m a female, I have a lot of experience with natural/animal cosmetic brushes but this is my first &amp;#34;real badger shaving brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive shaving brush, but I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> He has wanted to get into this type of shaving and had this particular brush on his wish list.  </li>
            <li> I super glued it back in place and it seems to have resolved the problem.</li>
            <li> I also did some reading on the web and decided that a brief break-in period for the brush would be adequate</li>
            <li> For the price this is a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Decent quality.</li>
            <li> well so all the main requirements are met.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Straight to the point: I like the brush and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Just gently rinse out most of the dried soap before using.  </li>
            <li> Main reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 star raiting was that the hairs have been falling out</li>
            <li> I like a slightly stiff, very full brush with no shedding, and this brush is exactly that.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have had is that the knot is smaller than I am used to and the handle is small and dainty.</li>
            <li> The brush hold water well, but is stiff enough to make a good lather.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended seller.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who isn&#x27;t using one.</li>
            <li> High quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buyer keep in mind this is a PURE Badger hair brush, complete with badger brush smell.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a little more $$$.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job in exfoliating (not to hard) and placing the shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li> A quick warning of sorts - it might feel a bit &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; at first due to its &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; badger makeup.</li>
            <li> So far very little shedding and it is adapting nicely</li>
            <li> no signs of ever being glued in and a very loose fit.</li>
            <li> It worked better than I expected, spreading evenly and really holding the mask well, I will never go back to applying clay masks by hand.</li>
            <li> I was just using it with normal shaving cream, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> It did shed a few hairs when I used it but not too many.</li>
            <li> left this a long time ago and wanted to elaborate.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, things seemed normal.  </li>
            <li> advice: You are probably looking at this item because you are thinking about starting this type of shaving, so here is my advice (for what its worth).</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> it &#x27;s pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> Initially, it lost a lot of bristles with each shave, but now it seems to be a rare occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m Asian and thus rarely need to shave).</li>
            <li> I hope that they will soften after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> It really is worth the extra money and this one isn&#x27;t priced at snob status prices.</li>
            <li> I own several badger brushes, some of very high quality, and while the SimplyBeautiful brush cannot compete with the most expensive ones, is better than other brushes at double the price.</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to get read of it since its not hard at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I liked this brush but after less than a month of use</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft enough and its fullness allows for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> Handle is a similar shape, I have not noticed much of a difference in the lather as both created a rich lather with multiple applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;16 Blade Sampler - Mine just arrived, and I am looking forward to finding the right blade for me before buying them in bulk (Feather is looking a likely candidate).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I noticed a little prickliness with the new brush on the first use but it is better the second time.</li>
            <li> appearing cheap due to</li>
            <li> I feels of good quality and besides the initial shedding which I expected, I feel it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving brushes, so I can&#x27;t attest to other badger brushes being smell free.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> almost all new badger brushes, this one smelled a bit and shed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush to help lather shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> I thought that I should have a new brush after years of using another.  </li>
            <li> If this continues I&#x27;ll need a new brush soon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a new brush after all</li>
            <li> and now I have to buy a new brush.</li>
            <li> Very few bristles have fallen out into my soap, which is considerably good since the action of proper lather is quite vigorous.</li>
            <li> A few months aback, I went to my local barber, who is amazing, and decided to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> So much better than artificial or boar&#x27;s bristles, this brush whips a healthy lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23, and have light but coarse facial hair (I am part middle-eastern).</li>
            <li> It had a number of decent reviews, so I was surprised when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it will shed, however if you shake it dry and then stand it on its handle it quickly becomes trained, and the hair stops falling out of the brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was unreasonable for me to expect a different brand brush to fit, but a lot of different brands are stated to be &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nice having shaving soap that smells good and a brush that smells like you have the actually animal on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fortunate enough to only have to shave once a week.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and creates a good lather but every shave it leaves behind bristles on my face.  </li>
            <li> The only real drawback to this dense brush is that since it soaks up a lot of lather, it&#x27;s more difficult to clean than other brushes, and it takes longer to dry, especially in high humidity, so if you plan to shave with a brush like this every day, you&#x27;ll need more than one</li>
            <li> I however have a very sensitive face, and this brush feels like angel wings gliding across it.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, lathers well, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy about the handle, but the bristles are very soft and it lathers well.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> No bristle loss, and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this brush.</li>
            <li> Likewise while I had a number of hairs fall out it was absolutely very far from the amount needed to render the brush unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft tips compared to the boar I am used to.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this natural bristle product.</li>
            <li> This is also easily overlooked by the fact that other brushes cost several times as much.</li>
            <li> I ant make lather with it  and it smelled bad so for what it&#x27;s worth  spen some real money and get a good brush.</li>
            <li> Steer clear!</li>
            <li> My last brush broke at the handle, this one seems pretty well built.</li>
            <li> The first brush - different product, lasted about 6 months.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 15 years and the dollar soap last a year each.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush and will be my last.  </li>
            <li> I had recently switched to using shaving creams and brushes when shaving, and this brush was recommended to me and it works very well!  </li>
            <li> Then again it&#x27;s the only badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned ;).</li>
            <li> Just Complete Junk!</li>
            <li> Even for a low price of ten or twelve dollars I expect a brush to last more than 4 months.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I left it soaking in water all the time either, just a 15 minute pre-moisturize with hot water on the bristles alone.</li>
            <li> wow - now I know what a badger smells like!</li>
            <li> I lost a couple bristles on the first wash and cleaning, but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> when I first saw it, thought I had a grown a giant hair!</li>
            <li> Ii have only used it a few times but  am pleased with the quality of the bristles as they lather very well and hairs do not fall out.</li>
            <li> Pay for quality and get the more expensive badger brush, It will last longer and give you a better shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first shaving brush, and for the money especially, it gives me all i want.</li>
            <li> Again I thought no big deal because it was pretty inexpensive and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on other similar brushes, I found they had issues with the hair (bristles) coming loose, or there not being enough bristles in the first place, or the handles not being good.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brushes from expensive to cheap and this one is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shedding:  This brush started shedding immediately, which for a new brush isn&#x27;t entirely unexpected.  </li>
            <li> At least, that gives greater control, for normal sized faces.</li>
            <li> Whips up a mean lather and breaks in very quickly!</li>
            <li> The badger bristles are soft enough to be comfortable but tough enough to stand up to regular use and generate a smooth comfortable lather with my Poraso shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It has enough backbone to lather a soft soap, but is still pretty soft on my face.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day it does the job, but I would recommend spending an extra few bucks and getting a higher quality brush that won&#x27;t be scratched when you open it and one which retains the badger hair better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten pretty tired of buying overpriced disposable cartridge razors and thought I&#x27;d try my hand at some good old fashioned wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It is a pure badger brush so the hair is a bit prickly, but I actually like how it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I decided to purchase another shaving brush on Amazon and found this SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is very soft right out of the box and the packaging was rather simple, an unmarked white box containing the brush wrapped in some tissue paper.</li>
            <li> Purchased this amongst many other items for my new found desire to wet shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, great for shaving and no need for an expensive one to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much for a ten dollar badger brush, but this has surprised a bit.</li>
            <li> A clear example of, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Used with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised about this brush</li>
            <li> The bristles have not started coming off yet, and is soft and works well.</li>
            <li> surprised by how well it fluffs-up each time</li>
            <li> It is the lowest end of bager hair but is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but 3 weeks in and its still shedding 3-4 hairs every time I shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still as soft as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> They were also adamant about using a badger hair brush over the others.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the SimplyBeautiful brush.</li>
            <li> He mentioned that he had been looking in stores for an old fashioned shaving brush but couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Not as soft as silvertips</li>
            <li> you want a soft brush, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to complete a starter manual shaving gift set.</li>
            <li> was surprised it didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;badger stink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Despite the initial odor issue I really would buy another one if this were lost.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, this is an $100 brush with a $12 price tag.  </li>
            <li> That one shed hairs like an old dog and it was made of boar bristles</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone starting out with DE or Straight Edge Razor shaving, or just looking for a backup brush.</li>
            <li> It is soft on the face.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Ever-ready brush.</li>
            <li> If not I will return to a boar brush in the future, as they seem to work very well also.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, some did come out when lathering</li>
            <li> Says the brush is soft, holds the soap well, and feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Old Bond Street Shaving Cream:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is an issue with all natural shaving brushes, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold water well.</li>
            <li> Bristles have stayed intact and the brush is soft on the face</li>
            <li> last time I used it, I was whipping around my shaving mug, and the whole brush came out....</li>
            <li> I noticed just a hint of a strange smell the first couple of times that I used it</li>
            <li> As for the brush losing bristles, so far the brush lost under 20 bristles.  </li>
            <li> I realize how much of a mistake getting this brush was initially (or the comparable escali</li>
            <li> The smell was nearly completly gone afterwords.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bristles became unglued completely and came off the handle after the 5 shave!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too soft or wimpy.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month so far.</li>
            <li> That was far from the truth with the one I received.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft, and it retains heat</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned one of those premium brushes, although I&#x27;ve had them used when getting an old timey barber shave.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of water, lathers well, and is surprisingly soft on the face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> It has done its job so far, but it has lost hairs with every usage.  </li>
            <li> , eventually the odor completely disappeared from use.</li>
            <li> I would be surprised if this lasts a year.</li>
            <li> Hold the lather well &amp; is soft on his face.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t go away completely, which is why I won&#x27;t give it five stars.  </li>
            <li> So far it has performed well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold lots of soap.  </li>
            <li> Well over the last two months the hairs are falling out fast as ever</li>
            <li> About 6 bristles have come out so far,  but</li>
            <li> there is a bit of &amp;#34;wet dog smell,&amp;#34; but you get that with any natural bristle</li>
            <li> Also, they are too soft for me.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to use the brush a few times which is the only reason I rated 2 stars instead of 1.  </li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> I works as good as an expensive brush</li>
            <li> it with the italian soap which name i forgot and creates a nice thick lather</li>
            <li> It dries perfectly standing on its base without a stand to hold it upside-down.</li>
            <li> (And it is unbranded, which for me is actually an aesthetic bonus.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some initial shedding of hairs during the first couple of shaves; however, that number has quickly subsided to zero.</li>
            <li> -the handle is a little skinnier than other brushes I have used-it fits nicely in the Art of Shaving Brush Stand I use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It started shedding right away but after six months the handle actually separated from the actual brush.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brushes, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and arrived in a reasonable amount of time, given that it came via APO.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or lost a crapload of hair like my other brushes, which is a giant plus.&lt;br /&gt;The light smell doesn&#x27;t even warrant removing a star,</li>
            <li> only gripe I have really, is that it&#x27;s a little on the stiff side for badger hair, but I can live with it since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than most others on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped tremendously (with the additional use of a safety razor) to cut down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> I actually went and bought this, as far as I can tell, exact brush at a local shaving boutique.  </li>
            <li> The brush was a little prickly at first and lost two or three bristles, all normal while breaking in a new brush.  </li>
            <li> I hot glued it in and it became loose again soon after.</li>
            <li> After the first two or three uses, it stopped shedding loose bristles.  </li>
            <li> Every time I shave, I have to clean a few brush hairs out of the sink.  </li>
            <li> The mark of a cheap cosmetic brush is shedding and that&#x27;s why you buy expensive brushes, well that must be true for shaving brushes as well because this brush sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> Lost a number of hairs during the first shave, then an occasional hair on each subsequent shave.  </li>
            <li> In sum, the Basic is: (1) an excellent brush; and (2) at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> but with decent care it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li> A decent brush, creates lather well, will definitely purchaae again</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews on this item before I purchased it which claimed a slight scent of &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; upon the first few uses, this did not bother me much as I expected the smell (it is real badger hair)</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this a better brush than the boar bristle as long as you keep it very wet when you lather it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m amazed with the high quality of this brush, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for someone going back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; was of shaving.</li>
            <li> I thought this was normal due to my lack of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give the Pure Badger Shaving Brush a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely spending a little more next time.</li>
            <li> For the same price or less you can get a boar hair brush of fantastic quality.  </li>
            <li> Neither of them will do the job half as well or a fourth as comfortably as this brush.</li>
            <li> There were only a few rogue hairs that were easily trimmed.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had done this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it too long before I replaced it with something I&#x27;m much happier with.</li>
            <li> First off, I have no issue at all with this brush as it performed as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I left it in warm water for too long or if it&#x27;s an assembly issue.  </li>
            <li> Both lose occasionally hairs, which is normal of all brushes i would assume...</li>
            <li> The brush gets plenty wet just by rotating it under running hot water for about 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Only one issue and this may be normal for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good brush that is replaceable, giftable, and that you won&#x27;t feel guilty for when you think about how much you spent.</li>
            <li> Sure it lost a few bristles the first few shaves as I would expect from even one costing double or triple this one cost.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does leave some of the hairs on your face the first few uses and there is a smell when you wet it at first, but this is normal and fades with time and usage.</li>
            <li> Several reviews mentioned that brand new badger brushes had a foul odor to them that took a while to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Gentle cleaning with shampoo, rinse, dry, soak, load, lather.</li>
            <li> but that hasn&#x27;t made it any less useful for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> brush lost a few hairs in the first 2-3 uses, but that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the length of the bristles, but getting better at making a good lather.</li>
            <li> For the price, I would recommend this brush to anyone who is either just starting to explore wet shaving or on a tight budget who still wants to enjoy the experience of a brush.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush to use with your shaving routine, but some of the bristles come out way too easily and now I am unable to hang it upside down in the stand because the rubber coating around the bristles that fits into the handle doesn&#x27;t stick enough and the bristle head constantly falls out of the handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, other than the ones I use for weapons cleaning.</li>
            <li> Definitely needed to be washed before use, but after a few uses now it’s seasoned and ready for my travel set.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered a second after I left the first at a hotel room.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I haven&#x27;t notice any funny oder and I have used it for other a month.</li>
            <li> other than that its doing its job consistently.</li>
            <li> This is a major manufacturer defect.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is also smaller or less full than the Tweezerman brush I have used for a couple of years.    </li>
            <li> The brush has been working just fine since then, so I got another two months out of it at least.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not as nice as a $30 brush, but for the purpose it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> shake it out,  let it dry, and it is as soft and pliable as new.  </li>
            <li> I found it a bit scratch compared to my finest and silver-tip badger brushes but at such a low price its a decent starter.</li>
            <li> As for me, I experienced a lot of shedding (even after a couple uses), a bad odor (bit of a stink), and general discomfort and itchiness from the hairs.</li>
            <li> I have used the mug &amp; brush method of shaving for over 30 years and have found this to be a common problem of cheaply made brushes.</li>
            <li> No big deal, I just used the one that came with the old brush.</li>
            <li> and I only lost about 4 bristles so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, and barely any hairs have come out.&lt;br /&gt;Simple</li>
            <li> brush has by far either the worlds softest bristles or not enough bristles in the knot to offer any stability of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But as a guy who just shaves with an old TracII razor using hotel soap in a coffee cup, this brush is smaller and stiffer than I prefer and it takes longer to work up the lather to a workable level.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s too soft but my last brush was boar</li>
            <li> The adult equivalent of finding out Santa, The Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Kwanzabot don&#x27;t actually exist.</li>
            <li> I, too, broke the brush in by soaking in dishwasher soap and then lathered it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood soap and left it in overnight.</li>
            <li> I received it two days ago, so only used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a definite exception to the old adage that \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> unless you really want to go back to the 1950&#x27;s, my recommendation is simply to go with today&#x27;s technology advances and simply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but also scratchy so the scrathy-ness definitely offsets the softness.</li>
            <li> It look like sunburn and red , so if u have sensitive this brush is not for me, I may try synthethic shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only lost a couple bristles so far after using this for about a month.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, on my first wet shave, I discovered I was allergic to that specific badger hair.</li>
            <li> It has, over the last few weeks, lost a few hairs, but lathers nicely and has maintained its shape well.</li>
            <li> Plus after you get it broken in, it smells like your favorite shave soap/cream.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush was nicer than I expected the hard plastic has a glossy black finish, easy to clean, I do not miss using my hand to apply shaving cream anymore,</li>
            <li> I prefer a bigger knot and handle and it was difficult to gauge the scale of this one in the picture before I bought it, so when it comes time to buy a new one I will most likely go bigger, but that might be a while because this one seems to be pretty well made and will last a while.</li>
            <li> Shed bristles from first use until the bristles just came un-glued from the handle all together (even though i stored it hanging bristles down).</li>
            <li> Merkur 20C Long Handle Black Double Edge Safety Razor]]), and I knew it would fit in the brush and razor holder that I wanted to get ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend especially if you&#x27;re new to using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This is a less expensive brush and its quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> one minor quibble is the smell that it has when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> The price was right, but this brush was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> During my first two weeks of use, the brush lost a handful of bristles (certainly less than a dozen), but since then none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loose at least 5 hairs or more</li>
            <li> brush gets wet very easily, and I find soaking it for lengthy times to be unnecessary so far.  </li>
            <li> favorite boar bristle brush has been slowly losing some bristles for a few months, and it&#x27;s now nearly 3 years old, so in the meantime I&#x27;ll just use that one.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be fine for now; it has lost a few bristles, but I would have expected that from a brush at this price.</li>
            <li> This isnt as soft as my other, more expensive one, but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> It is very well made and should last as long as the last one, (37 years).  </li>
            <li> Smells like badger, but no worse than any other animal hair brush, and it</li>
            <li> In the days of my youth, I did use a mug and brush, but have long since grown a beard and shave only my neck and don&#x27;t really need a shaving brush as such.  </li>
            <li> it is real badger, and the hairs dont shed other than one here and there</li>
            <li> Not a single hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the head might come undone from constant contact with water, but it&#x27;s solid so far.  </li>
            <li> however I prefer a much firmer brush, especially for the harder creams, (Proraso), and soaps out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so I understand that could be considered heavy usage but don&#x27;t most people shave everyday?  </li>
            <li> Pure Badger, hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is a tight brush that doesn&#x27;t shed as much as my cheaper (and I do mean cheap)</li>
            <li> i would&#x27;ve given this VERY soft brush 5 stars except for one minor glitch: the shaving bristles separated from the handle after only 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try a great bargain and like the stiffer, (not plastic bristle hard, just stiff as compared to this brush), then try the Tweezerman on here for a little over $11 bucks or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several purchasers mentioned an unpleasant odor, but upon unpacking, I gave the brush several good sniffs and was not aware of much if any smell at all.  </li>
            <li> I have since tried a couple of other cheap &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; brushes (one of them was not 100% badger as advertised and the knot fell out of handle after a few months).</li>
            <li> cause other than the experience of a very frothy lather for either personal reasons or just to add to the ritual of shaving I have found no added value in using a brush.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems like it will hold up long term.</li>
            <li> (keep it in a proper stand, only wet the tip, don&#x27;t use too much force with it), but I am still losing some.  </li>
            <li> After several uses, the smell dies out and you barely notice it.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs in the first 2 uses, haven&#x27;t noticed anything since.</li>
            <li> It is also small and compact (useful for traveling)</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time with the green Poraso cream/soap.</li>
            <li> I recommend soaking it in hot water for a few minutes before shaving to soften it.</li>
            <li> There was quit a bit of shedding at first and after a few weeks of use I am still getting a hair or two</li>
            <li> The bristles started falling out after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> At first it was just a few hairs here and there</li>
            <li> The few times that I have used it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs the first couple times I used it, but since then (about 6 weeks)</li>
            <li> I expected the loose pieces to end within the first month or two, but it looks like it is going to keep falling apart until I buy another brush.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush if you are just starting off with wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a decent quality brush with minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> For starting out wet shaving I would highly recommend .I</li>
            <li> He wanted to be able to start wet shaving but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the products himself, so I bought this and a few other necessities he&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> bristles are kinda rough and not many of them either but cheap price.</li>
            <li> A few bristles came out during the first couple weeks, but not enough to effect the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li> It shed only a few bristles in its first month of use.</li>
            <li> handle is a simple black plastic, but that is a large reason why I chose to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Very similar to the GBS pure badger black shaving brush (almost identical but no stand).  </li>
            <li> I am a new proponent to classical wet shaving</li>
            <li> It is much softer, lathers the soap better and loses far less hairs (actually very few hairs in total).</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with the feel of this brush for the amount of money spent, I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever</li>
            <li> few hairs have fallen out, but that was only really the first few uses, now it i don&#x27;t see any fall out.</li>
            <li> okay, but smelled badly when you get it wet to use, and shed bristles alarmingly quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a very classy look--no extraneous markings, just a quality brush with a beautiful black base.</li>
            <li> noticed that it&#x27;s hard to clean the brush after I shave, but I simply run it under the faucet and squeeze out the excess water and let it air dry in the medicine</li>
            <li> I hate to shave but must for employment, and I remember these from the \\&quot;good old days\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it has a little firmness from the thickness of it,the handle is a descent size which makes for it being comfortable to hold not to small or big</li>
            <li> Well, yes, but I&#x27;ve only ever used the silvertip and a small sampler pure badger besides this.</li>
            <li> It is soft, lathers extremely well, and ive noticed no hair loss.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this over any other for budget conscious buyer or a newbie into wet/traditional shaving.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that bristles came out for the first several uses.</li>
            <li> With correct care and educated handling, this brush will last as long as any and its quality is on par with more expensive counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00BFCV5JM</li>
            <li> A VERY occasional strand comes out, but much less than far more expensive brushes I have had.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted there is a slight musky odor when the brush is first used.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with my new black handled De safety</li>
            <li> Only time will tell how this effects it&#x27;s ability to last over the long haul.</li>
            <li> A few bristles fell of during the initial usage, which is perfectly normal.</li>
            <li> My old brush was a little larger, and I loved it until it began to shed badly.</li>
            <li> It whips up lather from cream in no time, and it holds so much water that I have to be careful not to water down my lather.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving having switched from cartridge razors and canned soap to a DE Razor and Wet Shaving Soap/Cream about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I followed the advice of another owner and &#x27;seasoned&#x27; the item before use: soaking it in soapy water, allowing my usual shaving cream to dry in the bristles before rinsing, etc.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the classy black handle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the price of this brush, but after the first use, it is obvious that it is high quality.  </li>
            <li> It does lose a hair or two per shave typically, which may indicate low quality judging from other reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect the functionality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All right, I am not going to compare this brush to a model costing a c-note, because that would be ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Just  realize that this brush was from a small animal and has a very pungent smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Fairly small and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my shower.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt look like it will last long.</li>
            <li> have no reasons to believe this brush won&#x27;t give me the same long faithful service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as it&#x27;s stored properly (on a stand, not on</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to assess durability</li>
            <li> At this time I can not speak about how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Brush does lose a few hairs, but this is sometimes normal at the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it: (1) was inexpensive; and (2) had good customer reviews.</li>
            <li> I freaked out a little and finished up with the Escali, then examined the new brush.  </li>
            <li> the way, although the proper way to store/let dry a shaving brush is by hanging it upside down; I have found that by rinsing out the excess soap, then squeezing out the excess water between thumb and forefinger, shaking it dry and then rapidly &amp;#34;swatting&amp;#34; the bristles back and forth against my other hand, the brush is pretty well dry before I place it back in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Now, 5 months later, the glue on the second brush has come loose.</li>
            <li> The reason why is the 2nd time I used it, the entire brush fell out of the handle and now it is extremely loose and unusable.</li>
            <li> and I only loss a half dozen hairs the first few uses.</li>
            <li> One tip I have for all of you to avoid the scrathy-ness is to press it hard on your face so that you are using the middle part of the bristles and not so much the tips of them.</li>
            <li> But the other more expensive brushes do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I believe it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Shake off the excess, hang it up, and it is dry with no odors the next morning.</li>
            <li> I store the brush properly and in a dry location so that is not the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the bristles may be 100% badger, the bristles in the center of the brush started falling out after a couple of uses and were completely gone from the center after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t caused any actual problems such as a skin rash but am curious why it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> This brush turned out to be at least as good as the expensive one that I have at home.</li>
            <li> Im buying a few more to serve as replacements in the event I leave one behind when traving or if the seller decides to stop selling.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for several weeks and haven&#x27;t lost a single hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, over the past month using different shaving soaps, the smell is now almost completely gone - a definite bonus.</li>
            <li> I had to use it a few times before it worked properly, and it did shed a few bristles the first couple of times I used it, but it seems to be holding together quite well now.  </li>
            <li> It is stiff enough to pick up soap on a kokum butter soap puck and lather softly on my face.</li>
            <li> Brush came loose from the handle after a couple of shaves, so I had to glue it back in place.</li>
            <li> the entire brush is loose in the handle.</li>
            <li> I like this brush which is a little stiffer than my old one.</li>
            <li> A little epoxy fixed it but it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This creates a lather much faster and with less effort than my previous boar-hair brush</li>
            <li> Shedded a little the first few times</li>
            <li> Having previously owned a $75.00 brush from Art of Shaving, my standards were a little high and expectations admittedly low for this price</li>
            <li> used twice both times the bristles were coming out to bad because it had a nice feel</li>
            <li> Too bad I really liked this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loose Bristles - All shaving brushes no matter how cheap or expensive will lose some bristles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit smaller than the average size of brushes I have used prior, but that could be a pro or con depending on preference or POU for the item.</li>
            <li> After using a boar brush for so long this brush feels like a feather duster.</li>
            <li> After using this Badger bristle I am wondering why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> A minor annoyance, but I am knocking off one star for that...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, I recently entered the world of wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hope this brush lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> i just started with a brush after a long time.</li>
            <li> but as long this $12.00 beauty continues to perform, I&#x27;ll have no need to find out.</li>
            <li> I also bought a merkur long handle and</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 5 is because well I expected it to be descented before I got it.  </li>
            <li> When it got wet you could smell it and not only could you smell it but the smell overwhelmed my shaving soap smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush for a few years now and my old brush is showing its age .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried within a few months the thing will completely disintegrate.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s on the small side (not necessarily a negative).  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure if this normal.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to get into wet shaving and went for it.</li>
            <li> read reviews of a &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34; but once wet the smell was quiet</li>
            <li> So far I had it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had not used a shaving brush in a long time so did not want to invest a fortune into a practice which might turn out to be temporary.</li>
            <li> but if you have a mug or scuttle that has deep walls, you&#x27;ll probably get your knuckles wet and soapy while working up your lather.</li>
            <li> It was relatively inexpensive, so I guess I should have expected it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s both soft and firm.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this brush, especially for people just getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> However, this is minor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is still a problem, but then since I expected it it&#x27;s not really as big of an issue to me as it may be for others.</li>
            <li> A few hairs have fallen off, but from what I have read, it is completely normal and it should be expected.</li>
            <li> A few of the bristles came out the first few times I used it, but since then, I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> Always soft and strong bristles...worked well for the first three months, until the bristles literally detached from the base!</li>
            <li> My previous brush was a more expensive Art of Shave brand brush...</li>
            <li> with this new brush, there is no more lathering in my hands</li>
            <li> Not too soft, but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> After a solid week of shaving i am looking for a new one because i loose at least 20 hairs per usage.</li>
            <li> I get the odd loose hair once in a while, but this is to be expected early on, and hasn&#x27;t diminished the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I started wet-shaving using shaving soaps, brushes and safety razors I&#x27;ve had two other brushes prior to this one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s low price, but this thing is a diamond in the rough!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and because my only other brush is a &amp;#34;medium grade&amp;#34; one I got with my Art Of Shaving kit at the AOS store.  </li>
            <li> However, shaving brushes have uses beyond their intended purpose and the above mentioned brush excels at cleaning small, close areas such as the vents on your car, between the buttons on your remotes and similar places.  </li>
            <li> other one had a wooden handle which the finish peeled off of.</li>
            <li> I do not know where the other reviewers get that this thing smells, not at all in my situation, it works well and after a couple of months it has lost a total of ONE BRISTLE.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this brush sheds significantly.</li>
            <li> Also the hair is very coarse and a little too short I would say.</li>
            <li> Not an expert on shaving brushes (yet), but this brush is very soft and has lost very few hairs.</li>
            <li> The brush was very soft and had very few hairs that came out on intial use, since there has been no hair loss.</li>
            <li> I dry it</li>
            <li> and it keeps the brush in shape and allows it to dry.</li>
            <li> You may, however, want to purchase a stand for this brush to dry out after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lather it with shave soap, LOTS of it...and let it sit and dry on the brush over night....</li>
            <li> Then I let it dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> While this may not be what your barber sells, this brush will hold up for months and dry well, as it has for me.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t stink when dry.</li>
            <li> how well it shakes nearly dry after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> stand to dry.</li>
            <li> Construction seems solid, but I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak as to long-term durability.</li>
            <li> I think that goes a long way to show that the guys there are willing to stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> It worked well a few times, then it took a very short drop and was totally busted. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I combine this with Proraso Green Shaving Soap and a Merkur Double Edge Safety razor in the shower for the ultimate shave experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few small hairs did fall out in first use but with every brush I&#x27;ve ever had, that was the case</li>
            <li> Only used it for  a few days before cat knocked it in the toilet, had to remove toilet to get it out</li>
            <li> Just ensure that you hang it in the stand upside down so as it will last long.</li>
            <li> I am still less than a year into wet shaving and my first shaving brush was comprised of very tough boars hair which I had to soak for 10 minutes to get it to soften up decently.  </li>
            <li> The 2 dollar single blade razor</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle.</li>
            <li> so my credibility is limited.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t shed a single strand of hair yet.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a shaving brush, so I have limited knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> so my experience is limited</li>
            <li> This brush offers very little shed</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is occasional loss of hair, there is a very slight smell initially, which has diminished as time goes by.  </li>
            <li> It is way too small and too soft</li>
            <li> The brush lost a few hairs on the first few shaves, but that is common; even on more expensive brushes because there is a break in period.</li>
            <li> Not worth the short money.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and it hasn&#x27;t been broken in, as I&#x27;m told they are wont to</li>
            <li> I had all these loose bristles I had to work around while shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the knot coming loose, the brush has performed well in the two weeks that I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Badger hair comes loose, but I am unsure if it will cease after using it a while.</li>
            <li> but I always get loose hairs from it during every shave.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this brush, I have to pick loose badger hair off my face.</li>
            <li> Its alright I loose a hair or two</li>
            <li> But if soft brushes aren&#x27;t your game, this brush is a feisty little bugger, and I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned several boar bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> B00AG92BXY SimplyBeautiful Black Brush &amp; Razor Stand - Fits Various Shaving Brushes and Razors]])</li>
            <li> You get a simple black (I assume plastic) handle badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the brush occasionally loses bristles, but the loss of bristles seems to have really slowed down for my brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the combination of smell + a slightly stiffer brush than I expected means this is a solid middle-of-the-road purchase for me.</li>
            <li> sheds hair liberally - brush hair length is too small and hair is too soft as compared to other brushes --</li>
            <li> I use it a little differently than my home set up.</li>
            <li> It only took a little bit of breaking in.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little smaller than a pig bristle brush that I have used from time to time, it does the job</li>
            <li> so it was a little coarse and didn&#x27;t lather as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a little smaller and the head is not as packed with bristles.</li>
            <li> I might try a boar brush next time, as I think I would like it to be a little harsher.</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra and buy something else</li>
            <li> my only concern is that the bristles prick the skin a little bit.</li>
            <li> If you care about longevity, then buy a better brush, if you only care if it works, then you shouldn&#x27;t mind some loose hairs and eventually losing the base.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in a pure badger brush, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little rough, but I have only used my brush twice.</li>
            <li> bristles are \\&quot;Goldilocks-good\\&quot; (not too hard, not too soft).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little smaller than my last few brushes, and I have had some of the bristles fall out while lathering.</li>
            <li> It works, it looks okay, and it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as I understand they sometimes can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as good as Parker Safety Razor brush that I normally use.</li>
            <li> Badger brush loses hair every use so far.</li>
            <li> The hair smells like wet dog when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no backbone.</li>
            <li> I have had minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li> Began to fall apart after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Rough and scratchy, bristles fall out, smells like a wet dog.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Fell apart only a few months in</li>
            <li> I rub a shaving soap stick over my beard, then I wet the brush to lather up the soap.</li>
            <li> but I have no real complaints about this one.  </li>
            <li> A few bristles do come off periodically, but I assume this is about standard.</li>
            <li> It lathers up instantly, brings up the stubble without waste of soap or blade.</li>
            <li> I guess I am off to find a wet badger to smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this few months back for my son, and he loves it .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush lathers well with minimal shedding.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected and does not shed hairs.</li>
            <li> but that is to by expected.</li>
            <li> It is a bit rough, but sometimes that can be advantageous in prepping your beard for a shave, depending on the sensitivity of your skin.</li>
            <li> but it smells of wet badger while in use.  </li>
            <li> For the feel, forgetting about the minimal cost, I am buying another Tweezerman brush now.</li>
            <li> Van der Hagen brush did and will probably last me a few years.  </li>
            <li> Probably to be expected in this price range.</li>
            <li> Not much shedding on mine, either.</li>
            <li> I use it every day with no real complaints.</li>
            <li> I would heartily recommend this as a basic brush for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Used it minimally (couple times a week).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving brushes made from a few different materials.  </li>
            <li> BIG WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I can still use it, but it is not what  I expected.</li>
            <li> I have spent over $60 for shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it--it&#x27;s a low-price but high-quality badger brush that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> Holds it&#x27;s shape when dried and placed back in the rack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at wet shaving and</li>
            <li> I have done everything I know to be careful</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as I started wet shaving with Proaso shave soap and needed a brush.</li>
            <li> Nothing alarming.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to pull on the bristles at all and this brush will serve you well.</li>
            <li> recommend this for those giving wet shaving a try.</li>
            <li> Such waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was until I got it wet</li>
            <li> like I rubbed a bar of soap on a wet raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was curious about using a badger brush, and there is a wide range of costs to them all, and they all seem to be way overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li> i was uneasy even though i did shave years ago in the military.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this shaving brush, he says it has minimal shedding</li>
            <li> The white, cardboard box it came in was completely mangled and broken...</li>
            <li> This brush is moderate sized, and not huge.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with a lot of loose bristles coming out or a smell when the brush got wet like some other reviews mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Loose hairs are workingtheir way out as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> now I used crazy glue to attach bristles back to the handle, but it made the bristles less flexible and using the brush less comfortable...</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can think of is if you leave it sitting upright (like it&#x27;s pictured to the left), a little bit of the black paint on the wooden handle will transfer to whatever it&#x27;s sitting on.</li>
            <li> Very little bristle-loss - only a few over weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li> It is soft but firm enough and creates a thick lather with little shaving cream.</li>
            <li> expensive razors a few years ago and decided to go back to the old double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush due to my previous brush falling apart after limited use.</li>
            <li> It did have a weird scent when I first got it, soaking it in soapy water seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sniffed other badger brushes in stores and didn&#x27;t notice this smell.  </li>
            <li> and I do not think it will come apart like my boars hair brush which did so the other day.  </li>
            <li> I had rinsed it a bit but other than that</li>
            <li> Only trouble was the cats!  </li>
            <li> only small thing I would like to see is an an extended handle.</li>
            <li> Two shaves in and have no idea how I shaved properly the past 25 years.</li>
            <li> Not much to say - it&#x27;s a shaving brush!</li>
            <li> I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and washed it out in dish washing detergent and then let it soak in a cup with a solution of dish washing detergent and water for about 90 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other badger hair brushes and none of them</li>
            <li> Hello all fellow Amazonian wet shavers out there!</li>
            <li> Within three weeks of shaving every other day, the brush separated from the handle.  </li>
            <li> It has been about three months on this brush, other than a hair falling out every now</li>
            <li> I purchased this item recently for it&#x27;s size (Small travel size) and for the price point it is what it is.</li>
            <li> I have also gotten emails to review other products of theirs that I never bought.</li>
            <li> It does smell like some other people mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> and I went with the badger brush due to recommendations.</li>
            <li> This one is no different, but I would not say the bristle loss is excessive.  </li>
            <li> You can move on to other brushes if you feel the need.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this brush had a smell out of the box like other reviewers have stated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bristles or hair coming out other than that to me</li>
            <li> Ike some other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had soom hairs come out, maybe twice.</li>
            <li> This brush also doesn&#x27;t smell like animal unlike other brushes.</li>
            <li> However, I was pulling down slightly on the brush to squeeze it dry and the bristles seem to have loosened from the handle.</li>
            <li> It is very rough and makes my skin itch.</li>
            <li> done, blow the wiskers and water out of your razor and then dry it on a towel by brushing it in reverse motion a few times, your razor will be sharp for months.</li>
            <li> some other reviews also claimed the loss of a few hairs during use, again this did not hinder my decision to purchase this brush because it is inevitable to lose a few hairs from the brush.</li>
            <li> Reading about the smelly badger hair brushes and how they loose brisles, I was a little concerned with purchasing this brush.  </li>
            <li> It had a bit of an unpleasant smell when I first started using it but that seems to be wearing off now that it&#x27;s been loaded with shave soap several times.</li>
            <li> The bristles are actively falling out as you soap up.</li>
            <li> It only got worse on the second day.</li>
            <li> should all be ashamed of the damage their tools of evil have reaped upon young men&#x27;s faces, wallets, and pride across these lands for many a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few uses the brush hairs constantly fall out, after a few months of use the assembly the holds the brush in the handle fell out.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that it&#x27;s a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Does tend to loose a few hairs every time.  </li>
            <li> However I have owned this brush for a few months and loose hairs still fall out during every shave.</li>
            <li> the bristles are a little shorter than I expected</li>
            <li> So this brush (like almost all other badger brushes) STINKS when you first get it wet.  </li>
            <li> Hair were a little scratcher than I expected but that could have been a misconception on my part.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but there was a little bit of a wet hair smell to it.  </li>
            <li> You loose a few whiskers and once the brush settles down, you get a quality lather spread across your face every time each time.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a gift for my boyfriend, who had been complaining about his current shave setup-- shaving cream and a safety razor, which were hard on his skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not educated enough about it to say.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Different articles had convinced me to at least give up the \\&quot;lather in a can\\&quot; and try using a brush and cream/shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I have been a barber since 1964, and have never seen such shoddy workmanship.</li>
            <li> So, 3 stars for being average.</li>
            <li> and it does the job admirably all for the price of your average synthetic brush.</li>
            <li> but this brush had a very slight odor to it that was not particularly objectionable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I use it on the average of twice a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a perfect brush though; a couple of hairs do fall off at every shave but not as much as the boar bristle brush, which groups of them would fall off during every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the shedding.</li>
            <li> It loses several hairs every shave but still works as intended.</li>
            <li> For the hassels the cost savings were not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep the bristles wedged into the base</li>
            <li> I have now been wet shaving for over a year, have tried a few brushes out and a variety of razors, creams and blades... and in so doing</li>
            <li> It did lose a few hairs in the beginning, but that is expected.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a brush to shred, you store it hanging (with the bristles down).</li>
            <li> with a stand which keeps it upside down when not in use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kept bristles down and rinsed with the water being squeezed out after every use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> I also read a few reviews above that complained about shedding, but this has not been my experience.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a few of the hairs fall out each time I use the brush.</li>
            <li> Seems to have 30% less brush</li>
            <li> The typical smell goes away after the 3-4th use.</li>
            <li> it works, mine stopped loosing bristles after a month or less.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; Picked up a black stand as well</li>
            <li> I had previously.  </li>
            <li> It was black, which matched my razor handle</li>
            <li> so it is slightly easier.</li>
            <li> it should&#x27;ve at least last a few months.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight wobble in the brush.</li>
            <li> Had this brush for less than a week before the brush separated from the handle.</li>
            <li> this is a typical occurrence with cheaper brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have another variety of these that is starting to slowly lose hairs, but the handle in this one is really firmly keeping them in place.</li>
            <li> Less than 3 week of use and  the handle detached</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles come out, but not enough to make it bald or even really be a serious annoyance.</li>
            <li> Glue holding the brushes in came off after less then 10 uses</li>
            <li> Just punch or drill a few holes in the top or base</li>
            <li> It will soften over time, but still provide a slight edge in order to exfoliate your skin and handle shaving soap.</li>
            <li> if you go and find the most expensive, highly rated Plisson, white badger brush and decide that you hate it, you&#x27;re out 350 bucks!  </li>
            <li> Very few hairs came loose when I used it.</li>
            <li> it is not so bad that the brush use useless, but if youre looking for a realy smooth soft bristle brush</li>
            <li> The hair stinks, and even after weeks of using great smelling shave creams (proraso/col conk) it still stinks and loses hairs.</li>
            <li> I mean, that would look really silly, right?</li>
            <li> The first time I soaked this brush, it was a little dirty and smelled funky, but once used a couple of times, this goes away.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy first few times, kinda gave up on it</li>
            <li> it did lose a few bristles (as expected), but no more than a dozen or so</li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;hair bit\\&quot; is a little on the sparse side, but it is sufficient and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all on me yet</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about spending a lot of money for a brush</li>
            <li> (I was a little scared of it</li>
            <li> That was of course until I came across this little beauty.</li>
            <li> after six years use I lost my brush.after a little detective work I found someone who sold this particulate brush.</li>
            <li> so I have little knowledge for comparison.  </li>
            <li> Sheds a little bit too, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now</li>
            <li> The glue is apparently weak or not used properly.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little softer than my boar brush, but all in all</li>
            <li> The handle could be a little longer.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little pricey</li>
            <li> it does take a little while for it to brake in</li>
            <li> It does smell a little but is tolerable.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a smell</li>
            <li> had a bad experience with it the first time I used it, though, so be careful!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few months now, maybe 3-4 times a week, and I haven&#x27;t had a single shave that hasn&#x27;t included at least a few hairs coming out of this</li>
            <li> Works as you would expect but the brush has come unglued from the handle quite a few times.</li>
            <li> nice brush but smells awful.</li>
            <li> It looses a few bristles ever now and then</li>
            <li> Few bristles lost.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush for a few months now and it sheds a few hairs with every shave.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap at all</li>
            <li> I use a variety of soaps including Art of Shaving sandalwood, arko, and proraso green .</li>
            <li> Until he&#x27;d used it a few times, and the soap smell got into the brush, the cats thought this was a toy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using faithfully for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now without issue.</li>
            <li> The SB brush has a shorter handle and does not fit in the stand unless you hang between bristles and handle..</li>
            <li> This brush became my everyday brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush months ago and the company, SimplyBeautiful, keeps emailing every few weeks to review their item.</li>
            <li> To get it to hang, you have to jam it, scratching the narrow spot on the handle.</li>
            <li> It was dried and cared for but still broke.</li>
            <li> so I will update my review after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Escali badger, or the Tweezerman badger for approximately the same price.</li>
            <li> It does shed a few hairs.</li>
            <li> After a shave I notice a few brush hairs in the tub or sink.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> after a few uses it goes away.</li>
            <li> It has also lost a few strands from the brush as well.</li>
            <li> I have seen a few bristles come out over time, but not a lot.  </li>
            <li> This goes away after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> People have used oxyclean to make the smell go away faster, but I just made a few lathers with it and washed it a bunch.  </li>
            <li> and I just had it for a few shavings</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Still gets the job done, and it is an inexpensive brush, so I can&#x27;t justify giving that harsh of a review.</li>
            <li> The badger hair was poorly glued to the handle and simply came out.  </li>
            <li> Not a surprise as it is a dead animal</li>
            <li> But, it goes away with few shaves.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, everything settled in.&lt;br /&gt;Great Brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles falling out heavily after 2.5 months of use.</li>
            <li> The stink did come out after a few uses for us though.</li>
            <li> Says it feels like you are snuggling with a fluffy animal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in April of 2014, and within a few months the glue which held the brush in the handle no longer held the brush in it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> lose a few bristles here</li>
            <li> it is not a smooth brush.</li>
            <li> The brush piece came off after a few days</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just started to lose a few hairs here and there now.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal and not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> The brush has always been stored bristles down in a stand, so I am not sure why this would happen.    </li>
            <li> The bristles in this brush are rather stiff and tend to fall out a few at a time with each use.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that this particular brush does not fit into the stand I ordered where I thought it would-near the base of the handle.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before buying but have not had any negative issues ( odor or hair falling out) just plenty of lather.</li>
            <li> Brush didn&#x27;t last long before the entire bundle of bristles became detached from the base.</li>
            <li> I have had a few hairs, but not more than a few, per shave leave the brush.</li>
            <li> The handle does feel a little small in my hand but it has not been a hindrance.  </li>
            <li> Cannot stand the mess it makes!</li>
            <li> After using it a and carefully suspending it to dry there has been just the faint smell of soap, no musk, no mildew.</li>
            <li> A lot less expensive, but the quality is equal to Art-of-shaving stuff!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to glue down all the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is the first bad review I have made on Amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell - It does have a really bad smell when first opened.  </li>
            <li> and it usually goes away after a few uses with soap.</li>
            <li> have the very inexpensive Tweezerman brush and a very expensive Thatcher silver boars heard brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly rank when it gets wet, but to me that just means it&#x27;s new and not quite broken in yet, and it&#x27;s not enough for me to take any of it&#x27;s stars away.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the thing stinks when wet.</li>
            <li> I decided on this brush as it was the least expensive natural bristle brush I could find.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;little brush that could\\&quot; has served me well!</li>
            <li> On the very first use the bristles came unglued from the base.  </li>
            <li> I endured this for about 3 months until I got tired of picking off the loose bristles on my shaving soap and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not recommend non-badger brushes as they are very stiff and not nearly as comfortable as badger bristles.  </li>
            <li> so I got a little pearl sized amount of shampoo and massaged it into the bristles and let it soak for about an hour and to say the least</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it has lost very little hair.</li>
            <li> No noticeable odor and very little shedding.  </li>
            <li> ; complaint is that I still experience some bristle loss even after using it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to spend a lot on a more expensive brush and be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll now I&#x27;m stuck with a stinky shedding one :/</li>
            <li> , just did my usual soak-then-lather thing with it...</li>
            <li> The brush is small.</li>
            <li> I find that when it comes to quality, you usually get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but seems to last forever!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bit small.    </li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but this brush performs well and after a few uses the animal smell that is commonly mentioned, when using a product made of animal hair, went away.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caveats: the brush does shed, but no more than the cheaper boar bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is supposed to do that.</li>
            <li> However it is a bit on the small side.  </li>
            <li> , it has a small handle</li>
            <li> Very few hairs come off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind bristles as I&#x27;ve seen on other shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> That being said, it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize how expensive some of these brushes can cost.</li>
            <li> Not softest, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be because very soft brush is a bad massager.</li>
            <li> It lathers thickly and loses very few bristles--unlike the synthetic brush I used to use.</li>
            <li> And, it’s hard to beat the price.</li>
            <li> My shaves have never been closer, and I don&#x27;t get cuts in the hard to shave places anymore.</li>
            <li> The brush is hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little annoyed that the bristles continue to dislodge.  </li>
            <li> The brush does has a bit of smell to it, but it is bothersome (at least the one I got).  </li>
            <li> My conclusion: the badger was dirty, and the hair wasn&#x27;t properly cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Beyond the cheap quality and deceptive size, it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> functionality over form at least.</li>
            <li> Not upset, but not thrilled either.</li>
            <li> waste your time and money on this poorly made item.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> : It smells terrible for the first few days, even after treating it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thin, floppy and sad excuse for a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> After learning to shave with a safety razor 50 years ago, I was tired of paying a small fortune for cartridge refills and thought I&#x27;d return to where I started my shaving adventures.  </li>
            <li> Have not experienced any of the negative issues of some of the negative posts.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from the insanely overpriced Gillette Mach 3 razor system to a Double Edge razor.</li>
            <li> Does everything the expensive brushes do at half the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll lose an occasional hair, but as bad as some others.</li>
            <li> If it still sheds after a week of daily use, that is a bad sign.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for a shaving brush I had owned for about 12 years and, unfortunately, had misplaced.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not good, it works.</li>
            <li> I bought two as Christmas gifts even though some reviews said, &amp;#34;it might stink but that will dissipate.&amp;#34; Maybe it stinks when wet</li>
            <li> The base is slightly too wide to slide into the stand&#x27;s arms.</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes that have lasted longer, so it is disappointing that it is doing this so soon.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the fur is what I&#x27;m smelling but it is not pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> The hairs fall out, and weak material.</li>
            <li> And for the price I&#x27;m not sure how you can go wrong purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> Weak and non durable.</li>
            <li> It still stinks a little</li>
            <li> Their quality control is poor, too.</li>
            <li> The hairs are clipped, so it is irritatingly scratchy.</li>
            <li> Basically poor quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> After you get it broken in this thing works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush approximately 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> Broken and I haven&#x27;t even used it...</li>
            <li> Poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> However, 8 months later the base and the hair separated and pieces of hair started coming out.</li>
            <li> Based on the poor quality of manufacturing</li>
            <li> but it shed worse that a cat in the beginning of summer.</li>
            <li> But six months later ALL of the bristles came out in one chunk (still glued at the base).</li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviewers the brush I received didn&#x27;t have a particularly bad odor.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t spend some ridiculous dollar amount!</li>
            <li> The bristles were loose and then came OUT of the plastic base.  </li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy which is dangerous when using a safety razor and the bristles get stuck in the blade every other stroke.</li>
            <li> Although there seems to always be a few stray bristles (bad hair day for brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> issue with it was how bad it stinks when wet.  </li>
            <li> However, I am a little disappointed with the brush.</li>
            <li> , it is a waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> I used a stand to hang the brush upside down (as you&#x27;re supposed to do) while it dries, so it couldn&#x27;t have been water in the base that caused the bristles to fall out.</li>
            <li> It is still shedding bad (at least 50 bristles) after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Soaked in dawn and borax at least 4 times and stills smells bad.</li>
            <li> No smell whatsoever (beyond a faint scent of Gillette Foamy).  </li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.  </li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical about the product given</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but there&#x27;s no polite way to describe it, so I&#x27;ll leave it to the reader&#x27;s imagination.  </li>
            <li> This is sort of absurd if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Looks like the glue that attached it to the handle failed.</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer of \\&quot;Crazy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that one was unavailable.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why some shaving brushes are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this thing is still shedding 5-10 hairs every shave.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong at $12.</li>
            <li> Not impressed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had (and sadly lost,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the handle fell off and detached from the bristles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect all the bells and whistles of an expensive brush, but</li>
            <li> a few bristles would fall out during use (annoying).</li>
            <li> This can be from a dye of some sort but because the brush smells like dirty animal</li>
            <li> it stinks though..</li>
            <li> , the water was dirty brown and smelled of that &amp;#34;wet</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> The brush literally stinks.</li>
            <li> But after about 6 months the handle inexplicably fell off</li>
            <li> These can get expensive!  </li>
            <li> It has lost some bristles, but nothing to mad about.</li>
            <li> It did not have an unpleasant odor like others</li>
            <li> It smells like dirty animal hair and really bad.</li>
            <li> It smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> What was bad though, was that it smelled like &amp;#34;Badger Butt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bad.  </li>
            <li> I had this brush for all of 2 days before I realized it was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> The product smelled so bad on the arrival and the brush hair were coming out when putting to put the shave</li>
            <li> Did I just get a bad one???  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush about 6 months ago and it started off with a bad animal odor.</li>
            <li> how bad it stunk</li>
            <li> Meaning now I&#x27;m just holding a bunch of badgers hairs in my hand and rubbing it on my face like a barbarian.</li>
            <li> I got sick of picking badger ass hairs off my face and out of my razor</li>
            <li> It broke within a couple of days :(</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> The packaging was Also crap.</li>
            <li> This is even with the brush in a holder so water doesn&#x27;t collect in the base</li>
            <li> This brush replaced a wood base, synthetic brush that I use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Plastic base, semi-soft bristles, holds moisture well.</li>
            <li> The biggest disappointment was how it arrived: the packaging was absolutely terrible!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After around a month of use the brush became detached from the base.  </li>
            <li> Do not store it on it&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s base)</li>
            <li> Brush bristles separated from the base.</li>
            <li> I was leery when it arrived as it seemed &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s base.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the idiot issue that others described</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very disappointed with this brush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.    </li>
            <li> Very disappointed guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, and this just reaffirms my belief in &amp;</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any man looking to elevate his &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game !!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely TERRIBLE brush....</li>
            <li> Nasty....</li>
            <li> I braced myself as I opened the package, I was prepared for the worst road kill stench known to mankind</li>
            <li> This is the worst brush I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> Brush has horrible animal odor to it.  </li>
            <li> Horrible brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made but smells terrible.</li>
            <li> It also smells terrible, so I&#x27;m just going to throw it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheaply made. The hair smells like wet dog when it gets wet. Gross. The bristles are actively falling out as you soap up. I had all these loose bristles I had to work around while shaving. Their quality control is poor, too. The bristles were all different lengths poking out from the rounded profile. The packaging was Also crap. Do yourself afavor. Spend the extra money for a GOOD badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Sheds like crazy first few times, kinda gave up on it</li>
            <li> Nice and soft shaving brush.Much better then Boar Bristle brush.A bit short handle for someone with big hands.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  Doesn&#x27;t shed, makes great lather.  Doesn&#x27;t smell at all.  Completely and totally satisfied; wish I would have bought this long ago.</li>
            <li> Okish, hair falls our constantly.  It makes me worried a bit about how well this thing is put together.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush for the price. Looks nice and works well. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, i have used really expensive brushes and i have used more affordable brushes, this one is one of the best i&#x27;ve used. Great price badger hair is perfect especially after a few uses. Lathers and spreads cream perfect. I will be purchasing another one soon. Used with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream.</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible. I used it for about 3 months. It constantly lost hairs. It has absolutely no backbone. The hairs are clipped, so it is irritatingly scratchy. For the same price or less you can get a boar hair brush of fantastic quality.  Do that.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised about this brush</li>
            <li> Received in good time - brush is excellent have not had hair loss at all, last brush I had&lt;br /&gt;would leave more hair on my face than wiskers.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been a brush shaver for many years and I just bought this one as a replacement for my one that I had for 10 years.  So far it seems to be of good quality and hopefully it will serve me for another 10 years.  Prompt service for this brush and shaving cream will make me order from this company again.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful! it did lose a few bristles (as expected), but no more than a dozen or so during the first couple of shaves. It works great with soap as well as creams and makes a rich lather. For the price, it is a must buy!! Just wish it came with a stand&lt;br /&gt;Alex</li>
            <li> This badger brush is definitely good for the price you pay. Absorbs water well. Works good with the shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;Performs good for what it is. I&#x27;m sure there are better and more expensive brushes out there, but I must say this brush did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Works as you would expect but the brush has come unglued from the handle quite a few times. This is even with the brush in a holder so water doesn&#x27;t collect in the base</li>
            <li> All you need. Holds up. Good quality. Great value.&lt;br /&gt;- A bald dude with a beard.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve owned and used this brush now for 4 months. For the most part it has been fine. It still sheds bristles, thinking that it would stop, but never did.&lt;br /&gt;Now after 4 months, the handle and the brush separated, so now I&#x27;m looking for a replacement. Hoping to get more use out of it, but guess not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush and it arrive promptly and was excellent until it fell apart. All the bristles came out of the handle in one bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I used crazy glue to attach bristles back to the handle, but it made the bristles less flexible and using the brush less comfortable...</li>
            <li> Could not ask for a better brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Does its job, but isn&#x27;t the best out there. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for the price. The bristles fell off the handle after 4 months of daily use and I glued them back with krazy glue.</li>
            <li> Nice Brush.  I thought it was as good as the 60 dollar brushes at the mall.</li>
            <li> Brush is very very soft and feels great. It did have a weird scent when I first got it, soaking it in soapy water seemed to do the trick. My last brush broke at the handle, this one seems pretty well built.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted there is a slight musky odor when the brush is first used. I take this to be a good sign that it is genuine badger hair as advertised. In the several weeks I&#x27;ve been using it the brush has created and held a good lather with Williams Shave Soap after a simple dunk in a sink of hot water and a shake off of the excess. There has been little to no shedding and it fits great in my Colonel Conk stand. For the price I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> After using a boar brush for so long this brush feels like a feather duster. It is well made and performs beautifully. It makes lather rapidly and rinses out quickly. I&#x27;m relegating my boar brush to &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; status and using this one as my main brush.</li>
            <li> Great starter brush.  But, after you get the hang of wet shaving, it&#x27;s best to go for a custom-made or higher quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for a shaving brush I had owned for about 12 years and, unfortunately, had misplaced. This one was significantly cheaper, but it was most certainly a case of you get what you pay for. It is very rough and makes my skin itch. I would suggest you spend the extra money and get a better quality brush from say &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving&amp;#34; or others.</li>
            <li> nice brush but smells awful.</li>
            <li> honestly, i don&#x27;t know any better, first time buying and using this sort of product, nevertheless, its been about a month and there is no change in &amp;#34;fit and function&amp;#34;, which is, it does the job and i didn&#x27;t spend some ridiculous dollar amount!</li>
            <li> Looks good and works as well as many that are much more expensive. It looses a few bristles ever now and then but that hasn&#x27;t made it any less useful for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> After a month the initial &amp;#34;gamey&amp;#34; odor hasn&#x27;t left.  I&#x27;ve sniffed other badger brushes in stores and didn&#x27;t notice this smell.  It performs well.  Creates a nice lather.</li>
            <li> When multiple soaking washes with Dawn dish soap and hydrogen peroxide didn&#x27;t get the smell out, in the garbage it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not kidding. It smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> Bristles feel nice and works up a very good lather, but like some other reviewers, the bristles came unglued from the handle fairly quickly.  I&#x27;m still using it but haven&#x27;t been able to find something more durable as an adhesive.  The handle looks nice.</li>
            <li> Been using a boar bristle brush for years.  This well-priced badger brush -- tho a bit small -- works much better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used, is very soft, and is easy to rinse and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrific bargain.</li>
            <li> A beautiful brush that works real well</li>
            <li> For the price its at the pure badger shaving brush is a good starter. The bristles have not started coming off yet, and is soft and works well. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly for cleaning cyano bacterial slime off reef rocks!</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly as advertised.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with a lot of loose bristles coming out or a smell when the brush got wet like some other reviews mentioned.  I&#x27;ve used the brush several times and it&#x27;s holding up well.  It worked up a lot of lather!  I was just using it with normal shaving cream, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for several weeks now am am quite pleased with it.  The price was right.  It seems well-made and it does the job a shaving brush is meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several purchasers mentioned an unpleasant odor, but upon unpacking, I gave the brush several good sniffs and was not aware of much if any smell at all.  Nevertheless, I followed the advice of another owner and &#x27;seasoned&#x27; the item before use: soaking it in soapy water, allowing my usual shaving cream to dry in the bristles before rinsing, etc.  Easy enough to do, and the brush has performed perfectly well since then.  No smell whatsoever (beyond a faint scent of Gillette Foamy).  I also read a few reviews above that complained about shedding, but this has not been my experience.  During my first two weeks of use, the brush lost a handful of bristles (certainly less than a dozen), but since then none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised by how well it fluffs-up each time I dry it (I purchased the matching Simply Beautiful brand &amp;#34;ebony&amp;#34; brush hanger––a simply-made device that fits the brush and works as advertised).  The black plastic or resin handle of the brush is smooth, weighty, and attractive.  All-in-all, a fine product and a bargain, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Will update my comments if it develops any problems in the future, though I do not expect this to happen.</li>
            <li> Love the Badger shaving brush!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using a synthetic brush for a couple years. After using this Badger bristle I am wondering why I waited so long. Great lather and coverage with my W-M brush soap.  My only nitpick is the brush did not come witha stand. No big deal, I just used the one that came with the old brush.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 months. Few bristles lost. Not softest, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be because very soft brush is a bad massager. Keeps its shape well. For $10 it works excellent.</li>
            <li> with this new brush, there is no more lathering in my hands which nows means water conservation, too.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned several boar bristle brushes. I however have a very sensitive face, and this brush feels like angel wings gliding across it. If you have a sensitive face then I strongly recommend this product. It lathers incredibly well and yet cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Gives a great coating, bristles aren&#x27;t harsh whatsoever and even has quite a nice smell. Overall, great for shaving and no need for an expensive one to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works just as it should.  It is a great price too.  I use it everyday and I would recommend for anyone looking for a good priced badger brush that works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price! Good introductory product. My only complaint is that a few of the hairs fall out each time I use the brush. I am not worried about all of the hairs being gone any time soon, but they do come out with some regularity. That being said, this is a great great brush for the price. Very soft.</li>
            <li> What can I say that hasnt been said, great quality, only 4-5 hairs fell out in the first 2-3 weeks and none since then...feels amazing and is great quality!</li>
            <li> I have had this a while now and holding up just fine you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I am still less than a year into wet shaving and my first shaving brush was comprised of very tough boars hair which I had to soak for 10 minutes to get it to soften up decently.  I bought this brush to try badger hair and I am very happy with the switch.  It is the lowest end of bager hair but is extremely soft.  I do not have to soak it like boars hair and it feels great on my face.  Although it is a small brush I can build up a good lather either directly on face or using a mug.  The handle feels solid and I do not think it will come apart like my boars hair brush which did so the other day.  A larger brush would provide a faster lather but I do tend to travel and find this brush is working out as an excellent size for that.  There was a slight smell when I first opened the package but a quick lather with Williams Shaving soap quickly eliminated it.  A hair or two does come out every couple of times I shave but considering the price I cannot complain.  For the novice it is great buy and for anyone else a good backup brush or travel brush.</li>
            <li> compact brush, hasn&#x27;t shed much, tight knot, shave good, woman like, me like!</li>
            <li> This brush is head and shoulders above the brush I use to use.  The bristles stay in the brush and the lather created is awesome.  Only one thing would make it better.  I use a shaving mug that is about two inches deep and the handle is a bit short.  That is the oly reason I did not give this brush 5 stars</li>
            <li> I really wish I had done this a long time ago. I hate to shave but must for employment, and I remember these from the \\&quot;good old days\\&quot;. Well, to make a long story quick, these are just wonderful. You get a nice lather using barber&#x27;s soap and any razor. Heck, I may even try a straight razor. Naaaaa</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Great brush. No problems</li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled with this</li>
            <li> I cannot argue with the price for this brush, and it does a very fine job of applying my Musgo Real shaving cream! I do find, however, that it continues to leave bristles on my face almost every morning. A minor annoyance, but I am knocking off one star for that...</li>
            <li> The handle is a simple plastic, but it is well-constructed without raised seams or anything else that detracts from its appearance.  The bristles are soft, but 3 weeks in and its still shedding 3-4 hairs every time I shave.</li>
            <li> This brush replaced a wood base, synthetic brush that I use in the shower.  The water proof coating on the wood brush cracked and feel apart within six weeks of use.  This brush looks like it will weather the shower better (I keep it in the shower on an inexpensive brush holder).  Initial smell was strong, but quickly went away after soaking overnight.  I have had minimal shedding.  Brush generates good lather using The Body Shop maca root shave cream (awesome).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all.  I was hesitant, because there is quite a range of badger hair brushes, and this is a cheaper model.  But so far it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Began to fall apart after only a few months of use.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pretty good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;hair bit\\&quot; is a little on the sparse side, but it is sufficient and it hasn&#x27;t shed at all on me yet (I have been using it over two weeks now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are \\&quot;Goldilocks-good\\&quot; (not too hard, not too soft).  If you use your shaving brush as both foam-development-, and foam-delivery-, system (as I do), then this is a good quality for a shaving brush to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is plastic which is good too, because it won&#x27;t be affected so much by the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; part of wet-shaving.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this shaving brush. It is soft but firm enough and creates a thick lather with little shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Good product for price, there are better quality products I&#x27;m sure but for the price point this works great.</li>
            <li> This brush is great the hairs are uniform and its just put together very good. It does what its supposed to do and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of months now. I use it almost every day. It&#x27;s still as soft as the day I got it. It holds shaving cream well and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The stiffness and density is great but the hairs fallout quite readily. I can&#x27;t imagine the brush lasting more than a year but it does a fantastic job at foaming up soaps.</li>
            <li> This brush is simple but quality for the price. It feels absolutely great and lathers soap very well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter brush.&lt;br /&gt;It gives great foam for the price.&lt;br /&gt;But it won&#x27;t be your last, it does shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a newbie to old school shaving, just starting with DE Safety Razors while waiting for my straight edge to arrive :)&lt;br /&gt;While traveling I picked up a synthetic brush from BodyShop for same price.  The contrast is significant.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as nice and doesn&#x27;t produce the same lather.  Seems to have 30% less brush</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  produces great lather for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I rather like this brush. For the cost, it is easily worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know for certain that it is badger hair in this brush, but I have no reason to believe that it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m honestly not educated enough about it to say.&lt;br /&gt;What I can say for certain is that I enjoy using this brush. It is stiff enough to pick up soap on a kokum butter soap puck and lather softly on my face. We will see how it holds up with age.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a simple black plastic, but that is a large reason why I chose to purchase this one. It looks nice and simple with no markings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty new to wet shaving. If my tastes change, I know I didn&#x27;t invest a lot into equipment and still got something that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Rough and scratchy, bristles fall out, smells like a wet dog.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> Fell apart only a few months in</li>
            <li> Good quality! Lost a few hairs in the first 2 uses, haven&#x27;t noticed anything since. The typical smell goes away after the 3-4th use.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush. That said I do like this brush but have nothing to compare to. It did shed a few hairs when I used it but not too many. It did not have an unpleasant odor like others have said and it worked great. Very happy with it so far and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I replaced an Art of Shaving brush, and I think the quality is the same, but at 1/10th the price. Great brush, and an even better value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few months now, maybe 3-4 times a week, and I haven&#x27;t had a single shave that hasn&#x27;t included at least a few hairs coming out of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great beginner&#x27;s shave brush for determining if you really want to give this kind of shaving a go, but I will be upgrading to a more rugged brush that doesn&#x27;t shed as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about spending a lot of money for a brush I wasn&#x27;t sure I would use in the first place. Different articles had convinced me to at least give up the \\&quot;lather in a can\\&quot; and try using a brush and cream/shaving soap. They were also adamant about using a badger hair brush over the others.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the SimplyBeautiful brush. It works like a charm, does a great job with the lather and application. It hold water well and rinses out easily. Shake off the excess, hang it up, and it is dry with no odors the next morning. Great value, great price. Perfection in a purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the second shaving brush I have owned. The first brush - different product, lasted about 6 months. The hairs were falling out of the brush clumps at a time. It pretty much started falling apart in about a month. I thought this was normal due to my lack of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give the Pure Badger Shaving Brush a try. Really like the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it has lost very little hair. The hair that it did lose was probably just stray strands as the brush hairs still looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much softer on the skin compared to my original brush. I believe my original brush was Horse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At last, just what I wanted. So much better than artificial or boar&#x27;s bristles, this brush whips a healthy lather.</li>
            <li> I replaced a boar bristle brush with this one because the boar brush kept losing bristles.  This brush doesn&#x27;t lose many bristles, but it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water as the boar brush, so I have to make sure it is very wet to get a decent lather.  Overall, I think this a better brush than the boar bristle as long as you keep it very wet when you lather it.</li>
            <li> This brush is a real deal...I&#x27;ve been using an Omega and the hairs have been falling out since day 1.  This brush has no hairs falling out, is very full, cleans up well, and does a super job of lathering the soap; as well as preparing the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the company from where I purchased this seems to genuinely care about their customers and the products they sell - that will keep me coming back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value, great brush, great company - GREAT-GREAT-GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times, and it falls apart more and more each time. I hope it will last for a year. Definitely spending a little more next time.</li>
            <li> I am using this brush with my travel shaving kit. I like it as much as I like my home-use Tweezerman brush. I use it a little differently than my home set up. I rub a shaving soap stick over my beard, then I wet the brush to lather up the soap. I have a vented plastic tube that I keep it in while traveling and it keeps the brush in shape and allows it to dry. Time will tell if the brush will hold up as well as hanging it to dry, but so far, so good. Probably best as a starter or traveling brush. By the way, mine did not stink, but I&#x27;ve had that happen to me before and it usually goes away after a few uses with soap.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, I recently entered the world of wet shaving.  I bought a cheap kit to try it out and found the boar hair brush a bit lacking.  I had heard a lot of hooplah about Badger brushes being the best and wanted to try it out without spending a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush delivers a good shave for a great price.  Very soft bristles, lathers well, etc.  The only caveat or problem I&#x27;ve experienced is that it does shed a decent amount.  I&#x27;ve had the brush for a few months now and it sheds a few hairs with every shave.  I store the brush properly and in a dry location so that is not the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, a great entry level brush for the beginner wanting to try out a badger brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft! It sheds quite a bit though.</li>
            <li> This was a great brush !! My buddies loved them ! Highly recommend it. If you want a great brush.  Buy it form here !</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Real badger hair- good lather&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;After a dozen uses hair is still falling out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for the price.  If you are unsure about DE shaving, this is perfect to try out.  Work the soap into a nice lather then apply in small circles so all of the hair softens/stands up a bit.  Be sure to wash it with mild soap, gently squeeze it out, and store it upside down in a stand.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Arko Shave stick, and it works like a champ. Great lather and I only lost about 4 bristles so far.</li>
            <li> it works, mine stopped loosing bristles after a month or less.  maybe there s better ones, but i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it maybe 4 or 5 times now and hair is still falling out pretty consistently. You can&#x27;t smell it unless youre shaking water out or if its close to your face. But it&#x27;s very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This brush is a pleasure to use and for the price it is very well worth it.  I don&#x27;t know what it is to use a high-end brush but I have no real complaints about this one.  Since I started wet-shaving using shaving soaps, brushes and safety razors I&#x27;ve had two other brushes prior to this one.  Well obviously I didn&#x27;t know how to take care of or treat those brushes before now, so after a lot of reading / YouTube research, I found that taking care of the brush is as important as shaving itself... Since I&#x27;ve done that, this brush has performed well.  I didn&#x27;t notice the pungent smell others experienced, it holds the soap / lather well and it feels good on my face and head when lathering up..... My &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; complaint is that I still experience some bristle loss even after using it for a few weeks now.  Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Finally found a customer to buy this brush. Big mistake. took it out of the box, unwrapped it and it fell apart. the bristles are not attached to the handle. no signs of ever being glued in and a very loose fit. Waste of money and a very dissatisfied customer.Beware!  I&#x27;ll never buy from them again. I have been a barber since 1964, and have never seen such shoddy workmanship.</li>
            <li> sheds hair liberally - brush hair length is too small and hair is too soft as compared to other brushes --</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a gift for my boyfriend, who had been complaining about his current shave setup-- shaving cream and a safety razor, which were hard on his skin. He really loves using this badger brush and getting a good lather with shaving soap. I don&#x27;t think he will ever go back to \\&quot;the usual\\&quot; setup again... sometimes the old ways are the good ways! Glad this item was available online for a very reasonable price compared to specialty shops. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This brush provides good value for money. It is not the most soft brush, but it works well. Initially when I used it, my skin became itchy. I believe you have to soak it in water for sometime and wash it 4-5 times to avoid this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert but I am very happy with this product.  It&#x27;s very soft yet sturdy. It is holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> This is my very first shaving brush and so far, it does great.  I have been using it now for over a month and have had no problem with it. A few hairs have fallen off, but from what I have read, it is completely normal and it should be expected.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  He mentioned that he had been looking in stores for an old fashioned shaving brush but couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  Amazon to the rescue!!  Now he is a happy camper!  He says he would recommend it.  I think I may try it on my legs!</li>
            <li> This is a smallish basic badger hair shaving brush. Not as soft as silvertips but it holds water very well and works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, build a good lather, and get under your whiskers well. What more do you need in a brush? Don&#x27;t get conned into paying a lot of money.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a safety razor I wanted the full effect. What else could one need? I&#x27;ll tell you  a 100% Badger brush!  Except while priced good this one fell apart after only 5 shaves. The handle separated from the bristles and the bristles constantly are left stranded in the shave creme. (which looks gross)</li>
            <li> Great brush! Super soft! Not cheap at all (I was a little scared of it appearing cheap due to it being a cheaper solid black brush), it&#x27;s beautifully crafted! And a nice addition to any shave set!</li>
            <li> For the price I am happy - I did not want to spend too much money, but wanted to see what &amp;#34;pure badger&amp;#34; is all about. This was it.  After soaking in warm water for a couple of minutes, I shake off excess water, swirl it in the tub of Proraso Shaving Soap (exquisite!) and then swirl it in my ceramic mug until I get nice lather. Very economical and plenty of foam to lather up your face 3-4 times (which you may need with straight edge razor). I was using a cheaper boar bristle brush of the same size and I like badger better.  A few bristles do come off periodically, but I assume this is about standard. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I was concerned that the head might come undone from constant contact with water, but it&#x27;s solid so far.  UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about 3 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I have since tried a couple of other cheap &amp;#34;badger&amp;#34; brushes (one of them was not 100% badger as advertised and the knot fell out of handle after a few months). This one is still solid. It&#x27;ll lose an occasional hair, but as bad as some others.</li>
            <li> Not bad but I defiantly could have found something better!</li>
            <li> Great products, well worth the money. This is my first badger shaving brush, and it works like a champ produces a lot of lather with the Arko shaving stick. Also got a good deal on Astra DE shaving blades. :-)</li>
            <li> The bristles fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this a long time ago and wanted to elaborate. The entire brush head of this fell out. The glue didn&#x27;t hold it in. I fixed it with some superglue, but this is not an uncommon problem for this brush.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive brush.  Very similar to the GBS pure badger black shaving brush (almost identical but no stand).  The brush is just a bit prickly on the face, but not bad.  The brush does has a bit of smell to it, but it is bothersome (at least the one I got).  Brush does lose a few hairs, but this is sometimes normal at the beginning.  brush dries well.  For the money it is not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try one of these shaving brushes. Amazing difference in the closeness of the shave. This is my first brush so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li> It helps lather the shaving soap well without getting it all slimy. He&#x27;s been using it for several weeks and we had not noticed any loss of bristles. It also rinses easily and still looks as good as new. We&#x27;ll definitely buy this brush again when the time comes to replace it (which might not be for a while).</li>
            <li> It smelled quite gamy first time under the faucet. After using it a and carefully suspending it to dry there has been just the faint smell of soap, no musk, no mildew. It lathers up instantly, brings up the stubble without waste of soap or blade. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;little brush that could\\&quot; has served me well! I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now and i absolutely love it. It is soft, lathers extremely well, and ive noticed no hair loss. I use a variety of soaps including Art of Shaving sandalwood, arko, and proraso green . Perfect brush for a beginner to wet shaving or a veteran as well.</li>
            <li> Good brush overall. It&#x27;s my first brush, but I like it a lot. Definitely considering buying another one for my brother. A plus also is how decently it&#x27;s priced!</li>
            <li> This brush was purchased for my husband. While I have not used it, it is nice looking and is sturdy. Husband seems pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very disappointed with this brush. The first time I used the brush I noticed a foul odor coming from it. I thought it might be because it was made from Badger hair and thought it would subside. I gave it another chance but after the second time using it, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and threw it out. Needless to say, I am looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit concerned about the smell of the bristles. But after reading a few pointers about soaking the brush in soapy dishwater, I noticed the smell diminished greatly. I have enjoyed a renaissance of shaving since I discovered the brush and soap with DE razors.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and for a great price. I would repurchase again and recommend. This works great to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great little brush. ..I use it in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price I paid, but after loosing a few bristles in the bugging it&#x27;s been holding great.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with my new black handled De safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my fist badger hair brush so I have nothing to compare it to but It seems like a nice brush. I have also never been up close to a badger so I can not say with any degree of accuracy that it is 100 percent pure badger. I will say I didn&#x27;t notice any wet badger smell as I was applying my shaving cream which is nice. I guess I am off to find a wet badger to smell and I will adjust my review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Picked up a black stand as well and .it looks great together</li>
            <li> I upgraded from Van Der Hagen&#x27;s beginner boar-hair brush. The difference is amazing; I can build a better lather in a fifth of the time. I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s such a difference, but my first guess is magic. Maybe even black magic. Who knows? :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, awesome price. I can&#x27;t imagine needing a better product. I&#x27;ve had it for three months and it&#x27;s holding up wonderfully. Do give it a shot.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I bought this simply for the price. I wanted a brush to use during a deployment to Afghanistan, and didn&#x27;t want to spend anything significant on something just to use there. This brush turned out to be at least as good as the expensive one that I have at home. I don&#x27;t know how the company manages to produce something of this quality for this price.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, other than the ones I use for weapons cleaning. This brush lathers well, holds soap and feels good against my face. Compared to other brushes, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and arrived in a reasonable amount of time, given that it came via APO. I like it!</li>
            <li> Brush works great, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer keep in mind this is a PURE Badger hair brush, complete with badger brush smell.</li>
            <li> A lot of people will steer people away from Pure Badger because of the brushes being stiffer/prickier. That is true, a silvertip boar brush will be a softer brush. A worn-in boar brush will be a softer brush. But, soft isn&#x27;t always good. I have a silvertip, and once I bought this brush....I have only used my silvertip for back of my neck shaves, while face/neck shaves have always been this brush. I prefer that stiffer feel, so for me, getting a pure badger was a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I LOVE this brush? No. Is it the BEST brush I have ever used? No. Well, yes, but I&#x27;ve only ever used the silvertip and a small sampler pure badger besides this. But you get the idea. It&#x27;s not a fantastic, amazing, special brush. But I paid 12 dollars for it. For that price, the fact that it performs as well as it does is fantastic and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a soft brush, this isn&#x27;t it. But if soft brushes aren&#x27;t your game, this brush is a feisty little bugger, and I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> This brush workes fine at firsy, but after using it about a month the hairs starting falling off.  I gueas you get what you paid for....cheap.</li>
            <li> Hairs came out on the very first use and have never stopped coming out.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> A good quality brush for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, and barely any hairs have come out.&lt;br /&gt;Simple styling, and good quality fibers.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. Good quality, great price and exactly what you expect for the price.  Much better than the boar hair brush I had previously.  It arrived quickly and I was using it right away.  Thank you mr badger, for donating your hair to my wonderful,shaving experience.  edit: the brush was nice, but after about 4 months started shedding a LOT. Probably lost about 10-20 bristles with each shave.  I ended up throwing it away and switching back to a really good Excelsior Boar&#x27;s hair brush.</li>
            <li> For less than $12.00 delivered this brush is a great value.  It works well for both face and bowl lathering and hasn&#x27;t shed a hair yet.  It is a pure badger brush so the hair is a bit prickly, but I actually like how it feels on my face.  If you have extremely sensitive skin it may not be the best for you.  The knot size on this brush is 20mm and the loft is 47mm.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent brush.  I wish that the density of the bristles were a bit higher, but I am happy with it for the price I paid.  I actually don&#x27;t use this for shaving; I use it to massage in my facial cleanser before rinsing.  You have to experiment with the pressure a bit to get the hang of it.  Not recommended for those with sensitive skin.  Sometimes my skin is very itchy afterward.  Also, not recommended if you have any breaks in the skin, as the scabs continue to open and won&#x27;t heal properly.  Very little bristle-loss - only a few over weeks of daily usage.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend a lot on a more expensive brush and be disappointed. So I spend less, $12, and I am quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;good brush good value</li>
            <li> Very nice and well constructed.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews I saw. Overall this is a decent quality brush with minimal shedding. It is pretty soft and does a nice job. I use Art of Shaving soap which does not need any effort to lather and this works perfectly with it. I also used it with African Shea butter (which does not foam) and it did a great job with it as well. Overall I have tried 4-5 other brushes and this is the best of them (under 25$) I suppose you can buy one in the $50+ range and beat it but why spend that much? Not fancy but functional.&lt;br /&gt;BTW-the handle is a little skinnier than other brushes I have used-it fits nicely in the Art of Shaving Brush Stand I use. My last brush was a pain to get in and it was messing up the bristles.</li>
            <li> Great value. Never in my wildest dreams would I have believed that badger hair would be so soft and comfortable to use.  I recommend it to all who prefer to lather with a brush to shave.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shave and better than others more expensive (currently unavailable though).  It is also small and compact (useful for traveling)</li>
            <li> I purchased this few months back for my son, and he loves it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to care for, just rinse with worm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I understand how SimplyBeautiful is able to give such a good deal on a badger hair brush. Its the hair around the anus of the badger. The hair stinks, and even after weeks of using great smelling shave creams (proraso/col conk) it still stinks and loses hairs.</li>
            <li> The glue holding the bristles to the handle came undone within 2 weeks of using.  This is a very cheaply made product.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush lathers up nice bristles very tight in brush good brush for the money I would recommend this brush to a friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of shaving with a safety razor, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on my first brush. This brush seemed like a good option. It was black, which matched my razor handle ([[ASIN:B005RZDEEC Merkur 20C Long Handle Black Double Edge Safety Razor]]), and I knew it would fit in the brush and razor holder that I wanted to get ([[ASIN:B00AG92BXY SimplyBeautiful Black Brush &amp; Razor Stand - Fits Various Shaving Brushes and Razors]]) since that is made by SimplyBeautiful, as well. The price was right, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the brush arrived, I immediately took it out of the box to inspect it. The handle is simple, yet stylish, and the badger hair was soft to the touch. Next, I pulled on the hair to see how well the knot was secured to the handle. It popped right out, glue and all. Immediate one star reduction. I managed to superglue the knot back into the handle, and it seems to be holding up well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the knot coming loose, the brush has performed well in the two weeks that I&#x27;ve used it. It whips up a good lather, but the hair isn&#x27;t as soft on my face as I would like it to be. I guess that&#x27;s the difference between this brush and a $50+ silvertip badger brush. I plan on upgrading eventually, but this was a great value and is a very good starter brush. If the knot were secured to the handle better, I would have given it 5 stars. I would recommend this to those looking for their first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The small handle will allow it to fit in your stand, and the bristles are nice and soft.  It did not stink like others have noted.  Good quality brush and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Shed hair with every use. Today after 4 months (60 uses aprox.) it shed a lot more than before and the knot came loose from the handle. Definitely not going to keep using it, bought a quality boar brush to replace it for the same price.</li>
            <li> Nice density on the bristles. Sturdy handle.  Perfect size.  It only took a little bit of breaking in.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> Excellent lather, very comfortable and easy to use, seems to maintain excellent condition after a few shaves. Very few hairs come off.</li>
            <li> Not an expert on shaving brushes (yet), but this brush is very soft and has lost very few hairs. What was bad though, was that it smelled like &amp;#34;Badger Butt&amp;#34; out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, over the past month using different shaving soaps, the smell is now almost completely gone - a definite bonus. The brush is just fine now and is quite acceptable.</li>
            <li> This brush is significantly better than my last and it comes at a great price. The brush lathers well and feels great when applied to the face. You may, however, want to purchase a stand for this brush to dry out after use.</li>
            <li> The brush lathers up well and makes my face feel great.  I would Highly recommend it. The service by  SimplyBeautiful was also top-notch.</li>
            <li> Brush is awesome and very soft keeps its shape even when wet. The Brush makes a really good lather and pushes the lather underneath the hair. Very reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today. NO bad smell at all. I soaked it for 30 min anyway. It works perfect :)</li>
            <li> This is the only badger brush I have ever used so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to but it works well and creates a nice lather!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful badgers! This brush is soft, yet, very effective in stimulating the face prior to shaving. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before so I have nothing to compare it to.  I feels of good quality and besides the initial shedding which I expected, I feel it will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s new way of shaving has made him purr!  This along with the jar of shave cream, pre-shave oil and Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm have been giving him great, close, shaves without causing irritation.  This brush foams up the smallest dollop of shave cream!  He is loving this.</li>
            <li> Plastic base, semi-soft bristles, holds moisture well. the bristles are a little shorter than I expected but it certainly works just fine and I think it&#x27;s a bargain for the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer than I&#x27;d like, and when I received it the bristles were kind of going every which way. Hopefully that will change from use. It does work, it lathers okay and applies okay. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s not good, it works. So, 3 stars for being average.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;m a female, I have a lot of experience with natural/animal cosmetic brushes but this is my first &amp;#34;real badger shaving brush&amp;#34;. The mark of a cheap cosmetic brush is shedding and that&#x27;s why you buy expensive brushes, well that must be true for shaving brushes as well because this brush sheds a lot. Probably 50-80 hairs in my shave soap and more on my legs with the first use. (yes I cleaned it first)  and Idk if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real badger&amp;#34;  it might actually be skunk because it smells. Bad.  My legs are located pretty far from my nose so maybe I could deal with the stink but if you are using this on your face? I&#x27;m sorry.  I should have gone the extra $40 and bought a good brush but I didn&#x27;t and we&#x27;ll now I&#x27;m stuck with a stinky shedding one :/ maybe the shedding and stink will lessen? Idk.  But you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> For the money, this brush is of very high quality. If you are thinking of upgrading from a simple boar brush, this is the one to go with. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to complete a starter manual shaving gift set. I have been using a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] and would have ordered one of those if I had not seen this item. It has a very classy look--no extraneous markings, just a quality brush with a beautiful black base. I have not personally used it, but I have been told it has a nice, soft feel. I would definitely recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> Very well made-really works up a lather-makes shaving easier. I have said what I want. These words are only fillers.</li>
            <li> great price yes its been shedding during break in but most do&lt;br /&gt;B&amp;B has guys recommending this brush....im old school for a better, cheaper shave!&lt;br /&gt;i dont buy $300 brushes and 40 pucks of soap! i find low cost shaving items, and SHAVE.</li>
            <li> First off, I have no issue at all with this brush as it performed as expected. I guess I don&#x27;t get the point of using a brush cause other than the experience of a very frothy lather for either personal reasons or just to add to the ritual of shaving I have found no added value in using a brush. I have an assortment of shaving soaps and am a wet shaver using a Gillette super speed with shark super chrome DE blades. I know everyone has their &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shaving products and if yours requires a brush then by all means get this one but I just use my fingers to lather and it works better for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is okay.  Reading the reviews, I thought it was going to be something wonderful and decided to buy it for my boyfriend as an add-on gift for the Merkur razor I bought him for Christmas.  The biggest disappointment was how it arrived: the packaging was absolutely terrible!  This lost a star for me.  The white, cardboard box it came in was completely mangled and broken...I couldn&#x27;t even fix it enough to be able to wrap it so it went in a bag instead.  In the process of wrapping it in the bag, some bristles fell out...this lost a star for me too because it hasn&#x27;t even been used yet so it should not be shedding bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will see how he likes this brush - depending on his opinion, I may give this brush another star back..</li>
            <li> It is way too small and too soft I ant make lather with it  and it smelled bad so for what it&#x27;s worth  spen some real money and get a good brush. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I bought it for my husband and he thinks it&#x27;s a great brush. He has recommended this brush to his friends. No compliants here.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving having switched from cartridge razors and canned soap to a DE Razor and Wet Shaving Soap/Cream about 3 months ago. This brush is so much better than the boars hair brush I originally used. It is much softer, lathers the soap better and loses far less hairs (actually very few hairs in total). Although I cannot compare it to an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; Badger Brush, I am very satisfied with my experience thus far. And, it’s hard to beat the price. I hope this brush lasts a long time. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, although the proper way to store/let dry a shaving brush is by hanging it upside down; I have found that by rinsing out the excess soap, then squeezing out the excess water between thumb and forefinger, shaking it dry and then rapidly &amp;#34;swatting&amp;#34; the bristles back and forth against my other hand, the brush is pretty well dry before I place it back in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve bought since switching to safety razors, so I cannot compare it to others.  That being said, it&#x27;s quite smooth and comfortable and spreads the cream around well.  I have not noticed any animal odors as others have, doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After around a month of use the brush became detached from the base.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is because I left it in warm water for too long or if it&#x27;s an assembly issue.  I used superglue to put it back on and have had to reapply. I may of just gotten a defective one.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I think it&#x27;s a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive shaving brush, but I like this one better.  Does a great job of creating a rich lather and looks good too.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic especially for the price. The bristles are soft and absorb water very well and also makes a great lather. I was kinda skeptical about the product given it&#x27;s low price, but this thing is a diamond in the rough!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he is very happy with it.  Will order again when a replacement is needed.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to put his shaving cream on with this brush and it was perfect!  It is very well made and should last as long as the last one, (37 years).  He did not know if he could find a new one, I typed it in on amazon and there it was!  Thank You amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a month or two, and it&#x27;s working slightly better than the Escali brush I also have, so I&#x27;ve been using it most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad experience with it the first time I used it, though, so be careful!  I had rinsed it a bit but other than that, just did my usual soak-then-lather thing with it... but when I put it on my face, there was a REVOLTING smell.  I freaked out a little and finished up with the Escali, then examined the new brush.  My conclusion: the badger was dirty, and the hair wasn&#x27;t properly cleaned.  (I refuse to dwell on what that smell was)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I lathered-and-rinsed it a few times, and since then it&#x27;s fine, and performs wonderfully!  I recommend it heartily for the price, but wash it first!  :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wanted this for his birthday! i got it and he loves it!! :) Thanks for the best gift!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush for the price. Got these and put them into a shaving pack that I made for my groomsmen &amp; they were a hit. Bought one for myself too - works great.</li>
            <li> This brush was great. I use it to apply clay masks at a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It worked better than I expected, spreading evenly and really holding the mask well, I will never go back to applying clay masks by hand. It cleans easily and drys great. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles coming out. The only issue is that the thing stinks when wet. I didn&#x27;t realize this and originally thought it was the clay I was applying but no. It was definitely the brush. After some research I realized this isn&#x27;t an issue with the brush as that&#x27;s what pure badger hair does, but just be aware. It smells fine when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this brush for all your shaving brush needs as it&#x27;s an excellent product at the right price, just don&#x27;t smell it while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and affordable.  Nothing fancy about the handle, but the bristles are very soft and it lathers well.  Construction seems solid, but I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak as to long-term durability.</li>
            <li> Husband just switched to safety razor a couple months ago - he bought this with the Ogallala products and the results are great.  He loves the brush, and bought the stand here also.  Only trouble was the cats!  Until he&#x27;d used it a few times, and the soap smell got into the brush, the cats thought this was a toy and it disappeared from the bathroom a couple times until we turned the stand to the back of the sink.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and great price for badger hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised it didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;badger stink&amp;#34; that new brushes sometimes have.&lt;br /&gt;Works great with creams, and although I&#x27;ve used it with soap a stiffer brush would be better.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little smaller than a pig bristle brush that I have used from time to time, it does the job well of spreading and working in whatever facial emollient I use with my Panasonic electric wet/dry razor. i just started with a brush after a long time. I like this one just fine.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but first time I used it the hair fell off the handle.  I super glued it back on and works fine now.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for the price! I would definitely recommend especially if you&#x27;re new to using a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 15 years and the dollar soap last a year each. The 2 dollar single blade razor 2 more dollars for 100 blade. shaving the cheapest thing i do now.</li>
            <li> I paired this brush with the Mission Style Wood brush/razor stand and the Colonel Conk Santa Fe shave bowl.  The whole set has exceeded my expectations and they look great together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush lost a few hairs in the first 2-3 uses, but that&#x27;s normal.  Other than that it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> I like a slightly stiff, very full brush with no shedding, and this brush is exactly that.  It works perfectly, however I was shocked by the odor that hit me the first time I used it.  I&#x27;m sorry, but there&#x27;s no polite way to describe it, so I&#x27;ll leave it to the reader&#x27;s imagination.  If I were the manufacturer I&#x27;d definitely pre-wash it before sale to neutralize the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I liked the feel of the brush so much that I cleaned it a second, and then a third time.  Now I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks, and the odor is 99% gone.  Despite the initial odor issue I really would buy another one if this were lost.  The brush is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now been five weeks.  The odor is just a distant memory now, and I love the brush.  Very glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it.  Best one I&#x27;ve used in almost thirty years.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a beginner brush and I am completely satisfied. The bristles feel great and does work the soaps into a great lather. I&#x27;ve been using faithfully for a few months now and I haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle. This is definitely better than the kit one from Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small thing I would like to see is an an extended handle. However, this does not affect rating. I&#x27;d prefer the longer handle to help whip faster to get a better lather. But like I said not a big deal. Great purchase all around!</li>
            <li> it does need  a little finesse with rinsing, but for the price, you can&#x27;t honestly ask for better i m jut happy with it.</li>
            <li> The hairs fall out, and weak material. For the price its a meh.</li>
            <li> Solid product and sanely priced. This will give you everything you expect in a pure badger brush and you&#x27;ll be spared the arrogance of stores like The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23, and have light but coarse facial hair (I am part middle-eastern). I bought this brush after the one my grandpa gave me started to lose more bristles than it had. This brush works great, holds water and lather well (I use Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood), and my dad often tries to take it from me when he visits. The price is just an even greater selling point, because what you get is a heavy, durable, fine bristled brush that works very well.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job at a very competitive price. It has, over the last few weeks, lost a few hairs, but lathers nicely and has maintained its shape well.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be bigger, as I am using it to lather to shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled a bit funny to begin with, but that is wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;Works great otherwise!</li>
            <li> Works great, looks good, Defiantly worth the money. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, been useing it three weeks now.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is great! Two shaves in and have no idea how I shaved properly the past 25 years. Actually had a comment today on how close my shave was.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter brush if you&#x27;re not sure about shaving like this yet. Badger hair is def the way to go. This applies nicely and cleans up in no time. Would recommend to anyone novice or experienced</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to keep at my girlfriend&#x27;s after I bought the Omega 13109, which is a fantastic brush, by the way. I like the heaviness of the handle, but overall the brush has a cheap feel to it and the hairs tend to fall out quite a bit. It&#x27;s not my preferred brush, but considering I use it only once or twice a week, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely TERRIBLE brush.... It had a number of decent reviews, so I was surprised when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now, it won&#x27;t stop shedding bristles and it has a very distinct chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away. Nasty....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY THIS, it is a waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money to start out on. Good value.</li>
            <li> Shed a lot, had to replace within the 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> not fancy but work great, rich lather</li>
            <li> Loose hairs are workingtheir way out as other reviewers have stated. Nice brush, rinses out easily and is really good value</li>
            <li> I had this brush for all of 2 days before I realized it was a bad purchase. In two shavings, more bristles fell out than I could count. It only got worse on the second day. The picture is deceiving too. The brush is small. Beyond the cheap quality and deceptive size, it smells terrible. I washed it, soaked it, and even used a pretty fragrant shaving cream with it. Nothing was covering up the smell. I ended up sending it back. Steer clear!</li>
            <li> Great brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Brush smelled alittle funky at first but it went away after the 2nd use. Been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any issue with shedding. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving brush at an excellent price.  Shipped fast.  Highly recommended seller.  Follow initial cleaning recommendations to the letter and you are good to go with a great wet shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived very quickly. As a user of shaving brushes for many years, I miss my silver tip brush with ivory handle that I had for 35 years, but when my son graduated law school, I passed my brush down to him for a keepsake. I bought this one until I can afford another one of the same quality I had before. This one seems to be fine for now; it has lost a few bristles, but I would have expected that from a brush at this price. There was no smell or odor as some have noted. For the price, this would be a great starter brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price. It makes a pretty good lather but it&#x27;s a little smaller than my last few brushes, and I have had some of the bristles fall out while lathering.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush lathers well with minimal shedding.  I like the look, feel and finish.  I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> The item arrived as described and appears to be pure Badger hair but I don&#x27;t think the hair was washed prior to making into a brush. The brush changes the water to a brownish color. This can be from a dye of some sort but because the brush smells like dirty animal I think it may be dirt. Now the price is right and the brush does the job. I just recommend soaking and washing brush prior to use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shaving brush look no further this is the perfect brush for a good price.  Easily makes a great lather when used properly, even with a cheapo can of shaving cream! Very satisfied with this brush and to top it off it matches my Edwin Jagger De86bl perfectly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a low cost badger brush and it shows. works well enough but definitely feels and looks &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34;. functionality over form at least.</li>
            <li> top quality as always</li>
            <li> It is everything it claims to be. And for the price I&#x27;m not sure how you can go wrong purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for a great lather.  This is my first badger brush and will be my last.  The price is great and the brush is quality.  Very few bristles have fallen out into my soap, which is considerably good since the action of proper lather is quite vigorous.</li>
            <li> I had recently switched to using shaving creams and brushes when shaving, and this brush was recommended to me and it works very well!  It applies cream to the face smoothly, and it cleans up easilly.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I may not be a shaving connoisseur (read snob), but I do know what feels good and works nicely.  As far as I am concerned, this is an $100 brush with a $12 price tag.  Great brush.  Feels good, lathers great, nice and fluffy.  What&#x27;s to complain about?  Buy it! Hey, look at it this way, if you go and find the most expensive, highly rated Plisson, white badger brush and decide that you hate it, you&#x27;re out 350 bucks!  This is sort of absurd if you ask me. Buy this one and you&#x27;ve coughed up about three fins.  Whoopty-do!  chance are, you&#x27;ll like it though!  Then you can take the remaining 345 dollars, buy a nice razor, a 5-year supply of good DE razorblades, a nice razor and get a GREAT shave!  Then, you&#x27;ll still have enough left to take your lady (she&#x27;ll love the shave) out to a nice dinner.  Yeah, totally great little brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace the one that came in a kit.  That one shed hairs like an old dog and it was made of boar bristles so it was a little coarse and didn&#x27;t lather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a big improvement. Soft bristles, great lather and it doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush, I just wished I started using it years ago.  My shaves have never been closer, and I don&#x27;t get cuts in the hard to shave places anymore.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and at a great price!!!!</li>
            <li> used twice both times the bristles were coming out to bad because it had a nice feel but it doesnt look like it will last long. Feels cheaply made for the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and a great buy. I purchased this to shave in the shower because the shaving cream can always gets rusty and stains the shelf. Problem solved and a much better shave as a bonus.</li>
            <li> The product smelled so bad on the arrival and the brush hair were coming out when putting to put the shave</li>
            <li> I just bought a more expensive brush, but this one is less costly but more superior in quality.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush at a decent price!&lt;br /&gt;  I stopped buying triple, quadruple, etc., etc. expensive razors a few years ago and decided to go back to the old double edge safety razor. For me that was a very good change. I get a closer smoother shave at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;  This Badger hair brush and a bar of shaving soap creates a great lather and the soap will last over a year. I had a cheap shaving brush with synthetic bristles before this one and it just did not compare. The badger hair is so smooth against your skin and raises a far superior lather in comparison to the cheap brush.  :-)</li>
            <li> Great brush, I would suggest this to anyone who need a new brush or is just starting to shave with a brush.</li>
            <li> Can’t wait to take this on the road. It‘s compact, yet full enough to foam up and cover my face quickly. Definitely needed to be washed before use, but after a few uses now it’s seasoned and ready for my travel set.</li>
            <li> This brush has been functional and has performed as promised. It doesn&#x27;t impress me BUT IT DOES NOT shed either (which is suggested by some reviews). My previous brush was a more expensive Art of Shave brand brush...so, I got what I paid for. This is a decent brush that is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. If you don&#x27;t want a brush to shred, you store it hanging (with the bristles down). Do not store it on it&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> Excellent little brush! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now without issue. No bristles falling out, dries quickly after use. Probably helps to squeeze excess water out prior to hanging it. The handle is plastic, but that&#x27;s fine with me. I&#x27;m not using the handle to lather my face. Pure Badger, hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband, he loves it....perfect starter brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said it stinks though..LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash with hot water and dish soap WELL, let sit in soapy water for some time....think he left it for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather it with shave soap, LOTS of it...and let it sit and dry on the brush over night....rinse, then it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave brush for the money. I have it about a month and it does the job admirably all for the price of your average synthetic brush. There is no comparison as the badger brush is far superior.</li>
            <li> The quality at this price,,,is great...i ordered 2 of them,and its working fine. Great lather. Bristles are smooth. Just ensure that you hang it in the stand upside down so as it will last long.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and it&#x27;s been absolutely amazing. Nothing feels more fantastic, smooth, or manly as an old fashioned shave. Love the product and would highly recommend. It&#x27;s also helped tremendously (with the additional use of a safety razor) to cut down on razor burn.</li>
            <li> Not much to say - it&#x27;s a shaving brush! It works as expected and does not shed hairs. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of these badger hair brushes after researching shaving brushes. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty tired of buying overpriced disposable cartridge razors and thought I&#x27;d try my hand at some good old fashioned wet shaving. I&#x27;ve read about the importance of using a good shaving brush for wet shaving and it seems badger hair brushes are the way to go. I find that when it comes to quality, you usually get what you pay for. That being said, it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize how expensive some of these brushes can cost. That was of course until I came across this little beauty. After reading some of the reviews on other similar brushes, I found they had issues with the hair (bristles) coming loose, or there not being enough bristles in the first place, or the handles not being good. Basically poor quality craftsmanship. I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve not had any of those issues with this brush and I&#x27;m amazed with the high quality of this brush, especially for the price. The handle has a nice weighted feel and the bristles are soft &amp; dense. I&#x27;ve only had a couple bristles come out but that is to by expected. I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good quality genuine badger hair brush at an economical price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;classact72</li>
            <li> Excellent product for your money.  Made to use immediately .  Handle is made with great quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> After learning to shave with a safety razor 50 years ago, I was tired of paying a small fortune for cartridge refills and thought I&#x27;d return to where I started my shaving adventures.  I didn&#x27;t use a brush as a kid and didn&#x27;t know anything about them but after reading all the reviews I could find, I decided to purchase this one. This brush just does a great job.  Several reviews mentioned that brand new badger brushes had a foul odor to them that took a while to get rid of.  I braced myself as I opened the package, I was prepared for the worst road kill stench known to mankind but this brush had a very slight odor to it that was not particularly objectionable.  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and washed it out in dish washing detergent and then let it soak in a cup with a solution of dish washing detergent and water for about 90 minutes.  I never noticed much of an odor during any phase of this process but did notice that the water became somewhat discolored.  The brush lost 3 bristles during this process and after using it for a couple of weeks it hasn&#x27;t lost any more.  I have no idea what a $200 silver tip badger brush could do for me but as long this $12.00 beauty continues to perform, I&#x27;ll have no need to find out.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Great price.  I actually ordered a second after I left the first at a hotel room.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Pros: It&#x27;s a badger hair brush for cheap! After you get it broken in this thing works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It smells terrible for the first few days, even after treating it. I thought it would never get better but sure enough, within about three or four days it didn&#x27;t smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you&#x27;re viewing and considering this item, just buy it. You more than likely won&#x27;t regret it, as I didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m generally picky. It&#x27;s super easy to whip up a great lather with this brush and it holds water well. Plus after you get it broken in, it smells like your favorite shave soap/cream.</li>
            <li> My son in law loved this.  He was getting break outs, so I bought him this new brush (always keep your brush clean!) with a stand which keeps it upside down when not in use.  No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush. Its done a great job for me... For the price this is a great starter brush. It is a bit rough, but sometimes that can be advantageous in prepping your beard for a shave, depending on the sensitivity of your skin. I have since upgraded to Art of Shavings basic badger brush and it is noticeably softer. Handle is a similar shape, I have not noticed much of a difference in the lather as both created a rich lather with multiple applications. Both lose occasionally hairs, which is normal of all brushes i would assume... I would recommend this brush to anyone starting out with DE or Straight Edge Razor shaving, or just looking for a backup brush. Simple, Cheap, Prime eligible... go for it!</li>
            <li> The brush is GREAT!!!  It really holds the lather well.  It is soft on the face.  It is definitely worth the price. Would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great brush with very little \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of bristles. Just as good as brushes priced 2x higher. I&#x27;d buy a second brush if I was TwoFace.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush for the price.  It was a good brush to see whether I liked DE shaving.  Lost a number of hairs during the first shave, then an occasional hair on each subsequent shave.  I&#x27;ve recently purchased a Parker brush which is much denser, but this one still produces a nice thick lather and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Escali brush and simple beautiful stand. The SB brush has a shorter handle and does not fit in the stand unless you hang between bristles and handle.. The brushes are equal in price and quality. I prefer the longer because I like the way it looks hanging in the stand and I soap out of a cup so it is slightly easier. I also bought a merkur long handle and a Jagger DE89L. All have nearly same price, do the same job, excellent tools. Cheap enough so get one of each.............</li>
            <li> For the money it was a great brush. For starting out wet shaving I would highly recommend .I have Edwin jagger I use , and its a great brush too. but really, I didn&#x27;t need it . I could have got by just fine with this brush .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush and you see others like it from competitors that are priced multiple times higher than this one. Lathers up nicely and applies evenly. Rinse out with warm water give it a vigorous shake and it quickly fluffs out and dries--and not in that clumpy way a lot of brushes do that aren&#x27;t badger. No shedding either. Great brush, great buy.</li>
            <li> this lovely brush along with the shaving cream make for the most out standing shave I ever gave my self</li>
            <li> This seems like pretty good quality. Then again it&#x27;s the only badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned ;). It had a bit of an unpleasant smell when I first started using it but that seems to be wearing off now that it&#x27;s been loaded with shave soap several times. Whips up a nice lather and spreads it well.</li>
            <li> Works great, good deal for the price. Badger is so much better than synthetic or boars hair brushes. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my second Badger shaving brush- one for each coast, of course!  LOVED my first one (wooden finish) and opted for black this time around.  Out of the box, things seemed normal.  I use Weleda shaving cream (don&#x27;t kid yourself, shaving cream will have a significant impact on your experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already had a great experience with the wooden one, i didn&#x27;t think twice about throwing this one in my travel bag right when it arrived.  Upon first shave, I was struck by an interesting aroma.  My mind was going through its rolodex of scents trying to place it, but I don&#x27;t think I really wanted to admit to myself what I was smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second shave there was no denying it.  The hairs from this brush were definitely harvested from around the badger&#x27;s anus.</li>
            <li> This item smell funky, I would not recommend, nor would I purchase again.  Perhaps the fur is what I&#x27;m smelling but it is not pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I used this brush once but it smells of wet badger while in use.  I&#x27;ve had other badger hair brushes and none of them had the strong animal odor that this one does.  Straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> For such an economically priced shaving brush, this little brush is superb - and well made!  With a little care, it will last nicely!  And it is ecological also - allowing one to dispense with cans of shaving foam and utilization of electrical power!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t complain for how cheap this brush is. A higher end brush will easily be close to $80 range. That being said, I haven&#x27;t notice any funny oder and I have used it for other a month. The brush works great and it comes at a great price.</li>
            <li> This was the first brush I tried when I switched to DE shaving.  It is a great one for the price.  I have little to compare it to, but it works great for me.  It sheds a little bit more than I would like, but again for an inexpensive first brush, I say it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are good, but the adhesive which held the bristles in the handle did not hold well and I had to re-glue it.</li>
            <li> I have another badger brush that I got from Amazon that was about $12 from a different company and both of these low cost brushes perform well. This one is a little smaller and the head is not as packed with bristles. It is soft and lathers well. I would caution before the first use, soak in water and wash with your usual shave soap. The first time I soaked this brush, it was a little dirty and smelled funky, but once used a couple of times, this goes away. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to shed much. I would have no reservations about recommending this brush.</li>
            <li> I would like a shaving brush a bit firmer and stronger bristles in the future purchase of my shaving brushes, but it&#x27;s nice to have a reasonably priced and quality product all in one. thank you. sincerely Dexter</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly (from Simply Beautiful) and arrived as described. It provides a good lather and has a nice volume of bristles extending from the knot. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star product is the amount of bristles that are lost when lathering. I used it for the first time with the green Poraso cream/soap. I was able to establish a nice lather, but lost a considerable amount of bristles in the bowl in the process (maybe 5-10). Still a great value for a beginning wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a badger brush.  This basic brush works very well and is probably the best value that I&#x27;ve seen in badger shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought a shaving bowl and brush for my boyfriend and he absolutly loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good and the brush softened up after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> Hello all fellow Amazonian wet shavers out there! (said like Ralph from Honeymooners),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has by far either the worlds softest bristles or not enough bristles in the knot to offer any stability of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin however I prefer a much firmer brush, especially for the harder creams, (Proraso), and soaps out there.&lt;br /&gt;I have the very inexpensive Tweezerman brush and a very expensive Thatcher silver boars heard brush. For the feel, forgetting about the minimal cost, I am buying another Tweezerman brush now. One for bathroom and one for travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to get what you like, so if you like the softness then a high end very large knot brush may be ideal for you. If you want to try a great bargain and like the stiffer, (not plastic bristle hard, just stiff as compared to this brush), then try the Tweezerman on here for a little over $11 bucks or so.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t actually use it for shaving. When I attended a CWP class (CCW) the instructor used a shaving brush to apply a light coat of CLP/ CL to a pistol/ revolver surface. Just a couple of drops in the middle of the bristles to apply a light protective coating to weapon metal in a easy to control amount. The brush did shed mildly initially, but with any natural product it is to be expected. Would definarely buy again, great brush at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> This works great with sandalwood shaving cream that I ordered here too.  It creates a great lather and makes shaving a lot better.</li>
            <li> I would like our money back from this item!  It fell apart on the 2nd use.  Junk! Just Complete Junk!</li>
            <li> best shave brush, bought 5 of them</li>
            <li> Everything you could expect in a shaving brush.  And going back to brushes from the gels/foams I think has really made a difference in the shave I get!</li>
            <li> Great little brush,  Nice looking handle and the bristles are very well secured to it.</li>
            <li> Works up a good lather and cleans easily. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months without any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent shaving brush, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it!!</li>
            <li> A great shaving brush at a great price - the brush is soft but firm enough to work up an excellent lather.  Sure, the handle is plastic and doesn&#x27;t look like an elegant antique, but if you are looking for high quality at a great price, this is the brush to buy.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for close to a year, and it is still in just as good of condition as the day it arrived.  Highly recommended!  When you can get a badger brush at this price, don&#x27;t settle for a nylon or boar&#x27;s hair brush.  Neither of them will do the job half as well or a fourth as comfortably as this brush.</li>
            <li> Works very good and I have not noticed any hair coming off brush. No negatives and I plan on buying another one.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Liked it so much, I got one for my son.</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot beat this shaving brush.  Sure a bristle falls out every now and then.. but find me a premium brush that doesn&#x27;t do the same..</li>
            <li> after six years use I lost my brush.after a little detective work I found someone who sold this particulate brush.I ordered it and held my breath till I got it.thankfully it is the exact brush that I had lost.it leathers well with any soap and retains its shape .I have no reasons to believe this brush won&#x27;t give me the same long faithful service.</li>
            <li> Bought 5 of these for all the guys in my life. They all are very pleased and some have changed their shaving habits just to use these brushes.</li>
            <li> Wow, its a great brush for this awesome price. A few bristles fell of during the initial usage, which is perfectly normal. other than that its doing its job consistently. I will recommend this over any other for budget conscious buyer or a newbie into wet/traditional shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my husband, and he loves it. He wanted to be able to start wet shaving but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the products himself, so I bought this and a few other necessities he&#x27;d need. He doesn&#x27;t have any other wet-shaving brushes to compare it to, but he says it&#x27;s soft and creates a good lather. Now that he&#x27;s tried it, he loves wet shaving a lot more than regular ol&#x27; disposable blade shaving, so I&#x27;d say this was a great investment and a good buy for anyone looking to get into wet shaving for fairly cheap. Great quality brush for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad its 100% pure, as my badger is really a stickler about purity!  Of course, he doesn&#x27;t really need it, since (as I&#x27;m sure you probably know), badgers don&#x27;t shave.  I mean, that would look really silly, right?</li>
            <li> OK starter brush. After using it for a bit, my advice would be to skip it and go directly to something better. I switched to a $60 model from Parker that was much, much better</li>
            <li> bristles are kinda rough and not many of them either but cheap price. Ok product for the price and value.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and because my only other brush is a &amp;#34;medium grade&amp;#34; one I got with my Art Of Shaving kit at the AOS store.  I assumed that one coming in a kit must be of lower quality and that an &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; model must be better.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thin, floppy and sad excuse for a shaving brush.  Compared to the AOS model I already own anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone for any reason.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush daily for a couple months now and its been really good. A few bristles came out during the first couple weeks, but not enough to effect the quality of my shave. This is also easily overlooked by the fact that other brushes cost several times as much.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Ever-ready brush. It is not as soft as that 30 year old brush but is very full and holds lots of soap as compared to my old brush that has lost so many bristles. I have only used it twice but am very happy with it. I noticed a little prickliness with the new brush on the first use but it is better the second time. It lost a couple of small hairs on the first cleaning when I squeezed out the excess soap but none the second time. Considering the price, I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush in April. First I should say it is a small brush. I wanted that because it fits in my lathering bowl and I can hang it in my brush stand by the handle and not where the handle and bristles meet.    The brush was a little prickly at first and lost two or three bristles, all normal while breaking in a new brush.  Unlike some other reviewers the brush I received didn&#x27;t have a particularly bad odor. This brush became my everyday brush. In July however the whole knot of bristles just fell right out of the brush in one piece. Looks like the glue that attached it to the handle failed. The brush has always been stored bristles down in a stand, so I am not sure why this would happen.    I may try to re-glue it because I do like the brush. Still I have to reduce to 3 stars when I would&#x27;ve given 5. Even for a low price of ten or twelve dollars I expect a brush to last more than 4 months.    Update:  I did glue the knot back into the brush. I put a thin layer of \\&quot;Crazy Glue\\&quot; in the handle and dropped the knot back in (the bristles were still glued together, the whole knot just had fallen out of the brush handle in one piece).  Then I let it dry overnight.  The brush has been working just fine since then, so I got another two months out of it at least.  Who knows, it may last for many more months.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to make the switch from cartridges to DE shaving and don&#x27;t regret it one bit. This is a good quality brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. After about a month and a half this brush is still in great shape. I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  Seems to work nicely.  Just  realize that this brush was from a small animal and has a very pungent smell to it.  I had read where another reviewer had the same reaction as I had.  All in all it is what it is...a good brush and seems to be well made.  If you are interested in a pure badger brush, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed at all.  The odor will hopefully go away over time.  If not I will return to a boar brush in the future, as they seem to work very well also.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  I saw others priced higher but decided to try this one out.  The quality is excellent.  It is used every day.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is a tight brush that doesn&#x27;t shed as much as my cheaper (and I do mean cheap) Van der Hagen brush did and will probably last me a few years.  It also fits nicely in the wooden Colonel Conk brush and razor stand I bought, which doesn&#x27;t take larger brushes.  But as a guy who just shaves with an old TracII razor using hotel soap in a coffee cup, this brush is smaller and stiffer than I prefer and it takes longer to work up the lather to a workable level.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality. Soft bristles, some did come out when lathering but then again so does my hair when I shampoo. Nice product though</li>
            <li> I bought it as a second (travel) brush. It&#x27;s not nearly as good as Parker Safety Razor brush that I normally use. Unfortunately that one was unavailable. This is a less expensive brush and its quality isn&#x27;t that great. It&#x27;s much thinner, lighter and looks a bit cheap. I was considering returning it but given its price it&#x27;s not really worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Works like it should. My only complaint is that bristles came out for the first several uses. Probably to be expected in this price range. Good for the money though.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was inexpensive. I works as good as an expensive brush does a definite recommendation to buy.</li>
            <li> I am new to the DE shaving and really enjoying it.  I even ordered my brother some to get him using the soap and DE shaving!  Brush help create a nice lather and after 3 weeks of use still holding up well</li>
            <li> it is smooth putting shaving cream on the only thing is it looses a couple ofhairs each time l use it</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely wonderful for shaving with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has lost only one single hair since I started using it, and helps make a wonderful lather with the shave stick I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as it&#x27;s stored properly (on a stand, not on it&#x27;s base) I believe it will last a very long time. It&#x27;s very well made, and helps exfoliate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one minor quibble is the smell that it has when it&#x27;s new. It&#x27;s fairly rank when it gets wet, but to me that just means it&#x27;s new and not quite broken in yet, and it&#x27;s not enough for me to take any of it&#x27;s stars away. I know the smell will fade in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very well made product that is well affordable and worth having.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my brother and my fiance just before Christmas and both arrived (one in CT and one in AZ) in record time. The quality is wonderful and both guys are super pleased! Great purchase all around!</li>
            <li> This shaving brush was nicer than I expected the hard plastic has a glossy black finish, easy to clean, I do not miss using my hand to apply shaving cream anymore, Applies smoothly to your skin, a really good deal for this quality item</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift.  Recipient was pleased, now my husband wants one for himself.  Great value for the money compared to other Badger Shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> Works fine and replaces my old one.  A little disappointed in the length of the bristles, but getting better at making a good lather.</li>
            <li> Been using the brush for about a month now, and maybe lost 3 hairs.  Works a great lather, and very comfortable.  Using it along with the Simply Beautiful stand and it&#x27;s a great combo.</li>
            <li> This brush works excellent as a brush.  The only reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 5 is because well I expected it to be descented before I got it.  When it got wet you could smell it and not only could you smell it but the smell overwhelmed my shaving soap smell.  However, after some time of using it the smell did mostly go away so given time it does get better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother and father for a father&#x27;s day gift.  It looks great and is very soft.  I haven&#x27;t heard anything from them regarding the brush other than my brother said it was the best shave ever (I also gave him some good shaving cream as well).</li>
            <li> This brush works great for me so far. I find the hair just right, so I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a shaving brush for a few years now and my old brush is showing its age .  I also generally shave in the shower making it easy to lather up, shave and rinse easily.  I suspect the really expensive brushes either lather better or will last longer but my experience with this is it just works.  Easily create lather, soft/smooth application of soap to face.  I can rinse easily and leave in the shower for next time.  Significantly softer and easily create lather than older brush.  Certainly well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush approximately 6 months ago. I use it on the average of twice a week. It&#x27;s kept bristles down and rinsed with the water being squeezed out after every use.  Everything was fine until last week I went to use it again and maybe 20 bristles ended up on my face. Every time since then I lose many bristles each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t put much stock in the reviews that are within the first couple of months of ownership. Mine was great until it started to fall apart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just ordered a tweezerman. We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> A great brush at a great value. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and I only loss a half dozen hairs the first few uses. No animal smell. Works up a great lather.</li>
            <li> Certainly have no complaints for the money.  Cheaper than and better than many boar brushes in this or any price range.  Not much shedding on mine, either.</li>
            <li> Always soft and strong bristles...worked well for the first three months, until the bristles literally detached from the base! I thought I was taking good care of it too, always drying it and using warm water. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Within three weeks of shaving every other day, the brush separated from the handle.  The cheap glue that was used stuck to the brush, and not the handle.  Pay more for something you&#x27;ll actually still be using in a month</li>
            <li> Initially foul smelling to the point of being unusable.  I lathered it up with mint shaving soap and let it sit over night but that didn&#x27;t help.  So then I soaked it, first in hydrogen peroxide, then listerine, then vinegar.  Then another lather of the mint soap.  That made it tolerable.  I use it with a mango scented lotion and it&#x27;s picked that up.  It&#x27;s pleasant now.  Be prepared for some work is what I&#x27;m saying.  After that you&#x27;ve got an inexpensive mid sized badger brush.  For me it&#x27;s too soft but my last brush was boar so I have little knowledge for comparison.  3 stars because I&#x27;ve not used it much so I can&#x27;t vouch for integrity.  If it holds up I&#x27;ll raise my rating.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the money</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I am happy with it. Trying to save money I did the switch to using brush and soap. So far so good. It has been about three months on this brush, other than a hair falling out every now and then it still looks and works great. I did get a plastic brush stand for the brush. I use it every day with no real complaints. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this brush.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> So far so good, will take some time to season and get rid of &amp;#34; classic wet dog smell&amp;#34; as associated with all badger brushes. So far very little shedding and it is adapting nicely</li>
            <li> Great brush , the soap and brush make the shave much easier</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our son who loves it.  Says the brush is soft, holds the soap well, and feels luxurious.  He&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
            <li> Badger hair comes loose, but I am unsure if it will cease after using it a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item recently for it&#x27;s size (Small travel size) and for the price point it is what it is. I expect similar performance from this item as I get for my more expensive name brand models.</li>
            <li> So was loving this brush (used it for a month) and the knot and the handle separated. Will probably glue it back on, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with the construction quality. That said I do like the feel of the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (Feb 21st) - I reached out to Simply Beautiful and they refunded me my money. I think that goes a long way to show that the guys there are willing to stand behind their product. Upping this from 3 stars to 4 stars based on the great customer service.</li>
            <li> This was a nice brush from 2 to 12 months. After that it lost 10-20 hairs for every use. Consider this a disposable brush.Great for the price. Nothing more.</li>
            <li> well priced, it works.&lt;br /&gt;used it with the italian soap which name i forgot and creates a nice thick lather</li>
            <li> A lot less expensive, but the quality is equal to Art-of-shaving stuff!</li>
            <li> While super affordable, I feel like you also lose quality with the price.  The first week I used this brush, it shedded every day.  Same with the second week, and several weeks later.  I&#x27;m worried within a few months the thing will completely disintegrate.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with using a shaving brush, so I have no frame of reference for judging it. It works, it looks okay, and it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as I understand they sometimes can. To me, that equals four stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a travel brush.  This is the worst brush I have ever bought.  The Escali brush is 100 times better for a cheap brush. It is still shedding bad (at least 50 bristles) after weeks of use.  Soaked in dawn and borax at least 4 times and stills smells bad. Did I just get a bad one???  This is the first bad review I have made on Amazon but I just felt like I needed to.</li>
            <li> After prepping the bristles are very soft and work up a great lather. What more could you want? I don&#x27;t think you will find a better brush than this for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great affordable brush. The bristles are fairly soft, and the brush helps create a good lather. The brush itself is also a good size, especially if you are just starting out with badger brushes. There were a few hairs that were lost in the first 2-3 shaves (1 or 2 hairs per shave at most), but haven&#x27;t seen any loss since then and it&#x27;s been about 2 months. Thoroughly impressed!</li>
            <li> The bristles have not come off, even after a month, and the handle is solid and easy to clean. good buy.</li>
            <li> I recently learned about shaving using a brush, shave soap and safety razor. I got myself this brush some Proraso soap and a Merkur. After my first shave, life changed forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern day &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; is a fallacy! The adult equivalent of finding out Santa, The Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Kwanzabot don&#x27;t actually exist. When I was an impressionable youth, on my 16th birthday I received a Mach 3 razor FROM GILLETTE!! Boy was I excited to have a &amp;#34;real razor&amp;#34; and this led me down a dark decade long rabbit hole under the belief that Gillette&#x27;s multi-bladed face killing monstrosities were the best of the best! Gillette, Schick, Braun, Phillips et al. should all be ashamed of the damage their tools of evil have reaped upon young men&#x27;s faces, wallets, and pride across these lands for many a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting a real shaving kit turns shaving from a chore into an enjoyable activity one looks forward to. I wish I could give this product 11 stars...10 for being awesome and 1 to walk around kicking Gillette&#x27;s stars in the cranston.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush months ago and the company, SimplyBeautiful, keeps emailing every few weeks to review their item. I don&#x27;t know how to get them to stop spamming me so I&#x27;m just going to give them a 1 star review for every spam email I get. This is my first brush so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m happy with it. I might try a boar brush next time, as I think I would like it to be a little harsher. I would not buy anything through SimplyBeautiful again because they will not respect your privacy. I have also gotten emails to review other products of theirs that I never bought. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been spammed by an Amazon vendor.</li>
            <li> I ordered two for gifts.  I like it so much that I;m going to buy one for myself.  You can;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> first time using a brush and shave cream etc.... and i&#x27;m impressed! i like the lather and feel and this brush seems well made.... hope it will last a while! so far so good......no complaints!</li>
            <li> it sheds more hair than my bald head, otherwise it is not a bad brush.</li>
            <li> The brush works very well with soap or cream. It lathers thickly and loses very few bristles--unlike the synthetic brush I used to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent small brush for the price.  Bristles are soft and create an excellent lather.  A VERY occasional strand comes out, but much less than far more expensive brushes I have had.  Do not recommend non-badger brushes as they are very stiff and not nearly as comfortable as badger bristles.  I liked this one so much I bought another, one for home and office.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, I have purchased a number of these from box stores they didn&#x27;t last, this one seems to be way ahead of the others.</li>
            <li> Works great, perfect size and stiffness. Smells like badger, but no worse than any other animal hair brush, and it the smell will fade over time. Sheds a little bit too, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and I notice almost no shedding at all anymore. Produced good lather and hold the right amount of water and product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush for about a month. Compared to the other brushes that I&#x27;ve had over the years (I&#x27;m 68), this is absolutely the best one. No bristle loss, and the bristles are very soft. It holds the soap lather very well for a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Every time I use the brush I notice a couple of bristles come off the brush. You have to be very gentle rinsing off the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush lathers up very nicely and applies smoothly.  No noticeable odor and very little shedding.  I would heartily recommend this as a basic brush for everyday use.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Worked well enough for about 6 months before the brush came out from the handle. I hot glued it in and it became loose again soon after. This was my first brush and it never did stop shedding bristles, so rather than trying again with epoxy I just replaced it with a Parker brush which is much nicer in every way. The price was right, but this brush was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush a lot.  I no longer shave using safety razors but if it wasn&#x27;t for this thing I expect I would have stopped even sooner.  It feels good on your face and does a great job creating lather and holding onto soap/cream to apply it to your face.  It cleans fairly easily as well.</li>
            <li> It worked well a few times, then it took a very short drop and was totally busted. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> After only 3 weeks of usage the brush came apart from the handle. At this rate I should&#x27;ve bough the more expensive The Art of Shaving and save myself the time of keeping a stock of these on hand for replacement every couple of weeks. I use the brush every day and so I understand that could be considered heavy usage but don&#x27;t most people shave everyday?  it should&#x27;ve at least last a few months. I would not recommend this brush</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush, excellent value for money. I own several badger brushes, some of very high quality, and while the SimplyBeautiful brush cannot compete with the most expensive ones, is better than other brushes at double the price. I am using it for traveling and am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, price and quality!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase the Simply Beautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush to use as a shaving brush.  In the days of my youth, I did use a mug and brush, but have long since grown a beard and shave only my neck and don&#x27;t really need a shaving brush as such.  However, shaving brushes have uses beyond their intended purpose and the above mentioned brush excels at cleaning small, close areas such as the vents on your car, between the buttons on your remotes and similar places.  Additionally, the bristles can be used in fly tying and you will still be able to your Pure Badger Brush for cleaning, at least until you&#x27;ve tied a whole lot of flies.  Great product and it looks nice sitting there waiting to be used.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a good price.I would recommend this product to any man looking to elevate his &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; game !!!!</li>
            <li> Broken and I haven&#x27;t even used it...</li>
            <li> Being new to the art of shaving I wanted to find a good quality, un-emblazoned badger brush that wasn&#x27;t going to break the bank. This fit the bill, and even before my DE razor arrived, significantly improved my shaving experience. I get the odd loose hair once in a while, but this is to be expected early on, and hasn&#x27;t diminished the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: Been using the brush for a couple of months now, and it is still going strong. Works up a great lather every-time and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced the smell that other (typically older) reviews have commented on. I was also thinking that I would upgrade to a more expensive brush fairly quickly, but honestly don&#x27;t feel like I need to!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional advice: You are probably looking at this item because you are thinking about starting this type of shaving, so here is my advice (for what its worth). I looked at a few all-in-one type starter packages, but they all seem to be either over priced or you have to compromise on quality, so I recommend you piece your own kit together. All in all, getting a pretty decent set up cost me ~$70-75. For those looking to transition to double edged shaving (without breaking the bank) then I would recommend the following (all purchased from Amazon):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger DE89 - I picked mine up for pocket change over $30, it&#x27;s top quality, beautiful and a brilliant first DE Safety razor (thanks to badger and blade community for the recommendation).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002RBF1PO B002RBF1PO]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream: Sandalwood - Top quality. It&#x27;s expensive, but seems to last forever!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW B0007MW2ZW]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 Blade Sampler - Mine just arrived, and I am looking forward to finding the right blade for me before buying them in bulk (Feather is looking a likely candidate).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007OL72B8 B007OL72B8]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting money on a bowl and stand straight away. If you want to trybowl lathering then just pick up a big mug or bowl from the kitchen cabinet. Stands can look nice, but aren&#x27;t really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I had a boar&#x27;s hair brush when I got this badger brush and the difference is like nigh &amp; day, this one holds so much more lather  it&#x27;s fantastic! I read the other reviews before buying but have not had any negative issues ( odor or hair falling out) just plenty of lather. Great brush. If you use a mug &amp; brush this is what you want.</li>
            <li> The brush detached from the handle during my first use. The glue is apparently weak or not used properly.    The brush itself is also smaller or less full than the Tweezerman brush I have used for a couple of years.    Update: I originally ordered two of these. The first broke on first use so I wrote the review above. Now, 5 months later, the glue on the second brush has come loose. This is a major manufacturer defect.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand - the handle diameter is too large. To get it to hang, you have to jam it, scratching the narrow spot on the handle.</li>
            <li> Mostly, a good brush also exfoliates (less ingrown hairs, and so bumps) your face, so you do not have to buy a face-scrub.    This brush is moderate sized, and not huge. At least, that gives greater control, for normal sized faces. Being badger, it retains enough heat/water, and your lather, for repeated passes. It&#x27;s is not floppy, and so it&#x27;s great for hard soaps, or creams/\\&quot;croaps\\&quot;.    While it is not as soft bristle tipped, as a Silver-tip badger brush, this still gives good exfoliation; without going to far (not excessively prickly). But you be the judge, of how it feels. It&#x27;s a quick brush. It&#x27;s just a bit small.    P.S. Everyone should know animal brush will smell when wet, and you wash it out, and then use a good scent shave soap, and let it sit overnight, to condition it. Also, you will lose some hairs; but it should not be much of the brush. Never boil, or use water you wouldn&#x27;t leave your hand in, or that would loosen the glue, and require re-gluing (2-part epoxy) back into the handle.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to give this brush to my son for Christmas.  He has wanted to get into this type of shaving and had this particular brush on his wish list.  He does a lot of research before adding items to his list so I am sure this brush is high quality and it is very soft and looks great.  Shipping was very fast with no problems at all.  I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush and I did choose a badger brush after reading reviews. Every now and then I&#x27;ve found one fallen out, but it lathers and feels really good on my face and neck. Warms quick and holds soap really well. Don&#x27;t see a reason to buy another ever.</li>
            <li> You can spend anywhere from $50 on up for a brush and this is a good one for the value. I recommend soaking it in hot water for a few minutes before shaving to soften it. It&#x27;s great for the beginning to DE shaving like myself, over time I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll upgrade to a better brush once this one kicks the bucket.</li>
            <li> It is a very good quality brush. My husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone and that it would be even better if used with a stand. Will increase its life span.</li>
            <li> This $12 dollar 100% badger shave brush well its a shave brush, its badger, its just that it requires like everything, conditioning, the first week you use it, it will shed, however if you shake it dry and then stand it on its handle it quickly becomes trained, and the hair stops falling out of the brush. I believe it has something to do with the creme shave products coat the hairs of the brush and its like conditioner on hair. The brush becomes softer and the hair will no longer fall out.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve never had one of these before, but this one works very well. It does smell like some other people mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush is a steal at this price ($12). I have used it every day for several weeks and haven&#x27;t lost a single hair. Great if you lather directly to face. I currently use it for travel. Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Bought this the other day and have only used it a couple of times so far, but it is great!  Holds a good lather, is soft on my face and easy to wash and maintain.  I actually went and bought this, as far as I can tell, exact brush at a local shaving boutique.  It cost $110.00.  Glad I went on Amazon and found this one.  Great product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush cannot be beat. Works very well and get great lather with the Williams soap I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  The quality is great for what I paid.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to do light stipple work with faux painting.  It fell apart after the first time I used it with lighter use that I would use if shaving. Very disappointed.    UPDATE:  I did get a message from the company to send it back and they would replace it.  I had already thrown it away but that is a great gesture from them.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why some shaving brushes are so expensive.  Brand name, maybe?  Whatever the reason, this brush is an exception.  It&#x27;s very well made.  After the first two or three uses, it stopped shedding loose bristles.  It lathers well and cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is an issue with all natural shaving brushes, and this one is no exception.  However, if you soak it in a mild dishwashing soap solution for an hour, lather it up with your shaving soap, let it sit overnight, and then rinse well, it should be OK.  After a week, any residual smell will dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice brush at a great price.  I recommend it most highly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel brush to leave in my toiletry kit.  It serves that purpose well.  Definitely not as nice as a $30 brush, but for the purpose it&#x27;s fine.  It sheds a bit and had an odor at first.  My main complaint is that it&#x27;s a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked this brush but after less than a month of use I noticed a slight wobble in the brush. After I let it dry, the whole brush part easily came out of the plastic handle. I super glued it back in place and it seems to have resolved the problem. But I think, had the brush been better made, this should not have happened.</li>
            <li> Brush has horrible animal odor to it.  Returned the product and purchased Parker Safety Razors brush.  Absolutely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> No frills shaving brush, but it does exactly what you want it to do. Badger hair brushes trump the heck outta boar hair brushes, and I now know why. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> So, It does shed a bit at first, and it smells like road kill for a while.  I believe those things are true for almost every badger brush.  Also, it&#x27;s on the small side (not necessarily a negative).  That aside, for $12 it would be really difficult to find a better brush.  Once the brush blooms out, it really loads up nicely.  It has a nice, soft body of bristles, and it does what you would want a brush to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it Sir Fancy Pants&#x27;s Favorite Pure Silver Badger Blah, Blah?  No.  Did I spend $200?  No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually bought two of these.  I got my dad this brush to go with some Proraso soap.  He loves it.  This brush is a good brush that is replaceable, giftable, and that you won&#x27;t feel guilty for when you think about how much you spent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush to use with your shaving routine, but some of the bristles come out way too easily and now I am unable to hang it upside down in the stand because the rubber coating around the bristles that fits into the handle doesn&#x27;t stick enough and the bristle head constantly falls out of the handle.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a month now and I like it better each day. Not as soft as a silver-tip badger but much more exfoliating. It lifts my beard better as well and does not blossom out as much. I, too, broke the brush in by soaking in dishwasher soap and then lathered it with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood soap and left it in overnight. There was no undo odor before the break in but after and since, it retains a nice fragrant aroma even after the shave and cleaning of the brush. Excellent product, especially for its price!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and hold water well. So far, it seems like it will hold up long term. I&#x27;m quite happy with it and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush along with the Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180 and the Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand. All products, including this brush, are great quality. This was my first shaving brush ever and I went with the badger brush due to recommendations. The only drawback is that this particular brush does not fit into the stand I ordered where I thought it would-near the base of the handle. The base is slightly too wide to slide into the stand&#x27;s arms. Instead, I have to hang the brush in the arms where the brush hairs meet the handle. Not a huge deal and not a deal breaker for me. I&#x27;d order it again and you should too!</li>
            <li> I though this would be softer.  I received it two days ago, so only used it twice so far.  It&#x27;s priced right for my first brush.</li>
            <li> Had this brush for less than a week before the brush separated from the handle. It was dried and cared for but still broke. I would NOT buy again. Too bad I really liked this brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles have stayed intact and the brush is soft on the face</li>
            <li> I have just started shaving with a safety razor and all my research said I need a shaving brush for the full experience.  After shopping around I found this brush to be fairly priced.  I have nothing to compare it to, but this brush performs well and after a few uses the animal smell that is commonly mentioned, when using a product made of animal hair, went away.  There was quit a bit of shedding at first and after a few weeks of use I am still getting a hair or two, again I this is my very first shaving brush so I am not sure if this normal.  Overall the brush is holding up well and feels terrific against my face when lathering up and I happy with my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I used this for the 1st time this morning.  It works great for getting a lather and creating a great based for your shave.  It also saves  a lot of shaving cream vs what you would use with your hands.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to end up buying a new brush very soon.  On the very first use the bristles came unglued from the base.  I am able to keep the bristles wedged into the base and I have been able to use the brush a few times which is the only reason I rated 2 stars instead of 1.  I will look again for another brush but try and find something made with better quality.</li>
            <li> Received this brush and gave it a try the same day received. It did a wonderful job. The brush was very soft and had very few hairs that came out on intial use, since there has been no hair loss. For the price this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Very good at the price, so far.</li>
            <li> Quality issues. Bought the brush in April. Used it minimally (couple times a week). Brush bristles separated from the base. Item is now unusable.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Perfect for travel and even for home use . Great product and highly reccommend it</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush for an even more awesome price!!  These can get expensive!  It&#x27;s a must to have badger hair brush!</li>
            <li> What can I say....I love it!</li>
            <li> Spend the extra couple of bucks for the Tweezerman....I&#x27;ve used brushes all my life, never had one where the ENTIRE brush fell out....I was leery when it arrived as it seemed &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s base.  Used it about 6 times, and it kept &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;...last time I used it, I was whipping around my shaving mug, and the whole brush came out....just tossed it...Hey, it&#x27;s YOUR face...don&#x27;t go cheap on something you use a RAZOR with...</li>
            <li> Been using it for two months now.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good after 1 year. Bristles are staying in pretty good so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush for several weeks now. It started out appropriately stiff for a new brush and softened nicely with use. It soaks up the water well and holds its shape nicely. Doesn&#x27;t shed hairs and has a terrific price point for something so well made. I could say it&#x27;s a great starter brush, but truth be told I&#x27;m a long-standing shaver and use it as a typical go-to brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much for a ten dollar badger brush, but this has surprised a bit. It has enough backbone to lather a soft soap, but is still pretty soft on my face. It whips up lather from cream in no time, and it holds so much water that I have to be careful not to water down my lather. Holds a pretty good amount of lather, usually enough for three passes. Good way to get started on the cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving brushes made from a few different materials.  This one is smaller than my other brushes, but it seems to soak up more water, and hold more soap than the others.  I had to use it a few times before it worked properly, and it did shed a few bristles the first couple of times I used it, but it seems to be holding together quite well now.  The only real drawback to this dense brush is that since it soaks up a lot of lather, it&#x27;s more difficult to clean than other brushes, and it takes longer to dry, especially in high humidity, so if you plan to shave with a brush like this every day, you&#x27;ll need more than one so you can alternate them.  At this price though, you can afford to buy more than one shaving brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works well and is attractively priced. It did have an unusual smell when I first started using it. But the smell seems to be subsiding with use. All in all I think this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush today. I am a new proponent to classical wet shaving so my credibility is limited. I read many of the reviews on this item before I purchased it which claimed a slight scent of &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; upon the first few uses, this did not bother me much as I expected the smell (it is real badger hair) some other reviews also claimed the loss of a few hairs during use, again this did not hinder my decision to purchase this brush because it is inevitable to lose a few hairs from the brush. I also did some reading on the web and decided that a brief break-in period for the brush would be adequate so I got a little pearl sized amount of shampoo and massaged it into the bristles and let it soak for about an hour and to say the least, the water was dirty brown and smelled of that &amp;#34;wet dog scent.&amp;#34; I am yet to build my first lather with this brush so I will update my review after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle seems to be made of a strong material and looks exactly like the photo for the listing. The badger hair is very soft right out of the box and the packaging was rather simple, an unmarked white box containing the brush wrapped in some tissue paper. I decided to purchase this over the Escali brush, due to the majority of the reviews stating much more hair loss from the brush. I chose a five star rating based on the physical appearance, construction, usability, and overall quality of the brush. For the price, I would recommend this brush to anyone who is either just starting to explore wet shaving or on a tight budget who still wants to enjoy the experience of a brush.</li>
            <li> dropped it and the bristles came off, glued it back and it stayed there ever since, overall still a good product</li>
            <li> Reading about the smelly badger hair brushes and how they loose brisles, I was a little concerned with purchasing this brush.  However, I did not have the magnitudes of these problems as reported by some reviewers of similar products.  The brush was washed with hair shampoo before the first use.  I noticed just a hint of a strange smell the first couple of times that I used it and then no offensive smells after consequent uses.  As for the brush losing bristles, so far the brush lost under 20 bristles.  The bristle loss appears to have stopped after the fourth use.  Although there seems to always be a few stray bristles (bad hair day for brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush gets wet very easily, and I find soaking it for lengthy times to be unnecessary so far.  The brush gets plenty wet just by rotating it under running hot water for about 5 seconds.  I use it with Proraso shaving cream tub and it creates a lot lather in a short time without even using a lather bowel.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, nice weight, stable handle. Takes shaving  to the next level. I Like to use with Art of shaving Lavender shave cream!</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft brush that is much higher quality than than your standard brush at your drug store. While this may not be what your barber sells, this brush will hold up for months and dry well, as it has for me.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brushes from expensive to cheap and this one is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two biggest complaints I have seen are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell - It does have a really bad smell when first opened.  However, it does get better with each use and goes away all together within a couple of weeks.  I didn&#x27;t try letting it air out in a separate room before using it but that may help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loose Bristles - All shaving brushes no matter how cheap or expensive will lose some bristles.  This one is no different, but I would not say the bristle loss is excessive.  In fact I have found it to be rather minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it gives a good lather, dries quickly and cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 04/20/14&lt;br /&gt;Downgrading to 4 stars because the brush suddenly started shedding bristles after 5 months.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, gift to my grandson and husband.</li>
            <li> For about a year i used the same cartridge razor and some water to shave every morning, needless to say it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant shave. I finally decided to get into wet shaving and went for it. I got some william&#x27;s mug soap, clubman aftershave, parker double edged razor and this brush, wallah my shave was 30x more enjoyable. The brush hold water well, but is stiff enough to make a good lather.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first brush. It does get the job done, and after 2 weeks the smell is finally starting to fade. Unfortunately this thing is still shedding 5-10 hairs every shave. I got sick of picking badger ass hairs off my face and out of my razor so I bought a Parker brush. I would recommend spending a little more $$$. I didn&#x27;t give this 1 star because the price is reflective of the quality you receive.</li>
            <li> My first brush, so I&#x27;m not an expert by any means, but it does the job, works well, and has held up just fine.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have now been wet shaving for over a year, have tried a few brushes out and a variety of razors, creams and blades... and in so doing I realize how much of a mistake getting this brush was initially (or the comparable escali brush).&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, it is better than nothing - hence two stars, but it sheds a lot, it is made of low quality hair and the results doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to comparably priced boar brushes. A lot of sites will state that badger is better than boar in general, and that might be true, when you are looking at brushes costing 5 times as much as this one.&lt;br /&gt;For this price you can get a solid boar brush from Omega or Semogue that provides a significantly better lather. For slightly more, there are many other options - look at various shaving forums before buying something like this and feel free to ask them what you should be looking at - you will get honest helpful answers. And this is not it.</li>
            <li> Horrible brush. The reason why is the 2nd time I used it, the entire brush fell out of the handle and now it is extremely loose and unusable. BIG WASTE OF MONEY. Spend another 10$ and get a decent pure badger one.</li>
            <li> Lasted only 8 months before all of the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush (and the safety razor I recently bought) has transformed my shaving routine!  While it did shed a good amount at first, it seems to have stopped doing so (for whatever reason) for the time being and is holding together fairly well after months of use.  I&#x27;m sure there are probably better brushes on the market, but this is a great entry level brush to get someone used to the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way of shaving.  I&#x27;m very glad that I picked this up!</li>
            <li> The second time I used this brush, I felt a &amp;#34;wiggle&amp;#34; in it.  The bristles were loose and then came OUT of the plastic base.  I can still use it, but it is not what  I expected.</li>
            <li> Thought the brush was a good deal; but with the bristles coming out with each shaving, before long there won&#x27;t be any left.</li>
            <li> If you like shaving with mug and soap, a really good brush is a must.  This one is good; soft and provides a rich lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for 2 months.  It stills feels sturdy, and no bristles have fallen out.  Badger brushes are the most desirable because they tend to hold a lot of water which is essential for the best close, razor shave.  This brush does an excellent job.  I combine this with Proraso Green Shaving Soap and a Merkur Double Edge Safety razor in the shower for the ultimate shave experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick story! A few months aback, I went to my local barber, who is amazing, and decided to get a close shave.  I have never gotten one and it has always been on my to do list.  I heard great things about getting a good ole fashioned close shave so I was curious and very excited to do so.  The result?  Nothing special!  I get a better shave every day at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this brush if your looking for a great quality product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I had never used a shaving brush before, but my friend gifted me a shaving set and along with the SimplyBeautiful shaving brush, my shaving experience has changed. The texture of the brush is soft and my beard hair is exfoliated out from skin to give a closer and a better quality shave. Highly recommend for anyone who isn&#x27;t using one.</li>
            <li> Lasted two months and then the badger head came out of the holder. Have to re-glue it in, I guess. It&#x27;s not like I left it soaking in water all the time either, just a 15 minute pre-moisturize with hot water on the bristles alone. Also, the badger hairs seem to fall out quite a bit, but I think that might not be unusual?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose there must be better brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I have spent over $60 for shaving brushes. The Basic would be one of the best products I&#x27;ve used even if it&#x27;s priced was tripled. Can&#x27;t go wrong at $12.</li>
            <li> This brush can&#x27;t be beat for the price. I&#x27;ve used it for several months and have had no bristle loss that i can see. It is considerably softer than the old Boar hair one I was using, I may get two more for traveling and a spare.</li>
            <li> Ordered one of these for my son. It arrived with a large crack in the handle. The bristles do not appear to be set into the handle very well. Poor workmanship. I would recommend the Escali badger, or the Tweezerman badger for approximately the same price. Much better quality.</li>
            <li> Good brush in general, excellent for the price.  Soft after breaking it in, good backbone.  Wish I started out with this guy, rather than my Van der Hagen badger.  Would recommend as a starter or travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like almost all new badger brushes, this one smelled a bit and shed.  To take care of this, test lather with your shaving soap of choice, rinse, then repeat, leave it for a day.  If necessary, do it a second time.  If it still sheds after a week of daily use, that is a bad sign.</li>
            <li> My first shaving brush was an Edwin Jagger Best Badger shaving brush. Unfortunately, on my first wet shave, I discovered I was allergic to that specific badger hair. So I went and purchased something of lesser value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies and purchased a boar bristle shaving brush. It did fine the 1st shave but after that, the bristles started to fall off after every shave. I endured this for about 3 months until I got tired of picking off the loose bristles on my shaving soap and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to purchase another shaving brush on Amazon and found this SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was under $12 (after all the boar bristle cost $6.xx after tax at Sally&#x27;s). On my first shave, when I was gathering up a lather with my soap, I noticed it did a way better job than the boar bristle brush. Then I applied it to my face. It felt WAY softer than the boar bristle AND the best badger brush from Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a perfect brush though; a couple of hairs do fall off at every shave but not as much as the boar bristle brush, which groups of them would fall off during every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush if you are just starting off with wet shaving. You can move on to other brushes if you feel the need. Though don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did; starting off with Best Badger then regressing to boar bristle and up. Just remember, we all have different skin sensitivities, and you must try out what works best for you.</li>
            <li> I got the brush. It smelt nice and clean when in the package read reviews of a &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34; but once wet the smell was quiet present none the less the brush is very nice and the handle is glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe they used the amonia to clean the fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit in watery laundry detergent  for about 30 mins. That did a good job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then 30 mins in watery fabric softener. The smell was nearly completly gone afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is a typical occurrence with cheaper brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell will go away by its self after about 5-6 shaves but I just wanted to get read of it since its not hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very soft. Lathers excellently and if I didn&#x27;t know better I would swear they sent my a 50-60$ brush by accident.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every time I shave, and it works great. There&#x27;s not much to say about it--it&#x27;s a low-price but high-quality badger brush that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well. A few of the bristles came out the first few times I used it, but since then, I&#x27;ve had no problems. Builds up a good lather and is easy to hang on to. Fairly small and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my shower.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind bristles as I&#x27;ve seen on other shaving brushes. My husband has been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> very nice brush for the price</li>
            <li> Nice brush which does lather up well. Looks good on black Stand by same company.</li>
            <li> Well constructed.  Comfortable against the skin during usage.</li>
            <li> Solid brush, some bristles are still falling out 20 uses later, but it is still holding up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a shaving brush to help lather shaving soap. This brush seems fine to me. It&#x27;s not itchy. It&#x27;s not prickly. It seems of good quality. Only one issue and this may be normal for a shaving brush. It does shed a few hairs. After a shave I notice a few brush hairs in the tub or sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen100 % Pure Badger Shaving Brush from $50 - $75 bucks! Don&#x27;t waste your money on other shaving brushes. This one is just as good.</li>
            <li> You do get what you pay for. The bristles started falling out after the first few uses. The on day 4, the entire set of bristles fell out from the handle. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> wow - now I know what a badger smells like! This brush is well made but smells terrible. Unusable. Trashed.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush!  The badger hair is good quality and it does not shed more than it should.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> High quality brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this brush at all.  It sheds like crazy. I loose at least 5 hairs or more everytime I use it. Absolute junk.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfectly serviceable, but i admit that it&#x27;s lighter and smaller than i would prefer. Aside from that, it works very well. It does seem to be losing hairs, but i&#x27;m waiting to see if this is just part of this brush&#x27;s breaking-in process, and if it eventually stops shedding a couple every time i shave. I have decided that since it&#x27;s a bit smaller than i prefer, i&#x27;m going to keep it in my travel kit, where space is always a premium.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a decent brush. I get a good lather going with my Proraso. My only complaint is the shedding. At first it was just a few hairs here and there but now I&#x27;m losing 10 or more every shave. Time to look into a different brush.</li>
            <li> Brush separated from handle in first week.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving brush. It was heavier than I expected which gave it a more premium feel. For the cost, this is one of the best brushes that I have come across. Check out some other great shaving products at discount prices here. http://rewardgalaxy.com/?ref&#x3D;698372</li>
            <li> Nice quality, an excellent value for the money.  Nothing is more satisfying then putting hot lather on your face and working it in with a genuine badger haired brush, the closeness of shave you get is amazing and it really is soothing and lowers that &#x27;burn&#x27; you get without using one.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Decent quality.</li>
            <li> Cheap, works well. Develops a good lather. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little softer than my boar brush, but all in all it &#x27;s pretty much the same.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose to lather my face up for a shave.</li>
            <li> Good value. Product is as described.  After one year, the product is still very functional.  The brush rarely sheds and has remained soft.  This brush gives a good lather for the price.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> i would&#x27;ve given this VERY soft brush 5 stars except for one minor glitch: the shaving bristles separated from the handle after only 4 shaves.  Upon close inspection I noted that there were only two TINY spots of glue holding the bristles to the handle.  A liberal dose of Super Glue and one day&#x27;s drying time and the brush is performing flawlessly.  Perhaps the manufacturer could add more glue?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have anything recent to compare it to, but seems very nice. Used daily for the last 2 weeks. Not too soft, but not too stiff. Produces nice smooth, not frothy, lather with Arko or Proraso. Dries pretty quickly and holds nice shape.</li>
            <li> Great brush that I do recommend buying. A few small hairs did fall out in first use but with every brush I&#x27;ve ever had, that was the case and I&#x27;ve used over 20 of them.</li>
            <li> Brush separated from handle after a week</li>
            <li> Used my brush for the first time, today. Works great and feels great. For the price, there&#x27;s nothing to complain about. I&#x27;d recommend breaking it in a little bit to make sure the brush sheds all the lose hairs, but other than that, this is a great brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome for the price! Sheds very little and lathers up so good. Will buy another for my dad and brother as part of holiday gift set!</li>
            <li> it does have a smell when you first use it. after a few uses it goes away. Pretty good quality for the price. If you are a shaving snob, you will find faults with it. But as a regular guy, it works and it its pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush!  I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a while now and it&#x27;s holding up great.  Great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> You do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles became unglued completely and came off the handle after the 5 shave!&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t even last a week.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time and money on this poorly made item.</li>
            <li> The bristles in this brush are rather stiff and tend to fall out a few at a time with each use.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price,  it has held up well.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. So far I had it a few weeks. The brush lost a few hairs on the first few shaves, but that is common; even on more expensive brushes because there is a break in period. It does a nice job in exfoliating (not to hard) and placing the shaving cream on my face. Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Seems like real badger so I&#x27;m going to believe it is. Cheap plastic handle, but the quality of the brush bristles are all I cared about and they are fine and the grip is acceptable. I lost a couple bristles on the first wash and cleaning, but not enough to bother me. For the price, quality, real badger,  and the fact it was shipped from the US, it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic brush.  Its amazing what a difference pure badger makes.  I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent value . Very easy to hold and should last many years . Good quality and soft on the skin , Would definitely recommend to all for&lt;br /&gt;comfy shaving . Will definitely get another one to carry in my travel kit  .</li>
            <li> good quality at a good price</li>
            <li> It feels great, works perfectly.  I have another variety of these that is starting to slowly lose hairs, but the handle in this one is really firmly keeping them in place.</li>
            <li> Not impressed... the glue attaching the bristles to the handled came apart after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> I had not used a shaving brush in a long time so did not want to invest a fortune into a practice which might turn out to be temporary. But I have been pleasantly surprised and got more than I bargained for. I guess my use of this very good brush will be permanent or at least long-term.</li>
            <li> After first shave it all good. Not a single hair has fallen out. I washed mine with dove dish detergent and hot water to get rid of the badger smell. It still stinks a little but once I got some soap on it the smell is fading. Overall I love it!</li>
            <li> Less than 3 week of use and  the handle detached</li>
            <li> Within a few uses the brush hairs constantly fall out, after a few months of use the assembly the holds the brush in the handle fell out.</li>
            <li> Works as intended for applying shaving soap but I always get loose hairs from it during every shave. Kinda funny when I first saw it, thought I had a grown a giant hair!</li>
            <li> Bristles are somewhat stiff.&lt;br /&gt;had bristles fall out every time that I used it for the first couple of months I had it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have spent a little more for a better product.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this brush. Not too soft or wimpy. Just a tad stiffer than a makeup brush. I bought two as Christmas gifts even though some reviews said, &amp;#34;it might stink but that will dissipate.&amp;#34; Maybe it stinks when wet but they don&#x27;t stink when dry. Since these are gifts, I can&#x27;t very well test them so, once they are tested I&#x27;ll update my review. Couldn&#x27;t very well give it a 5 star rating without full test results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the brush.  Works great.  Perfect size.  Been using it for a month so far. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I believe this to be an okay brush, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my Escali shaving stand. I might be able to force it, but I don&#x27;t want to break my shaving stand. Maybe it was unreasonable for me to expect a different brand brush to fit, but a lot of different brands are stated to be &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34;. My mistake I guess. It has also lost a few strands from the brush as well. Not upset, but not thrilled either.</li>
            <li> I only use this brush once, it felt good on my face, the bristle are really soft , and only a couple came out.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for someone else and am happy with the quality. Can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have never used it.</li>
            <li> I love lathering my face with this brush. It&#x27;s almost like a really soft massage, and it lathers the soap so good. Very delightful.</li>
            <li> Just got the brush and have used it a couple times.  Very happy with the results...much better than trying to lather with my hand on my face.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a loss of bristles.  Also, it looks great paired with The Art of Shaving Brush Stand.</li>
            <li> While the bristles may be 100% badger, the bristles in the center of the brush started falling out after a couple of uses and were completely gone from the center after 3 weeks.  I have used the mug &amp; brush method of shaving for over 30 years and have found this to be a common problem of cheaply made brushes.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it lost a dozen or more hairs. No, I didn&#x27;t pull on the hairs, or drop it, or stomp on it, or otherwise abuse it, It just starting falling apart immediately. It also smells terrible, so I&#x27;m just going to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite boar bristle brush has been slowly losing some bristles for a few months, and it&#x27;s now nearly 3 years old, so in the meantime I&#x27;ll just use that one.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed with this brush. When I took it out of the box it had a huge scratch on the top of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I keep losing badger hair every time I mix up my shaving soap. At the end of the day it does the job, but I would recommend spending an extra few bucks and getting a higher quality brush that won&#x27;t be scratched when you open it and one which retains the badger hair better.</li>
            <li> I am really gentle with this brush but no matter what I do, each shave I get a bristle or two that come off of it and into my lather. It lathers well and feels fine on the face but I wish I had gotten one that was a bit better.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews how this product lost a lot of bristles and smelled.  That was far from the truth with the one I received. Sure it lost a few bristles the first few shaves as I would expect from even one costing double or triple this one cost.  If you want a good brush at a good price, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, it did smell funny at first, but a good soak got rid of most of that, and the rest was gone within a couple shaves (it starts smelling like your shaving cream/soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, keeps its shape, dries thoroughly. Cheap, light plastic for the base. It does lose a hair or two per shave typically, which may indicate low quality judging from other reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect the functionality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, nice enough.</li>
            <li> For $10 it&#x27;s a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have really, is that it&#x27;s a little on the stiff side for badger hair, but I can live with it since it&#x27;s so much cheaper than most others on the market.</li>
            <li> Produces a great lather,at a great price</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised.  My first shave brush and it is performing as well as the most positive reviews mention.  Have not experienced any of the negative issues of some of the negative posts.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Great product!</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and the soft bristles make a good lather. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to assess durability but there don&#x27;t seem to be many bristles accumulating in the drain screen. I regret not noticing I had been given a 2-day shipping option that cost nearly as much as the brush itself. My biggest concern about the brush itself is the &amp;#34;pure badger bristles&amp;#34; apparently have some kind of dye in them which turns my lather gray. This hasn&#x27;t caused any actual problems such as a skin rash but am curious why it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Cracked shortly after using</li>
            <li> Applied shave cream okay, but smelled badly when you get it wet to use, and shed bristles alarmingly quickly. Didn&#x27;t use it too long before I replaced it with something I&#x27;m much happier with.</li>
            <li> soft, but has a good bursh</li>
            <li> Wonderful, superb, and practical badger there is currently on Amazon. Im buying a few more to serve as replacements in the event I leave one behind when traving or if the seller decides to stop selling. The thing to take home is that the quality is there... it is real badger, and the hairs dont shed other than one here and there (nothing to get worked up about)</li>
            <li> Not much I can say about this brush, if you have ever used a badger hair brush, then this is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried and certainly more affordable. Many traditionalists out there would probably not approve of the plastic handle, but I am more utilitarian than most. It lathers well, it&#x27;s soft, and it retains heat well so all the main requirements are met. The only problem I have had is that the knot is smaller than I am used to and the handle is small and dainty. That in itself is not necessarily a deal breaker for me but if you have a mug or scuttle that has deep walls, you&#x27;ll probably get your knuckles wet and soapy while working up your lather. I prefer a bigger knot and handle and it was difficult to gauge the scale of this one in the picture before I bought it, so when it comes time to buy a new one I will most likely go bigger, but that might be a while because this one seems to be pretty well made and will last a while. Been using it for a couple weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t shed a single strand of hair yet.</li>
            <li> This brush has great quality bristles with a very solid acrylic handle that looks like it will hold up for a long time. It has a decent size knot that will definitely whisk up a good lather every time. Great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> GOod for the price. doesnt fit in my shaving stand though...</li>
            <li> Cup &amp; brush are the ONLY way to get a decent, warm shave! This brush replaces the brush I inherited after my Dad died in 1997. I used it for years after he used it for years &amp; I expect that this new one will hold up just as well!</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> After using this brush for a of couple weeks, I&#x27;ve bought my last high-dollar badger brush!  This brush is a definite exception to the old adage that \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.  I think I&#x27;ll order another...</li>
            <li> Beginner to DE shaving, this brush meets the needs and helps me progress and learn on nuances, eventually moving up to &#x27;higher end&#x27; brushes.  IF I think i need to. BUT to be honest; it does what its suppose to and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;There is occasional loss of hair, there is a very slight smell initially, which has diminished as time goes by.  I&#x27;m very happy with the initial quality, the shipment and the low price point to start.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s okay for the history buffs, but frankly, the shaving cream available on the market today beats yesteryear&#x27;s, so unless you really want to go back to the 1950&#x27;s, my recommendation is simply to go with today&#x27;s technology advances and simply &amp;#34;spread it on and shave it off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a step-up from my cheap bore brush. I am impressed, this hold water really good, and lathers great as well. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush especially for the price. It has lost some bristles, but nothing to mad about. Seller is great.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a brush, so take my words with a grain of salt. Overall, the product seems to be fairly well made. As others have mentioned, the brush occasionally loses bristles, but the loss of bristles seems to have really slowed down for my brush. Initially, it lost a lot of bristles with each shave, but now it seems to be a rare occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it&#x27;s hard to clean the brush after I shave, but I simply run it under the faucet and squeeze out the excess water and let it air dry in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight to the point: I like the brush and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush that gets the job done. Brush came loose from the handle after a couple of shaves, so I had to glue it back in place.</li>
            <li> Not as good as more expensive badger hair brushes I&#x27;ve had (and sadly lost, which is why I bought the cheaper one).  Doesn&#x27;t lather as nicely as the better ones and hairs come out with each use.  For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s not bad, but you can certainly do better with just a bit more money.</li>
            <li> You get what you  pay for. This isnt as soft as my other, more expensive one, but it certainly does the job. Basic is an accurate description.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This creates a lather much faster and with less effort than my previous boar-hair brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;first couple shaves smell like you&#x27;re using a wet dog to shave, but after that it gets better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every time I use it another bristle or two comes off so there&#x27;s that too</li>
            <li> Very smooth and holds the soap well. Lathers up fast and almost magical in how fast it does this. Quite smooth and easy on the face too! Far better than the rough horsehair kind found at the local drug stores and such. Holds it&#x27;s shape when dried and placed back in the rack. In short, this is simply a great brush and I&#x27;m quite glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I think this is probably the best brush in its price range. I&#x27;ve never owned one of those premium brushes, although I&#x27;ve had them used when getting an old timey barber shave. For home use I&#x27;ve only used cheap boar bristle brushes, which I&#x27;ve always felt were good enough. This brush is a step up and worth the price. It lathers better than non-beaver brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveats: the brush does shed, but no more than the cheaper boar bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for price paid.</li>
            <li> My brother is not the easiest person to buy for and he really loved it,&lt;br /&gt;It is a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good brush.  I bought a Parker brush that I use every day and loved it so much that I bought one of these for my travel kit.  I have seen a few bristles come out over time, but not a lot.  Probably not for everyday use, but great for a travel backup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for about three weeks. Great brush. The handle could be a little longer. i certainly would recommend it</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a month now and so far it&#x27;s been a good brush.  For the first couple weeks it lost some hare.  But I haven&#x27;t seen any loss for a while.  I&#x27;m a beginner at wet shaving and this brush for the price had worked fine.</li>
            <li> What can I say? The bristles are really very stable and don&#x27;t come out easily. They are also just the right length so that you can get great lather without it dissipating when applied. I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> very soft bristles and excellent brush to apply shaving soap</li>
            <li> Good brush , when paired with taylor of old bond street cream makes a very good lather</li>
            <li> The hair tends to fall out when getting shaving cream and putting it on your face.  not sure if it is supposed to do that.</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly, dries nicely, and sheds very little. I am very happy with it. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> A great price for a 100% Pure Badger brush.  However it is a bit on the small side.  Smells at first, but is fine after a week or two of shaving use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his shaving brush. He says it works up a great lather with his Bond Street shaving soap dish.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this item to use as a dust brush for my camera. Bristles are soft enough and its fullness allows for quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> For twelve bucks you can&#x27;t beat it. It lost maybe three or four hairs on the first use and none since. It holds a lot of water, lathers well, and is surprisingly soft on the face. Is it Silver Tip badger fur? No, but it&#x27;s not a hundred bucks or so either. If your just getting into wet shaving and want an inexpensive (I won&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;) brush to see if it&#x27;s for you or are looking for a good travel brush this one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> You need a shaving brush if you are going to be using shaving cream.  This is my first brush but I&#x27;m a little annoyed that the bristles continue to dislodge.  After a month of shaving with the brush I still get 2-8 bristles falling out everytime I shave.  They either get lodged in my shaving cream or get left on my face when I apply the cream.  The weight and design are perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! Whips up a mean lather and breaks in very quickly! Do not overlook because of the price. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Sheds hairs easily. Other than that...... it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> my first shaving brush, it makes shaving nicer and with my safety razor really close. this brush keeps hair well and how can you argue with a $10 brush vs. a 20 one&amp;#62; great brush</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a shaving brush when I saw this one.  It has done its job so far, but it has lost hairs with every usage.  I have done everything I know to be careful (keep it in a proper stand, only wet the tip, don&#x27;t use too much force with it), but I am still losing some.  Every time I shave, I have to clean a few brush hairs out of the sink.  I have used other brushes that have lasted longer, so it is disappointing that it is doing this so soon.</li>
            <li> Shed bristles from first use until the bristles just came un-glued from the handle all together (even though i stored it hanging bristles down). Would work well enough if you just want to try this type of shave and didn&#x27;t want to spend any more $.  Not something you are going to use for more than a couple of months.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little pricey but it lathers up great. It feels smooth on the face and holds the lather.  I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is a great option for a beginner brush or an excellent travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit smaller than the average size of brushes I have used prior, but that could be a pro or con depending on preference or POU for the item. (great travel size!) It is badger, which is a great plus and it is pretty soft (again, preference thing) much softer than any unbroken in badger that I have used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily because I wanted a brush with a synthetic handle, as I like to presoak my brush and have had problems with low-mid priced brushes cracking eventually or the knot coming free from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I think this brush is hard to beat for the price, and even if it isn&#x27;t quite your preference it will be a great travel brush or back-up to toss into your toiletry case!</li>
            <li> A shaving brush is the best way to use a razor blade. It gives you a closer and smoother shave if you use caress soap.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush as a gift to some friends as a starter brush. My room-mate also owns this brush so I was able to test it myself. I found it a bit scratch compared to my finest and silver-tip badger brushes but at such a low price its a decent starter. Plus the handle is easy to be reused with a better knot when you grow out of this one.</li>
            <li> This brush is full, high quality, and the perfect stocking stuffer for your handsome lover. Will buy another one next year!</li>
            <li> So this brush (like almost all other badger brushes) STINKS when you first get it wet.  This goes away after a few uses.  People have used oxyclean to make the smell go away faster, but I just made a few lathers with it and washed it a bunch.  Now it just smells like the shaving soap I use.  It works great for the money and while it is not the softest, most luxurious brush, for the money it is 100% worth it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from the insanely overpriced Gillette Mach 3 razor system to a Double Edge razor. I purchased all the DE supplies here on Amazon (razor, blades, brush, soap, etc). This brush is very soft and overall seems to be of top notch quality. However, after 3 weeks of use, one or two bristle hairs still come out when I&#x27;m mixing up the shaving soap. Thus, they sometimes end up on my face with the lather, which is a hassle. I had hoped that by now this brush would have &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; and it would not be losing bristles, but that is not the case. If this keeps happening I will eventually have to replace the brush. While I really like how soft and otherwise well made this brush is, I&#x27;d probably try a different one to see if it&#x27;s bristles remain intact better than this one.</li>
            <li> This brush is ver soft and works up a great lather. Does tend to loose a few hairs every time.  Only time will tell how this effects it&#x27;s ability to last over the long haul.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a razor. I bought this brush because it: (1) was inexpensive; and (2) had good customer reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, as I wasn&#x27;t sure I would continue shaving with a razor. The brush is an outstanding value. It does what is intended to do. It lathers up the shaving cream beautifully. It is easy to hold. It is a perfect size. It shed only a few bristles in its first month of use. I subsequently bought a brush costing 3 times the cost of the Basic brush--I do not see any improvement in the more expensive brush. In sum, the Basic is: (1) an excellent brush; and (2) at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this, especially for the price. I let it sit in shaving soap overnight before first use. Then rinsed it thoroughly. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with bristles shedding. Almost makes shaving fun. Almost.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and creates a good lather but every shave it leaves behind bristles on my face.  It was relatively inexpensive, so I guess I should have expected it.</li>
            <li> A great little shaving brush for the money. I have been using wet lather for well over thirty years, using an old brush that was given to me. It was time for a replacement, and this little brush really does a nice job. Yes, it had the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell which was rather pungent, but only for about a month. It whips up a nice lather. It is amazing how well it shakes nearly dry after rinsing.  Should have done this sooner. I bought the Super Safety Razors Chrome Shaving Brush Stand to go with it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the price of this brush, but after the first use, it is obvious that it is high quality.  There is a bit of a &amp;#34;wet badger&amp;#34; smell when you first start using it, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and will hopefully go away soon.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush. Works fine &amp; dandy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush. I bought this brush as I started wet shaving with Proaso shave soap and needed a brush. The brush is of good quality, yet feels soft on skin.</li>
            <li> The brush literally stinks. It smells like dirty animal hair and really bad. I tried cleaning the brush and letting it soak but it didn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s not nice having shaving soap that smells good and a brush that smells like you have the actually animal on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Great starter to find out if you will enjoy shaving with soap and a brush.</li>
            <li> Does everything the expensive brushes do at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about 6 months ago and it started off with a bad animal odor. I soaked it in vinegar over night which helped a lot, eventually the odor completely disappeared from use. About a month ago the bristle head fell off, but it remained useable. It loses several hairs every shave but still works as intended. If you care about longevity, then buy a better brush, if you only care if it works, then you shouldn&#x27;t mind some loose hairs and eventually losing the base.</li>
            <li> Yes, the low price made me suspicious, but with all the good reviews posted here, I figured it was okay to take a chance. Well, it wasn&#x27;t okay. This piece of garbage fell apart --- the bristle-pack detached from the bottom &#x27;holder&#x27; --- the first time I used it. I sometimes feel foolish paying a higher price when there are lower-priced alternatives available. But not in this case. A clear example of, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Brush looks great but the hair is full of what looks like wood glue. Tried to use brush anyways  but scratched my face and neck. Very disappointed guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my boyfriend after his cheapie boar brush fell apart. I couldn&#x27;t afford the more expensive 100% badger hair brushes so I was excited to find one so cheap! I decided he could try it out and it wasn&#x27;t much of a loss if this brush turned out to be one of those &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; situations. Thankfully, he loves it! He says the lather is nice and thick, the bristles are soft and are holding up great.</li>
            <li> It still smells after I have conditioned it several times by leaving it overnight lathered in nice shaving cream. It smells gamy. But it was not expensive. I guess you get what you pay for. Hairs keep falling off. It reminds me of how my baldness started :-).</li>
            <li> The brush seems fine; some of the bristles have been coming off with use.  Nothing alarming.  Other than that it does a good job and I am satisfied with it.  I have never owned a shaving brush, so I have limited knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue with it was how bad it stinks when wet.  It needs to be soaked and washed with a bunch of stuff to reduce the smell.  I know it will go away with time, but it was a bit of a surprise how bad it stunk initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as the bristles stay on, it should prove to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Shedded a little the first few times I used it but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I thought that I should have a new brush after years of using another.  This one smells like the badger is still there.  But after using it for a week or so, it has lost the smell and works up a great lather.  It has not lost hairs like prior brushes.  I am very pleased</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush due to my previous brush falling apart after limited use. Ii have only used it a few times but  am pleased with the quality of the bristles as they lather very well and hairs do not fall out. Unfortunately the handle fell off and detached from the bristles. This also occurred with my precious cheaper brush. There needs to be a better way for attaching the two pieces rather than a dab of glue. I now have to spend my time trying to fix this issue. For that I can only give 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush purchase, and after having this, I see no reason to spend more for some ridiculously overpriced brush that would win the approval of the shaving snobs.  Of my three brushes I own, this has already moved to the top as my favorite.  It lathers wonderfully and shedding has not been a problem.  The handle does feel a little small in my hand but it has not been a hindrance.  Overall, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush, especially for the price. It&#x27;s held up well for me now over a month of daily use. The badger bristles are soft enough to be comfortable but tough enough to stand up to regular use and generate a smooth comfortable lather with my Poraso shaving soap. It&#x27;s a great, affordable little luxury.</li>
            <li> The price for these brushes is all over the place. This one is a great value for the price. It works up a great lather and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush so I can&#x27;t compare it to those that cost much more but it works very well and I didn&#x27;t have to spend too much.  Is it the best badger hair? Probably not, but it is a good value and does what I need, builds a good amount of lather for a great shave.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome works grate it does take a little while for it to brake in but after that it&#x27;s the best you can buy for the money you spend on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a brush. I don&#x27;t really see how this type of product could be excellent. The product does what I expect it to, but there&#x27;s nothing that makes it an exceptional purchase.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this brush is great for the discerning wet shaver. The large size and firm bristles create a great lather and condition your beard nicely to prep for a shaze with your safety/straight razor. However, I was pulling down slightly on the brush to squeeze it dry and the bristles seem to have loosened from the handle. I sort of pushed them back in and it still works fine, but they still spin around a bit now. Just be careful not to pull on the bristles at all and this brush will serve you well.</li>
            <li> So i bought this a couple months ago, and I haven&#x27;t really used it that much (I&#x27;m Asian and thus rarely need to shave). The few times that I have used it, it works pretty well. However, despite not seeing much usage, the brush has fallen out of its handle already. Meaning now I&#x27;m just holding a bunch of badgers hairs in my hand and rubbing it on my face like a barbarian. While I could probably fix this with some epoxy, I don&#x27;t own any, and obtaining some would probably not be worth it considering this thing costs barely more than a tube of good epoxy.</li>
            <li> Good product, you will have a few hairs come off of it but that&#x27;s normal, dries quick and lathers very well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush, good quality for the price.  Lathers up great!  Was shipped in a timely manner.  Would highly recommend this product for someone going back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; was of shaving.</li>
            <li> This brush appeared to be high quality and worked great while it lasted. However, 8 months later the base and the hair separated and pieces of hair started coming out. I used the brush as intended, and always hung it on my razor stand to dry.</li>
            <li> few hairs have fallen out, but that was only really the first few uses, now it i don&#x27;t see any fall out. Good brush for the price. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is alright. I haven&#x27;t had the idiot issue that others described (I&#x27;m assuming it depends on what lot the hair for your particular brush came from), but I have had a LOT of hair loss from my brush! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks &amp; every shave results in significant loss of hair from the brush. If this continues I&#x27;ll need a new brush soon.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for those giving wet shaving a try. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, but I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> First shaving brush for me.&lt;br /&gt;Some hairs slip out every-so-often, but doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Soft and easily works up a lather.</li>
            <li> i like the brush for it&#x27;s price but i would get boar hair, the makers of this make this cheap by cut to shape the bristles</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this for me and I just had it for a few shavings but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Rich</li>
            <li> What can I say? This brush does the job and the price is great.  The brush stunk when I first got it, as you&#x27;d expect being a Badger brush.  I soaked the brush in some warm water for about an hour before I first used it.  Very few hairs came loose when I used it.</li>
            <li> Been using brushes for years.  Read the reviews and thought I would replace my eshave brush.  First use, hairs fell out and became knotted up.  Would not hold water or lather.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Spend a little extra and buy something else</li>
            <li> I got this 6 months ago and love it. It was my first shaving brush and the fact that it was badger hair and was so cheap. I am still just amazed. I find it really soft and love using it. It did lose a few hairs in the beginning, but that is expected. After the first month it hasn&#x27;t lost any and is still holding strong and doing its job well. Would totally recommend it. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great brush. There were only a few rogue hairs that were easily trimmed. My boyfriend loved it. That&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, with minimal initial shedding of hairs, at a very good price.  Wash in warm dish-washing soap and water, rinse, soak for 30 minutes to an hour in the same kind of solution, rinse, and then work up a lather of your favorite shaving soap or cream, and let it dry overnight in the brush.  The brush is cleaned, &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34;, and deodorized.  Just gently rinse out most of the dried soap before using.  Great brush!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Feels great on the beard. I use it to apply oils and give my beard a bit of a fuller shape and nicer smell. Works fantastically!</li>
            <li> Good brush and price.  Absorbs water well and makes a great lather.  Love these old fashioned brushes.  Makes ya feel manly!</li>
            <li> After reading through some of the reviews, it appears that there are a variety of experience that can be had with this brush. As for me, I experienced a lot of shedding (even after a couple uses), a bad odor (bit of a stink), and general discomfort and itchiness from the hairs. Still gets the job done, and it is an inexpensive brush, so I can&#x27;t justify giving that harsh of a review. However, I am a little disappointed with the brush. If you choose to place an order, I hope you get one of the good ones.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very nice, but the brush handle is small in my hand and the brush has a low cost appearance. I prefer a brush with a bigger head of bristles so it holds more lather and a better handle with more grip surface.</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have expected a lot out of a cheap pure badger (lowest badger quality) shaving brush. But I ended up just getting a better brush after learning a bit more about safety razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very prickly (or &amp;#34;skritchy&amp;#34;), even after break-in (I used it for about a month). It also doesn&#x27;t really work up a great lather. I use a much more expensive Mühle synthetic fiber brush now that set me back over $60, but you can also get a silvertip badger brush for around $30. I&#x27;d skip this one.</li>
            <li> I had a brush I paid $67 for. This brush is every bit as good and cost a fraction of the one I had.&lt;br /&gt;The other one had a wooden handle which the finish peeled off of. This one is plastic so the water will not harm it.&lt;br /&gt;It is the right size and easier to control. I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad and not hard to lather with the brush. But every shave it sheds hair even though I&#x27;ve had this since Feburary 2014. Recommended for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this brush, I have to pick loose badger hair off my face. I would be surprised if this lasts a year.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush. It&#x27;s both soft and firm. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but it seems reslly good. Some of the bristles come out, but not enough to make it bald or even really be a serious annoyance.</li>
            <li> Neither impressed or unimpressed.  But it is cheap.  It does what it is designed to do. I cannot fault it for doing its job, but it isn&#x27;t better than other budget badger hair brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush separated from the handle after 3 uses. Either this is junk, or I&#x27;m the unluckiest buyer in the history of this product. Worked well for the 3 uses, anyhow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend more than 25 bucks for a badger brush.  This one is great.  It takes about a week to break it in, but it seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> Great price, sheds a little for several shave s 2to 3 hairs, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Bought this based on so many good reviews. It did not disappoint me. I was looking for a smaller brush and this fit my need perfectly. It does smell a little but is tolerable. After several uses, the smell dies out and you barely notice it. Do buy a good scented soap - I suggest one that has menthol as it cools your face as you shave.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price. Had a bit of a smell when i first got it,  but it has subsided now after 4 uses. Nothing falling out yet. I do recommend this brush, especially for people just getting into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a good alternative to the Art of Shaving badger brush, but it&#x27;s not. Weak and non durable. Not worth the short money. Pay for quality and get the more expensive badger brush, It will last longer and give you a better shave.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s great. Hold the lather well &amp; is soft on his face. He said I picked a keeper</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good shaving brush. Easy to clean, dries quickly. It doesn&#x27;t have the animal musky odor I read about on some of these badger brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t want to invest to much money.. The bristles are a little rough, but I have only used my brush twice. I hope that they will soften after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shaving brush. I doesn&#x27;t seem to shed very much and works up a good lather. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this brush and now understand the advantage of badger hair over synthetic. However I have owned this brush for a few months and loose hairs still fall out during every shave.</li>
            <li> The brushe broke after my first use.  The badger hair was poorly glued to the handle and simply came out.  Based on the poor quality of manufacturing I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Not a bad beginner brush. Sheds for the first week of use. After that holds up well and stops shedding. Great product for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $10 so you really can&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s good for starting your set up. It lathers well and that&#x27;s really about it. It&#x27;s soft but also scratchy so the scrathy-ness definitely offsets the softness. Although I said it lathers well, it has a small handle so my fingers are always in the lather, not a big deal but I for one like bigger handles and I know the shaving community does too. One tip I have for all of you to avoid the scrathy-ness is to press it hard on your face so that you are using the middle part of the bristles and not so much the tips of them.</li>
            <li> i really like this brush. It&#x27;s my first shaving brush, and for the money especially, it gives me all i want.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush but is a bit scratchy , since I have sensitive skin on one side of my face it doesn&#x27;t work for me after a couple of uses I got tinny pimples all over my cheek area . It look like sunburn and red , so if u have sensitive this brush is not for me, I may try synthethic shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Hair were a little scratcher than I expected but that could have been a misconception on my part. Main reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 star raiting was that the hairs have been falling out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brush in this same price range that was not even close to the quality of this brush. This brush offers very little shed and it dries well. It works up a good lather and the bristles really get your beard ready for a nice shave. This brush is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is really a good looking shaving brush, but after using them for over 40 years, this one falls apart more than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.  I expected the loose pieces to end within the first month or two, but it looks like it is going to keep falling apart until I buy another brush.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, the softness and feel of the brush is just what I expected. Yes I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift. It&#x27;s no simpson brush, however its workable and gets the job done. If it were for myself, I would be inclined to spend more and buy a simpson brush but for those on a budget then it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product..it is good quality for the price.  Will be purchasing more for my dad, my son, and my brother..</li>
            <li> it is very good so far ( one month use till now)...I recommend it for others..it does the job perfectly...</li>
            <li> The brush works great, but you really need to use it a few times with a fragrant soap before the smell subsides.  The smell doesn&#x27;t go away completely, which is why I won&#x27;t give it five stars.  I am new to shaving brushes, so I can&#x27;t attest to other badger brushes being smell free.  I probably would buy this again, seems like a good value.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely made shaving brush, it is very easy to hold, and produces a great amount of lather</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Works good for the price gets the job done for me</li>
            <li> Having previously owned a $75.00 brush from Art of Shaving, my standards were a little high and expectations admittedly low for this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I was pleasantly surprised, if not shocked, at how nice this brush really is though. The handle is heavier than I imagined and almost feels like glass or ceramic to the touch - definitely NOT the cheap plastic feel I was expecting. (And it is unbranded, which for me is actually an aesthetic bonus.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some initial shedding of hairs during the first couple of shaves; however, that number has quickly subsided to zero. With correct care and educated handling, this brush will last as long as any and its quality is on par with more expensive counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00BFCV5JM SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Razor and Brush Stand, Chrome]] for proper storage/drying. Being from the same company, the fit was naturally perfect and BOTH are equally exceptional items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and quite impressed with SimplyBeautiful in general - great products at great prices!</li>
            <li> I used it about thrice and threw it in the garbage bin. Such waste of money.</li>
            <li> It broke within a couple of days :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this brush had a smell out of the box like other reviewers have stated.&lt;br /&gt;That was until I got it wet and it smelled like roadkill on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it about 30 times now, and aside from it losing 2-4 hairs per shave (still) it seems to work pretty well. It also smells, as my girlfriend has told me several times, like I rubbed a bar of soap on a wet raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is nice and has a good grip.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy. It sheds like crazy which is dangerous when using a safety razor and the bristles get stuck in the blade every other stroke. The 7 dollar having kit at Walmart has a better brush in the kit then this buy alone brush. I expected alot better. After 4 shaves with this i just gave up and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  I&#x27;ve never used one before so my experience is limited but…  It&#x27;s a brush for putting shaving soap on my face.  It works.  Nuff said!  The only negative thing I can think of is if you leave it sitting upright (like it&#x27;s pictured to the left), a little bit of the black paint on the wooden handle will transfer to whatever it&#x27;s sitting on.</li>
            <li> Purchased this amongst many other items for my new found desire to wet shave with a safety razor. After getting all my items together i was very excited on the deal i found for the Badger brush. When it arrived it looked nice, but didn&#x27;t smell the best. Not a surprise as it is a dead animal but it shed worse that a cat in the beginning of summer. After a solid week of shaving i am looking for a new one because i loose at least 20 hairs per usage. Cannot stand the mess it makes!</li>
            <li> After first shaving brush started loss hair and color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best brush I used so far. Yes, initially you have that smell. But, it goes away with few shaves. You loose a few whiskers and once the brush settles down, you get a quality lather spread across your face every time each time. Soft bristles producing smooth buttery strokes! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this brush. Heavy handle, excellent bristle shape cut, good quality badger bristles. Lathers nicely and holds a good bit of water. Best brush for under $15 I have found.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs the first couple times I used it, but since then (about 6 weeks) it&#x27;s been fine. Making a nice lather, and comfortable to hold, this brush is proving to be a better buy than others I&#x27;ve had for twice the price. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This brush feels good, does the job flawlessly.  The handle isn&#x27;t fancy but it is a nice glossy black and works adequately.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush and well worth the money. Received the brush in a timely manner and have enjoyed the way it sets up my beard. BTW no bristle loss</li>
            <li> It looks more costly than it is. Well made and looks good . At this time I can not speak about how long it will last. but for the money I wish I had purchased two.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.&lt;br /&gt;My Nephew turned me on to it and he researches everything.&lt;br /&gt;After trying 2 others, he bought this one, loved it, suggested I get it too.&lt;br /&gt;Note - 1st week I had to break the brush in. It worked well, but there was a little bit of a wet hair smell to it.  I almost sent the brush back.  I am so glad I kept it.  After a few uses, everything settled in.&lt;br /&gt;Great Brush.&lt;br /&gt;Buying one for my son.</li>
            <li> I like it! Pretty good bang for your buck</li>
            <li> The brush is great and well worth my money. I have used it for three weeks, and it has worked well every time. I have had a few hairs, but not more than a few, per shave leave the brush. It holds heat well from my shave bowl hot water pre-soak; my shave cream keeps a fair amount of heat throughout my shave, and I normally do one pass with the grain and follow that up with one against the grain. It has a hint of scent, but nothing significant. I was curious about using a badger brush, and there is a wide range of costs to them all, and they all seem to be way overpriced for what you get. This is a great simple option; there is not special branding on it. You get a simple black (I assume plastic) handle badger hair brush. It is not the largest brush, but it is plenty for my face.</li>
            <li> Why spend a ton of money on something else when you can get this one, and it is just as good!</li>
            <li> The brush is hard to beat for the price. There was some shedding with the first couple of uses, but has since subsided. The brush holds the lather well and is gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and feel in the hand definitely reflects the lower cost. However, this is minor. I am fortunate enough to only have to shave once a week. Therefore, I could not justify buying a more expensive/quality brush. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> All right, I am not going to compare this brush to a model costing a c-note, because that would be ridiculous.  I bought this to use as a travel brush, and I have used it for about a month daily at home as well.  Works pretty good (at any price).  It is a true steal at the advertised price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bristles falling out heavily after 2.5 months of use. The stink did come out after a few uses for us though. The entire set of bristles are coming unglued as well.</li>
            <li> I use this brush holder with the Muehle Tortoise Shaving Brush Holder, also available from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using soap and brush to shave for many years.  I got him this brush for Xmas and it is the only one he has ever commented on.  Says it feels like you are snuggling with a fluffy animal.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth handle just the right size. Yes it does leave some of the hairs on your face the first few uses and there is a smell when you wet it at first, but this is normal and fades with time and usage.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and it hasn&#x27;t been broken in, as I&#x27;m told they are wont to do.&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;m quite glad the brush I started with wasn&#x27;t boar if this is considered soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is still a problem, but then since I expected it it&#x27;s not really as big of an issue to me as it may be for others. Likewise while I had a number of hairs fall out it was absolutely very far from the amount needed to render the brush unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the combination of smell + a slightly stiffer brush than I expected means this is a solid middle-of-the-road purchase for me. As a first brush, I&#x27;d probably recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush and for the price real good,it is fairly soft as from what I understand badger is supposed to be but not too soft it has a little firmness from the thickness of it,the handle is a descent size which makes for it being comfortable to hold not to small or big I have not used it yet so can&#x27;t state as to bristles or hair coming out other than that to me it seems well made</li>
            <li> it has arrived so now i have every thing i need to shave. i was uneasy even though i did shave years ago in the military. it  worked and i believe it will work a lot better as i reacquire the talent and remember it is not the good old days of a soft beard</li>
            <li> Had it for couple months. Couple things to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush hairs do fall off even if you follow all the instructions. But the other more expensive brushes do the same thing. Nothing unusual about that.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not the greatest brush you ever had. Don&#x27;t expect all the bells and whistles of an expensive brush, but&lt;br /&gt;3. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more visits to Art of Shaving. I&#x27;m sticking with this as you get great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Only used it for  a few days before cat knocked it in the toilet, had to remove toilet to get it out so that was the end of that shaving  brush.  It worked ok, but seemed to shed a bit.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, good value.</li>
            <li> As good as a shaving brush can get with just the right size and stiffness.  You would not want a softer brush made from expensive, exotic hair.  It dries perfectly standing on its base without a stand to hold it upside-down.</li>
            <li> My first badger brush. Very soft tips compared to the boar I am used to. Gentle cleaning with shampoo, rinse, dry, soak, load, lather. It is quite nice. I do prefer the stiffer hair at times, though. Highly recommend considering the price!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, thanks. Gift for my Dad.</li>
            <li> I like this brush.  It gives me an even coat of shaving soap over my face, and the bristles feel softer and of better quality than the standard brushes I used to buy at Walmart and beauty supply shops.  There is a little bit of a smell but I don&#x27;t care, the beautiful feeling of these soft quality bristles on my face is well worth it.  Purchased in May 2014, it is now August and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart or lost a crapload of hair like my other brushes, which is a giant plus.&lt;br /&gt;The light smell doesn&#x27;t even warrant removing a star, 5 stars all the way, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to the old school brush and soap and love it. Follow some of the reviews on how to prepare it, but it&#x27;s much better than foam or other premium shave lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson to introduce him to the joys of shaving with real lather.  So far it has performed well. Good price as well.</li>
            <li> Glue holding the brushes in came off after less then 10 uses</li>
            <li> This badger hair shaving brush is very good, although my only complaint is that the hairs keep coming out of the end and they end up on my face when I lather. Fits nicely in my shaving stand though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in April of 2014, and within a few months the glue which held the brush in the handle no longer held the brush in it&#x27;s place. Very disappointed, and this just reaffirms my belief in &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to those who buy this even after reading my review. This item is junk!</li>
            <li> bristles stay in place without any loss.</li>
            <li> TL;DR: Brush fell apart after 5 weeks... find another one and don&#x27;t order this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detail:  I was looking for a Badger brush for my travel shaving kit and wanted Badger Hair (heavy beard + badger hair &#x3D; good lather) and came across this one on Amazon.  With good reviews and a good price, it seemed like a no brainer.  Badger hair works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding:  This brush started shedding immediately, which for a new brush isn&#x27;t entirely unexpected.  But it never stopped shedding.  Every shave I&#x27;d pull 3 or four hairs off my beard or out of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Quality Knot:  Now, be aware that this is a cheap brush.  There should be no illusions that isn&#x27;t on the level of a high-end brush, but it should not fall apart after five weeks.  I have another cheap brush that is working on two years with no signs of faltering any time soon.  This brush detached from the handle after about fives weeks of use, shaving 2-3 times a week.  The knot is glue, set into the handle.  The knot &amp; brush separated from the handle.  I could re-glue it with superglue, but I was on the road when it happened and just chucked it in the trash after finishing my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Spend a bit more to get a better quality brush, as you&#x27;ll be buying another in the near future anyway...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas .  He loves it!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with the feel of this brush for the amount of money spent, I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever but with decent care it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li> Really great brush, especially for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months now and have found that it does a great job.  The bristles are soft and hold lots of soap.  I especially like the classy black handle.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive brush. I had had none of the problems some reviewers have experienced. Also here&#x27;s a tip: a 4.5&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34; (with top on) pharmacy pill bottle fits the brush perfectly. Just punch or drill a few holes in the top or base and you have a perfect travel case. Most pharmacies will give these bottles for free.</li>
            <li> Brush was delivered promptly and was as promised. I would and will definately recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> nice item, good quality, looks great. lose a few bristles here and there but everything is still in tact.</li>
            <li> One of my best brushes for the cost..lathers well and has a nice size to it...none off the hairs have came off..been using it for a couple of weeks...one of my best buys on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this shaving brush, he says it has minimal shedding</li>
            <li> This brush is good in a sense that it lathers very well and that it is a pure badger brush. my only concern is that the bristles prick the skin a little bit. it is not a smooth brush. it is not so bad that the brush use useless, but if youre looking for a realy smooth soft bristle brush this isnt the one for you. i would go a step up and purchase a super badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the money the brush is well worth it. i have sensitive skin and this brush has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Lost lots of hair but not work the time to send back</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent choice for those starting a wet shaving routine. Why spend a ton of money on overpriced brushes? This brush provides great value. Works up a good lather. A quick warning of sorts - it might feel a bit &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; at first due to its &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; badger makeup. It will soften over time, but still provide a slight edge in order to exfoliate your skin and handle shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush one year now. From day one I was finding a couple of hairs in my soap and I thought it was no big deal, it&#x27;s a new brush after all and it&#x27;s hard to glue down all the hairs. But after about 6 months the handle inexplicably fell off and so I had to glue it back on. Again I thought no big deal because it was pretty inexpensive and you get what you pay for. Well over the last two months the hairs are falling out fast as ever and now I have to buy a new brush. I get that brushes won&#x27;t last forever but this thing has been a hassle from the beginning. I would recommend getting a higher quality one even if you have to pay 50% more.  For the hassels the cost savings were not worth it. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> The bristles come out quite often.</li>
            <li> This is my back up brush in my traveling bag. It works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about a year now.  It has worked great since the day I bought it.  It does shed a hair here and there, but nothing that concerns me.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not only does the job but is holding up well.</li>
            <li> I love the brush. Although it is my first experience with a badger brush, it seems to work very well. It seems to be made of great quality materials.</li>
            <li> this brush does a fabulous job. I use about a finger tip amount of Art of Shaving cream, and I can lather up 3 or more times. it does a greay job of lifting the hair. I highly recommend this brush</li>
            <li> As a beginner to wet shaving I can say that this brush is perfect, stiff enough and can hold enough water for a great lather. This is a great price for some one new to wet shaving so go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat that good old Badger hair!</li>
            <li> I bought because a review I read for Kiss My Face Moisture Shave said to use it withba shaving brush. I have been satisfied so far with the ability to lather. Ike some other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had soom hairs come out, maybe twice.</li>
            <li> I just recently switched to a double-edged safety razor for shaving,  and following all the advice online,  I also switched to a brush lather style shaving cream,  which is supposed to provide a slicker, smoother shave than aerosol creams and gels.  I decided on this brush as it was the least expensive natural bristle brush I could find.  In 3 weeks of use,  I have found it produces a great lather (with Taylors Old Bond Street shaving cream),  it feels comfortable while whisking it around my face,  and is easy to care for.  I just rinse it,  shake it out,  let it dry, and it is as soft and pliable as new.  About 6 bristles have come out so far,  but none during this last week,  so I feel safe in recommending the quality of the construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Very good feel and quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a brush my father bought me 20 years ago . . . which finally wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the handle is a bit short the brush does everything it needs to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a great shave while saving hundreds of dollars a year do the following:&lt;br /&gt;After washing your beard area with brush, rinse then use \\&quot;Shave Secret\\&quot; or \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot; shaving products. Both last months, no cans to throw away, and give very good close shaves. Be warned, your wife will steal the \\&quot;Kiss My Face Product\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When done, blow the wiskers and water out of your razor and then dry it on a towel by brushing it in reverse motion a few times, your razor will be sharp for months. No kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, try Dorco razors, they are top notch and cost much less than name brand razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All products found at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great shaving brush. I really like it.</li>
            <li> It works up a great lather.  I have had no problem with shedding, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like roadkill, like some reviewers said.  there is a bit of &amp;#34;wet dog smell,&amp;#34; but you get that with any natural bristle</li>
            <li> The bristles come out every time you shave. Also, they are too soft for me.</li>
            <li> A++ Quick delivery and works up a great lather!!</li>
            <li> It will be a good brush as soon as the wet bager smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for this price range. Very comfortable and holds a lather well. A good starter brush for switching from boar to badger</li>
            <li> Basic but looks good and does the job.</li>
            <li> I do not know where the other reviewers get that this thing smells, not at all in my situation, it works well and after a couple of months it has lost a total of ONE BRISTLE.  Excellent quality for the cost. I highly recommend this natural bristle product.</li>
            <li> My old brush was a little larger, and I loved it until it began to shed badly. My CVS no longer handles Shaving Brushes so I looked online. I like this brush which is a little stiffer than my old one. But I am quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Great item; great price; great service; greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> good quality was easy to break in. I paired this brush with &amp;#34;The Art of Shaving Acrylic Black Brush Stand&amp;#34; it fits perfect.</li>
            <li> The brush piece came off after a few days</li>
            <li> The brush head fell out of the handle after a month. A little epoxy fixed it but it should have lasted longer. I remember the supplier emailed wanting a review right away. Before the brush fell apart.</li>
            <li> Brush separated from the handle after 3 days of use. Had to buy a new one (this time an Escali badger-hair brush, which is far superior). Lesson: sometimes paying for better quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> A decent brush, creates lather well, will definitely purchaae again</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this brush sheds significantly. I&#x27;ve owned this for about 6 months and it has shed so much the entire brush is loose in the handle. The bristles are nice and it lathers the soap well, but I end up with three or four pieces of fiber on your face every time I shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price. Builds a great lather and definitely helps you get a smoother and closer shave. This brush also doesn&#x27;t smell like animal unlike other brushes.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess you get what you pay for. This brush fell apart after about 6 months of use ( 3X week). It started shedding right away but after six months the handle actually separated from the actual brush. Also the hair is very coarse and a little too short I would say.</li>
            <li> Brush didn&#x27;t last long before the entire bundle of bristles became detached from the base.</li>
            <li> Its alright I loose a hair or two once in a while when I am shaving with it.  I just stated shaving with a safety razor so I will probably upgrade later.</li>
            <li> Badger brush loses hair every use so far. I&#x27;m going on my 10th shave. Maybe this will get better the more I shave with it. It does give me a good lather and is fairly soft on the face.</li>
            <li> I have used a shave brush for years. Was traveling on business and left mine in the hotel bathroom. This on is almost identical to the one I lost and works great.</li>
            <li> Purchased July 23, 2014. It was OK... a few bristles would fall out during use (annoying). But six months later ALL of the bristles came out in one chunk (still glued at the base). I used a stand to hang the brush upside down (as you&#x27;re supposed to do) while it dries, so it couldn&#x27;t have been water in the base that caused the bristles to fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only lost a couple bristles so far after using this for about a month. It lathers up my shaving puck well and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using a boar hair brush for a month or two when I first switched from the foam everyone uses. It really is worth the extra money and this one isn&#x27;t priced at snob status prices. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s just started to lose a few hairs here and there now.</li>
