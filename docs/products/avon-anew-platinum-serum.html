            <li>Another good thing about Avon is price.</li>
            <li>Since this was the best skin treatment I, and many others, have ever used of theirs (see the Amazon reviews), I wonder why it wasn&#x27;t marketed more aggressively?  </li>
            <li>This is a really great product, but the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>and I wake up to  nice skin.  </li>
            <li>And I loved not having to pay full retail!  </li>
            <li>Texture was good and absorved quickly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for the neck!  </li>
            <li>I love Avon Products.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for allowing sellers to offer products at a better price.</li>
            <li>It does not burn my skin like most products do</li>
            <li>I love Avon, but don&#x27;t like having an Avon lady, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my feet where I get a lot of sun.</li>
            <li>I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>There is more to skin care than external--must also include lifestyle etc).  </li>
            <li>love this cream.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, it really smoothes out the lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also love their bug spray, Skin-so-Soft.</li>
            <li>she look more like 45 yrs</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased from Avon and liked it so thought I would see if I could get it cheaper from Amazon</li>
            <li>I have really great skin; I am 67 now and the old serum was WAY better than this.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly...absorbs easily</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin, except near the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Anew Platinum Serum, as I had been happy with the products in the Ultimate series.  </li>
            <li>I love avon products and this is the first time I did not like what I bought.</li>
            <li>You could pay more, but probably not find a better facial line.      </li>
            <li>Product came quickly and as presented.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel I can give it an adequate approval.</li>
            <li>received really quickly.</li>
            <li>I really love how smooth and soft this serum makes my skin without any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li>I love the Avon serums for older skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have found that by using this high quality serum I have been able to switch to a value priced face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Avon for several years and I am very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>Can say that so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>this case, the price for the product more than recommends it because the fluid works.  </li>
            <li>On top of that (on my nose only), I apply a blemish serum that contains sulfur, and the combination is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really hope they keep making it!</li>
            <li>I love Avon&#x27;s Anew line, especially this serum.  </li>
            <li>Seems they could have saved a bunch of money and given us the same amount of serum for a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that this did not seem to feel as good on my skin, that it felt a little sticky rather than absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>The Avon serums are very lightweight and effortless to apply.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a few years and just love it.  </li>
            <li>I also wonder what product is replacing it that is supposedly new and improved?  </li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you get too much, you can&#x27;t put it back in.  </li>
            <li>It is not enough to make me stop using this bottle, but I will most likely go back to the ultimate Serum.   </li>
            <li>The old serum tightened your skin immediately.</li>
            <li>I cannot use the Avon Ultimate line because its very acidic and literally gives me skin ulcers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years, and really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like old milk smell...  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind layering if the product is not heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>I am too young for it.  </li>
            <li>her skin look so radiant and soft</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this daily to see if it makes any changes, but after the first use, the next day after washing my face in the morning, I did notice how really soft my face felt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands, most were much more expensive; none worked nearly as well for me.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed when Avon quit making Clearly C Serum, which worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the old Serums.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the old Serums.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and this keeps my skin moisturized all night long, even during the winter.</li>
            <li> I am a life long Avon customer, my Mom was an Avon lady when I was a sub teen and teenager</li>
            <li> apparently the reason it is two to three times the price on Amazon that it was a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I knew it would give me a good result, but I couldn&#x27;t  use it because of mega bad smell!  </li>
            <li> Love this product too bad they are discontinuing it</li>
            <li> It is unlike the other Avon producte that I use until I cant scrape anymore out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I do like the other Platinum products.  </li>
            <li> I will no doubt continue to use this serum and the other Avon products.</li>
            <li> in combination with the Avon Anew Genics Treatment Cream I am feeling much less self-conscious about my aging skin.</li>
            <li> Supposedly, Avon is simply adding &amp;#34;new, fresh&amp;#34; products to their line and discontinuing ones that sell poorly, based on the response I received from their Information center.  </li>
            <li> I know Avon does not approve, but those of us trying to save a little money, appreciate the help.   </li>
            <li> bonus on the Avon serums is that I could wear them under my makeup for day, and didn&#x27;t get a heavy, greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick like the other face creams.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you are sensitive to bad smells.  </li>
            <li> However, this packaging is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, since it was a terrific serum.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy when I have to send something back-inconvenient!</li>
            <li> The pump takes alot of pressing to get started and it&#x27;s difficult to control the amount that comes out of the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Their methods of producing and marketing products have become very poor.  </li>
            <li> Too bad Avon is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> Dangerous products!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in Avon.  </li>
            <li> I must say this is the worst smelling product I have ever gotten from Avon.  </li>
            <li> Worst smell cosmetic ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My loves this stuff so I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Too bad Avon is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Reversalist and Platinum serums from Avon, and compared to the Genifique and Estee Lauder, I&#x27;d rather use the Avon and save big bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bonus on the Avon serums is that I could wear them under my makeup for day, and didn&#x27;t get a heavy, greasy feeling. The Avon serums are very lightweight and effortless to apply.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for the neck!  I have finally started using these products and I am amazed at the improvement in my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced &amp; get the results I want.</li>
            <li> Lightweight serum gives your face a drink that lasts all day.  I also use the lip and eye cream and the night cream.  Very high quality.  You could pay more, but probably not find a better facial line.      I&#x27;d rather it came in a tub/jar than the upright bottle with pump.  The pump takes alot of pressing to get started and it&#x27;s difficult to control the amount that comes out of the nozzle.  If you get too much, you can&#x27;t put it back in.  And it only takes a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> I love Avon Products. When I saw this advertised on Amazon at a lower price than the Avon Website, I decided to buy.  It is unlike the other Avon producte that I use until I cant scrape anymore out of the bottle.  After a couple of uses I retired this one.  The product is sticky on my face.  I don&#x27;t like the way it feels so I don&#x27;t know if it works or not.  I&#x27;m going back to the old Serums.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Anew Platinum Serum, as I had been happy with the products in the Ultimate series.  I was surprised that this did not seem to feel as good on my skin, that it felt a little sticky rather than absorb into the skin. It is not enough to make me stop using this bottle, but I will most likely go back to the ultimate Serum.   I do like the other Platinum products.  Thank you Amazon for allowing sellers to offer products at a better price. I know Avon does not approve, but those of us trying to save a little money, appreciate the help.   Everything I have purchased along this line is factory wrapped an sealed; looks just the same as what I buy from my Avon representative.  Same texture, smell, look.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60s and constantly looking for products that actually work as they are advertised.  I am a skeptic of advertising claims having been ripped off before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, the price for the product more than recommends it because the fluid works.  I notice a firming around my jawline and my hands.  You know how the hands get wrinkled and spotty?  This firms them up and diffuses the spottiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can use it on my nose without it breaking out or getting oilier, it&#x27;s also making the pores smaller. Not just &#x27;appearing&#x27; smaller, they are actually reducing in size!  On top of that (on my nose only), I apply a blemish serum that contains sulfur, and the combination is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in combination with the Avon Anew Genics Treatment Cream I am feeling much less self-conscious about my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and just love it.  It feels so silky on your skin. I was only using it in morning but now use it both am and pm.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all you get in this container. I was disappointed when Avon quit making Clearly C Serum, which worked great. I am a life long Avon customer, my Mom was an Avon lady when I was a sub teen and teenager and it was all we used. I have really great skin; I am 67 now and the old serum was WAY better than this. I do not see any improvement in my skin after several weeks. The old serum tightened your skin immediately. This does not seem to be making any difference.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and as presented.  It feels good on the skin, except near the eyes.  Prefer the gentleness of Olay&#x27;s serum around the eyes.  Hope to look as good as the model.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Originally I purchased from Avon and liked it so thought I would see if I could get it cheaper from Amazon and of course I did.  I can not tell the difference from the packaging or the way the feels and smells.  Great Find!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service and product both!</li>
            <li> It does not burn my skin like most products do and I have very sensitive skin. I live in a very dry climate and this keeps my skin moisturized all night long, even during the winter. I cannot use the Avon Ultimate line because its very acidic and literally gives me skin ulcers.</li>
            <li> I must say this is the worst smelling product I have ever gotten from Avon.  I will go back to the ultimate 7s serum.  Do not buy this product if you are sensitive to bad smells.  I will never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for years. I love Avon, but don&#x27;t like having an Avon lady, if that makes any sense. The price was good;.</li>
            <li> Avon Anew Platinum Night Cream, Avon Anew Platinum Serum and Avon Anew Platinum Day Cream leaves skin burns! Dangerous products!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, but the scent is too strong for me.  I use it on top of my feet where I get a lot of sun.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.  And I loved not having to pay full retail!  I can tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years, and really like it. It isn&#x27;t thick like the other face creams.</li>
            <li> Like this product. Saw improvement where applied on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Applied night cream on remainder of face (where serum was not needed.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this product at makeupalley.com and decided to give it a go. Glad I did.  It goes on smoothly...absorbs easily and I wake up to  nice skin.  (I do not believe it miracle products, so I won&#x27;t say that my skin is now flawless etc.  There is more to skin care than external--must also include lifestyle etc).  I will no doubt continue to use this serum and the other Avon products. Good value for money.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get the serum out of the container...pumping for a minute and you might get a tiny bit! I love avon products and this is the first time I did not like what I bought. Thought about trying to exchange it- so I would actually get to try the serum but haven&#x27;t as of yet. I am not very happy when I have to send something back-inconvenient! I will not anything in this type of container again.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for 3 weeks so I don&#x27;t feel I can give it an adequate approval. Can say that so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product too bad they are discontinuing it I&#x27;ve used it for years!!!</li>
            <li> Will continue to order...i should say, i hope they keep selling it.</li>
            <li> love this cream.  received really quickly.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and use this product even though it is marketed to 60 plus.  Do not let that stop you from purchasing this product.  The price is great and I have found that by using this high quality serum I have been able to switch to a value priced face moisturizer.  Will definitely buy again and will not switch to another brand!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this daily to see if it makes any changes, but after the first use, the next day after washing my face in the morning, I did notice how really soft my face felt.</li>
            <li> Worst smell cosmetic ever. Texture was good and absorved quickly. I knew it would give me a good result, but I couldn&#x27;t  use it because of mega bad smell!  It&#x27;s like old milk smell...  Sad.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really smoothes out the lines under my eyes. I really hope they keep making it!</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine going without this stuff.  I makes my skin feel so good and keeps wrinkles away.  I use it on my face, neck and shoulders.  Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Well packaged. I really love how smooth and soft this serum makes my skin without any irritation or redness. I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I love the Avon serums for older skin.  However, this packaging is ridiculous.  There is only one ounce of product is this oversized bottle.  Seems they could have saved a bunch of money and given us the same amount of serum for a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles on my skin!  I will not be without it again!  I&#x27;ve tried several other brands, most were much more expensive; none worked nearly as well for me.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this on my face. I don&#x27;t mind layering if the product is not heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I am too young for it.  This product is for people in their 60s.  My skin didn&#x27;t let it soak in, so I must not have needed the extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I just found out that this product has been discontinued, apparently the reason it is two to three times the price on Amazon that it was a few months ago.  I am really disappointed in Avon.  Their methods of producing and marketing products have become very poor.  Supposedly, Avon is simply adding &amp;#34;new, fresh&amp;#34; products to their line and discontinuing ones that sell poorly, based on the response I received from their Information center.  Since this was the best skin treatment I, and many others, have ever used of theirs (see the Amazon reviews), I wonder why it wasn&#x27;t marketed more aggressively?  I also wonder what product is replacing it that is supposedly new and improved?  Too bad, since it was a terrific serum.</li>
            <li> Shipment was on time.  Product arrived in perfect shape.  I love Avon&#x27;s Anew line, especially this serum.  I have been using Avon for several years and I am very satisfied with the results.  Another good thing about Avon is price. I also love their bug spray, Skin-so-Soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is 67 yrs her skin look so radiant and soft she look more like 45 yrs</li>
