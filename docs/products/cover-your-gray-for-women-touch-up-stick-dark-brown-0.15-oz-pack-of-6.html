            <li>(my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very nice after I apply it)</li>
            <li>Good choice for temporary use between hair coloring.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a good way to cover it a bit in between colorings without having to color it at home.  </li>

            <li>Sure didn&#x27;t need 6 because I didn&#x27;t even fully use 1 before I decided I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>For those in-between cover-ups you will not find anything better.</li>

            <li>THese color sticks really come in handy between coloring your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve happily used this item for several years but could no longer find it retail.  </li>

            <li>This product is handy and easy to use for touch up grey hair.  </li>
            <li>Works good for grey coverage.</li>
            <li>During the last week before you go to the hairdresser to get your roots done, use these amazing Cover Your Gray Sticks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect thing for those of us who need to regularly cover grey, but often find ourselves letting too much time go between colorings.  </li>
            <li>I have never went back to any spray dyes or any kind of dyes since the first day I bought it.</li>
            <li>I apply the color stick on sparingly on my roots (and rub it in to make it look more natural and to not use so much .</li>
            <li>I like it very much, does the trick.</li>
            <li>and it colored the hairs pretty well and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>THIS IS SECOND TIME I BUY THIS, I LOVE THIS STUFF,</li>
            <li>Covered my gray hair very well!</li>
            <li>The packaging is great, small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>probably won&#x27;t have to get more for a long time.  </li>
            <li>and it was very REDDISH brown.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much on.  </li>
            <li>Just dot the area and gently rub with a tissue to blend in.  </li>
            <li>maybe I have too much gray.</li>
            <li>Item was as advertised and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>when the gray grows out it really shows up.  </li>
            <li>It really works well between hair color for my gray.</li>
            <li>Just be careful around gentle fabrics like: silk, polyester, nylon, etc because it will take a STRONG spot remover to remove it  </li>
            <li>Ever since using this touchup stick, I can now almost double the interval between full hair dyeings.  </li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair but the dark brown works perfectly on my &amp;#34;whites.&amp;#34; When I ran out of this product I was using dark brown eye shadow to cover up, which also worked well, but it only lasted a day.</li>
            <li>It is shaped like a lipstick and has the consistency of a very dry lipstick, which means it&#x27;s easy and discreet to carry and a cinch to apply.  </li>
            <li>I need mainly for front area where I am thinning.....</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just too much blonde showing to have enough patience to put this everywhere, and it gets gunky if you put it in too many places.  </li>
            <li>This is useful, very convenient, long ago bought, is running out, has been looking for it, today finally found and bought, I hope as good as with the previous ones.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a timesaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>wow!!  </li>
            <li>Better than chemicals that are too harsh.</li>
            <li>The product was fresh and not hard as some of the sticks I purchased from a local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>No bigger than a tube of lipstick, it tucks right in to your purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li>It is not messy like the wand-type covers ups, it doesn&#x27;t freeze your scalp like the spray, and it doesn&#x27;t take more than a few seconds to apply.</li>
            <li>Pretty sticky and gross.  </li>
            <li>This one is a little \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;, but I think it is still easy to put on, and I did not have to get \\&quot;creative\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27; b using it long time as it is go to cover grey easily.</li>
            <li>So, if something has direct contact with that part of your head, you&#x27;re going to leave a mark.  </li>
            <li>And if you just put the tube/stick thing to your roots you end up drawing on your scalp and it doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>so everything looks natural.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look natural</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use too much because this brown is actually a little dark, but if I control how much, it blends just fine.</li>
            <li>i love it and recommend it to everyone  who has a little grey to cover</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product a few years ago at Longs Drugstore.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Its a little waxy but for a quick fix it works.</li>
            <li>It washes out totally and doesn&#x27;t get in the way when you actually use real hair coloring.</li>
            <li>While it definitely covered my grays, it left my hair really sticky and greasy - it feels like I have wax in my hair.</li>
            <li>yes it is waxy, but again, you don&#x27;t need to press or glob it on....just barely swipe.  </li>
            <li>However, the first stick I opened is a little on the dry side--it covers my gray but is not as moist as I remember; therefore, it does not go on as smoothly and easily as in past applications.</li>
            <li>your Gray\\&quot; crayon is very dark and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Before using this product, I had a choice of either doing frequent hair dyeings or having embarrassing grey roots showing at the whorl and at my part line.  </li>
            <li>It may take a little getting used to, but I found that barely swiping it on to fill in the growth of gray.....even holding a swatch of hair straight up.....</li>

            <li> your Gray\\&quot; crayon is very dark and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Before using this product, I had a choice of either doing frequent hair dyeings or having embarrassing grey roots showing at the whorl and at my part line.  </li>
            <li> It may take a little getting used to, but I found that barely swiping it on to fill in the growth of gray.....even holding a swatch of hair straight up.....</li>
            <li> I took an old eyebrow BRUSH, or one could use a kids toothbrush, or an old mascara wand - just something with short stiff bristles... and I rub some off on the brush and actually brush the stuff on my roots.</li>
            <li> I actually never bought it to cover up grey but to try to cover up my edges where I have hair loss because I was tried of using spray dyes.</li>
            <li> it will last me a long time!  </li>
            <li> This product works very well, but I find hard to blend in since it also gets on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> You just basically twist the stick to raise the product, apply it to peeping grey roots, and go.  </li>
            <li> It does its work though especially if you do it when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> The whole point of using this product is not really to save money, but to save time, because hair dyeing is a major time sink and a major hassle(at least to me, maybe I am lazy).  </li>
            <li> I thought a little expensive for what you get but better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> It was packed in a neat little white box that contained the 6 sticks as represented.</li>
            <li> No need to wet them like other sticks.</li>
            <li> once you&#x27;ve applied it to your roots, it is like lipstick in the sense that it can be transferred onto other surfaces.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the other brand at all.</li>
            <li> - otherwise I&#x27;d have to do so every other week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product because it covers my gray hear instantly especially between periods when I am not able to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> Actual: hairs can wrap around product,get stuck, &amp; leave small chunks in hair, causes hair to look matted.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My wife was using a color stick purchased from Amerimark, but they cost $5 plus shipping. These were a bit cheaper and she figured she would try these. They work OK, but they do not rinse out well. They are on the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; side and she says they are usable but she would not have me re-order them again. Hope this helps in your wanting to try these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the woman&#x27;s picture on the box fool you.  I have been using this product for several years now to camouflage my graying moustache and sideburns.  It is the best thing that I have found.  Convenient easy to use applicator.  Fast delivery and good pricing makes this one a 5 star find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.  It is shaped like a lipstick and has the consistency of a very dry lipstick, which means it&#x27;s easy and discreet to carry and a cinch to apply.  You just basically twist the stick to raise the product, apply it to peeping grey roots, and go.  It&#x27;s the perfect thing for those of us who need to regularly cover grey, but often find ourselves letting too much time go between colorings.  A word of warning, though:  once you&#x27;ve applied it to your roots, it is like lipstick in the sense that it can be transferred onto other surfaces.  So, if something has direct contact with that part of your head, you&#x27;re going to leave a mark.  This includes pillowcases, baseball caps, and the clothing of toddlers who jump on your head while you&#x27;re on the ground picking up spilled trail mix.  Fortunately, it has always washed off easily.  :)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product a few years ago at Longs Drugstore.  It disappeared even before the merger with CVS.  I bought the ROUX dark brown hair color crayon and it was very REDDISH brown. The \\&quot;Color your Gray\\&quot; crayon is very dark and is exactly what I wanted.  Don&#x27;t put too much on.  Just dot the area and gently rub with a tissue to blend in.  I use it on my scalp that shows through the hair. It washes out totally and doesn&#x27;t get in the way when you actually use real hair coloring.</li>
            <li> THese color sticks really come in handy between coloring your hair.  You have to careful not to heavy handed with this merchandise as it can get sticky.  I have been using this item for years.</li>
            <li> These sticks are a great find. They are waxy but don&#x27;t look obvious. No need to wet them like other sticks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve happily used this item for several years but could no longer find it retail.  I bought the 6-pack because it was a lot cheaper than just buying one--probably won&#x27;t have to get more for a long time.  However, the first stick I opened is a little on the dry side--it covers my gray but is not as moist as I remember; therefore, it does not go on as smoothly and easily as in past applications.</li>
            <li> Works okay but I&#x27;ve had better crayons.</li>
            <li> This product is great for hiding grays if youu want it done quickly. Its a little waxy but for a quick fix it works.</li>
            <li> Received the product I imagined. It was packed in a neat little white box that contained the 6 sticks as represented. The product was fresh and not hard as some of the sticks I purchased from a local beauty supply. The price was an added bonus. Will definitely reorder when supply used up.l</li>
            <li> Good Quality &amp; Reasonable Cost</li>
            <li> Gave them away.  I didn&#x27;t like how they worked.  Hard to put on without it looking thick and fake</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quite get the hang of application.....Will try again when have more patience....maybe I have too much gray.</li>
            <li> This product is handy and easy to use for touch up grey hair.  Good choice for temporary use between hair coloring.</li>
            <li> During the last week before you go to the hairdresser to get your roots done, use these amazing Cover Your Gray Sticks. They cover your roots without all the fuss of dye. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and most of the reviews says it works great. I agree. Here is what isn&#x27;t great. How to apply it. The consistency of the stick is, well, kinda sticky. And if you just put the tube/stick thing to your roots you end up drawing on your scalp and it doesn&#x27;t look natural. Unless you&#x27;re going for that dense fill in look.. I needed this only to get through the week where the gray roots around my face were coming back and I didn&#x27;t have time to color them. I wear my hear off my face in a pony tail, so the gray is even more visible for me. Okay, here is what I do and how I solved this problem. I took an old eyebrow BRUSH, or one could use a kids toothbrush, or an old mascara wand - just something with short stiff bristles... and I rub some off on the brush and actually brush the stuff on my roots. It blends very well with my own hair and I don&#x27;t use too much because this brown is actually a little dark, but if I control how much, it blends just fine. This way you&#x27;re not trying to apply and hit your scalp or forehead and have to rub it out or be worried you can see the \\&quot;misses\\&quot;. So, 3 stars not because it doesn&#x27;t work but because it took some creative thinking to apply. I actually think it should come with some type of applicator.. that would improve this product.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a product that was convenient to carry around...this product did it for me. The packaging is great, small enough to fit in my purse. ...i love it and recommend it to everyone  who has a little grey to cover</li>
            <li> Product works perfectly and is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, helpfull</li>
            <li> This product works very well, but I find hard to blend in since it also gets on my scalp.  I tried Style Edit Conceal Spray and it works much better and is easier to apply.  I use this product as a touch up between Style Edit spray applications.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I was using a spray before that never really worked that great for me and was discontinued.  I was shocked to find this product and when I received it and tried it...wow!!  You don&#x27;t need to press or glob it on....It may take a little getting used to, but I found that barely swiping it on to fill in the growth of gray.....even holding a swatch of hair straight up.....don&#x27;t need to even touch the scalp....yes it is waxy, but again, you don&#x27;t need to press or glob it on....just barely swipe.  Then comb or brush through and keep adding as needed.  I need mainly for front area where I am thinning.....when the gray grows out it really shows up.  I have shoulder length med/ dark brown hair.  I ordered the dark brown.  It looks very dark in the tube, but is perfect color for me.  It doesn&#x27;t go on as dark as it looks in the tube.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 6 pack...it will last me a long time!  Great price too!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fab product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product that really covers the gray as a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used daily with no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I actually never bought it to cover up grey but to try to cover up my edges where I have hair loss because I was tried of using spray dyes. This product can get onto things however it is great. I have never went back to any spray dyes or any kind of dyes since the first day I bought it. My boyfriends hair is thinning out so I bought him the one for men. He&#x27;s tried and loves it also. Just be careful around gentle fabrics like: silk, polyester, nylon, etc because it will take a STRONG spot remover to remove it  (clorox does not work) not washing alone.</li>
            <li> Any one with gray hair should have one of this in there purse. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Product is OK. Easy to use and does the job for what I need. Better than chemicals that are too harsh.</li>
            <li> This product is great for those in between times when you don&#x27;t have time to touch up with permanent dyes. It is convenient to carry in your purse.  It is not permanent so it will rub off if you wear a hat.  I go with darker colored hats when I have applied a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stick and another from a different brand at a beauty supply. I did not like the other brand at all. This one is a little \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;, but I think it is still easy to put on, and I did not have to get \\&quot;creative\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of gray and it grows out quickly. I apply the color stick on sparingly on my roots (and rub it in to make it look more natural and to not use so much . It takes just a minute. I am happily ordering this pack so that I don&#x27;t have to color my gray more than every 4 to 5 weeks - otherwise I&#x27;d have to do so every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t kind of sticky (my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very nice after I apply it)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> No doubt this product does cover gray, but it didn&#x27;t work out for me for what I purchased it for.  I have dull dirty blonde hair and get it colored dark brown a couple times a year.  My regrowth looks terrible so I thought this would be a good way to cover it a bit in between colorings without having to color it at home.  There&#x27;s just too much blonde showing to have enough patience to put this everywhere, and it gets gunky if you put it in too many places.  If you have a few grays peeking out, then this product should work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find another use for it, I tried it on my eyebrows - just a little bit and it colored the hairs pretty well and didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty sticky and gross.  Sure didn&#x27;t need 6 because I didn&#x27;t even fully use 1 before I decided I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SECOND TIME I BUY THIS, I LOVE THIS STUFF, SO EASY FOR CARRY AND SO GOOD AT RESULT.</li>
            <li> This product works well if your goal is just to temporarily cover your gray hair. Your hair becomes sticky and thick so it feels like you have to shampoo before bedtime. It does its work though especially if you do it when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> The whole point of using this product is not really to save money, but to save time, because hair dyeing is a major time sink and a major hassle(at least to me, maybe I am lazy).  Before using this product, I had a choice of either doing frequent hair dyeings or having embarrassing grey roots showing at the whorl and at my part line.  Ever since using this touchup stick, I can now almost double the interval between full hair dyeings.  I use about 1/8 of a stick every time after I shampoo and I need to reapply only if I wash my hair.  I highly recommend this product as a timesaver.</li>
            <li> It was alright.  I thought a little expensive for what you get but better than nothing.  just had to try it,</li>
            <li> I like this product because it covers my gray hear instantly especially between periods when I am not able to dye my hair. It is easy and convenient to apply.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to keep going to the hairdresser to cover my grays before every function.&lt;br /&gt;It has saved me time and money.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to both men and women who need to cover up grays when they are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this it works great I recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27; b using it long time as it is go to cover grey easily.</li>
            <li> this product cover your roots very well, for an emergency is the best.</li>
            <li> This item works incredibly well covering up the root grays that pop up.  It is easy to use and blends amazingly to make it look very natural.  Also great for the eyebrows so everything looks natural.  I can workout and seat and the color doesn&#x27;t run or come off until I sleep on it or wash it out with shampoo.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Works good for grey coverage.</li>
            <li> While it definitely covered my grays, it left my hair really sticky and greasy - it feels like I have wax in my hair. Don&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a Lifesaver, especially when traveling!  I have ordered many times and love it every time!!</li>
            <li> My CVS ran out of these so I scooped up this 6-pack (and saved about 8 dollars in the process!) It is not messy like the wand-type covers ups, it doesn&#x27;t freeze your scalp like the spray, and it doesn&#x27;t take more than a few seconds to apply. For those in-between cover-ups you will not find anything better. I have medium brown hair but the dark brown works perfectly on my &amp;#34;whites.&amp;#34; When I ran out of this product I was using dark brown eye shadow to cover up, which also worked well, but it only lasted a day. This product stays put for days and days and doesn&#x27;t come off until. you wash it out. No bigger than a tube of lipstick, it tucks right in to your purse or makeup bag. Love, love, love LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since 5 years before and loved it. It really works well between hair color for my gray. I have purchased them from local retail stores, i.e., CVS and Duane and Read. When I found the 6 pack-product from Amazon, I was so happy. However, I found the product was very different from what I get from retail stores. It didn&#x27;t work. So I colored hair and retried next month when gray hair started visible. But the unsatisfactory result was same. I was so disappointed and requested refund but the Seller refused to refund because it passed a month from purchase. I won&#x27;t buy this product from amazon. I will go to retail store, although it is more expensive at local stores. I cannot trust the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;After awhile since I posted this review, the seller&#x27;s customer service has contacted me and apologized that they did not refund this purchase without considering my complaint. They have refunded fully after all. I guess the product might have been dried or something during storage and did not work as usual. I discarded the product but am satisfied with the seller&#x27;s attitude. So I would give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, does the trick. I will always keep on hand for quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Norma</li>
            <li> it helps to hide the white hair but it doesn&#x27;t look natural</li>
            <li> While excellent product covers gray hair.</li>
            <li> Accidentally ordered this knock-off brand .  Meant to order Claudia Stevens &amp;#34;COVER that GRAY&amp;#34;.  Bought 6-pk, when opening tubes 3 out of 6 were broken &amp; tops fell off. Actual: hairs can wrap around product,get stuck, &amp; leave small chunks in hair, causes hair to look matted. Gave it one star because it did color the gray, would give 1/2 star if available.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll ever do if they stop making it. The funny thing is, I don&#x27;t use this to cover-up greys, I actually use it to cover up some bad scars I have on my scalp from previous surgeries. For anyone who has difficulty with the consistency, I recommend shaking a little powder, like baby powder, in your hair after applying and then just comb it through and blow dry the powder out. It will prevent your scalp from having a greasy, sticky look. This product is great and can be used to fix multiple imperfections. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrows and no mess at all. My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> This is useful, very convenient, long ago bought, is running out, has been looking for it, today finally found and bought, I hope as good as with the previous ones.</li>
            <li> Very simple and thorough.  I reccommend this product to anyone try to cover gray hair, as a brunette. It works!!!!</li>
            <li> Covered my gray hair very well!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and it does the job it professes to do!</li>
