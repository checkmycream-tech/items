            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great clean and simple fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is however unique</li>
            <li>Amazing Grace is my new \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li>Years ago fell in love with Amazing Grace then switched to this, Inner Grace.</li>
            <li>Clean uplifting scent.</li>
            <li>A very soft clean scent that is nice.</li>
            <li>I received Inner Grace&#x27;s  body lotion and shower gel as a gift and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, but doesn&#x27;t seem to come thru much when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this one Love it....</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s a lighter scent, which I&#x27;m willing to reapply during the day, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>He says Amazing Grace makes me smell \\&quot;girly,\\&quot; but Inner Grace makes me smell \\&quot;sexy.\\</li>
            <li>The fragrance seems to last longer than the fragrance of Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this, because I simply adore Amazing Grace and Living Grace.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment!  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite, too bad philosophy made the sad mistake of not making this delightfully sensual and yet pure scent,, howverver,... glad to have found it on AMAZON!!!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Inner Grace, but it seems a lot of people must, because it&#x27;s always out of stock at Ulta.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as it&#x27;s shown.</li>
            <li>It may be for some, but unfortunately not for me.  </li>
            <li>I am running low and hopefully I will still be able to order thru AMAZON.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Several months ago, I fell in love with Philosophy skin-care products, so when I wanted a new perfume, I looked to Philosophy fragrances.</li>
            <li>I alternate between Amazing Grace and Inner Grace.</li>
            <li>but it really appeals to me</li>
            <li>very disappoiunted have not returned it no info on the return</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not as overpowering as many other well-known perfumes, which works for me, since I like to layer my fragrance with lotion.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I found plenty of other Philosophy scents that suit me better.</li>
            <li>I have had this perfume before and this inner grace does not smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Long lasting without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, this is very similar to Lovely, and quite a bit stronger than other Philosophy scents.</li>
            <li>All the other Grace colognes sit there, but this one gets snapped up quickly.</li>
            <li>While Amazing Grace is soft and delicate, Inner Grace is stronger, with a sultry tone.</li>
            <li>To make the set complete, I ordered the Eau de Parfum.  </li>
            <li>It is very spicy and definitely not for me.  </li>
            <li>However, I wanted something stronger, a little sexier to wear for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It is not soft, it is very powerful and smells nothing of the feminine softness that are the other Grace fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a light scent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>When I reached Inner Grace I was surprised.  </li>

            <li> My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Inner Grace, but it seems a lot of people must, because it&#x27;s always out of stock at Ulta. All the other Grace colognes sit there, but this one gets snapped up quickly. I ended up buying it from Amazon. To me it&#x27;s a lighter scent, which I&#x27;m willing to reapply during the day, because I love it so much. It&#x27;s perfect for summer and I get many compliments on it. I spritz myself all over, even on my clothing. If you prefer a lighter scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, this may be your cologne. I recently purchased a bottle of Inner Grace Spritzer (not cologne) for after the shower to compliment the cologne. Amazon comes through again!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite, too bad philosophy made the sad mistake of not making this delightfully sensual and yet pure scent,, howverver,... glad to have found it on AMAZON!!!!! YAY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product , love the scent! Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi</li>
            <li> very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  It is however unique but it really appeals to me and I have the lotion as well. It&#x27;s a great clean and simple fragrance.</li>
            <li> Several months ago, I fell in love with Philosophy skin-care products, so when I wanted a new perfume, I looked to Philosophy fragrances. Amazing Grace is my new \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance. It&#x27;s such a light scent for everyday wear. However, I wanted something stronger, a little sexier to wear for special occasions. Inner Grace is that fragrance. While Amazing Grace is soft and delicate, Inner Grace is stronger, with a sultry tone. It&#x27;s very hard to describe. Sometimes fragrances smell differently on your body than in the bottle, and I was unsure of this scent until I tried it at the store. The longer I wore it, the better it smelled. It&#x27;s still not as overpowering as many other well-known perfumes, which works for me, since I like to layer my fragrance with lotion. My husband probably describes it better than I can. He says Amazing Grace makes me smell \\&quot;girly,\\&quot; but Inner Grace makes me smell \\&quot;sexy.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Amazing Grace for years.  I received Inner Grace&#x27;s  body lotion and shower gel as a gift and loved it.  To make the set complete, I ordered the Eau de Parfum.  The fragrance seems to last longer than the fragrance of Amazing Grace.</li>
            <li> Wonderful gift for my mother.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume . Sad though, it&#x27;s being discontinued by the company. A very soft clean scent that is nice.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite perfumes!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law. Turn around on it was great when I ordered. Came exactly as it&#x27;s shown. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer the scent.</li>
            <li> For some reason this bottle of Inner Grace did not smell the same as bottles I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume spray I have been looking for a long time everywhere including Sephora. Very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> Love it very clean scent and worth the money I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne...so happy to have found someone who still carried it!</li>
            <li> hard to find as I think this one is on its way out from the manufacturer.  but at least I know where I can get it.</li>
            <li> I received Inner Grace as part of a set and have been trying them out day by day.  When I reached Inner Grace I was surprised.  It may be for some, but unfortunately not for me.  It reminded me of mens aftershave, spicy but stronger than some of the reviews.  I could still smell this hours after applying.  Thankfully, I found plenty of other Philosophy scents that suit me better.</li>
            <li> Great seller and my daughter loves it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and also enjoy the body lotion. I alternate between Amazing Grace and Inner Grace. Every time I wear Inner Grace, I receive compliments. It isn&#x27;t heavy or flowery nor fruity. Just pleasant. I have discovered it is no longer available by Philosophy. I am running low and hopefully I will still be able to order thru AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> the perfume smelled stale and old. I have had this perfume before and this inner grace does not smell fresh. very disappoiunted have not returned it no info on the return</li>
            <li> Years ago fell in love with Amazing Grace then switched to this, Inner Grace. Wear it everyday. Enjoy the scent and it doesn&#x27;t bother friends with allergies.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this, because I simply adore Amazing Grace and Living Grace. Thank goodness I only bought the .33 ounce size!  This is very very strong, it DOES smell like a men&#x27;s fragrance.  They should bottle this as a Philosophy mens aftershave or something!  It is not soft, it is very powerful and smells nothing of the feminine softness that are the other Grace fragrances.  It is very spicy and definitely not for me.  Someone posted a review that this is a replica of Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s Lovely fragrance???  I honestly dont know where you get that from because I&#x27;ve tried Lovely and liked it....I do not like this fragrance at all!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but doesn&#x27;t seem to come thru much when wearing it.  Not as good as Amazing Grace, also by Philosophy.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this is very similar to Lovely, and quite a bit stronger than other Philosophy scents.Long lasting without being overwhelming. My husband liked the scented shampoo and he does not like many perfumes, plus it smelled good on him! Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing. Clean uplifting scent. Sense of well being. If Champaign had a scent it would smell like this. Sparkly and bubbly. It is truly a happy fragrance, leaving you in a great mood. Thanks for offering this one Love it....</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment!  Love this sent and cannot find it in the stores anymore - very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> It was a perfect and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so fragrant and not overwhelming like a lot of perfumes.  It has a very light sent and smells very fresh.</li>
