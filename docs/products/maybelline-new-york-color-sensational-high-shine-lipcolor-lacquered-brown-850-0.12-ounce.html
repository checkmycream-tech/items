            <li>The price for this product was very good through Amazon.</li>
            <li>very good product ...</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and it stays on.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Product  came quickly and was so happy to find this discontinued color!</li>
            <li>The lipstick was somewhat moisturizing, but as I&#x27;ve said before nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect color, goes on sheer and glossy, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>this was a gift for my mother, and she was very pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li>This is a nice color.</li>
            <li>Good , nice and cheap ...</li>
            <li>So for me its back to the drawing board on trying to find the best brown lipsticks.</li>
            <li>But I love this color and opted to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I found this in a local drugstore, but after it was discontinued, I was very happy to find it on line.</li>
            <li>I just love it...</li>
            <li>It was delivered early and I am happy I got it.  </li>
            <li>Too light,</li>
            <li>Love the lipstick&#x27;s qualities but has a distinct plum tint to it -- not just brown.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a long time and the color is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Too bright red.</li>
            <li>I did a google search for the product to see if I could find it anywhere else for a lesser price than the drugstores and it popped up on Amazon for a really good price and with no shipping.  </li>
            <li>The picture of the color looked a more mauve and less brown, so I gambled that this would be a good color for my mom (medium/light tan complexion).</li>
            <li>It feels soft on the lips and hydrating with a shine finish--although NOT the high shine of Maybelline&#x27;s Color Sensational Color Elixir.</li>
            <li>The color of this lipstick is good, but not unlike some other colors I already have.</li>
            <li>It is definitely brown but with a softer tone which looked amazing on her skin tone and really nice on mine (extremely fair/porcelain).</li>
            <li>When I finally find a lipstick color that I can wear with everything I want more-  </li>
            <li>More pinkish red than anything.</li>
            <li>I can and will use it, the price was a good one, but you have to wait for it to come to your door and that being said I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time buying it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is a very neutral color.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>BUT THANKS TO AMAZON, ALL WAS NOT LOST.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this  lipstick and can&#x27;t find it in stores any more unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Sensational High Shine Lipcolor&amp;#34; - uh, NO.</li>
            <li>Will order a few more to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Love the color; it&#x27;s a soft dark color.</li>
            <li>No way, no how was this lip color very shiny, and certainly not any more shiny than any other lipstick.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I have found what I want on Amazon and have ordered quite a few to last a while.</li>

            <li> I expected it to be a different color after reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other users said it was not brown, but a variation on it which was flattering to their skintones.</li>

            <li> The picture of the color looked a more mauve and less brown, so I gambled that this would be a good color for my mom (medium/light tan complexion). It is definitely brown but with a softer tone which looked amazing on her skin tone and really nice on mine (extremely fair/porcelain). It feels soft on the lips and hydrating with a shine finish--although NOT the high shine of Maybelline&#x27;s Color Sensational Color Elixir. Two TOTALLY different products.</li>
            <li> When I finally find a lipstick color that I can wear with everything I want more-  but then the drugstore doesn&#x27;t carry this shade anymore!  Fortunately I have found what I want on Amazon and have ordered quite a few to last a while.</li>
            <li> Too bright red. I was hoping for a darker red.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t brown at all.More pinkish red than anything.So for me its back to the drawing board on trying to find the best brown lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Product  came quickly and was so happy to find this discontinued color! Cannot beat the price!! Will order a few more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Not a good color for me,  Description misleading.Too light,</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my mother, and she was very pleased with the gift. she loves the color. yay</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a different color after reading all the reviews.  It is definitely brown, which I cannot wear.  Other users said it was not brown, but a variation on it which was flattering to their skintones.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this as It is discontinued. I have had bad experiences  with old make-up causing me to break out.  But I love this color and opted to give it a try.  It was delivered early and I am happy I got it.  I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I found this in a local drugstore, but after it was discontinued, I was very happy to find it on line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, but, didn&#x27;t want to pay $6-$8 for it at the drug store.  I did a google search for the product to see if I could find it anywhere else for a lesser price than the drugstores and it popped up on Amazon for a really good price and with no shipping.  This color works like majic on me, it blends with any color clothes that I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> No staying power at all</li>
            <li> The color of this lipstick is good, but not unlike some other colors I already have. The price for this product was very good through Amazon. The &amp;#34;Sensational High Shine Lipcolor&amp;#34; - uh, NO. No way, no how was this lip color very shiny, and certainly not any more shiny than any other lipstick. The lipstick was somewhat moisturizing, but as I&#x27;ve said before nothing exceptional. It is a lipstick NOT a lip stain, which means the color does stay on longer and I do like it for that reason. All in all the experience of buying this lipstick wasn&#x27;t horribly bad I can and will use it, the price was a good one, but you have to wait for it to come to your door and that being said I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love the lipstick&#x27;s qualities but has a distinct plum tint to it -- not just brown. Glossy, like other lipsticks in this line.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color. Was a little dented when I recieved it. But did not appear used. Great product</li>
            <li> Close enough...might be my imagination, shade a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this color in the stores and was not able to find it.  Purchased 2 of them and received it immediately . Thanks.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and it stays on.  Someone had purchased it and recommended that I give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lipstick.  It stays on for a long time and the color is very nice.  It is a very neutral color. Which can go with all skin tones.  I just love it...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this  lipstick and can&#x27;t find it in stores any more unfortunately.  It&#x27;s the perfect color, goes on sheer and glossy, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good , nice and cheap ... thanks</li>
            <li> very good product ...</li>
            <li> FOUND A COLOR THAT WORKS, THEN FOUND OUT IT WAS A DISCONTINUDED COLOR. BUT THANKS TO AMAZON, ALL WAS NOT LOST.  YOU SAVED ME. ITEM AS DESCRIBED. THANKS</li>
            <li> Love the color; it&#x27;s a soft dark color. It makes my lips soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I thougt it would be</li>
