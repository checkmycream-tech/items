            <li>frizz serum is much better than this one and does not leave my hair smelling like a million chemicals.</li>

            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of this from Folica because they ship fast and have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE review reader and did a ton of research.</li>
            <li>The Sedu anti-frizz serum is supposed to leave my hair looking shiny and smooth and instead, my hair was greasy</li>
            <li>The best way to use this is on damp towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li>Sedu needs to make this in a bigger bottle because it literally is amazing!</li>
            <li>I was over excited from the reviews, when i got this product it does work</li>
            <li>Even though I have fine straight hair, this oil makes it sleek , smooth , silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was pleased enough to purchase two more.</li>
            <li>I can not recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li>daughter have a dry hair and she loved as well</li>

            <li>My hair felt very smooth &amp; soft &amp; didn&#x27;t have a lot of breakage from being tangled.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would assume this would be an excellent treatment for thick straight hair as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if it is better than some of the other Argan oil products now available.</li>
            <li>the results are better than I ever imagined was possible.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Folica!</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on my hair since I started using it and will definitely keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products expecting this to be no different.  </li>
            <li>I have tried COUNTLESS serums as well (too many to name but</li>
            <li>the two most recent were Loreal expert serums).</li>
            <li>hot curler sets.</li>
            <li>I use a Hot Tools (large barrel) spring curling iron (purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and Loreal Smooth Intense Xtreme Straight Creme in my damp hair, I use the Olivia Garden 2 3/4 round brush, I use the DryBar Lemondrop Blow dryer (LOVE), I still use my Hot Tools large barrel purple spring curling iron.</li>
            <li>Is is very easy on the hair and light weight very manageable to use and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!!!</li>
            <li>This product works great on my thick hair!</li>
            <li>It really does shorten drying time and protects your hair from split ends when you blow-dry and iron.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it on the ends of my hair before dryung and it really helps with frizziness.</li>
            <li>(maybe I used too much?)</li>
            <li>Saves me SO MUCH TIME in the morning now.  </li>
            <li>It has done more for my hair than any other product.</li>
            <li>This product does great things for my long, thick, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>(which ultimately damaged my hair) but am able to blow dry and go with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying new products to see what might help.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Overall effect is pretty disheartening.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft and protects it from the humidity!</li>
            <li>I have enough natural curl that using a flat iron alone would not keep my hair smooth and shiny if there was any dampness in the air.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy, frizzy fine hair that I iron everyday and this leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Also, it has almost completely gotten rid of all of my frizz.</li>
            <li>Those would be: tigi hair styling products, Loreal Expert Professional styling products, Loreal EverClear shampoo/conditioner; Redkin Ever Soft shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now.</li>
            <li>Compared to Moroccan oil products , sedu wins hands down.</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to blow dry or to iron my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I usually buy expensive hair products and shampoos that are not sold in the regular stores, but I generally have not been very happy with my hair.</li>
            <li>but with this I feel I look professional enough to go curly!!!  </li>
            <li>I have used a Hot Tools blow dryer for a couple of years and a Revlon round wire brush (for the blowout look).</li>

            <li> I have used a Hot Tools blow dryer for a couple of years and a Revlon round wire brush (for the blowout look).</li>
            <li> I put a total of 3 dime sized amounts in my hair for blow drying and then afterwards I flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> I payed too much money for a small bottle of Sedu Anti Frizz.</li>
            <li> I flat iron afterwards and</li>
            <li> I used to have to flat iron</li>
            <li> I have always flat ironed my hair -</li>
            <li> and it leave my hair feeling soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I leave a little of my natural hair out.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to receive a long bottle of Sedu Anti Frizz Polishing oil.</li>
            <li> After using 3 pumps of this on damp hair (I blow dry it until almost dry before applying) and then continuing to blow dry until totałly dry, my hair is transformed.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to dry hair, before I do my styling.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump on damp hair then blow dry.</li>
            <li> After blowing my hair dry with this dryer, my hair is so smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply to hands and &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; through each section using as little product as possible and yet coating each section.  </li>
            <li> I am a white female with thick, wavy, unmanageable and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and I have thick curly and mature, colored &amp; damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first summer that I have been able to wear my hair down, even in the rain or the worst humidity.</li>
            <li> I have very thick &amp; long hair that is still the texture of an African American.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Elchim blow dryer and some other conditioning products.</li>
            <li> A must for thick coarse hair!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smoother without weighing it down, and seems to add volume too.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but you only use a dollop each time so it will probably last me a year or two-</li>
            <li> and in fact, a little brittle.</li>
            <li> I also combine it with GK Hair Taming System with Juvexin and a little</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I try to wash it every other morning and on the morning I do not wash my hair, it is really hard to straighten it.</li>
            <li> It is slick, manageable and holds its shape.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and slick.  </li>
            <li> my hair felt so silky for a few days even after showering!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked how silky, soft and well defined</li>
            <li> but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have very curly hair which I hate.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, color-treated, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Do not let the seller Execeon trick you into buying this product which he or she sells expensive.</li>

            <li> I am a hair stylist, and I love this product. Very light weight and  perfect for all types of hair. Compared to Moroccan oil products , sedu wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t worth the price.  Didn&#x27;t make a difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was over excited from the reviews, when i got this product it does work okay but not amazing. Better products out there...</li>
            <li> I always re-purchase this product. Have been using this for years! It really does shorten drying time and protects your hair from split ends when you blow-dry and iron.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your hair.  I have wavy, frizzy fine hair that I iron everyday and this leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> A must for thick coarse hair!</li>

I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I can not recommend this more highly. I am over 50 and have very curly hair which I hate. I spend summers by the ocean so the curls also turn into frizz. Overall effect is pretty disheartening. So- I&#x27;ve been trying new products to see what might help. In the process I found this Sedu polishing oil and I&#x27;m in love with it. I can&#x27;t describe it without using cliches. It makes your hair feel and look like silk, it literally makes your hair shine and it smells so wonderful. It is expensive, but you only use a dollop each time so it will probably last me a year or two- so definitely worth the money.</li>

I decided to give this product a try a couple of weeks ago and I am a customer for life! It has done more for my hair than any other product. Amazing! Yesterday I did not even need to straighten my hair. I woke up, brushed it and I looked in the mirror- my God, my hair looked amazing. It is slick, manageable and holds its shape. Thank you, Sedu!</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who wears weave. I leave a little of my natural hair out. This oil is GREAT at smoothing and blending my natural hair with the weave without being too oily! It&#x27;s fabulous! One of the best things I have bought for my hair in a long time!</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to receive a long bottle of Sedu Anti Frizz Polishing oil. However, when this product was delivered to me, I got disapointed. I payed too much money for a small bottle of Sedu Anti Frizz. Do not let the seller Execeon trick you into buying this product which he or she sells expensive.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy. I love it. Smells good too. Best when applied on wet hair. Anti frizz  great results</li>
            <li> This is the most impressive oil that I have found in years.  Is is very easy on the hair and light weight very manageable to use and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It leaves my hair shiny and slick.  It makes it easier to blow dry or to iron my hair straight.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my thick hair! I have used it all summer.  It makes my hair feel really soft and protects it from the humidity!</li>
            <li> Love Folica and love Sedu!!! This stuff is amazing! Even purchased a bottle for my sister who absolutely loves this stuff also!! Sedu needs to make this in a bigger bottle because it literally is amazing! Will definitely be ordering more of this from Folica because they ship fast and have excellent customer service. Thanks Folica!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I use it on the ends of my hair before dryung and it really helps with frizziness.</li>
            <li> Use this every day on my hair.  Helps control the frizz and adds a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> I use this every day after I take a shower and it leave my hair feeling soft without weighing it down. Also, it has almost completely gotten rid of all of my frizz. I love this and would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Elchim blow dryer and some other conditioning products. I was pleased enough to purchase two more.</li>
            <li> This product eliminates the frizzies without all the goo that you get with the silicon-based products.  It is very light and non-greasy, and just disappears into your hair.  The frazzled ends magically disappear, and hair looks nice and shiny.  I apply it to dry hair, before I do my styling.  I do not know if it is better than some of the other Argan oil products now available.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. It completely smooths every strand without being greasy and also gives hair a wonderful, healthy shine. I use one pump on damp hair then blow dry. I used to have to flat iron my ends daily (which ultimately damaged my hair) but am able to blow dry and go with this product. I have had many compliments on my hair since I started using it and will definitely keep purchasing it. The 1oz bottle has lasted me 4 months and I have about a week left!</li>
            <li> Ok, I got this product in spite of it&#x27;s price and the fact that it did not have many reviews here in Amazon and it serves me right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Tresemme No frizz serum is much better than this one and does not leave my hair smelling like a million chemicals. The Sedu anti-frizz serum is supposed to leave my hair looking shiny and smooth and instead, my hair was greasy (maybe I used too much?) and in fact, a little brittle. I will not buy this again and still have about 75% of an 1-oz bottle left from when I bought is 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> Even though I have fine straight hair, this oil makes it sleek , smooth , silky and shiny. Love, love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and I have thick curly and mature, colored &amp; damaged hair.  Nothing has ever made my hair behave as well as this.  I have tried many products expecting this to be no different.  I was so pleasantly pleased!!!!  The best way to use this is on damp towel dried hair.  Part and section hair.  Apply to hands and &amp;#34;rake&amp;#34; through each section using as little product as possible and yet coating each section.  I was shocked how silky, soft and well defined my curls were after this!!!  I have always flat ironed my hair - but with this I feel I look professional enough to go curly!!!  Saves me SO MUCH TIME in the morning now.  Just wash, condition and treat hair and walk out the door wet, and hair will look great all day!!!  I also combine it with GK Hair Taming System with Juvexin and a little Frizz Ease Curl Reviving Mouse when  want even more definition and put my hair up and want to keep my curls segmented.  I would assume this would be an excellent treatment for thick straight hair as well.</li>
            <li> Really good, works really well. Have a great smell and leave my hair soft and shine.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter have a dry hair and she loved as well and now I&#x27;m purchasing one for her.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smoother without weighing it down, and seems to add volume too.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, color-treated, frizzy hair. I have tried as many products as I could think of. Those would be: tigi hair styling products, Loreal Expert Professional styling products, Loreal EverClear shampoo/conditioner; Redkin Ever Soft shampoo/conditioner. I have tried COUNTLESS serums as well (too many to name but the two most recent were Loreal expert serums). I have used a Hot Tools blow dryer for a couple of years and a Revlon round wire brush (for the blowout look). I bought 4 (yes 4!) hot curler sets. I use a Hot Tools (large barrel) spring curling iron (purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after all of that... here is what actually WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rahua Shampoo and Conditioner, I use the It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and Loreal Smooth Intense Xtreme Straight Creme in my damp hair, I use the Olivia Garden 2 3/4 round brush, I use the DryBar Lemondrop Blow dryer (LOVE), I still use my Hot Tools large barrel purple spring curling iron. Then I finish it off with SEDU Antifrizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil.. then I add a bit of hairspray to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe what makes the difference is this shampoo/conditioner - the DryBar blowdryer - and the SEDU Antifrizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil (this stuff is AWESOME... it has an amazing smell and works so well). The Blow dryer is the absolute BEST!! After blowing my hair dry with this dryer, my hair is so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps... I am a HUGE review reader and did a ton of research. I bought a bunch of stuff on impulse but this is what works for me!!</li>
            <li> my hair felt so silky for a few days even after showering!  i would definitely recommend this product.  Great for protecting my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Glad I found it. My hair is so soft now.</li>
            <li> I have very thick &amp; long hair that is still the texture of an African American. (I am African American) I put a total of 3 dime sized amounts in my hair for blow drying and then afterwards I flat ironed my hair. My hair felt very smooth &amp; soft &amp; didn&#x27;t have a lot of breakage from being tangled. I do have a relaxer, but after going 8 weeks without one it still showed great results.</li>
