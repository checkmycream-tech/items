            <li>It smells good and does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li>I like this as a once a week wash, or a special occasion wash.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean is how Lemisol makes your most intimate part feel.</li>
            <li>I like this product, really refreshes and I feel very clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Keeps you fresh and clean all day confidence</li>
            <li>It makes you feel clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh,  clean and tingly every time.  </li>
            <li>Fresh clean and orderless tutu...</li>
            <li>The tingling sensation tells you you&#x27;re clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>You feel fresh and clean when using it.</li>
            <li>So fresh and SO clean</li>
            <li>I keep this in the shower, it tingles you clean, and its been around forever so it must be doing something right</li>
            <li>You will feel fresh all day...</li>
            <li>This package with two bottles is quite economical.</li>
            <li>gives you a tingle sensation so minty fresh</li>
            <li>Giving it a fresh tingle feeling.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer recommended, it&#x27;s probably better to dilute this with water (or a fem wash) or use a regular fem wash first, and</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I thought I had listerined my crotch.</li>
            <li>so I was a little leery about trying this product at first, but I used it and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I am extremely fresh and clean throughout my entire day.</li>
            <li>I got my Lemisol fast.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn like Satan, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t the gentle cool that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Honestly,  Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>This one feels less stronger than the original, but it still leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is much too strong for a regular wash and could cause potential vaginal infections.</li>
            <li>I have practically no vaginal smell (the vaginal smell that&#x27;s NORMAL, anyway) while using this, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any yeast infections.</li>
            <li>You really do stay fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>My friends from New York swear by this product</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it in my home.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34; is a little strong for me bordering on a burn</li>
            <li>You just feel so clean and refreshed when you use it, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy film like some other products do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too sensitive for summers eve and vagisil</li>
            <li>One of the bottles was leaking a very little amount, next time it would be better to have the bottle sealed</li>
            <li>It does suds up a little, and has a light fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t last longer than your shower.</li>
            <li>No other product compares.</li>
            <li>I thought you&#x27;d feel fresh a little longer, but no..</li>
            <li>My nieces who are young women liked it, and asked me where to buy it so it isn&#x27;t a bad product just didn&#x27;t jive with me, and my mature vagina.</li>

            <li> I give this product four stars, because it was too much for my delicate ecosystem with the menthol.</li>
            <li> I grew up using this product, and it became harder to find after I moved out of my country.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice once you&#x27;re expecting it (very similar to KY Yours and Mine) but quite shocking if you aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> (I usually like to wash, rinse, repeat and let sit when I use feminine wash), so I had to rinse it off immediately.</li>
            <li> Been using it fir the past 9 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dominican and Lemisol is very common there</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few of my close friends to use it as well!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> Keeps you fresh and clean all day confidence</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! Love the STUFF..</li>
            <li> I like this product, really refreshes and I feel very clean afterwards.  Great product. I think it words better than Summer&#x27;s Eve, because after using I feel the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> My friends from New York swear by this product so I had to give it a try! I&#x27;m too sensitive for summers eve and vagisil so I was a little leery about trying this product at first, but I used it and absolutely love it! Don&#x27;t have any issues in the low lands but just wanted to feel a little fresher and most soaps are über irritating. It&#x27;s kinda tingly which was a pleasant surprise. A definite re-buy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.It makes you feel clean and fresh all day. It smells good and does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, leaves you feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> I got my Lemisol fast. Each bottle wasn&#x27;t individually sealed, but there was no leakage, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue. The Lemisol itself works great. The &amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34; is a little strong for me bordering on a burn (I usually like to wash, rinse, repeat and let sit when I use feminine wash), so I had to rinse it off immediately. It didn&#x27;t burn like Satan, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t the gentle cool that I was expecting. I have practically no vaginal smell (the vaginal smell that&#x27;s NORMAL, anyway) while using this, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any yeast infections. Like another reviewer recommended, it&#x27;s probably better to dilute this with water (or a fem wash) or use a regular fem wash first, and then the Lemisol. Rinse thoroughly!</li>
            <li> Feels fresh,  clean and tingly every time.  Also a refreshing surprise if used as lube in the shower ;p&lt;br /&gt;As a diabetic it also helps keep yeast infections at bay.</li>
            <li> It was great and got there on time. Best wash I have used thus far.. Packaging of the items were great, well sealed and no leakage.</li>
            <li> This is the best feminine cleanser I have ever used!!!! I have gotten a few of my close friends to use it as well!!!</li>

            <li> The most refreshing intimate cleanser on the market. I am extremely fresh and clean throughout my entire day. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Loved this products!!!! All women should own this! So refreshing!!!</li>
            <li> Since I have used this it is the only thing I use. Forget Summers Eve. It has a pleasant tinging feeling, and you feel the freshness.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was leaking a very little amount, next time it would be better to have the bottle sealed</li>
            <li> Fresh clean and orderless tutu...you will love this product. You will feel fresh all day...I love this product worth every penny</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my body, love it!!</li>
            <li> Honestly,  Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> Ladies this soap keeps that coochie on point. I&#x27;ve been using this soap since I was a kid and it works awesome. If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, be prepared for a rush of menthol in your nether regions.</li>
            <li> A Spanish friend of mine told me about this and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now. No other product compares. You really do stay fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> These product are Good,, my friend was very happy, all her friends were asking for more for them..... thank you...</li>
            <li> Best! If your dominican then you don&#x27;t need explainations on what lemisol is. I&#x27;ll never stop using this product ever</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean is how Lemisol makes your most intimate part feel.</li>
            <li> lemisol is an excellent product.  I prefer it over Summers Eve and Vagisil.  ENOUGH SAID!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. This one feels less stronger than the original, but it still leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for years, great product</li>
            <li> I personally love it and won&#x27;t go without it.. It has a menthol cool feeling, the scent is nice and light. very nice specially for the summer..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product ever since I moved from Miami and I have now found it on here !</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years now.  It&#x27;s very refreshing. Would highly recommend it.  Very happy with my purchase.  Product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone for personal hygiene.  This works great for women</li>
            <li> I have to agree with all the reviews. What separates me from all the rest is I am a guy and my wife told me about it. She said try it once and now i&#x27;m hooked. Feel extremely clean. Try it you&#x27;ll love it. The tingling sensation tells you you&#x27;re clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel refreshed... Didn&#x27;t think I would find this product online, but it seems as though one can find almost anything on this site.</li>
            <li> I like this as a once a week wash, or a special occasion wash. I believe it is much too strong for a regular wash and could cause potential vaginal infections. This product is great for the week you are menstruating though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years, and I love it. I order it every time I am close to running out of it.  You feel fresh and clean when using it. This package with two bottles is quite economical.</li>
            <li> Lemisol is truly the best feminine wash ever. I cannot live without it in my home.</li>
            <li> I was so happy this product came in the fashion it was describe to me how it was going to arrived. and I was a happy camper. I will continue to order only amazon.com in the future...thanks</li>
            <li> I keep this in the shower, it tingles you clean, and its been around forever so it must be doing something right</li>
            <li> I love this wash it&#x27;s everything and more a woman could use for her feminine hygiene gives you a tingle sensation so minty fresh</li>
            <li> I give this product four stars, because it was too much for my delicate ecosystem with the menthol. My nieces who are young women liked it, and asked me where to buy it so it isn&#x27;t a bad product just didn&#x27;t jive with me, and my mature vagina.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I feel so refresh and clean. I would definitely recommend this product to all women. Enjoy ladies</li>
            <li> She swears by it and moved away for college. So now I get it online and ship it to her......</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. Just doesn&#x27;t do the job. It does suds up a little, and has a light fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t last longer than your shower. I thought you&#x27;d feel fresh a little longer, but no..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dominican and Lemisol is very common there and I was also able to find it easily in NY but that was not the case once I moved out of there so I am beyond elated to be able to find this product here!!! I love Lemisol it leaves me feeling fresh and clean and confident!! Feels like my privates swallowed a mint!! LMAO So fresh and SO clean</li>
            <li> Its like listerine for your vag-jay. Giving it a fresh tingle feeling. If she could talk, she would say &amp;#34;aahhh&amp;#34; after washing with this</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fresh and tingly&amp;#34; indeed!! The first time I used it, I thought I had listerined my crotch. It has a lot of menthol in it! It&#x27;s nice once you&#x27;re expecting it (very similar to KY Yours and Mine) but quite shocking if you aren&#x27;t. Really nice clean feeling that keeps you fresh all day. No UTIs or irritation to report.</li>
