            <li>Discovered at the Store I enjoyed the scent of the Patchouli.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed how the scent carried in the bathroom too.</li>

            <li>Love Patchouli Zum Bars...Will be odering more...</li>
            <li>but there is something relaxing about the aroma as well as the nice full lather it generates.</li>
            <li>but, to me, well worth it!!</li>
            <li>I got in the habit of doing this easily over a week.</li>
            <li>the scent filled the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Besides that it&#x27;s so smooth and creamy in feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok not as good as the Zumba brand which smells and last longer!</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I have found, hands down!!  </li>
            <li>I absolute love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using knotty boy all purpose in the patchouli love scent, but wanted to try this one because it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Zum does make nice, natural products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap and where I live</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the added</li>
            <li>They actually make their own boxes from scrap cardboard they horde from around town</li>
            <li>After using this soap for the first time, my husband and I began loping around the house for some moldy fruit we must have overlooked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything pretty much.</li>
            <li>Now, I work in a very smelly place.</li>
            <li>Oh la la this soap puts a smile on my face every time and makes my skin so soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>I come home with not so much as a hint of locker room.</li>
            <li>but well worth it to treat yourself everyday to make yourself feel special.</li>
            <li>The soap is very soothing to my sensitive skein.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, it&#x27;s a true patchouli soap, that&#x27;s hard to find, and it is the only fragranced product I buy.</li>
            <li>Much better than far more expensive patchouli soap bars !</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often covered in dirt and grass by the time i get in the shower, so don&#x27;t really need any extra debris.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off I am a man who works in balmy Florida</li>
            <li>Lather, cleaning, scent, natural Oils for skin quality</li>
            <li>and he smells a lot better than usual!</li>
            <li>I have to open a new one about every 3 weeks...</li>
            <li>After using it a few times I can tell it&#x27;s not going to be a long lasting bar, so I&#x27;m glad I have five of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the little bits that are in the soap.</li>
            <li>I generally buy it at a chain grocer not in our area.  </li>
            <li>Patchouli fragrance was barely detectable.</li>
            <li>Seemed masculine enough.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, but my only complaint is that it does not last long.  </li>
            <li>It had an old smell to it, as if the expiration date on it was a long time ago.</li>

            <li> Great soaps. Get cleaner than using liquid body wash. N smells great too :)</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Love this soap and its great smell!! Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, it&#x27;s a true patchouli soap, that&#x27;s hard to find, and it is the only fragranced product I buy.</li>
            <li> I absolute love this stuff. It was given to me as a gift a few years ago. I had put it on my shelf and forgotten about it. A month ago I saw it and pulled it out to use. Wow... the scent filled the bathroom. Now, I work in a very smelly place. After my 12 hour shift, I can still smell it on my skin. This is the best stuff I have found, hands down!!  I have even used it on my hair after shampooing and before my conditioner and it makes my hair smell great!!  I&#x27;m so glad to have found it here. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either, like regular soap. Pricey, yes, but, to me, well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a bad batch. Patchouli fragrance was barely detectable. Actually, the soap smelled like it had &amp;#34;gone off&amp;#34; a bit. Won&#x27;t buy again. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Oh la la this soap puts a smile on my face every time and makes my skin so soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Patchouli and receive so many compliments!  The soap is very soothing to my sensitive skein.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant- smells wonderful! The fragrance lasts long but the actual soap doesn&#x27;t last long. I have to open a new one about every 3 weeks...but I still love it :)</li>
            <li> I have been using knotty boy all purpose in the patchouli love scent, but wanted to try this one because it was much cheaper. The scent is wonderful. It lasts a bit longer and its just how patchouli should be. It feels good on my skin and gets me nice and clean. After using it a few times I can tell it&#x27;s not going to be a long lasting bar, so I&#x27;m glad I have five of them. I&#x27;m not crazy about the little bits that are in the soap. I&#x27;m often covered in dirt and grass by the time i get in the shower, so don&#x27;t really need any extra debris. Seems to work well on my dreadlocks. All in all a very nice soap.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent soap and not overpowering it leaves the bathroom smelling beautiful and you with just a hint of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> These are like soaps that Jesus had in Israel.  I love these soaps. Many types of smells of these soaps.</li>
            <li> The bath and bed rooms smell wonderful after my shower. The fragrance dose not last as long as I thought it would after reading review. But this is the Patchouli that I remember from my youth, and I love it for that.</li>
            <li> I bought for my dad who saw an ad about goat&#x27;s milk soap and how it helps with dry skin.  He says these are really nice and he smells a lot better than usual!</li>
            <li> I have to rave a bit here and why.&lt;br /&gt;First off I am a man who works in balmy Florida and I sweat gruesomely on a daily basis. Stinking is not an option for me. I hate smelling like a mens locker room at the end of each day. The constant sweat made my skin itch too. Mold and bacteria run rampant down here. I needed something that actually kills bacteria on a massive scale and won&#x27;t reak havoc on my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve tried everything pretty much. Dial had the best success but just didn&#x27;t kill all the bacteria and at the end of the day there was still that hint of locker room...and my skin still itched. Then I tried Dove body soap. Dead is dead now. I come home with not so much as a hint of locker room. Though sticky and sweaty. My skin still itched however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then along came Zum ! Discovered at the Store I enjoyed the scent of the Patchouli. Seemed masculine enough. I enjoyed how the scent carried in the bathroom too. After I scrubbed out my day with the dove I would rinse off and apply the Zum bar. I got in the habit of doing this easily over a week. If the Dove soap is the rough part of my shower Zum Bar soap is the pleasure part. I don&#x27;t know but there is something relaxing about the aroma as well as the nice full lather it generates. Once more it has this creme like texture to it that says Ahhhhhhhh....thats so nice. Then one day I noticed my skin didn&#x27;t itch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found a winning combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side is this is premium Soap. It&#x27;s not Zest or Lever 2000. Its not even oil of Olay (yeah tried that too) At close to twice the cost of those other soaps Zum actually delivers on quality across the board. Lather, cleaning, scent, natural Oils for skin quality I give em all 5 stars. But you pay for it. Definitely worth the added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 5 pack from Soap Hope for several reasons. 1st was they offered the cheapest deal (at the time). They delivered in good time and packing was superior. They actually make their own boxes from scrap cardboard they horde from around town or they find on the floor from shipments they received. Most of their profits go toward women&#x27;s charities. Zum does the same thing by helping dog charities. What a winning team !lly make their own boxes from scrap cardboard they horde from around town or they find on the floor from shipments they received. Most of their profits go toward women&#x27;s charities. Zum does the same thing by helping dog charities. What a winning team !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok not as good as the Zumba brand which smells and last longer!</li>
            <li> Lovelovelove this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than far more expensive patchouli soap bars ! Good strong scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap and where I live it is hard to find.  I generally buy it at a chain grocer not in our area.  You can&#x27;t beat the quality of these soaps. My disappointment was the price.  $2.00 more per bar than what I pay for in the grocery/health foods store.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but found some at our local store and it $ 1:00 less.</li>
            <li> My husband loves patchouli scented soap. After using this soap for the first time, my husband and I began loping around the house for some moldy fruit we must have overlooked. We finally discovered it was the soap that smelled so bad. This soap smelled like moldy fruit and did not smell like any patchouli soap we have ever purchased. It smelled so bad, we had to throw it out of the house immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrant soap with bits of patchouli in the bar.  It smells lovely, but my only complaint is that it does not last long.  That&#x27;s why only 4 stars.  Zum does make nice, natural products.</li>
            <li> I am totally addicted to the fragrance. Besides that it&#x27;s so smooth and creamy in feel. A luxury, yes, but well worth it to treat yourself everyday to make yourself feel special.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with the patchouli soap. It had an old smell to it, as if the expiration date on it was a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and heaven in a soap bar..  Mmm thank you.</li>
            <li> Everything I thought it would be. Was delivered on time..very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Love Patchouli Zum Bars...Will be odering more...</li>
