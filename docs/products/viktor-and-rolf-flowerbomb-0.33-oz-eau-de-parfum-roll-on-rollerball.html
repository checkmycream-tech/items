            <li>Flower bomb is one of my favorite Fragrances.</li>

            <li>I love it, and so does the man in my life.  </li>

            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice fresh scent and with roller ball</li>
            <li>So easy and convenient to take with you anywhere.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a strong smell and do not overuse perfume, but this does nothing.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet, spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li>so she is very pleased with her gift, therefore I would highly recommend as a token gift too.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this a great fragrance, but the convenient rollerball is never something I had considered as a convenience.</li>
            <li>The cologne is fabulous</li>
            <li>I would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes a sweet smelling scent that is strong but not over powering.</li>
            <li>it was a very nice touch and a personal thank</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and have had a lot of compliments while wearing it!</li>
            <li>Flowerbomb first of all is such a beautiful fragrance and</li>
            <li>Smells soooo fresh n floral... lasts all day...</li>
            <li>The Price Is Right</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and no problems what so ever-perfect.</li>
            <li>Great roll on for carrying in handbag for late day touch ups.</li>
            <li>Even If It isn&#x27;t The Real ThiNg!</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to lug my regular sized bottle around, now.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, but can never afford the bigger bottles.</li>

            <li>It is more than i expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>haha</li>

            <li>It really does not work.  </li>
            <li>it really is the bomb.</li>
            <li>It also has a smell of alcohol when I first put it on (it lasts only about 20 seconds) but the spray smells sweet immediately.</li>
            <li>works well with many of my other scents.</li>
            <li>This little vial is so much better</li>

            <li> It does not last as long on my skin as the spray.</li>
            <li> I can carry it to work and introduce other people to this romantic fragrance.</li>
            <li> but otherwise this is as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality perfume, so a little dab lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> i buying not first time ilove this parfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a different travel bottle for my Flowerbomb which involved transferring perfume from one container to another using a small funnel.  </li>
            <li> the funnel never drained (3 sets) without trickery, mess, and product loss.  </li>
            <li> just so it won&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> This roller smells nothing like the perfume on the bottle - was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The perfume smell is not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> Did not receive roll the roll on but rather a small bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> Could only afford roll-on as way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Do you realize how tough it was for me to get through writing this without... ah, there.</li>
            <li> and, sorry for the pun</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve knocked off TWO of these delicate glass vials and shattered them on my bathroom tile. :(</li>
            <li> Im obsessed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I will be returning it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does not last as long on my skin as the spray. Maybe it is because it is a rollerball. It also has a smell of alcohol when I first put it on (it lasts only about 20 seconds) but the spray smells sweet immediately. Could it be a knock-off? If it is I do not blame the sender.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. I love it.</li>
            <li> So easy and convenient to take with you anywhere.</li>
            <li> Love the scent,  long lasting, not to heavy of a scent, has staying power.  Great roll on for carrying in handbag for late day touch ups.</li>
            <li> Did not receive roll the roll on but rather a small bottle of perfume. Very disappointed I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;And I like it&#x27;s the rolling type.</li>
            <li> I LOVE FLOWERBOMB !&lt;br /&gt;Roll on is cheaper elsewhere though</li>
            <li> I fits in my Louis Vuitton cosmetic case.  I can take it on the airplane to exotic places and smell good.  I can carry it to work and introduce other people to this romantic fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is more than i expected. I ordered this again because i dropped it so beware it is very fragile but it is just as great as i remember it begins from any dept store.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed! Wish the scent lasted longer on me but my husband and I both love it! Great price too</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells so fresh and have had a lot of compliments while wearing it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Could only afford roll-on as way too expensive. Lovely scent. Would recommend as a perfume for every occasion.</li>
            <li> i buying not first time ilove this parfume</li>
            <li> Highly addictive scent. If you&#x27;re fine with secretly smelling your wrists all day, this one is for you. Do you realize how tough it was for me to get through writing this without... ah, there.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out before committing to a bottle. I am so glad I did. Not only is this a great fragrance, but the convenient rollerball is never something I had considered as a convenience. It&#x27;s wonderful and so easy to take anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> i love it. a great every day scent. works well with many of my other scents. a great addition to my perfume collection. must try!!</li>
            <li> Love love love it! It&#x27;s easy to wear,nothing comes close to it! As you wear it it gets better and better.</li>
            <li> Flowerbomb first of all is such a beautiful fragrance and the &#x27;rollerball&#x27; format is GREAT to take in your purse!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love those perfume!! I have been using it for a couple years now and always get compliments. It&#x27;s one of those perfumes that will smell good on anybody regardless of your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Beautifully packaged with care. Great follow-up from shipper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume based on reviews and ratings I had never smelled this perfume before,I had heard the name of it before even in songs so i just decided to order it and I&#x27;m officially in love I can&#x27;t take the bottle away from my nose lol it smells so good I don&#x27;t even want to use it just so it won&#x27;t waste haha I would totally recommend. Oh and also it came wrapped in the the cutest zebra print tissue paper and all these cute pink ribbons it was a very nice touch and a personal thank you card. I order a lot from amazon literally and this has been the best wrapped order.😃</li>
            <li> I like this roll-on because I&#x27;m a frequent traveler and can put it in my purse.  It meets the TSA 3-1-1 size requirements to have it in my purse so I don&#x27;t have to pack it in my suitcase and worry about it possibly breaking.  I take this when I travel and leave the big bottle at home.</li>
            <li> Although in my opinion the smell is fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t last long.  The smell wears off in about 30 minutes.  I also think they should make the tube plastic.  If it falls out of your purse it will shatter.</li>
            <li> Nice Smell. The Price Is Right Even If It isn&#x27;t The Real ThiNg! It Came Right Away, Which Is Always Great!</li>
            <li> Favorite fragrance, so a purse-friendly version is a must. I love that I don&#x27;t have to lug my regular sized bottle around, now.</li>
            <li> After receiving I emailed to ask about return, but no one ever got back to me.  It&#x27;s been sitting at my desk since.  This roller smells nothing like the perfume on the bottle - was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The roller bottle is a perfect way to experience a high-end fragrance at an affordable price. It&#x27;s quality perfume, so a little dab lasts a long time. I love the sweet, spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li> A great value for the product when not getting the spray.</li>
            <li> Love this! Super fast shipping and no problems what so ever-perfect. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Flower bomb is one of my favorite Fragrances. It makes me feel feminine &amp; sexy whenever I wear it! I&#x27;m sure you will Love it too!</li>
            <li> Smells soooo fresh n floral... lasts all day... rollerball is so convenient to try. u dont need to invest $$$ for a scent u may not like.</li>
            <li> The cologne is fabulous but I&#x27;ve knocked off TWO of these delicate glass vials and shattered them on my bathroom tile. :(</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for my sister, she loved it!</li>
            <li> Because that is how I would describe this one -- sexy.  I love it, and so does the man in my life.  The rollerball container is also pretty convenient -- no perfume on my fingertips or too much squirting out of an atomizer.</li>
            <li> I love the roller ball applicator. I need to figure out if I can refill it but otherwise this is as expected. Good product</li>
            <li> It really does not work.  The perfume smell is not strong at all.  I don&#x27;t like a strong smell and do not overuse perfume, but this does nothing.</li>
            <li> Love it, the scent make people go WOW. It is a nice fresh scent and with roller ball it is compact for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It smells great, and I can wear it to work or on a night out on the town.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift to a close friend and she thought the fragrance was &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; and keeps it in her purse to freshen up after she leaves office prior to going out to dinner with friends.  They have noticed and asked what she was wearing so she is very pleased with her gift, therefore I would highly recommend as a token gift too.  Outstanding presentation and was wrapped nicely, a lot of work went into this gift,  Outstanding delivery too.  Do not see any block to check.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes a sweet smelling scent that is strong but not over powering.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but can never afford the bigger bottles. This size is perfect &amp; the price is affordable. Also, this type bottle is the roller ball, so it is convenient to carry in your bag!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a different travel bottle for my Flowerbomb which involved transferring perfume from one container to another using a small funnel.  the funnel never drained (3 sets) without trickery, mess, and product loss.  This little vial is so much better and, sorry for the pun it really is the bomb.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend who loves this perfume. She has been wanting to buy it for a while now. She got the&lt;br /&gt;roll on for travel as she is going to New York to visit family this month.</li>
