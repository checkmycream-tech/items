            <li>Perfect for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best! !</li>
            <li>Great color!</li>
            <li>This is very beautiful and tasteful and the quality is very nice as well.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly happy.</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>Good quality mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s often the brush that makes the mascara good.</li>
            <li>Maybelline always puts out a great product with mascara, am not yet sure about the color though.  </li>
            <li>It showed up nicely without being too bright.</li>
            <li>Love the color and had no problem with dryness or flaking, great product.</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof and removes very easy but does not come off under my eyes during the daytime.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I first saw this mascara as it looked like the perfect color for fall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK as a mascara on my very light skin, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love these colored mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Top seller too.</li>
            <li>For me it looks more like a brown than anything.</li>
            <li>so I can be creative.</li>
            <li>Takes many coats to cover lashes.</li>
            <li>The color is more brown than plum.</li>
            <li>nice product, true plum color.</li>
            <li>Which is fine as I can never find browns in the shops.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that they still make the fun colors</li>
            <li>This needs to be applied a few times to get the color shown, but is great!</li>
            <li>and I always come back to Great Lash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light brown.</li>
            <li>To me it looks like the color of a light sorrel horse.</li>
            <li>This very berry shade is more like an interesting color of brown.</li>
            <li>Love this product and color - it works great for my green eyes and auburn hair - really enhances my eye color - I love it!</li>
            <li>The green is great, and I love they way</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline&#x27;s mascara, although the red is more like brown.</li>
            <li>This was a fun color to add a pop to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is very easily removed with a simple wash with soap and water or eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about this color, but it really does accentuate blue eyes nicely.</li>
            <li>Super intense colour...</li>
            <li>Still, I bought this in the Pink Wink color as well and with that one you could really see the color brightly, so I just had higher hopes for this shade as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Tip: for more vibrant color use a white eyelash primer first.</li>
            <li>This mascara is an interesting color, but the makeup itself is really rather dry.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as bright and bold as the other colors in this series, but that is what I expected</li>
            <li>it just really didn&#x27;t have the color payoff I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>It really makes the color pop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was here on Amazon, and sold for muuuch less.</li>
            <li>I use mostly neutral colors on my face but like a little bit of tasteful color.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>and I often look for makeup that will look for natural on me...</li>
            <li>So overall this is a very wearable neutral color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every brand of mascara</li>
            <li>I generally apply a second coat in a different color, such as blue, to add more dimension to the area.</li>
            <li>I am a fair golden blonde and black mascara is usually too dark.</li>
            <li>I really love this (and their other two colors ) as an alternative to black.</li>

            <li> Really are unable to tell the color when it is on dark lashes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up too well over black mascara, but I don&#x27;t like it by itself.</li>
            <li> It allows me to wriggle the mascara easily from the base of my lashes to the tip without making all my eyelashes clump.</li>
            <li> I wanted berry, as it is called, to bring out my green eyes.</li>
            <li> Subtle colour on dark lashes.</li>
            <li> Hard find.</li>
            <li> The Maybelline colored mascara series is pleasantly not what one might expect.</li>
            <li> Too thin, doesn&#x27;t lengthen or volumize.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s the case, but I think the fact that it&#x27;s a rather thin formula also helps.</li>

            <li> No it didn&#x27;t. Its not red at all its brown. I give it a 0 rating.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. I have auburn-dyed hair and this mascara is a sort of wine color. I&#x27;ve used it a bit in my eyebrows as well. This isn&#x27;t as bright and bold as the other colors in this series, but that is what I expected and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> nice product, true plum color. doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural. love it.</li>
            <li> YIKES..this mascara is a joke...it&#x27;s so red.  I have red hair and I often look for makeup that will look for natural on me...this is not it!</li>
            <li> Love these colored mascaras.  There is just enough color to them to highlight the eyes yet not look clownish.  Top seller too.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, but a poor formula. Too thin, doesn&#x27;t lengthen or volumize. Will bring out redness around eye area. Doesn&#x27;t show up too well over black mascara, but I don&#x27;t like it by itself.</li>
            <li> Maybelline always puts out a great product with mascara, am not yet sure about the color though.  It makes my eyes appear too red.</li>
            <li> Love this product and color - it works great for my green eyes and auburn hair - really enhances my eye color - I love it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I first saw this mascara as it looked like the perfect color for fall. I like the formula of this mascara it just really didn&#x27;t have the color payoff I had hoped for. For me it looks more like a brown than anything. I asked my husband and he said he could see a reddish/berry tone so maybe it looks differently to those looking at it from the outside. Still, I bought this in the Pink Wink color as well and with that one you could really see the color brightly, so I just had higher hopes for this shade as well. One thing though it is not very colorfast. If you rub your eye at all you will have streaks all over your skin. On the plus side, it is very easily removed with a simple wash with soap and water or eye makeup remover. So overall this is a very wearable neutral color and I will still use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of mascara for over 30 years and I love the fact that they still make the fun colors so I can be creative.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline&#x27;s mascara, although the red is more like brown.Which is fine as I can never find browns in the shops.The green is great, and I love they way they all go on. No clumps.</li>
            <li> This was a fun color to add a pop to my eyes.  It showed up nicely without being too bright.</li>
            <li> This needs to be applied a few times to get the color shown, but is great!</li>

            <li> Good quality mascara.</li>
            <li> this is a brown color</li>
            <li> The color is more brown than plum. Makes my eyelashes look like poo. Literally.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly happy. Tip: for more vibrant color use a white eyelash primer first. It really makes the color pop.</li>

            <li> Super intense colour... no clumps or globs...it&#x27;s the best! !</li>
            <li> The actual color is not even close to the color on the tube. It&#x27;s a light brown. To me it looks like the color of a light sorrel horse. I wanted berry, as it is called, to bring out my green eyes. It&#x27;s OK as a mascara on my very light skin, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great color. I missed buying this at CVS store last year. I&#x27;m glad it was here on Amazon, and sold for muuuch less. I like.</li>
            <li> Love the color and had no problem with dryness or flaking, great product.</li>
            <li> Hard find. Great color!</li>
            <li> Really are unable to tell the color when it is on dark lashes.</li>
