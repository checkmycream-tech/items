            <li>it&#x27;s very lightweight and smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find moisturizers that work, but most are too greasy and often times causes my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>I love that you can turn the pump to close it, preventing air from reaching the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so optimistic that I would actually be able to get through a product without any complications.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is the best skin care product for women of African descent.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels now.</li>
            <li>On top of that, when I sweat it just slides off my face.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer gives your skin a \\&quot;glowing look\\&quot; and the more you use it the better your face looks.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has 30 SPF in it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i am really lovin&#x27; this moisturizer:) it is light, smells great, and does not leave my skin looking oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more even toned and feels smooth, it has a dewy glow, and my acne scars have even lightened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results and don&#x27;t have no plans to ever use any other brand.</li>
            <li>I had to switch to something new and could never find anything as good until now.</li>
            <li>it is silky and soft and it has sunscreen in it, and a surprisingly pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>and my skin is smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I like the flowery scent and the light texture of the cream.</li>
            <li>and I have light skin</li>
            <li>The reason I love this moisturizer is that I have very oily skin and this moisturizer provides SPF 30 without leaving my face more shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean to toot my own horn or anything, but my skin is really gorgeous!</li>
            <li>My wife was happy with this purchase, Not sure how good the product is, only that my wife is very pleased with it</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve got a \\&quot;knock-out\\&quot; combination to keep your face clear, smooth, moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li>To me it smells like clean soap with a hint of florals.</li>
            <li>I clean my face about 3 times a day and then apply this cream.</li>
            <li>You only need 2 pumps to cover your face and it smells good as well.</li>
            <li>In addition, it makes the face smooth &amp; supple, because it soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Ambi moisturizer because it has made my face feel really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again and would recommend it to my friends and family members as a very good moisturizer for dry to normal</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this moisturizer and definitely do not see myself changing to another anytime soon, if at all!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a moisturizer I&#x27;ve liked and my skin has always had a lot of red tones and blotches, but then I found ambi.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been clear, but now it has more of a glow.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me. :)</li>
            <li>This is a nice facial moisturizer for the winter months.</li>
            <li>And just the right amount sun protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just right for my skin and is working well with the foam face wash.</li>
            <li>It cleared my face right up</li>
            <li>I have dark, combination (mostly oily) skin and most products with sunscreen leave me with an oily, white-tinged (ashy) face.</li>
            <li>It is not thick and does not require blending at all.it works fine</li>
            <li>I agree that this is not super moisturizing but it works great for me because i have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a suitable daily moisturizer...</li>
            <li>I tried this because i needed a good moisturizer to wear under my makeup that would also work to fade my black spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; types of products for moisturizing, and I believe the Ambi works better than most of what I&#x27;ve tried, at least this far into using the product.  </li>
            <li>this leave no whiteness and absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li>pretty even already.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t find this product in your area, please be aware that this moisturiser has an expiration date.</li>
            <li>So if you want to order several at once don&#x27;t buy more than you can finish in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say it diminishes any spots, though, so I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and makes my skin so pretty that makes up for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\</li>
            <li>Love the daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face very greasy and shiny which I didn&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle 6 months ago</li>
            <li>Be consistent with use and you will see&lt;br /&gt;result.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect,and it last most of the day.</li>
            <li>This makes my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It kinda pains me to write a positive review of this product after spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on Obagi #3,4,5.  </li>
            <li>The Ambi moisturizer with sunscreen leaves my face looking fresh and clean, with no white tinge.</li>
            <li>I had large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen to me--</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help with spots or clearing but would buy again.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, enlarged pores and some acne.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t give me an amount as to how much I want to rate a product please.  </li>
            <li>reason I give it 4 stars and not 5, is because I don&#x27;t really notice much evening out of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>As soon as I apply it to my face my hands and face get really oily.</li>
            <li>it leaves it very oily</li>
            <li>This product makes me look very greasy and sweaty.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li>and It really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>In summer it will get the face really shiny because it seems to melt or react to sweat though</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t work at least for me as good</li>
            <li>Does well at evening tone with daily use, which I now do since it doesn&#x27;t have that strong sunscreen smell which I am sensitive to.</li>
            <li>applying this it does leave a slight shine and a very light tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>Had used many different moisturizer before expecting my pores would get somewhat smaller and none of those worked for me at all.</li>
            <li>i have had oily skin for many years, and have had a hard time finding the right one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer, but so far it hasn&#x27;t evened out much.</li>
            <li>I wash twice a day with Ambi foaming facial cleanser, and to \\&quot;smooth and even out\\&quot; my skin complexion, I use the fading cream (a very small amount) once a day, five days a week (and then apply moisturizer on top of fading cream after it absorbs).</li>
            <li>The smell is good personally, smells like melon and lasts for hours but can crash with other perfume scent if used at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>But its very comfortable for an SPF 30 esp compared to other facial spfs.</li>
            <li>After purchasing and using the Ambi daily moisturizer, I started noticing the difference within the first two days of use.</li>
            <li>The cheek area, directly under my eyes is so sensitive!  </li>
            <li>This product helped protect my face from damaging effects of the sun while significantly reducing dark spots I developed from acne.  </li>
            <li>, I think it provides a nice base for make-up, I&#x27;ve gotten very smooth and even coverage after using Ambi</li>
            <li>Glad I found this product, but it seems to be harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Ambi Skin Care Even &amp; Clear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it makes my skin soo soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is not an organic action coming from me to rating products....</li>
            <li>far this moisturiser works for me.</li>
            <li>This rating is a reflection of my extremely sensitive skin, not the product.  </li>
            <li>But if your skin is sensitive switch up products to a creamy wash.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer isn&#x27;t too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>my skin feel so soft and my completion has an even tone look.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 66 years old.  </li>
            <li>my skin soft and</li>
            <li>It came recommended by my doctor after breaking out with adult acne.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I order all of my Ambi products on Amazon, and save money and time because most stores in my city don&#x27;t carry Ambi, or they will just have the fading cream.</li>
            <li>My skin looked so much better, my breakouts were actually diminishing, and the texture was definitely improving from the slight leathery texture my skin was.</li>
            <li>I live in the tropics, so the SPF is a big bonus.</li>
            <li>I also had tiny bumps all over my face that were very noticeable, especially in direct sunlight; the other day i took a picture outside and these tiny bumps have pretty much left</li>
            <li>I have a dry to normal skin pattern on my face</li>
            <li>Ambi Even &amp; Clear Daily moisturizer is the only moisturizer that I use on my skin.</li>

            <li> This is a nice facial moisturizer for the winter months.</li>
            <li> And just the right amount sun protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just right for my skin and is working well with the foam face wash.</li>
            <li> It cleared my face right up</li>
            <li> I have dark, combination (mostly oily) skin and most products with sunscreen leave me with an oily, white-tinged (ashy) face.</li>
            <li> It is not thick and does not require blending at all.it works fine</li>
            <li> I agree that this is not super moisturizing but it works great for me because i have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a suitable daily moisturizer...</li>
            <li> I tried this because i needed a good moisturizer to wear under my makeup that would also work to fade my black spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; types of products for moisturizing, and I believe the Ambi works better than most of what I&#x27;ve tried, at least this far into using the product.  </li>
            <li> this leave no whiteness and absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li> pretty even already.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t find this product in your area, please be aware that this moisturiser has an expiration date.</li>
            <li> So if you want to order several at once don&#x27;t buy more than you can finish in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say it diminishes any spots, though, so I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and makes my skin so pretty that makes up for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\</li>
            <li> Love the daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face very greasy and shiny which I didn&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle 6 months ago</li>
            <li> Be consistent with use and you will see&lt;br /&gt;result.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect,and it last most of the day.</li>
            <li> This makes my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It kinda pains me to write a positive review of this product after spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on Obagi #3,4,5.  </li>
            <li> The Ambi moisturizer with sunscreen leaves my face looking fresh and clean, with no white tinge.</li>
            <li> I had large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen to me--</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help with spots or clearing but would buy again.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, enlarged pores and some acne.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t give me an amount as to how much I want to rate a product please.  </li>
            <li> reason I give it 4 stars and not 5, is because I don&#x27;t really notice much evening out of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> As soon as I apply it to my face my hands and face get really oily.</li>
            <li> it leaves it very oily</li>
            <li> This product makes me look very greasy and sweaty.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> and It really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> In summer it will get the face really shiny because it seems to melt or react to sweat though</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t work at least for me as good</li>
            <li> Does well at evening tone with daily use, which I now do since it doesn&#x27;t have that strong sunscreen smell which I am sensitive to.</li>
            <li> applying this it does leave a slight shine and a very light tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> Had used many different moisturizer before expecting my pores would get somewhat smaller and none of those worked for me at all.</li>
            <li> i have had oily skin for many years, and have had a hard time finding the right one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, but so far it hasn&#x27;t evened out much.</li>
            <li> I wash twice a day with Ambi foaming facial cleanser, and to \\&quot;smooth and even out\\&quot; my skin complexion, I use the fading cream (a very small amount) once a day, five days a week (and then apply moisturizer on top of fading cream after it absorbs).</li>
            <li> The smell is good personally, smells like melon and lasts for hours but can crash with other perfume scent if used at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> But its very comfortable for an SPF 30 esp compared to other facial spfs.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and using the Ambi daily moisturizer, I started noticing the difference within the first two days of use.</li>
            <li> The cheek area, directly under my eyes is so sensitive!  </li>
            <li> This product helped protect my face from damaging effects of the sun while significantly reducing dark spots I developed from acne.  </li>
            <li> , I think it provides a nice base for make-up, I&#x27;ve gotten very smooth and even coverage after using Ambi</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product, but it seems to be harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Ambi Skin Care Even &amp; Clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it makes my skin soo soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is not an organic action coming from me to rating products....</li>
            <li> far this moisturiser works for me.</li>
            <li> This rating is a reflection of my extremely sensitive skin, not the product.  </li>
            <li> But if your skin is sensitive switch up products to a creamy wash.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer isn&#x27;t too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li> my skin feel so soft and my completion has an even tone look.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 66 years old.  </li>
            <li> my skin soft and</li>
            <li> It came recommended by my doctor after breaking out with adult acne.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I order all of my Ambi products on Amazon, and save money and time because most stores in my city don&#x27;t carry Ambi, or they will just have the fading cream.</li>
            <li> My skin looked so much better, my breakouts were actually diminishing, and the texture was definitely improving from the slight leathery texture my skin was.</li>
            <li> I live in the tropics, so the SPF is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> I also had tiny bumps all over my face that were very noticeable, especially in direct sunlight; the other day i took a picture outside and these tiny bumps have pretty much left</li>
            <li> I have a dry to normal skin pattern on my face</li>
            <li> Ambi Even &amp; Clear Daily moisturizer is the only moisturizer that I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ambi&#x27;s Even &amp; Clear facial wash and moisturizer has multiple daily benefits of moisturizing, clearing the dark blemishes and providing a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find at my usual store.</li>
            <li> Considering the bottle is small, it does last a long time and a dime size drop is enough for your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> Daily Moisturizer SPF 30-3oz\\&quot; (long name!)</li>
            <li> Helps clear away black spots and discolourations.</li>
            <li> my face gets extremely dry and i need to put extra lotion on my face</li>
            <li> I have occasional episodes of plague psoriasis on the dry areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it all year long.</li>
            <li> I used it all summer long and never had a skin problem.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t really use this product, my skin is very sensitive and broke out from this product.</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial (of Jamaican and Caucasian descent) and have mixture of oily and dry skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> but you can see the dry skin.</li>
            <li> skin is delicate and oily on my forehead, dry and delicate on my cheeks, and super delicate above my lips, and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well as I have scars from bad acne</li>
            <li> but lately if it is all natural with nothing else</li>
            <li> For me, the use of the product made my skin look oily and shiny by the afternoon which I&#x27;ve been getting from the use of other sunscreen,</li>
            <li> but I will when my other cream runs out....</li>
            <li> I rate it to help other customer</li>
            <li> Why shop any other way?</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month, the ance scarring and hyperpigemnation /discoloratoin I have from an IPL photo facial and jessner peels, is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> product evens some dark areas and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on my cheeks that I want to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if it even fade my dark spots</li>
            <li> Glides over the face without weighing skin down.</li>
            <li> and when i&#x27;m in bad lighting (well i should say really bright, but bad because of how my skin looks in it), the tiny bumps are now only on my forehead and there are only a few!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it starts to feel a little too oily in the summer.</li>
            <li> so I can wear less makeup.</li>
            <li> the bottle is small, but you only need a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the product but it leaves my skin feeling a little dry, I add a small coat of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and my acne scars are lightening up a little bit.</li>
            <li> I applied this product everyday in the morning for about a month.</li>
            <li> My skin had been looking very dull and dry for sometime--for about a year.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with combination/sensitive skin, and the only complaint that I have is that it is a tad greasy, and can be irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past wo days</li>
            <li> I usually have it in my purse for retouch.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product after using Olay SPF 15 moisturizer for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it improved my skin discoloration or acne marks but not as dramatic as I expected.</li>
            <li> it is not oily,or too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and slowly removes the marks and protects skin.</li>
            <li> Too bad for me.</li>
            <li> and I dont even know where it is because i hate it.</li>
            <li> My face breaks out from ambi products and this moisturizer was awful on my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been looking for this product for some time.  This has to be the best skin care moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> I have dark, combination (mostly oily) skin and most products with sunscreen leave me with an oily, white-tinged (ashy) face. The Ambi moisturizer with sunscreen leaves my face looking fresh and clean, with no white tinge. It&#x27;s so great it really doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen to me--I&#x27;m amazed that it provides SPF 30 protection (that&#x27;s the minimum I use). I used to use Neutrogena Ultra-sheer dry-touch sunscreen, which was actually pretty good, but the ingredients were making my eyes burn! I had to switch to something new and could never find anything as good until now. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this product. My only complaint is that it starts to feel a little too oily in the summer.</li>
            <li> This made my face skin feel great.  Didn&#x27;t really help with spots or clearing but would buy again.  Arrive don time</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the product but it leaves my skin feeling a little dry, I add a small coat of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Couple this Ambi Moisturizer with Ambi Fade Soap and you&#x27;ve got a \\&quot;knock-out\\&quot; combination to keep your face clear, smooth, moisturized and healthy!</li>
            <li> Ambi Even &amp; Clear Daily moisturizer is the only moisturizer that I use on my skin. I don&#x27;t mean to toot my own horn or anything, but my skin is really gorgeous! I am bi-racial (of Jamaican and Caucasian descent) and have mixture of oily and dry skin on my face and neck. I wash twice a day with Ambi foaming facial cleanser, and to \\&quot;smooth and even out\\&quot; my skin complexion, I use the fading cream (a very small amount) once a day, five days a week (and then apply moisturizer on top of fading cream after it absorbs). I&#x27;m telling you- this regimen has got to be the greatest thing since biore strips! Seriously, I order all of my Ambi products on Amazon, and save money and time because most stores in my city don&#x27;t carry Ambi, or they will just have the fading cream. Thank you Ambi- thank you Amazon- my skin is so beautiful and happy it is glowing!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I will use on my face. Love the way it moisturizes. I use it all year long.</li>
            <li> this is a good deal for 3 oz spf that also helps your skin. it feels good on the skin. I agree that this is not super moisturizing but it works great for me because i have really oily skin. I blot the oil off my face 5 times a day and it becomes oily again after 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;after applying this it does leave a slight shine and a very light tacky feeling. But its very comfortable for an SPF 30 esp compared to other facial spfs. Its non-greasy and i love the smell. To me it smells like clean soap with a hint of florals. this leave no whiteness and absorbs pretty well. i like that this includes Vitamins C &amp; E. Though i can not say it has evened my skin tone, my skin it pretty even already.&lt;br /&gt;the only CON i have is that this doesn&#x27;t help with shine, it actually adds to the shininess on my face. otherwise, a great SPF moisturizer for OILY SKIN</li>
            <li> This product helped protect my face from damaging effects of the sun while significantly reducing dark spots I developed from acne.  In addition, it makes the face smooth &amp; supple, because it soaks right into the skin.  After using the product for 14 days, my friends noticed the younger &amp; fresher look.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for everyday. It&#x27;s combination of SPF 30 and Vitamin C really helps protect your skin, as well as decrease uneven tone over time. I am Caucasian with combination/sensitive skin, and the only complaint that I have is that it is a tad greasy, and can be irritating. I recommend alternating between this and CeraVe AM for awesome skin!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin so I was looking for a suitable daily moisturizer...Ive been using this for months and Its now part of my daily skin care regime.It doesnt make my face oily and allows my makeup to look flawless..</li>
            <li> It kinda pains me to write a positive review of this product after spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on Obagi #3,4,5.  I have really oily skin, enlarged pores and some acne.  After using this product for about a month, the ance scarring and hyperpigemnation /discoloratoin I have from an IPL photo facial and jessner peels, is hardly noticeable. I use the Obagi SPF 50 sunscreen over it in the AM and Retin-A over it in the PM. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I applied this product everyday in the morning for about a month. For me, the use of the product made my skin look oily and shiny by the afternoon which I&#x27;ve been getting from the use of other sunscreen, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it improved my skin discoloration or acne marks but not as dramatic as I expected. The smell is good personally, smells like melon and lasts for hours but can crash with other perfume scent if used at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is a moisturizer, sunscreen and contains vitamins that can improve skin discoloration all in one. I will continue using it at least for another round of bottle to give more time for evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li> The reason I love this moisturizer is that I have very oily skin and this moisturizer provides SPF 30 without leaving my face more shiny.</li>
            <li> The best face moisturiser with sunscreen ever! Very light in texture. Glides over the face without weighing skin down. No residues. Helps clear away black spots and discolourations. And just the right amount sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me, I love it&#x27;s very lightweight and smells great. I will definitely be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li> Does well at evening tone with daily use, which I now do since it doesn&#x27;t have that strong sunscreen smell which I am sensitive to. Am on my second bottle of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not greasy and it makes my skin soo soft. I used it all summer long and never had a skin problem. I used in conjunction with the ambi even tone face bar and my skin is smooth and even toned. The scent is light and not overpowering at all. Considering the bottle is small, it does last a long time and a dime size drop is enough for your whole face and neck. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> product evens some dark areas and moisturizes.  It is not thick and does not require blending at all.it works fine</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but I will when my other cream runs out....Please don&#x27;t give me an amount as to how much I want to rate a product please.  I rate it to help other customer but when you impose a word limits to accept my comment I feel like this is not an organic action coming from me to rating products....</li>
            <li> This keeps my face moist and is also a sun screen. I am actually seeing a difference in the texture of my face.</li>
            <li> My skin had been looking very dull and dry for sometime--for about a year. I&#x27;ve been trying to find moisturizers that work, but most are too greasy and often times causes my skin to break out. After purchasing and using the Ambi daily moisturizer, I started noticing the difference within the first two days of use. My skin looked so much better, my breakouts were actually diminishing, and the texture was definitely improving from the slight leathery texture my skin was. I also had tiny bumps all over my face that were very noticeable, especially in direct sunlight; the other day i took a picture outside and these tiny bumps have pretty much left and when i&#x27;m in bad lighting (well i should say really bright, but bad because of how my skin looks in it), the tiny bumps are now only on my forehead and there are only a few!!! It&#x27;s been almost a week and I love how my skin is looking! It&#x27;s more even toned and feels smooth, it has a dewy glow, and my acne scars have even lightened. The best part about this moisturizer is that it is also a sunscreen, so now I have a moisturizer in which I don&#x27;t have to lather on a layer of sunscreen on top. I&#x27;m loving this moisturizer and definitely do not see myself changing to another anytime soon, if at all!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a daily moisturiser with SPF that was lightweight enough to wear under make-up. I have some dark spots on my cheeks that I want to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this moisturiser works for me. The handy pump allows you to dose the product well. I love that you can turn the pump to close it, preventing air from reaching the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the moisturiser for about 3 weeks now. My skin feels softer, but so far it hasn&#x27;t evened out much. I like the flowery scent and the light texture of the cream. I live in the tropics, so the SPF is a big bonus. I wear this cream under my make-up (foundation and powder). I clean my face about 3 times a day and then apply this cream. I like this moisturiser and now consider it a staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t find this product in your area, please be aware that this moisturiser has an expiration date. So if you want to order several at once don&#x27;t buy more than you can finish in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5, is because I don&#x27;t really notice much evening out of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tried this because i needed a good moisturizer to wear under my makeup that would also work to fade my black spots. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past wo days but I think today will be my last day. As soon as I apply it to my face my hands and face get really oily. Whe I put it on my nose it leaves it very oily but you can see the dry skin. I won&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work, may work for some, just not for me!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this on my skin. it is silky and soft and it has sunscreen in it, and a surprisingly pleasant scent. A bit Pricy Though.</li>
            <li> I have been using ambi skin care for years and it&#x27;s the only moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried that  doesn&#x27;t break-out my skin. Glad I found it on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find at my usual store.</li>
            <li> This rating is a reflection of my extremely sensitive skin, not the product.  I was so optimistic that I would actually be able to get through a product without any complications.  I like the combination of even and toning and moisturizer.  However, my skin reacted to the product.  The cheek area, directly under my eyes is so sensitive!  Also, time of year is critical for my skin because it changes drastically.  I am going to keep it and try it again in the fall, especially winter.  I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> is lightweight, absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;can be used under makeup.  I usually have it in my purse for retouch. Is a great product ladies!!</li>
            <li> Nice over the counter skin care regimen works effectively... But if your skin is sensitive switch up products to a creamy wash.</li>
            <li> I used to spend alot more money on expensive brand name moisturizers, but find Ambi to do the job just as well for a fraction of the cost. Glad I found this product, but it seems to be harder and harder to find. Hurray for Amazon.</li>
            <li> thanks ambi for this wonderful product</li>
            <li> My wife was happy with this purchase, Not sure how good the product is, only that my wife is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> The moisturizer isn&#x27;t too heavy or too light. It is just right for my skin and is working well with the foam face wash.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin looking healthy and adds a nice glow without being oily.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use on my face. It makes my face feel and even look so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it diminishes any spots, though, so I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and makes my skin so pretty that makes up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is delicate and oily on my forehead, dry and delicate on my cheeks, and super delicate above my lips, and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me break out anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over twenty years. It male my skin feel so soft and my completion has an even tone look.</li>
            <li> I have a dry to normal skin pattern on my face and I&#x27;m 66 years old.  I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Ambi Skin Care Even &amp; Clear Daily Moisturizer SPF 30-3oz\\&quot; (long name!) for about two weeks and I&#x27;m happy with the results I get.  My skin feels really good after applying the moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; types of products for moisturizing, and I believe the Ambi works better than most of what I&#x27;ve tried, at least this far into using the product.  I will buy this product again and would recommend it to my friends and family members as a very good moisturizer for dry to normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I think it provides a nice base for make-up, I&#x27;ve gotten very smooth and even coverage after using Ambi moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\&quot; the savings on shipping, and on gas (from having to drive to town to shop).  The savings make up for any price difference.  Why shop any other way?</li>
            <li> my face gets extremely dry and i need to put extra lotion on my face&lt;br /&gt;I dont even know if this thing works</li>
            <li> I have been using Ambi products since age 50.  My skin is nearly flawless and have no wrinkles at now age 59.  Ambi  products are truly a miracle worker. In my opinion, it is the best skin care product for women of African descent.</li>
            <li> I have used liquid make-up for years until I found this product a couple years ago. It moisturizes my skin without leaving it too oily and it evens out my skin tone so it leaves my skin glowing and natural-looking. It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like using liquid make-up use to do. I love the way my skin feels now. I don&#x27;t feel like I have a mask on my face any more!</li>
            <li> This product makes me look very greasy and sweaty. On top of that, when I sweat it just slides off my face. I have been using it for about 1 1/2 months, and I have yet to see any difference. I can only hope that by the next weeks of or so I will...</li>
            <li> Goes on nice leave my skin soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem i have is dont get it to close to eyes because it irritates</li>
            <li> Love the daily moisturizer.  Have used it for years</li>
            <li> I bought this ages ago and I dont even know where it is because i hate it. My face breaks out from ambi products and this moisturizer was awful on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and I have acne scars. I wanted to try ambi out so I can wear less makeup. I have been using it for a week now and my acne scars are lightening up a little bit. This moisturizer gives your skin a \\&quot;glowing look\\&quot; and the more you use it the better your face looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a moisturizer I&#x27;ve liked and my skin has always had a lot of red tones and blotches, but then I found ambi. All problems are solved, you will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product after using Olay SPF 15 moisturizer for the past 7 years. I live in the desert so my skin is definitely prone to dryness. I decided to try this once the temperatures started rising in Phoenix. It works great! My skin has always been clear, but now it has more of a glow. It has also made my complexion flawless, without the use of any makeup. I have officially converted, and once my Olay cleanser runs out, I am going to try Ambi&#x27;s cleanser as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Ambi moisturizer because it has made my face feel really smooth and soft. I had large pores on my nose. Had used many different moisturizer before expecting my pores would get somewhat smaller and none of those worked for me at all. However, in this short time, 2-3 weeks there is quite a noticeable change. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and don&#x27;t have no plans to ever use any other brand.</li>
            <li> It works very well. I like to use it when I am going out since it does have the SPF. I do worry about some of the ingredients but lately if it is all natural with nothing else it just doesn&#x27;t work at least for me as good so I end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li> Makes your face very greasy and shiny which I didn&#x27;t like! Im sure if it even fade my dark spots</li>
            <li> I have occasional episodes of plague psoriasis on the dry areas of my face.  Ambi&#x27;s Even &amp; Clear facial wash and moisturizer has multiple daily benefits of moisturizing, clearing the dark blemishes and providing a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love the way the lotion feels and smells! And it&#x27;s very lightweight. My skin is sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me. :)</li>
            <li> It came recommended by my doctor after breaking out with adult acne. It cleared my face right up and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!!! I have oily skin and scars from acne. This moisturizer is non greasy and has drastically faded these scars throughout use. I bought my first bottle 6 months ago and I still have some left to use. You only need 2 pumps to cover your face and it smells good as well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial moisturizer for the winter months. I like it however, I don&#x27;t think it has even out my skin. Maybe I need to use it for a bit longer, afterall I&#x27;ve only been using it for over 2 months.</li>
            <li> Ambi makes good moisturizers and creams that does what it says.  Be consistent with use and you will see&lt;br /&gt;result.  This lotion feels so good on your face and is not greasy so it can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. I love the smell as well as I have scars from bad acne and I have light skin and It really cleared up my skin. It has spf as well which is practical!</li>
            <li> i am really lovin&#x27; this moisturizer:) it is light, smells great, and does not leave my skin looking oily. i have had oily skin for many years, and have had a hard time finding the right one. i am so grateful that this product works good and does not make my skin more oily.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my skin;which was dry,but now is balanced.I love the fact that it has 30 SPF in it. it is not oily,or too thick. It is perfect,and it last most of the day. Try it for yourself. I love it.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have used. It&#x27;s creamy and slowly removes the marks and protects skin. Rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or greasy feeling. In summer it will get the face really shiny because it seems to melt or react to sweat though</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great..the bottle is small, but you only need a small amount to get the job done. This makes my face so smooth and soft. I will never use anything else to moisturize my face but this. And it&#x27;s not just for skin of color</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t really use this product, my skin is very sensitive and broke out from this product. Too bad for me.</li>
