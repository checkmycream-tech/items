            <li>I think Rose Essentielle has become my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.  </li>

            <li>THE ROSE</li>
            <li>She thinks it smells nice.</li>
            <li>But I looked it up to make sure it was a good deal...</li>
            <li>But the rose scent mixes well with me.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, umm like rose.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, it is original.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The package came perfectly, cushy wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!</li>
            <li>I first must comment how beautiful the packaging of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>The box is large and beautifully engraved.</li>
            <li>If she likes it, I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li>BVLGARI IS NOW MY FAVORITE PERFUMES.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>and I love this size bottle.</li>
            <li>One of my go to fragances - Love it.</li>
            <li>Would say this is one of the better fragrances from Bvglari.</li>
            <li>Buy it and u will love it.</li>
            <li>As for the perfume itself, it&#x27;s one of my favorite</li>
            <li>Love the price and the shipment was on point....</li>
            <li>I love this smell.  </li>
            <li>but I know I would love it in the perfume.</li>
            <li>Favorite scent and my children are a fan as well.</li>
            <li>I used to love the jasmine from Bvlgari, and now it is also one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful powdery floral scent that is soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>Anyways, definitely a good choice for an older lady who likes to wear perfume!</li>
            <li>, I wanted a nice rose perfume and this was recommended by the SA at Sephora, but I ended up completely hating the scent (and the migraines) and swapped it.</li>
            <li>This has to be the most beautiful scent I have smelled in a long time.</li>
            <li>But it was way too strong, made me sneeze, and gave me a migraine every time i wore it.</li>
            <li>This product does not have the strong aroma of the eau du toilette.</li>
            <li>I dont recall the scent being so lightly scented.</li>
            <li>I am a prime member so shipping was free.</li>
            <li>I smelled this at macys last year after trying to find another rose scent which mimicked the impossible-to-find Chloe Rose Edition.</li>
            <li>I love this scent on me, it&#x27;s very feminine clean, sexy, light but fragrant...</li>
            <li>The main accord is rose, but it also has a citrus note.</li>
            <li>original bottle was given to me and was purchased at a department store..</li>
            <li>I love this scent bought it the first time through a Groupon.  </li>
            <li>Vera Wang Princess, D&amp;G Light Blue, and Versace Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li>Great buy just spent to much for it in Disney World, must better price.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my old fashioned rose water to the Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, not harsh, and long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell so much, and it is cheaper than any store.</li>
            <li>haha :)</li>
            <li>Beautiful, elegant rose scent, not overpowering or old ladyish if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li>However, when you wear it longer, it dries down to this beautiful scent that smells like a bouquet of roses.</li>
            <li>The perfume is florally and quite strong when you first spray it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the proper way to describe it, so probably a light, sweet rose.</li>
            <li>When I ordered Amazon&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;perfume,&amp;#34; I received the &amp;#34;eau de toilette.&amp;#34;  The scent is rosy, but it dissipates quickly within an hour.  </li>
            <li>It has become a new favorite of my Mom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The rose is almost nonexistent after the initial spray.</li>
            <li>I researched rosy fragrances and tried the Bvlgari Rose Essential Perfume at a department store.</li>
            <li>Smells like I&#x27;m relaxing in a vat of freshly cut roses.  </li>
            <li>Nice big bottle.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it smells so good and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li>If you love the fragrance of roses you will love this scent as it is soft, romantic, and perfect for daytime wear since it is not heavy, dramatic, or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It is a subdued fresh light rose scent that is not sweet.</li>
            <li>I started hoarding samples of it last year until I finally found a great deal on it and purchased a full-sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Top notes of vanilla and blackberry give way to a soft, slightly musky rose.</li>
            <li>The main notes are of rose oil (obviously!)</li>
            <li>his words exactly.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Eau de Parfum&amp;#34; is not even Eau de Toilette, I guess it was too much alcohol, and parfum&#x27;s odor fades, It&#x27;s rubbish!....</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Great product but slow delivery</li>
            <li>Delicious scent smells soft and delicate fragance very romantic&lt;br /&gt;is prefect size for the price , come on time too</li>
            <li>This is my favorite I will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li>My favorite Bvlgari scent and an essential in my collection.</li>
            <li>Perfume smelled exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>Instead it is very subtle and probably better suited for younger wearers and is probably a good fit.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and soft.</li>
            <li>Received the product fast.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my daughter in law for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It stays the whole day from like 8am to 6pm of my office hours.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago when I was on the search for a rose perfume, because my Nina Ricci le Paradis was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, with that said, one of the things that makes it so special is that the scent isn&#x27;t heavy or overpowering, so it may just be that after a while my nose becomes accustomed to the scent and doesn&#x27;t smell it as strongly.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light/airy, feminine and classic.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommendation.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance and a little lasts all day</li>
            <li>The fragrance reminded me of an armload of freshly cut tea roses and lasted until my morning shower the next day--almost 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, just different, not as strong or long lasting.</li>
            <li>It is unfortunate that the box and container are very close in size and color to the eau du toilette; not that this product is at all of lesser quality, but more description might be helpful to men like me shopping for a gift (most of us are clueless when it comes to perfumery).</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about this purchase, because I usually do not buy perfume without having smelled it before, but I was pleasantly surprised, and pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend obviously does not either ;)    </li>
            <li>Hey, my grandma&#x27;s a classy lady!</li>
            <li>i am currently running low on original bottle.</li>
            <li>what perfume I should buy for her (she loves to wear perfume but everything she wears is old now), I landed on this.</li>
            <li>It is not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t give me that old lady or young punk smell.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it and it aired away in 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>but it makes me feel old.  </li>
            <li>I find the smell quite pleasant, but it&#x27;s too big for my daughter, she does not often use perfume, next time maybe I will buy smaller, I suggest to buy a small one .</li>
            <li>and I smelled it compared to the original one I had it is not authentic.</li>
            <li>But it soon became so cloying, that I could barely stand to smell it on the bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle is heavy and substantial, packaging done well, and I feel it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Delicate and not too sweet or overpowering --</li>
            <li>It should be noted that this is not a long lasting fragrance, figure about 2 hours unless you get some on your clothes - where the fragrance tends to linger longer but does not stain or ruin the material.</li>

            <li> It stays the whole day from like 8am to 6pm of my office hours.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago when I was on the search for a rose perfume, because my Nina Ricci le Paradis was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, with that said, one of the things that makes it so special is that the scent isn&#x27;t heavy or overpowering, so it may just be that after a while my nose becomes accustomed to the scent and doesn&#x27;t smell it as strongly.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light/airy, feminine and classic.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommendation.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and a little lasts all day</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminded me of an armload of freshly cut tea roses and lasted until my morning shower the next day--almost 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant, just different, not as strong or long lasting.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the box and container are very close in size and color to the eau du toilette; not that this product is at all of lesser quality, but more description might be helpful to men like me shopping for a gift (most of us are clueless when it comes to perfumery).</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about this purchase, because I usually do not buy perfume without having smelled it before, but I was pleasantly surprised, and pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Very classy.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend obviously does not either ;)    </li>
            <li> Hey, my grandma&#x27;s a classy lady!</li>
            <li> i am currently running low on original bottle.</li>
            <li> what perfume I should buy for her (she loves to wear perfume but everything she wears is old now), I landed on this.</li>
            <li> It is not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t give me that old lady or young punk smell.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it and it aired away in 2 seconds.</li>
            <li> but it makes me feel old.  </li>
            <li> I find the smell quite pleasant, but it&#x27;s too big for my daughter, she does not often use perfume, next time maybe I will buy smaller, I suggest to buy a small one .</li>
            <li> and I smelled it compared to the original one I had it is not authentic.</li>
            <li> But it soon became so cloying, that I could barely stand to smell it on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle is heavy and substantial, packaging done well, and I feel it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Delicate and not too sweet or overpowering --</li>
            <li> It should be noted that this is not a long lasting fragrance, figure about 2 hours unless you get some on your clothes - where the fragrance tends to linger longer but does not stain or ruin the material.</li>
            <li> For the record, I am a 29 year old, and unlike some other reviewers, I do not feel that this scent is too \\&quot;old\\&quot; for someone in my age range.  </li>
            <li> However my scent did not last 30 min without becoming faint.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I did notice the fragrance did not last very long on me as a cologne</li>
            <li> #34;What can I lose?&amp;#34; urns out the thing you loose is the fragrance after only an hour.</li>
            <li> Not only was the color faint, compared to the original, the bottle was lighter and the cap was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts quite long for an EDT.</li>
            <li> It lasts long.</li>
            <li> It is such a huge disappointment .</li>
            <li> I am unable to smell it on myself after a few hours, but I receive so many compliments on it, even 6-8 hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being a perfume under $50, I was afraid it might smell cheap, like perfumes at mass-merchants that smell like toilet bowl cleaner.</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviewers who describe this scent as chemical, bathroom air freshener, etc.</li>
            <li> Other perfumes that I use/like for reference:</li>
            <li> I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST</li>
            <li> Maybe later when I hit my late 30s</li>
            <li> I had some trouble using the tracker, but other than that, I received my bottle in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have tried Bvlgari in a few years.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> When I was running out I checked Amazon price and per usual it was cheaper than any</li>
            <li> at least not yet.  </li>
            <li> Feminine and delicate.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle not over powering.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate I&#x27;m old</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I was at the store and the man behind me said &amp;#34;you smell so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Disappointing the scent practically rubs off.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does have a beautiful smell, and as a fan of rose and Bvlgari I thought &amp;#34;What can I lose?&amp;#34; urns out the thing you loose is the fragrance after only an hour. Disappointing the scent practically rubs off.</li>
            <li> I liked this..in the store. But it soon became so cloying, that I could barely stand to smell it on the bottle. The scent neeeever dies, it stays with you all day, which is great if i liked it. But it was way too strong, made me sneeze, and gave me a migraine every time i wore it. I couldn&#x27;t remember why i ever bought it, I wanted a nice rose perfume and this was recommended by the SA at Sephora, but I ended up completely hating the scent (and the migraines) and swapped it. PS I agree with some other reviewers who describe this scent as chemical, bathroom air freshener, etc. The rose is almost nonexistent after the initial spray. :/</li>
            <li> If she likes it, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I started hoarding samples of it last year until I finally found a great deal on it and purchased a full-sized bottle.  It&#x27;s light/airy, feminine and classic.  When I asked my boyfriend to smell it, he said it smelled \\&quot;sensuous\\&quot;, his words exactly.  For the record, I am a 29 year old, and unlike some other reviewers, I do not feel that this scent is too \\&quot;old\\&quot; for someone in my age range.  My boyfriend obviously does not either ;)    I think Rose Essentielle has become my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; scent.  I do wish that it would last a bit longer though. For me, it begins to fade after 4-6 hours of regular wear.  However, with that said, one of the things that makes it so special is that the scent isn&#x27;t heavy or overpowering, so it may just be that after a while my nose becomes accustomed to the scent and doesn&#x27;t smell it as strongly.      Regardless, it is a beautiful perfume and if you are a fan of roses, as I am, you will love this as well.</li>
            <li> It smells real good and was an awesome price. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Eau de Parfum&amp;#34; is not even Eau de Toilette, I guess it was too much alcohol, and parfum&#x27;s odor fades, It&#x27;s rubbish!....you cheat me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Send me my money back!!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous scent! Delicate and not too sweet or overpowering -- yet it lasts from the morning into the night. My favorite perfume of all time. Great packaging, shipping and arrival on time.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my grandmother. After researching for a couple of hours what perfume I should buy for her (she loves to wear perfume but everything she wears is old now), I landed on this. Several reviews for this included the fact that it was for a &amp;#34;classy lady&amp;#34;. Hey, my grandma&#x27;s a classy lady! I bought it...and she loves it!! And it honestly smells great! The main notes are of rose oil (obviously!) but there&#x27;s a sweeter element to it as well. I don&#x27;t know the proper way to describe it, so probably a light, sweet rose. Anyways, definitely a good choice for an older lady who likes to wear perfume!</li>
            <li> BVLGARI IS NOW MY FAVORITE PERFUMES. ANY KIND THAT I HAVE TRIED, LOVE.THANK YOU! THE ROSE AS TRULY GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. So feminine. It is great and smells wonderful and I love this size bottle. It looks so pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li> One of my go to fragances - Love it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing perfume, not cologne. There is a big difference in the way it smells. It is not unpleasant, just different, not as strong or long lasting.</li>
            <li> I researched rosy fragrances and tried the Bvlgari Rose Essential Perfume at a department store. The fragrance reminded me of an armload of freshly cut tea roses and lasted until my morning shower the next day--almost 24 hours.  When I ordered Amazon&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;perfume,&amp;#34; I received the &amp;#34;eau de toilette.&amp;#34;  The scent is rosy, but it dissipates quickly within an hour.  I prefer my old fashioned rose water to the Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> If you love the fragrance of roses you will love this scent as it is soft, romantic, and perfect for daytime wear since it is not heavy, dramatic, or overwhelming.  It should be noted that this is not a long lasting fragrance, figure about 2 hours unless you get some on your clothes - where the fragrance tends to linger longer but does not stain or ruin the material. The bottle is heavy and substantial, packaging done well, and I feel it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mum. My wife is also a convert. Nice fragrance, not harsh, and long-lasting scent. Arrived promptly. Would say this is one of the better fragrances from Bvglari. Excellent value and well priced</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells so good and the scent is long lasting. When u wash ur clothes u still get smell it. I get complements from this fragrance. Buy it and u will love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago when I was on the search for a rose perfume, because my Nina Ricci le Paradis was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found this perfume sooner! It smells wonderful! Top notes of vanilla and blackberry give way to a soft, slightly musky rose. I am unable to smell it on myself after a few hours, but I receive so many compliments on it, even 6-8 hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being a perfume under $50, I was afraid it might smell cheap, like perfumes at mass-merchants that smell like toilet bowl cleaner. Imagine my surprise when it smelled better than my $120 bottle of Penhaligon&#x27;s! Don&#x27;t let the low price mislead you. It is definitely a &#x27;high-class&#x27; scent at a &#x27;down-home&#x27; price.</li>
            <li> The delivery of the perfume was awesome. I had some trouble using the tracker, but other than that, I received my bottle in a timely manner. The perfume itself is AMAZING! It is the perfect rosy scent in my opinion. The rose fragrance is light and flirty, and the blackberry undertones are pleasant! I was a little apprehensive about this purchase, because I usually do not buy perfume without having smelled it before, but I was pleasantly surprised, and pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Received the product fast. As for the perfume itself, it&#x27;s one of my favorite so I already knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast. The packaging was perfect. As for the perfume, this is an Eau de Toilette. The main accord is rose, but it also has a citrus note. It smells sweet and soft.</li>
            <li> I first must comment how beautiful the packaging of this perfume. The box is large and beautifully engraved. Now onto the perfume. The perfume is florally and quite strong when you first spray it. However, when you wear it longer, it dries down to this beautiful scent that smells like a bouquet of roses. It lasts quite long for an EDT. I only have to reapply the perfume, when I go out for the night. Other perfumes that I use/like for reference: Vera Wang Princess, D&amp;G Light Blue, and Versace Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li> It is perfume. My wife picked it.She thinks it smells nice. Works for me. What else can I say. -Mk</li>
            <li> I find the smell quite pleasant, but it&#x27;s too big for my daughter, she does not often use perfume, next time maybe I will buy smaller, I suggest to buy a small one .</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in the product. i am currently running low on original bottle. Not only was the color faint, compared to the original, the bottle was lighter and the cap was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original bottle was given to me and was purchased at a department store..the price was never  an issue..but the quality is. NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Love the price and the shipment was on point....</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent and lovely bottle!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Mom and she loved it! The bottle was beautiful and the fragrance is lovely. The only downside is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long. It is a beautiful powdery floral scent that is soft and feminine. It has become a new favorite of my Mom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells like I&#x27;m relaxing in a vat of freshly cut roses.  I love this smell.  Was recommended by a friend.  It lasts long. Don&#x27;t have to re-apply.  Nice big bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter requested this fragrance for her birthday. She has purchased this several times and loves it. After she opened it I tried it myself. Very, very nice ! My husband like it too. I did notice the fragrance did not last very long on me as a cologne but I know I would love it in the perfume.</li>
            <li> Great buy just spent to much for it in Disney World, must better price.  Beside the perfume is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product but slow delivery</li>
            <li> I smelled this at macys last year after trying to find another rose scent which mimicked the impossible-to-find Chloe Rose Edition. I dont recall the scent being so lightly scented. It is a subdued fresh light rose scent that is not sweet. However my scent did not last 30 min without becoming faint. If you like reapplying and spritzing throughout the day,  buy this EDT/eau de toilette.  If you prefer to spray once and have it last then opt for the EDP/eau de parfum. I prefer the latter.</li>
            <li> I love this scent bought it the first time through a Groupon.  When I was running out I checked Amazon price and per usual it was cheaper than any where else. I am a prime member so shipping was free.</li>
            <li> I love the smell so much, and it is cheaper than any store. I highly recommendation. This price of this perfume is deserve.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter in law for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. But of course, it&#x27;s Bvlgari after all!</li>
            <li> This product does not have the strong aroma of the eau du toilette. Instead it is very subtle and probably better suited for younger wearers and is probably a good fit. It is unfortunate that the box and container are very close in size and color to the eau du toilette; not that this product is at all of lesser quality, but more description might be helpful to men like me shopping for a gift (most of us are clueless when it comes to perfumery).</li>
            <li> buen producto, con buena ropa, con buen tranporte, envio gratuito y rapido, atentos cuando se les pregunto... lo recomiendo. luis</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this perfume on Groupon WITHOUT ever smelling it!!! But I looked it up to make sure it was a good deal...THIS IS THE BEST PERFUME EVER!!! I love this scent on me, it&#x27;s very feminine clean, sexy, light but fragrant...I get A LOT of compliments on it even after I don&#x27;t smell it anymore. I will continue to buy this perfume forever....I love love love it!</li>
            <li> llego en perfectas condiciones y es excelente perfume, buen olor, ademas de economico, lo volveria a comprar si es necesario</li>
            <li> I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BUT WHEN MY PARFUM ARRIVED I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE SCENT AND MY HUSBAND LOOOOOOVES IT AS WELL....</li>
            <li> This fragrance really is very nice.  I have tried Bvlgari in a few years.  But the rose scent mixes well with me.</li>
            <li> Favorite scent and my children are a fan as well. It is not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t give me that old lady or young punk smell. Very classy.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Beautiful, elegant rose scent, not overpowering or old ladyish if you know what I mean.  Don&#x27;t hate I&#x27;m old but I don&#x27;t have to smell like it.</li>
            <li> So light and floral - it&#x27;s wonderful. Wonderful in all seasons. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The package came perfectly, cushy wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, it is original.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume.based one the reviews. When I got it and I smelled it compared to the original one I had it is not authentic. I sprayed it and it aired away in 2 seconds. It is such a huge disappointment .</li>
            <li> Delicious scent smells soft and delicate fragance very romantic&lt;br /&gt;is prefect size for the price , come on time too</li>
            <li> This is my favorite I will definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> I got the sample of this perfume.  It smells nice, umm like rose.  I sprayed it on the upper part of my chest and my wrists.  It stays the whole day from like 8am to 6pm of my office hours.  Smells beautifully but it makes me feel old.  I&#x27;m 24 and I don&#x27;t think this perfume is for me ... at least not yet.  Maybe later when I hit my late 30s haha :)</li>
            <li> Feminine and delicate.  My favorite Bvlgari scent and an essential in my collection.</li>
            <li> Always love Bvlgari!!!! including all the perfumes. I used to love the jasmine from Bvlgari, and now it is also one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Everytime I spray perfume the nozzle leaks</li>
            <li> This has to be the most beautiful scent I have smelled in a long time. It is subtle not over powering. I was at the store and the man behind me said &amp;#34;you smell so good&amp;#34;. That is the best compliment. You have got to try this perfume, you will be hooked from the start!!</li>
            <li> My signature signature scent I&#x27;ve worn for years now. Happy with this seller. Perfume smelled exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> excellent product and excellent shipping ... thank you very much</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and a little lasts all day</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
