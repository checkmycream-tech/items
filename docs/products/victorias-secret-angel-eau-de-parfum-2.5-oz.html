            <li>i love it, tried in the store and stayed on my hoody for like a week after only a couple spritz.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a perfume I like. There are only 2 fragrances as of right now I enjoy enough I could wear every day, and this is one of them. The other, is [[ASIN:B000C1UCYG Pure Poison By Christian Dior]]. Angel is the exact opposite of my other all time favorite, it&#x27;s light and delicate. It&#x27;s my favorite summertime fragrance, since it&#x27;s not heavy or overpowering. It&#x27;s made from sparkling plum, sheer violet and amber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is stunning. Very large (even more so than I though it would be), it seems to last forever. I have been wearing this perfume almost every day for 3 months and I&#x27;ve barely gone though a small portion of it. It&#x27;s a beautiful heavy glass bottle with large opaque wings wings on the back of it. The spritzer works perfectly and dispenses just the right amount. The whole perfume bottle itself looks beautiful and extremely unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing and lasts forever, this perfume is one of my all time favorites!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters birthday this month.  I was really suprised how quickly it was received being that it is Christmas time.  My daughter has not opened it yet.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It&#x27;s not too floral and it&#x27;s not overwhelming. And it has staying power. I&#x27;ve never really smelled another perfume like it.</li>
            <li> i cannot wait for valentines day this year just so my boyfriend can get this for me ;) i love it, tried in the store and stayed on my hoody for like a week after only a couple spritz. a sweet hint of pink grapefruit and my boyfriend agreed it was delish!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter so she will stop using mine! Shipping great, fast and product awesome!!!! And the price was the best!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by VS and a much better deal than getting it from the actual VS store!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother... well, I did not get a feedback, so either she likes it or have returned it..... no news is good news, right???</li>
            <li> Received order fast, in plenty for our Christmas.  Very pleased with value for the money,  best value that I found for same item.</li>
            <li> There is another vic sec angel that is the Italian version and smells very very good, floral.  This is NOT it.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear this fantastic perfume! This is one of my top 3 scents by far!</li>
            <li> This perfume was worn by a student in a class I am taking and I fell in love with the fresh scent. I really like using this perfume and it will be one of my favorites from now on.  The beautiful bottle is a plus also!</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing!!!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a year now and can&#x27;t be without it.  It last all day and I get compliments every time I wear it.  My boyfriend loves it!!</li>
            <li> The budget was tight this Christmas, and we had a limited budget for everyone.  Well, this perfume is my son&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s favorite, but when I saw it at Victoria&#x27;s Secret, I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  I looked on Amazon for \\&quot;the heck of it\\&quot;, and there it was.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price!!!  I bought it right away.  I was impressed with how quickly it was shipped, and even more so, with how it was packed wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap to protect it!  Great buy and great seller!!!</li>
            <li> The best Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfume EVER! I love the way it smells on me and it stays on me and my clothes all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent . Satisfied with the product. Thank you very much</li>
