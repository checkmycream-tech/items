            <li>, I have no complaints,  it was delivered on time and the color is awesome.....</li>
            <li>It works perfect.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really, really nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it....</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 12 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will work for me.</li>
            <li>This straightener is okay.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money this costs, I would suggest investing in a better hair straightener because this one doesn&#x27;t do the job that well for me</li>
            <li>Love the item.</li>
            <li>It heats evenly and gets extremely hot so works good for me.</li>
            <li>It does work nicely with my hair and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Materials seem to be a little cheap but works perfectly</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect different settings and really like it</li>
            <li>I love how fast it arrived at my house and it straightens</li>
            <li>really well i love it.</li>
            <li>I do not have any problems with this item even though I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>When I received this flat iron, I was excited!!</li>
            <li>I found that my hair got caught under the pads so the iron is pretty much unusable.</li>
            <li>I really like this item</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that will lie on my head like a pancake if I don&#x27;t try anything with it, and I found that using this straightener on the lowest heat setting is helpful for providing a little bit of curl at the bottom of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like the 1-inch flat irons better than the 1 3/4 flat irons.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak about thick hair, but this straightener is fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>Pink is my absolute fave color.</li>

            <li> I did not like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other flat irons that did not do this, so I will not be using this flat iron again.</li>
            <li> It was chipping and splitting around the heat plates, the whole flat iron gets hot while you&#x27;re trying to curl your hair and it has a terrible smell when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try to use it again until it was too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> My hair kept getting caught in the grooves at the base of the flat iron plates, and pulled my hair out.  </li>
            <li> When I took it out the package, I became disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not work, crap straightener.</li>
            <li> Should get a refund for this chunk of worthless plastic that does nothing.</li>

            <li> I found that my hair got caught under the pads so the iron is pretty much unusable.</li>
            <li> I used this one time.  It quit working after one use.  I bought it as a back up, so I didn&#x27;t try to use it again until it was too late to return it.  Now I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect different settings and really like it</li>
            <li> It heats evenly and gets extremely hot so works good for me.</li>
            <li> When I received this flat iron, I was excited!! When I took it out the package, I became disappointed. It was chipping and splitting around the heat plates, the whole flat iron gets hot while you&#x27;re trying to curl your hair and it has a terrible smell when you turn it on. I just threw it away..</li>
            <li> It does work nicely with my hair and arrived quickly. I do not have any problems with this item even though I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Very nice. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it arrived at my house and it straightens + curls really well i love it. i would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Hi, I just got the straightener today. I haven&#x27;t used it yet. But, I&#x27;m going to tonight. It&#x27;s really, really nice. Pink is my absolute fave color. I already have a hair straightener now. but, I&#x27;m gonna get rid of it. I&#x27;m sure it will work for me. I like the 1-inch flat irons better than the 1 3/4 flat irons.</li>
            <li> I really like this item, I have no complaints,  it was delivered on time and the color is awesome..... I&#x27;m loving it....</li>
            <li> Convenient for the price. It works perfect. Materials seem to be a little cheap but works perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought this to put some shape into my hair.  I have very fine hair that will lie on my head like a pancake if I don&#x27;t try anything with it, and I found that using this straightener on the lowest heat setting is helpful for providing a little bit of curl at the bottom of my hair.  Can&#x27;t speak about thick hair, but this straightener is fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 12 year old daughter</li>
            <li> This straightener is okay. The plates are kinda greasy feeling and it&#x27;s small so it takes longer to straighten my hair. For the amount of money this costs, I would suggest investing in a better hair straightener because this one doesn&#x27;t do the job that well for me</li>
            <li> I did not like this flat iron.  My hair kept getting caught in the grooves at the base of the flat iron plates, and pulled my hair out.  I&#x27;ve used other flat irons that did not do this, so I will not be using this flat iron again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the prompt service.  Love the item.</li>
            <li> Does not work, crap straightener. Never again will I buy one. Should get a refund for this chunk of worthless plastic that does nothing. Also my hair keeps getting stuck like under the plates or something.</li>
