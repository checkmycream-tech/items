            <li>Good brand.</li>
            <li>My frizz is gone and my hair never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I used the babliss before for years which I loved</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been told by my hairdresser that if you want a good hair dryer, you should be prepared to spend around the $100+ mark.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a really good hair dryer</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>I found the best deal on Amazon.com and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It works great and drys your hair quickly!!  </li>
            <li>It looks so much more beautiful and shiny and healthy and all I changed was the dryer!</li>
            <li>love my dryer its a great dryer for a great price, am a hairdresser and love it.</li>
            <li>As far as I know and have experienced, this is one of the best dryers on the market.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer for my daughter because she loved using mine so much - it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>it is WAY better than the T3 and Sedu dryers!</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say it again, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This dryer was recommended by my hairdresser, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product, but if you do purchase it, make sure you register it!</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 Supersolano&#x27;s because I LOVE the dryer but wish they held up!</li>
            <li>It better not break!</li>
            <li>My hair came out shiny and smooth and laid beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and I am so pleased!  </li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>That said, the blowdryer worked just fine, and I was happy with it until it broke after just 5 months.</li>
            <li>This dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>an amazing decision.  </li>
            <li>My hair drying time is greatly reduced, by hair looks smoother, shinier and frizz is eliminated... fabulous hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I already own one and needed another.  </li>
            <li>The best part is I no longer need to use my straightening iron because this does such a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dryer does have a nice, sturdy cord that looks as though it&#x27;s resistant to curling up and tangling (a nice feature).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for that kind of dryer I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I asked my new stylist what he thinks and he recommended this $250 Solano that he sells, and then went on and on about why Solano is awesome</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li>I have had my Super Solano since 1984 and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>One of the most reliable products I own.</li>
            <li>My old SuperSolano (purchased in 2001) provided excellent service throughout its working lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer, it works spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I paid a fortune for it then, but it was the best investment I ever made in a professional tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent build quality, very quiet (important if you want to preserve your precious hearing) and great performance.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS HUGE!</li>
            <li>Great power, heat &amp; good direction with the 3 different attachments...</li>
            <li>The product works ok, and it should, for $85.00.</li>
            <li>This is actually one of the best hair dryers on the market.</li>
            <li>Top stylists use and love it.</li>
            <li>When my favorite dryer in the world died--Hai brand--</li>
            <li>After 9 months I&#x27;m still pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>OK, if you&#x27;re convinced I&#x27;m a spendthrift, get this: I&#x27;m buying another one for travel.</li>
            <li>but I certainly don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>A multi-millionaire who did many of the repairs and shipping himself.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just ok product for the price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what this would be like, re heat, choices and weight.  </li>
            <li>No nasty chemical smells that take 15 uses to burn off.  </li>
            <li>It is also quieter than most blowdryers.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>The most power I&#x27;ve had in any hairdryer.</li>
            <li>So keep ahold of it and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer-</li>
            <li>so, yes it&#x27;s going to be more substantial, but the weight doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I can honestly recommend this dryer to another who wants a good substantial product.  </li>
            <li>both my husband and I fell in love with it, so purchased one for home.</li>
            <li>My wife and my two daughters love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>They had many drawbacks including noise, gyroscopic torque and sucking hair into the air intake.</li>
            <li>Solano is always a sure bet for quality..</li>
            <li>This works great and is much cheaper online compared to buying it at Ulta.</li>
            <li>The consistent flow of air this hair dryer has is amazing!</li>
            <li>Not to mention my hair looks beyond shinny, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Great dryer and really fast service.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I love this hair dyer and recommended it to  my friends.  </li>
            <li>but I may love this one more.</li>
            <li>but I am sure I&#x27;ll acclimate to it.  </li>
            <li>But I love the way my hair looks</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad for them to have the $$ given the guidance they gave me.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best hair dryer on the market.  </li>
            <li>but with that said, may be better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>but it was better than ever -</li>
            <li>I love this and wish I would&#x27;ve figured this one out years ago.  </li>
            <li>love the warrenty on them to</li>
            <li>I just could not comprehend why I needed to spend more that $20.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We couldn&#x27;t be more excited to own this dryer.</li>
            <li>glad to see they are still available.</li>
            <li>The Super Solano is still the best, longest lasting hair dryer ever</li>
            <li>I came right home and ordered my own.  </li>
            <li>Not bad!  </li>
            <li>lots of power, easy settings and substantially constructed.  </li>
            <li>The placement of the controls make it easy to change temperature when I want but not accidentally.</li>
            <li>My hair dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are because it&#x27;s easy to switch settings while holding it.</li>
            <li>Dries your hair very quickly without burning.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>When it did work, I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer about a month ago and my drying time had been cut for about half the time and the best part is that it leaves it shinny....</li>
            <li>but I bought a TwinTurbo at a Beauty Supply shop who said they didn&#x27;t carry Super Solano any more.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly without damaging; leaves hair looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer, but wished control buttons were located in different spot.  </li>
            <li>I had to return for an exchange and fortunately the replacement was shipped correctly.  </li>
            <li>I still cannot get over how smooth my hair is, almost like I used a straightening iron -</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Then I picked up this dryer, my new best friend, my secret weapon, my happy place...</li>
            <li>Great for all types of hair especially harder to manage &amp; you need a good blow dryer to get it straight.  </li>
            <li>I love that it never gets too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>She had this Supersolano and from the first time I used it I noticed that my fine hair looked so much shinier and healthy than ever before - like when you leave the salon!  </li>
            <li>As others have stated this is a professional hair dryer that will last years and provide superb performance.  </li>
            <li>( you got to keep the filer clean ).  </li>
            <li>I go to clean the lint filter, and there&#x27;s nothing in it.</li>
            <li>With this blow dryer, I am able to achieve a smooth straight finish for my hair every time.</li>
            <li>Nice to buy from your stylist so they can get a cut and stay in business, but this one was such a better deal</li>
            <li>He recommended the Solano &amp; he was right on!</li>
            <li>good news is that these units can be fixed at the factory for a very reasonable price...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not too loud, which is nice</li>
            <li>Seriously the BEST hairdryer there is.</li>
            <li>It drys well and quickly.</li>
            <li>Quickly dries hair.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>As I said I have fine hair follicles at a normal density and my end split easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dryer, super loud and drys really really fast.  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I quickly purchased it.</li>
            <li>The noise level is acceptable and does not have that high pitched humm that many of them do.  </li>
            <li>So, I did some research on Solano and other brands, and this seemed by far the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They say this lasts a long time so if you&#x27;re going to buy a dryer, go ahead and get a good one.</li>
            <li>I love my new knife, but am still getting use to it.</li>
            <li>I had a Solano about 30 years ago that lasted a very long time and have not found another one as good since then</li>
            <li>been in the entertainment business for over 24 years, and needed a product that would cut my drying time in half, and leave my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Received item long ago and its perfect, well made and will last another 18 years, probably longer since I no longer travel for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick hair!</li>
            <li>Solano seems to be used in many high end salons, which is where I first discovered it.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer works fast and my hair hair came out really smooth.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these from a Sally&#x27;s beauty salon a few years ago and it was great.</li>
            <li>This dryer dries my hair fast and leave it feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>buy it, it is worth</li>
            <li>So, although the inconvenience of damaged shipment and return, it is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if attachments were included but was pleasantly surprised to receive them.  </li>
            <li>I advise you getting one, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>The workings of the dryer rarely break  as a result of a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s durable, powerful, and even though it&#x27;s powerful it&#x27;s weight is not an issue even after blow drying for a while.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My daughter was using mine often and finally asked for one of her own.</li>
            <li>I had borrowed a friends Supersolano on a few occasions and liked it so much I bought my own.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and works as well today as the day I bought it two years ago.</li>
            <li>Its kind of a love/hate relationship actually.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Long cord is good for salons but bit big for home unless you like being able to move around while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>It Works with the right heat and leave no freeze</li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdryer, at my stylist&#x27;s recommendation and I could see the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Learning a new tool can be fun and rewarding, but when it comes to hair, I really want my trusted tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this hair dryer very strong, hair get dry quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much and the volume stays true.</li>
            <li>Nice, long cord.</li>
            <li>But the super is the one she really was looking for 1800 watts.</li>
            <li>I love the super long cord on this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly it dries my hair and the long cord.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries very fast with this-</li>
            <li>Smooth drying, easy to use, does not overheat you or or bathroom, effective and fast to dry long hair.</li>
            <li>Most hairdressers will tell you the same thing.</li>
            <li>This is well worth your money, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It blows hot air.</li>
            <li>I first tried a Rusk dryer which was aweful</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>After using this dryer my hair was left brittle and frizzy (and I happen to have healthy hair).</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t ear-piercing loud like the cheap hair dryer I was using until this one arrived.</li>
            <li>Everyone has noticed a big difference on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>The first one I owned lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li>Get the red one, so cute.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about a year, then just stopped working.</li>
            <li>and I learned this is a consistent problem with the Ultra Chi.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve had the first for years.</li>
            <li>The air didn&#x27;t get all that hot</li>
            <li>I bought the first one based on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>One of the best in the market and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li>Surely the company has updated it several times over the years.</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago my favorite chefs knife broke recently, after 20 years of use.</li>
            <li>Super long cord makes it so easy too.</li>
            <li>Wow - this is one special dryer.  </li>
            <li>and now I have a new hair dryer I&#x27;m expecting to last 7+ years easily with mild self cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never found better.</li>
            <li>the super Solano is very powerful and I like the long cord.</li>
            <li>However, I was happy to find the same model, same handle, same settings, shape, and size was still being made, and being sold right here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would be nice if they  made a slightly shorter cord</li>
            <li>I started beauty school in 1985 and this dryer was recommended buy a fellow student and 27 years later it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have really thick fine hair and this drier dries my hair quickly as leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li>I have gone through a lot of hair dryers in my time and finally realized I would need a good quality one to dry my hair quicker and not fry my hair.</li>
            <li>I like that it has so many different settings from cool and low speed to high speed and hot.  </li>
            <li>Doent get too hot like many other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; dryers.</li>
            <li>I had my last Super Solano for 10 years!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good alternative between cheap blow dryers you&#x27;d buy at Target and the really expensive salon ones.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast.  </li>
            <li>and I have never come across a dryer that damaged my hair as much as the SuperSolano did.</li>
            <li>I looked at others that were twice as much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think a dryer would make that much of a difference in the health, style and look of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I looked at $80.00 dryers, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be much difference between a $20.00 dryer and an $80.00 dryer.  </li>
            <li>It has only basic functions, but joy, they actually work.  </li>
            <li>I never knew there could be this much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I never knew there was really a difference -</li>
            <li>It dries my hair really fast.  </li>
            <li>When traveling, I can really tell the difference when I have to use the hotel&#x27;s hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t that the whole point?  </li>
            <li>Really likes it</li>
            <li>Hair shines and feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>Includes two accessories for drying straight hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much smoother;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my hairdryer to be ridiculously hot, but I need more heat than this one offers to dry my hair within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Okay product but gave it 3 stars because it is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this hairdryer, but it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the heat and speed functions work really well, and my hair is generally smooth after a blow dry.</li>
            <li>I bought my Super Solano in the early 90&#x27;s when I was a working professional.</li>
            <li>After 2 years of loving my Hai, I expected quality of all these other high end dryers would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Second, it makes my hair look terrific (shiny and healthy).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a super solano before but a slightly different one.  </li>
            <li>I have a thick head full of straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>After years of use, abuse (dropping it, loaning it out), traveling around the nation and world, my super solano finally quit working yesterday.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself feels nice and solid- not plasticy cheap like my other ones, and so I was worried my arm would hurt after holding it up too long-</li>
            <li>Also, it has a really long cord, which is good for me because I tend to sit down away from the plug while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately despite 3-4 day a week use it has lasted and i&#x27;ve never had a single problem with it.</li>
            <li>I was able to cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half (to 10 minutes) because it&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this high performance hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Its a high powered Hair dryer that is used by professionals.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this  product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>but I think this is because of its high quality.</li>
            <li>highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>A honest and hard working man.</li>
            <li>I love the extra long cord for getting to the other side of my chair easily.</li>
            <li>This unit is often seen in professional salons and really does the job.</li>
            <li>I ordered it through Amazon, as it was about 25% off the normal retail price.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and durable and quiet.  </li>
            <li>These are powerful machines that last for years and years!</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s worth all the extra money</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t really get that hot -</li>
            <li>The only negative might be that it&#x27;s pretty heavy, so it&#x27;s not the best for travelling.  </li>
            <li>Powerful with multiple settings.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful; yet quiet.</li>
            <li>This cost much less than at my local salon and arrived much faster than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li>With the Super Solano, I only had to use the oil before as it looked soft and shiny after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep thinking that it can&#x27;t be that hard to make a good dryer, especially when that&#x27;s one of the main purposes of your company.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer for professional use!</li>
            <li>it look like the motor was stock, and it was brand new..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to the \\&quot;new and improved version.\\</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d go for something new.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new hair dryer for my vacation home.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; blow-dryer almost every year ($25-60)-</li>
            <li>After 10 years I needed a new one</li>
            <li>This is how I feel about my new knife, learning all over again, and this is how I would have felt if I had to purchased an updated model of the Supersolano.</li>
            <li>While this one is pretty powerful (the airflow is very strong), it left my hair very tangled and difficult to brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used drugstore $30 blowdryers &amp; then last month I asked my hairstylist what professional blowdyer was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>They are on the handle like other dryers but they sit right where your fingers rest, making it easy to inadvertently change it to a lower setting when moving it around to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer works well (and very fast) for my low maintenance hair.</li>
            <li>I will buy again in future, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>And she has very thick hair, so she was very pleased.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s me after blow drying my long hair with the Super Solano 1875 Professional Dryer (bought 2012 around $130): \\&quot;Whoa....</li>
            <li>BTW, I have short hair, so it didn&#x27;t have that much use!</li>
            <li>while my other dryer the T3 is supposed to have better ratings but simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well.  </li>
            <li>(I previously owned a cheap Revlon).</li>
            <li>I would caution you that it is a tad heavy and the on/off and temperature control buttons are easy to hit when you are holding it.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about spending this much money on a hair dryer but this one really delivers a strong consistent air flow.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to flat iron hair as much with this!</li>
            <li>Results were not immediate, but after the first week my fine graying hair is much smoother, less staticky, and much less fly-a-way.</li>
            <li>A little heavy because of the really good motor</li>
            <li>I have had mine for 10 years and its still alive and well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone because its not heavy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a professional blow dryer</li>
            <li>I had to get rid of my old solano bc</li>
            <li>When I tearfully confessed that I was thinking of going to my natural hair color</li>
            <li>No wonder all of the professional stylists use it.</li>
            <li>I got this hair dryer to replace my old T3 that died.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s professional quality</li>
            <li>It was like losing an old friend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Overall, I like it so much I ordered another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>and after a year they either seem to lose power or just break completely.  </li>
            <li>Works as promised - no frizz - dries my medium long frizzy hair fast!  </li>
            <li>This dryer will get your hair completely dryer while also making your hair look saloon quality.</li>
            <li>Supersolano 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Dryer.  </li>
            <li>It takes several months even years to really get use to a product.</li>
            <li>I never had a professional dryer before &amp; was a bit nervous putting out the $$</li>
            <li>It has several different settings and is really powerful.  </li>
            <li>More expensive than some, but  the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the prize I spent.</li>
            <li>YOU SOLANO for keeping it the same, making strong, long lasting dependable products!&lt;br</li>
            <li>In short, I hope this dryer lasts forever, and even if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m going right back to Solano for another.</li>
            <li>This one however is nowhere near as powerful as the other one.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of heat/speed settings and the temperature remains consistent while you dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>also noticed (as did I) that her hair stays flat and straight all day.</li>
            <li>My main issue isn&#x27;t the result but the actual dryer...</li>
            <li>Like a knife, a musical instrumenet, etc...the hairdryer is a tool your hands get use to, which takes practice, precision, acurracy in finally achieving consistent results....</li>
            <li>I dropped it and now only high power works, not medium</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my hairdresser cousin, who says it will last 5 years!</li>
            <li>Even the Chi didn&#x27;t at all seem worth the extra cash - so I have been reluctant to buy another more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>, it was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>There are a few settings for hot and cold, all work beautifully.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit tight enough to stay on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s finally time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I live in the South and here we only have 2 seasons, winter and summer.</li>
            <li>This is my third Solano  Hairdryer (same red &amp; black model) and wldnt have had to replace it if grand daughter hadn&#x27;t knocked it off counter.</li>
            <li>After using a few different professional brands, of which all died rather quickly for their high price, I decided to ask my local beauty supply dealer his recommendation.</li>
            <li>guess it might last longer, but i could buy 2.5 of the other one for this one&#x27;s price, and i don&#x27;t see it lasting more then twice as long.</li>
            <li>With the reliability and performance of this product, there was no other choice for me.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get very hot and it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li>so it has the power necessary to blow dry hair, but the hot air could be hotter.  </li>
            <li>so I was skeptical that it would dry smooth or fast at first</li>
            <li>Super powerful blow dryer, it dried my hair in less than 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>Yes, its expensive but unlike crappy cheap dryers, this one will NEVER get too hot and fry your hair.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate the variety of settings, power and extra long cord.  </li>
            <li>I only found out about this hairdryer because they have them at my gym, but once I started using it my old one at home had to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also big and loud.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hairdryer is immediately apparent...</li>
            <li>Apparently the Solano name justifies the exorbitant price.    </li>
            <li>My Mom&#x27;s old one finally broke and she&#x27;s had it for 22 years.</li>
            <li>They basically forwarded me a link to the dryer where I could find a link to the manufacture warranty, but apparently I&#x27;m out of luck because in order to get the warranty, you had to know to register the product within 30 days of purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so powerful that if you&#x27;re not careful, your hair will be totally dry; you may have to wet it a bit to style.</li>
            <li>It is heavier than a standard dryer but the dry time is so much faster</li>
            <li>For the price difference, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more powerful or dry hair any faster that a much less expensive brand like Conair.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and wouldn&#x27;t let me purchase any other model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 5 years and not a single problem.  </li>
            <li>after borrowing my friend&#x27;s dryer (and doing everything else the same - same washing temp, same shampoo/conditioner and other hair products) I realized that it may be worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>This blows enough heat at a high enough temperature so I can minimize flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the Cold setting, really does work to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the style.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to spend the money on a good, quality hair dryer and this one was just disappointing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing special in the least.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but I love how solid it</li>
            <li>The problem for me is that is doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair  in the way that my previous dryer did.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair much faster than an average hair dryer you buy at the store.  </li>
            <li>Even after brushing my hair the entire time I was drying it, I still could barely get my brush through my hair after drying with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The dryer wasted used more than a few times a week, and still only lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li>a nutshell, it cut my drying time in half, despite the fact I was fussing with my sectioning clips, it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am not needing to wash as often for some reason, no oils on scalp area, so still looks clean 3rd day, where previously it was needing washed every other.</li>
            <li>It takes me like 20 minutes to dry, and it leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It still took me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair completely with this dryer.</li>
            <li>Her assumption is that the old $20 CVS dryer wasn&#x27;t getter her hair completely dry to the core and root of the hair.</li>
            <li>I splurged for my Solano after first using one at my swanky gym, which made me realize what I had been missing by using commercial brands at home</li>
            <li>First, it dries my (very thick) hair twice as fast as drugstore brands of the same wattage.</li>
            <li>My Wife and I love this hair dryer, it takes 2 minutes to dry my short hair and 5 minutes to dry her thick, lower back length, hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>The second one started making a grinding noise (like the first one did before it stopped working) and I&#x27;d only had it a little over 4 months!  </li>
            <li>Never thought to look on Amazon for the Solano since I thought it was only sold in Beauty Supply shops, but after the bad buy of the Twin Turbo, I continued my search and found it on Amazon for a good price</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s the best dryer for the money, and customer service and support is top notch.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer before and believe it is one of the best products that are available.  </li>
            <li> good dryer like this</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> Good brand.</li>
            <li> My frizz is gone and my hair never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I used the babliss before for years which I loved</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been told by my hairdresser that if you want a good hair dryer, you should be prepared to spend around the $100+ mark.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a really good hair dryer</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> I found the best deal on Amazon.com and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It works great and drys your hair quickly!!  </li>
            <li> It looks so much more beautiful and shiny and healthy and all I changed was the dryer!</li>
            <li> love my dryer its a great dryer for a great price, am a hairdresser and love it.</li>
            <li> As far as I know and have experienced, this is one of the best dryers on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my daughter because she loved using mine so much - it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> it is WAY better than the T3 and Sedu dryers!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say it again, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This dryer was recommended by my hairdresser, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product, but if you do purchase it, make sure you register it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 Supersolano&#x27;s because I LOVE the dryer but wish they held up!</li>
            <li> It better not break!</li>
            <li> My hair came out shiny and smooth and laid beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and I am so pleased!  </li>
            <li> Love the color!</li>
            <li> That said, the blowdryer worked just fine, and I was happy with it until it broke after just 5 months.</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> an amazing decision.  </li>
            <li> My hair drying time is greatly reduced, by hair looks smoother, shinier and frizz is eliminated... fabulous hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I already own one and needed another.  </li>
            <li> The best part is I no longer need to use my straightening iron because this does such a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer does have a nice, sturdy cord that looks as though it&#x27;s resistant to curling up and tangling (a nice feature).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that kind of dryer I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I asked my new stylist what he thinks and he recommended this $250 Solano that he sells, and then went on and on about why Solano is awesome</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great.  </li>
            <li> I have had my Super Solano since 1984 and it still works great.  </li>
            <li> One of the most reliable products I own.</li>
            <li> My old SuperSolano (purchased in 2001) provided excellent service throughout its working lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer, it works spectacular.  </li>
            <li> I paid a fortune for it then, but it was the best investment I ever made in a professional tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent build quality, very quiet (important if you want to preserve your precious hearing) and great performance.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS HUGE!</li>
            <li> Great power, heat &amp; good direction with the 3 different attachments...</li>
            <li> The product works ok, and it should, for $85.00.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the best hair dryers on the market.</li>
            <li> Top stylists use and love it.</li>
            <li> When my favorite dryer in the world died--Hai brand--</li>
            <li> After 9 months I&#x27;m still pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> OK, if you&#x27;re convinced I&#x27;m a spendthrift, get this: I&#x27;m buying another one for travel.</li>
            <li> but I certainly don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> A multi-millionaire who did many of the repairs and shipping himself.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just ok product for the price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this would be like, re heat, choices and weight.  </li>
            <li> No nasty chemical smells that take 15 uses to burn off.  </li>
            <li> It is also quieter than most blowdryers.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> The most power I&#x27;ve had in any hairdryer.</li>
            <li> So keep ahold of it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer-</li>
            <li> so, yes it&#x27;s going to be more substantial, but the weight doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly recommend this dryer to another who wants a good substantial product.  </li>
            <li> both my husband and I fell in love with it, so purchased one for home.</li>
            <li> My wife and my two daughters love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> They had many drawbacks including noise, gyroscopic torque and sucking hair into the air intake.</li>
            <li> Solano is always a sure bet for quality..</li>
            <li> This works great and is much cheaper online compared to buying it at Ulta.</li>
            <li> The consistent flow of air this hair dryer has is amazing!</li>
            <li> Not to mention my hair looks beyond shinny, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great dryer and really fast service.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I love this hair dyer and recommended it to  my friends.  </li>
            <li> but I may love this one more.</li>
            <li> but I am sure I&#x27;ll acclimate to it.  </li>
            <li> But I love the way my hair looks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad for them to have the $$ given the guidance they gave me.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best hair dryer on the market.  </li>
            <li> but with that said, may be better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was better than ever -</li>
            <li> I love this and wish I would&#x27;ve figured this one out years ago.  </li>
            <li> love the warrenty on them to</li>
            <li> I just could not comprehend why I needed to spend more that $20.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We couldn&#x27;t be more excited to own this dryer.</li>
            <li> glad to see they are still available.</li>
            <li> The Super Solano is still the best, longest lasting hair dryer ever</li>
            <li> I came right home and ordered my own.  </li>
            <li> Not bad!  </li>
            <li> lots of power, easy settings and substantially constructed.  </li>
            <li> The placement of the controls make it easy to change temperature when I want but not accidentally.</li>
            <li> My hair dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are because it&#x27;s easy to switch settings while holding it.</li>
            <li> Dries your hair very quickly without burning.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> When it did work, I liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer about a month ago and my drying time had been cut for about half the time and the best part is that it leaves it shinny....</li>
            <li> but I bought a TwinTurbo at a Beauty Supply shop who said they didn&#x27;t carry Super Solano any more.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly without damaging; leaves hair looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, but wished control buttons were located in different spot.  </li>
            <li> I had to return for an exchange and fortunately the replacement was shipped correctly.  </li>
            <li> I still cannot get over how smooth my hair is, almost like I used a straightening iron -</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Then I picked up this dryer, my new best friend, my secret weapon, my happy place...</li>
            <li> Great for all types of hair especially harder to manage &amp; you need a good blow dryer to get it straight.  </li>
            <li> I love that it never gets too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> She had this Supersolano and from the first time I used it I noticed that my fine hair looked so much shinier and healthy than ever before - like when you leave the salon!  </li>
            <li> As others have stated this is a professional hair dryer that will last years and provide superb performance.  </li>
            <li> ( you got to keep the filer clean ).  </li>
            <li> I go to clean the lint filter, and there&#x27;s nothing in it.</li>
            <li> With this blow dryer, I am able to achieve a smooth straight finish for my hair every time.</li>
            <li> Nice to buy from your stylist so they can get a cut and stay in business, but this one was such a better deal</li>
            <li> He recommended the Solano &amp; he was right on!</li>
            <li> good news is that these units can be fixed at the factory for a very reasonable price...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not too loud, which is nice</li>
            <li> Seriously the BEST hairdryer there is.</li>
            <li> It drys well and quickly.</li>
            <li> Quickly dries hair.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> As I said I have fine hair follicles at a normal density and my end split easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, super loud and drys really really fast.  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I quickly purchased it.</li>
            <li> The noise level is acceptable and does not have that high pitched humm that many of them do.  </li>
            <li> So, I did some research on Solano and other brands, and this seemed by far the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They say this lasts a long time so if you&#x27;re going to buy a dryer, go ahead and get a good one.</li>
            <li> I love my new knife, but am still getting use to it.</li>
            <li> I had a Solano about 30 years ago that lasted a very long time and have not found another one as good since then</li>
            <li> been in the entertainment business for over 24 years, and needed a product that would cut my drying time in half, and leave my hair looking great.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Received item long ago and its perfect, well made and will last another 18 years, probably longer since I no longer travel for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick hair!</li>
            <li> Solano seems to be used in many high end salons, which is where I first discovered it.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works fast and my hair hair came out really smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these from a Sally&#x27;s beauty salon a few years ago and it was great.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries my hair fast and leave it feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> buy it, it is worth</li>
            <li> So, although the inconvenience of damaged shipment and return, it is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if attachments were included but was pleasantly surprised to receive them.  </li>
            <li> I advise you getting one, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The workings of the dryer rarely break  as a result of a manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s durable, powerful, and even though it&#x27;s powerful it&#x27;s weight is not an issue even after blow drying for a while.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My daughter was using mine often and finally asked for one of her own.</li>
            <li> I had borrowed a friends Supersolano on a few occasions and liked it so much I bought my own.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and works as well today as the day I bought it two years ago.</li>
            <li> Its kind of a love/hate relationship actually.</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Long cord is good for salons but bit big for home unless you like being able to move around while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> It Works with the right heat and leave no freeze</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer, at my stylist&#x27;s recommendation and I could see the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Learning a new tool can be fun and rewarding, but when it comes to hair, I really want my trusted tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this hair dryer very strong, hair get dry quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much and the volume stays true.</li>
            <li> Nice, long cord.</li>
            <li> But the super is the one she really was looking for 1800 watts.</li>
            <li> I love the super long cord on this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly it dries my hair and the long cord.  </li>
            <li> My hair dries very fast with this-</li>
            <li> Smooth drying, easy to use, does not overheat you or or bathroom, effective and fast to dry long hair.</li>
            <li> Most hairdressers will tell you the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is well worth your money, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It blows hot air.</li>
            <li> I first tried a Rusk dryer which was aweful</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> After using this dryer my hair was left brittle and frizzy (and I happen to have healthy hair).</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t ear-piercing loud like the cheap hair dryer I was using until this one arrived.</li>
            <li> Everyone has noticed a big difference on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> The first one I owned lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li> Get the red one, so cute.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about a year, then just stopped working.</li>
            <li> and I learned this is a consistent problem with the Ultra Chi.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had the first for years.</li>
            <li> The air didn&#x27;t get all that hot</li>
            <li> I bought the first one based on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> One of the best in the market and is not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Surely the company has updated it several times over the years.</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago my favorite chefs knife broke recently, after 20 years of use.</li>
            <li> Super long cord makes it so easy too.</li>
            <li> Wow - this is one special dryer.  </li>
            <li> and now I have a new hair dryer I&#x27;m expecting to last 7+ years easily with mild self cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never found better.</li>
            <li> the super Solano is very powerful and I like the long cord.</li>
            <li> However, I was happy to find the same model, same handle, same settings, shape, and size was still being made, and being sold right here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would be nice if they  made a slightly shorter cord</li>
            <li> I started beauty school in 1985 and this dryer was recommended buy a fellow student and 27 years later it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have really thick fine hair and this drier dries my hair quickly as leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a lot of hair dryers in my time and finally realized I would need a good quality one to dry my hair quicker and not fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I like that it has so many different settings from cool and low speed to high speed and hot.  </li>
            <li> Doent get too hot like many other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; dryers.</li>
            <li> I had my last Super Solano for 10 years!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good alternative between cheap blow dryers you&#x27;d buy at Target and the really expensive salon ones.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast.  </li>
            <li> and I have never come across a dryer that damaged my hair as much as the SuperSolano did.</li>
            <li> I looked at others that were twice as much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think a dryer would make that much of a difference in the health, style and look of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I looked at $80.00 dryers, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be much difference between a $20.00 dryer and an $80.00 dryer.  </li>
            <li> It has only basic functions, but joy, they actually work.  </li>
            <li> I never knew there could be this much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I never knew there was really a difference -</li>
            <li> It dries my hair really fast.  </li>
            <li> When traveling, I can really tell the difference when I have to use the hotel&#x27;s hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t that the whole point?  </li>
            <li> Really likes it</li>
            <li> Hair shines and feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> Includes two accessories for drying straight hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks much smoother;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my hairdryer to be ridiculously hot, but I need more heat than this one offers to dry my hair within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Okay product but gave it 3 stars because it is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this hairdryer, but it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the heat and speed functions work really well, and my hair is generally smooth after a blow dry.</li>
            <li> I bought my Super Solano in the early 90&#x27;s when I was a working professional.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of loving my Hai, I expected quality of all these other high end dryers would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li> Second, it makes my hair look terrific (shiny and healthy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a super solano before but a slightly different one.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick head full of straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> After years of use, abuse (dropping it, loaning it out), traveling around the nation and world, my super solano finally quit working yesterday.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself feels nice and solid- not plasticy cheap like my other ones, and so I was worried my arm would hurt after holding it up too long-</li>
            <li> Also, it has a really long cord, which is good for me because I tend to sit down away from the plug while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately despite 3-4 day a week use it has lasted and i&#x27;ve never had a single problem with it.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half (to 10 minutes) because it&#x27;s pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this high performance hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Its a high powered Hair dryer that is used by professionals.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this  product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> but I think this is because of its high quality.</li>
            <li> highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> A honest and hard working man.</li>
            <li> I love the extra long cord for getting to the other side of my chair easily.</li>
            <li> This unit is often seen in professional salons and really does the job.</li>
            <li> I ordered it through Amazon, as it was about 25% off the normal retail price.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and durable and quiet.  </li>
            <li> These are powerful machines that last for years and years!</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s worth all the extra money</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t really get that hot -</li>
            <li> The only negative might be that it&#x27;s pretty heavy, so it&#x27;s not the best for travelling.  </li>
            <li> Powerful with multiple settings.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful; yet quiet.</li>
            <li> This cost much less than at my local salon and arrived much faster than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li> With the Super Solano, I only had to use the oil before as it looked soft and shiny after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep thinking that it can&#x27;t be that hard to make a good dryer, especially when that&#x27;s one of the main purposes of your company.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer for professional use!</li>
            <li> it look like the motor was stock, and it was brand new..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to the \\&quot;new and improved version.\\</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d go for something new.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer for my vacation home.  </li>
            <li> I buy a new \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; blow-dryer almost every year ($25-60)-</li>
            <li> After 10 years I needed a new one</li>
            <li> This is how I feel about my new knife, learning all over again, and this is how I would have felt if I had to purchased an updated model of the Supersolano.</li>
            <li> While this one is pretty powerful (the airflow is very strong), it left my hair very tangled and difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used drugstore $30 blowdryers &amp; then last month I asked my hairstylist what professional blowdyer was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> They are on the handle like other dryers but they sit right where your fingers rest, making it easy to inadvertently change it to a lower setting when moving it around to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well (and very fast) for my low maintenance hair.</li>
            <li> I will buy again in future, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> And she has very thick hair, so she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s me after blow drying my long hair with the Super Solano 1875 Professional Dryer (bought 2012 around $130): \\&quot;Whoa....</li>
            <li> BTW, I have short hair, so it didn&#x27;t have that much use!</li>
            <li> while my other dryer the T3 is supposed to have better ratings but simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well.  </li>
            <li> (I previously owned a cheap Revlon).</li>
            <li> I would caution you that it is a tad heavy and the on/off and temperature control buttons are easy to hit when you are holding it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending this much money on a hair dryer but this one really delivers a strong consistent air flow.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to flat iron hair as much with this!</li>
            <li> Results were not immediate, but after the first week my fine graying hair is much smoother, less staticky, and much less fly-a-way.</li>
            <li> A little heavy because of the really good motor</li>
            <li> I have had mine for 10 years and its still alive and well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone because its not heavy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a professional blow dryer</li>
            <li> I had to get rid of my old solano bc</li>
            <li> When I tearfully confessed that I was thinking of going to my natural hair color</li>
            <li> No wonder all of the professional stylists use it.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer to replace my old T3 that died.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s professional quality</li>
            <li> It was like losing an old friend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Overall, I like it so much I ordered another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> and after a year they either seem to lose power or just break completely.  </li>
            <li> Works as promised - no frizz - dries my medium long frizzy hair fast!  </li>
            <li> This dryer will get your hair completely dryer while also making your hair look saloon quality.</li>
            <li> Supersolano 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Dryer.  </li>
            <li> It takes several months even years to really get use to a product.</li>
            <li> I never had a professional dryer before &amp; was a bit nervous putting out the $$</li>
            <li> It has several different settings and is really powerful.  </li>
            <li> More expensive than some, but  the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the prize I spent.</li>
            <li> YOU SOLANO for keeping it the same, making strong, long lasting dependable products!&lt;br</li>
            <li> In short, I hope this dryer lasts forever, and even if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m going right back to Solano for another.</li>
            <li> This one however is nowhere near as powerful as the other one.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of heat/speed settings and the temperature remains consistent while you dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> also noticed (as did I) that her hair stays flat and straight all day.</li>
            <li> My main issue isn&#x27;t the result but the actual dryer...</li>
            <li> Like a knife, a musical instrumenet, etc...the hairdryer is a tool your hands get use to, which takes practice, precision, acurracy in finally achieving consistent results....</li>
            <li> I dropped it and now only high power works, not medium</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my hairdresser cousin, who says it will last 5 years!</li>
            <li> Even the Chi didn&#x27;t at all seem worth the extra cash - so I have been reluctant to buy another more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> , it was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> There are a few settings for hot and cold, all work beautifully.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit tight enough to stay on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s finally time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I live in the South and here we only have 2 seasons, winter and summer.</li>
            <li> This is my third Solano  Hairdryer (same red &amp; black model) and wldnt have had to replace it if grand daughter hadn&#x27;t knocked it off counter.</li>
            <li> After using a few different professional brands, of which all died rather quickly for their high price, I decided to ask my local beauty supply dealer his recommendation.</li>
            <li> guess it might last longer, but i could buy 2.5 of the other one for this one&#x27;s price, and i don&#x27;t see it lasting more then twice as long.</li>
            <li> With the reliability and performance of this product, there was no other choice for me.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get very hot and it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> so it has the power necessary to blow dry hair, but the hot air could be hotter.  </li>
            <li> so I was skeptical that it would dry smooth or fast at first</li>
            <li> Super powerful blow dryer, it dried my hair in less than 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> Yes, its expensive but unlike crappy cheap dryers, this one will NEVER get too hot and fry your hair.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate the variety of settings, power and extra long cord.  </li>
            <li> I only found out about this hairdryer because they have them at my gym, but once I started using it my old one at home had to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also big and loud.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hairdryer is immediately apparent...</li>
            <li> Apparently the Solano name justifies the exorbitant price.    </li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s old one finally broke and she&#x27;s had it for 22 years.</li>
            <li> They basically forwarded me a link to the dryer where I could find a link to the manufacture warranty, but apparently I&#x27;m out of luck because in order to get the warranty, you had to know to register the product within 30 days of purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so powerful that if you&#x27;re not careful, your hair will be totally dry; you may have to wet it a bit to style.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than a standard dryer but the dry time is so much faster</li>
            <li> For the price difference, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more powerful or dry hair any faster that a much less expensive brand like Conair.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and wouldn&#x27;t let me purchase any other model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 5 years and not a single problem.  </li>
            <li> after borrowing my friend&#x27;s dryer (and doing everything else the same - same washing temp, same shampoo/conditioner and other hair products) I realized that it may be worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> This blows enough heat at a high enough temperature so I can minimize flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the Cold setting, really does work to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the style.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to spend the money on a good, quality hair dryer and this one was just disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing special in the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but I love how solid it</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that is doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair  in the way that my previous dryer did.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair much faster than an average hair dryer you buy at the store.  </li>
            <li> Even after brushing my hair the entire time I was drying it, I still could barely get my brush through my hair after drying with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer wasted used more than a few times a week, and still only lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li> a nutshell, it cut my drying time in half, despite the fact I was fussing with my sectioning clips, it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am not needing to wash as often for some reason, no oils on scalp area, so still looks clean 3rd day, where previously it was needing washed every other.</li>
            <li> It takes me like 20 minutes to dry, and it leaves the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It still took me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair completely with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Her assumption is that the old $20 CVS dryer wasn&#x27;t getter her hair completely dry to the core and root of the hair.</li>
            <li> I splurged for my Solano after first using one at my swanky gym, which made me realize what I had been missing by using commercial brands at home</li>
            <li> First, it dries my (very thick) hair twice as fast as drugstore brands of the same wattage.</li>
            <li> My Wife and I love this hair dryer, it takes 2 minutes to dry my short hair and 5 minutes to dry her thick, lower back length, hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li> The second one started making a grinding noise (like the first one did before it stopped working) and I&#x27;d only had it a little over 4 months!  </li>
            <li> Never thought to look on Amazon for the Solano since I thought it was only sold in Beauty Supply shops, but after the bad buy of the Twin Turbo, I continued my search and found it on Amazon for a good price</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s me after blow drying my long hair with my old Conair 1875 Lite (bought circa 1999 around $10): \\&quot;Why&#x27;s my hair always so frizzy and looks so dry and fluffy?\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, the cord is long, the power (both heat and fan) is all you can possibly need, and while my styling time is cut nearly in half I find that somehow it just makes my hair look better, less frizzy, with less product.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and need a dryer that will dry quickly, WITHOUT frizzing or damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> Being a professional, I could not recommend any other dryer.</li>
            <li> I use this with a paddle brush and I have soft shiny hair and absolutely no &amp;#34;bushy-head&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I could actually achieve the soft silky hair that I walked out of her salon with in half the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> They dont last long if you drop them.</li>
            <li> My hair dried faster than ever, and it also dried smooth- unlike the frizz from all other blowdryers including the Chi.  </li>
            <li> but they last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> big plus is that the cord is very long and sturdy.</li>
            <li> However, it dries in half the time of my old Rusk dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the bliss that other reviewers apparently feel when they use it.</li>
            <li> They are not small and they are not light weight</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who has long thick hair but wants to wash in the morning instead of before bed, because you actually have the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was powerful, got hot, but could be turned down to low and the cold air switch was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I have a decent amount of thick hair, and like everyone else in a similar scenario, blow through hair dryers about every 6 mos.  </li>
            <li> I see absolutely no difference in my hair using this blowdryer as opposed to my standard Conair cheapie.</li>
            <li> The cord is actually long.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Solano user for a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, since I&#x27;m a hairdresser and use it all day long I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the lighter one.</li>
            <li> I have long treated hair, plus I go to the gym 5 times a week.</li>
            <li> Blow drying her hair was a long process before this Supersolano dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All minor.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long but not an issue-</li>
            <li> I have long been the person who did not see the need to spend money on a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> The extra long cord is a bit much for a small bathroom, however, when I am elsewhere I don&#x27;t have to be overly concerned that a mirror &amp; outlet are not right next to each other.</li>
            <li> The only disappointing aspect is that the air isn&#x27;t as hot like my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and then this one which was not hot enough and cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li> , other then some extra weight to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> This product make my hair so dry and fuzzy.</li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any quicker, either.</li>
            <li> It was dry to the touch but not truly dry.</li>
            <li> Only four stars since I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately thick, naturally wavy hair that I use only moroccan oil to style.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair (halfway down my back) and what used to take 30 minutes to blowdry now takes 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it to women with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Usually the demise is accompanied by smokey fumes, maybe a spark or two, or just a complete shutdown.</li>
            <li> Drying takes half the time; hair stays soft and less damaged.</li>
            <li> was only slightly used.</li>
            <li> Third, I didn&#x27;t realize I could get it for half the price on Amazon until I&#x27;d already used it.</li>
            <li> I know by reputation and previous experience this dryer will last.  </li>
            <li> I got a $110 Chi a few years ago with a discount from my old stylist and it had a 1 year warranty and it broke down a week after the warranty was up.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers say the dryer is heavy, I don&#x27;t remember the dryer being heavier than the old type, but it was much less fatiguing to use because it did not fight you when changing angles or direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that it is a little heavier than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> It is heavy and only has two speeds...barely blowing and blow your head off!  </li>
            <li> I spent weeks researching blow dryers before I settled on the Supersolano 232rb.  </li>
            <li> I used to work in the Skokie repair center with \\&quot;Mr.</li>
            <li> However, that repair center is no longer.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to drop it.  </li>
            <li> I was working way harder</li>
            <li> The dryer is somewhat heavy in comparison to my drug store version but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have had my SuperSolano for about 5 years and it is only starting to wear down now, after being used at least once a day for this long of a time.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple!</li>
            <li> Quiet but very heavy and a very long cord.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy but it blows really hard on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry with my Wigo hairdryer, so I was hoping to cut that time down by investing in a nicer hairdryer.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t buy a new one because it occasionally would blow cold air only</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer was killing my hair, and would leave it dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> No temperature controls, only hot or cold.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair everyday and need one that is sturdy, well constructed and, one that will last longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick straight hair that is about five inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Repairs are still done but thru another location, not the Skokie Illinois location mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided to buy it</li>
            <li> , how it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair like other brands, etc...  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair in a fraction of the time that it took all of the other blow dryers that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I currently was given a $200 dryer to use (Hana-air) and will be sending that back also because of fluctuating heat and poor switch placement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blower is lower than you average blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> I purchased the Supersolano after my old Ultra Chi was dropped and broken.</li>
            <li> My other hairdryers weould leave my hair just a little bit frizzy and brittle.</li>
            <li> Also, in the past I would put some Moroccan oil before and after styling as my hair felt so dry.  </li>
            <li> previous dryers had been the \\&quot;snail shell\\&quot; type with the motor on the side.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done on my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Drys hair quicker then other dryers that I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Little damage.</li>
            <li> only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t blow really hard.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy though some may find it a bit too heavy.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t say the dryer is too heavy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> I had bought at least a dozen hair dryers before this one and I will never buy any other after using it.</li>
            <li> I wish the cord didn&#x27;t get so tangled all the time but at least I don&#x27;t feel like I&amp;#34;m frying my hair which is how it seems with other dryers.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair that I am always trying to tame.</li>
            <li> I am glad I mad the change!!  </li>
            <li> Solano has a warranty that not many can match.</li>
            <li> It is a very heavy blowdryer</li>
            <li> I am just an ordinary girl with really thick hair that LOVES my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I swallowed hard when i bought this hair dryer  over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I get use to something, and it works, its hard to switch.</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat and air settings and a cold air button -- just like a $10 Conair from Walgreens.     </li>
            <li> One negative is the attachements they include don&#x27;t stay on the barrel when the air is going.  </li>
            <li> Takes me a long time to dry my hair however, so that is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Bought the Solano on March 5th 2011, it broke this past January.....not even a year of use!</li>
            <li> So far I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> One small annoyance: The temperature and air speed setting toggles are poorly placed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it has poor power...losing power each day -- and I am unable to return it due to Amason&#x27;s return policy.  </li>
            <li> Controls are in a bad location so I was constantly changing settings.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> It came Broken in a box...</li>
            <li> If you are not experienced with using  &lt;br</li>
            <li> Solano can also stand behind their items.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer is the secret.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of buying the drugstore hair dyers that lasted a year or two.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for just a few months use</li>
            <li> , it could be the wrong one for you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I returned it.</li>
            <li> Here is a dryer that looks (sorry) like it jumped out of 1972.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to keep it because I didn&#x27;t have time to return it before I went away for a weekend.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but well-made.</li>
            <li> So warranty is now useless to me.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> For the price....you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> When I go to my sister&#x27;s house and have to use her awful little drugstore dryer, it just keeps getting hotter &amp; hotter and has no power at all--UGH!</li>
            <li> the bad news...</li>
            <li> and she assumed it was because her conditioner was bad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> Iam really very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very disappointed with the way that Amazon handled this...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> I hated it after shelling out $85.00 with a no return policy!  </li>

            <li> I was looking for a quality hairdryer and settled on this one after comparing reviews on multiple models.  So far I have not been disappointed.  It has multiple setting combinations.  It is sturdy though some may find it a bit too heavy.  I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time drying my hair so it&#x27;s weight does not bother me.  It drys well and quickly.</li>
            <li> Great price, great dryer. They forgot to mention the hair dryer was used.  I kept it anyway was only slightly used. They should have told me though.</li>
            <li> I have had my SuperSolano for about 5 years and it is only starting to wear down now, after being used at least once a day for this long of a time. I&#x27;m totally impressed with the longevity thus far.&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer has a solid construction and has power in the motor that you will not find on regular consumer hair dryers. The Italians, in addition to being masters at crafting sports cars, know how to make a great hair dryer. The SuperSolano is the Bugatti Veyron of the hair drying world.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it, it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10 years later and this thing is still a champ. One of the most reliable products I own.</li>
            <li> I think this hair dryer is perfect.  It&#x27;s lightweight, the cord is long, the power (both heat and fan) is all you can possibly need, and while my styling time is cut nearly in half I find that somehow it just makes my hair look better, less frizzy, with less product.  I only found out about this hairdryer because they have them at my gym, but once I started using it my old one at home had to go.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer you can buy. Most hairdressers will tell you the same thing. You can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not as happy as I wanted to be about this product.  I finally decided to spend the money on a good, quality hair dryer and this one was just disappointing.  It is heavy and only has two speeds...barely blowing and blow your head off!  There are no attachments either!</li>
            <li> I love the super long cord on this dryer.  It has several different settings and is really powerful.  It&#x27;s a good alternative between cheap blow dryers you&#x27;d buy at Target and the really expensive salon ones.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a Supersolano, have had an Elchim for 8 years. Bought the Solano on March 5th 2011, it broke this past January.....not even a year of use! It&#x27;s also big and loud. Save your money.  BTW, I have short hair, so it didn&#x27;t have that much use!</li>
            <li> Super powerful blow dryer, it dried my hair in less than 2 minutes! while my other dryer the T3 is supposed to have better ratings but simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well.  This is well worth your money, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand as long as I can remember, and I&#x27;ve never found better. I especially like its relative quietness, compared to others. Solano seems to be used in many high end salons, which is where I first discovered it. This cost much less than at my local salon and arrived much faster than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, but wished control buttons were located in different spot.  I have accidently turned off while drying my hair. I would still purchace this dryer.  Quickly dries hair.</li>
            <li> Great power, heat &amp; good direction with the 3 different attachments...Great for all types of hair especially harder to manage &amp; you need a good blow dryer to get it straight.  Don&#x27;t have to flat iron hair as much with this!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations.  Very well made.  Dries my hair fast.  My hair looks smoother and sleeker.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer before and believe it is one of the best products that are available.  I ordered it through Amazon, as it was about 25% off the normal retail price.  However, when I received the shipment, the box did not have any bubble wrap and the product was damaged.  I had to return for an exchange and fortunately the replacement was shipped correctly.  So, although the inconvenience of damaged shipment and return, it is definitely worth it and I would highly recommend this high performance hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer ever!  I had one of these for 15 years and it went out. Just got another one- it is WAY better than the T3 and Sedu dryers! Makes my hair shiny and easier to straighten. A little heavy because of the really good motor but makes my hair look SO much better than anything else!!! RECOMMENDED! Ulta also sells it.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairstylist for almost 30 years and Solano&#x27;s are the only blowdryer I purchase.  They are not small and they are not light weight but they last for a very long time.  I believe that I have only purchased two or three for home use in 30 years.  Not bad!  I have thick hair and need a dryer that will dry quickly, WITHOUT frizzing or damaging my hair.  Ceramic and Solano is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if attachments were included but was pleasantly surprised to receive them.  The quality of the hairdryer is immediately apparent...lots of power, easy settings and substantially constructed.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It came Broken in a box...it look like the motor was stock, and it was brand new.. I returned It and  Got my money back.</li>
            <li> As others have stated this is a professional hair dryer that will last years and provide superb performance.  I&#x27;ve owned a SuperSolano for the last 10 years.  It&#x27;s finally time for a new one.  My old SuperSolano (purchased in 2001) provided excellent service throughout its working lifetime.  It had been dropped numerous times and kept on working.  If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the housing was damaged in one of the aforementioned drops this dryer would still be in service.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the \\&quot;new and improved version.\\&quot;  It quietly does its job without drawing attention to itself.      Excellent build quality, very quiet (important if you want to preserve your precious hearing) and great performance.  Best dryer I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer several months ago after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;m still waiting for the bliss that other reviewers apparently feel when they use it. It&#x27;s a hair dryer, guys. It blows hot air. It has multiple heat and air settings and a cold air button -- just like a $10 Conair from Walgreens.     One small annoyance: The temperature and air speed setting toggles are poorly placed. They are on the handle like other dryers but they sit right where your fingers rest, making it easy to inadvertently change it to a lower setting when moving it around to dry your hair. Irksome.    The product works ok, and it should, for $85.00. Apparently the Solano name justifies the exorbitant price.    Still, I can&#x27;t believe I paid $85.00 for a hair dryer...</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!  I&#x27;ve always had Solano products because they are so well built and last a looooooong time!  Dries hair quickly without damaging; leaves hair looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hairstylyst recommended this hair dryer.  I found the best deal on Amazon.com and it arrived quickly.  It works great and drys your hair quickly!!  I would recommend it to everyone!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I will not recommended this product to anyone.This product make my hair so dry and fuzzy.Since I start using this hairdryer my hair is falling.Iam really very disappointed.I hope I can returned this product and get my money back.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the best hair dryers on the market. I have had mine for 10 years and its still alive and well. Its a high powered Hair dryer that is used by professionals. It is great for straightening and smoothing curly/straight hair. I would suggest that keeping it away from your scalp so as not to burn yourself...</li>
            <li> As far as I know and have experienced, this is one of the best dryers on the market. Top stylists use and love it. It makes your hair shiny and  &lt;br /&gt;beautiful when used properly.  If you are not experienced with using  &lt;br /&gt;a good dryer like this, it could be the wrong one for you.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer. It Works with the right heat and leave no freeze hair.&lt;br /&gt;The blower is lower than you average blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer about a month ago and my drying time had been cut for about half the time and the best part is that it leaves it shinny....</li>
            <li> I have gone through a lot of hair dryers in my time and finally realized I would need a good quality one to dry my hair quicker and not fry my hair. I did a lot of research as to what would be the best one and I kept finding great things about the Solano. I have now been using it for several months and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Definitely a good buy and it was way cheaper here on Amazon then anywhere else I found it.</li>
            <li> This is the best of Solano. My wife is been using this product for over 11 years. But the super is the one she really was looking for 1800 watts. It works great. Solano can also stand behind their items. I advise you getting one, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> When my favorite dryer in the world died--Hai brand--I thought I&#x27;d go for something new.  After 2 years of loving my Hai, I expected quality of all these other high end dryers would be worth trying.  This was not the case.  I first tried a Rusk dryer which was aweful and then this one which was not hot enough and cumbersome to use.  Controls are in a bad location so I was constantly changing settings.  I currently was given a $200 dryer to use (Hana-air) and will be sending that back also because of fluctuating heat and poor switch placement.  I&#x27;m sending the Hana air back too and waiting for my backordered Hai. It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I spent weeks researching blow dryers before I settled on the Supersolano 232rb.  After 9 months I&#x27;m still pleased with it.  I&#x27;m a swimmer and always shower at the  gym/pool after a workout, so I pack this in my gym backpack.  I&#x27;ve learned to take an extra minute to wind the cord around the body of the blow dryer to keep it from unwinding all over my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately thick, naturally wavy hair that I use only moroccan oil to style. This dryer works well (and very fast) for my low maintenance hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used drugstore $30 blowdryers &amp; then last month I asked my hairstylist what professional blowdyer was worth the investment. He recommended the Solano &amp; he was right on! This dryer is amazing. I have long wavy hair (halfway down my back) and what used to take 30 minutes to blowdry now takes 15 minutes. I would highly recommend this  product to anyone.</li>
            <li> For those of you who think $85 is a lot for a hairdryer, I just bought this model from my hairdresser&#x27;s salon for $200. Why? Three reasons. First, it dries my (very thick) hair twice as fast as drugstore brands of the same wattage. Second, it makes my hair look terrific (shiny and healthy). Third, I didn&#x27;t realize I could get it for half the price on Amazon until I&#x27;d already used it. Drat! OK, if you&#x27;re convinced I&#x27;m a spendthrift, get this: I&#x27;m buying another one for travel. The thing weighs a ton and the handle doesn&#x27;t fold, but the advantages compensate for those drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I read the mostly good reviews of this blowdryer and thought: I should get this! Unfortunately for me it&#x27;s nothing special in the least. I would never recommend it to a friend. It is way overpriced.  I see absolutely no difference in my hair using this blowdryer as opposed to my standard Conair cheapie. Really! AND it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any quicker, either. I don&#x27;t hate it but I certainly don&#x27;t love it. My advice: don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great.  Have been using for several weeks now.  Results were not immediate, but after the first week my fine graying hair is much smoother, less staticky, and much less fly-a-way. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!  Quality feel, great power...  Gets the job done on my long thick hair.  I had another Solano dryer that lasted for years.  The only brand I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. I have been using a hairdryer to blow out my hair for over 10 years and I have never come across a dryer that damaged my hair as much as the SuperSolano did. After using this dryer my hair was left brittle and frizzy (and I happen to have healthy hair). Needless to say, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have had my Super Solano since 1984 and it still works great.  I used to work in the Skokie repair center with \\&quot;Mr. Solano\\&quot; himself.  A honest and hard working man. A multi-millionaire who did many of the repairs and shipping himself. It was a privilege to work for  RBI.  If we get a repair in on Monday, we would fix it Tuesday and ship it back to you on Wednesday.  However, that repair center is no longer. Repairs are still done but thru another location, not the Skokie Illinois location mentioned in other reviews. The Super Solano is still the best, longest lasting hair dryer ever and I know, I was the repair guy, I&#x27;d say 90% of the repairs were from customers dropping,  a simple short in the cord or clogged with hair ( you got to keep the filer clean ).  A short can happen to any dryer that is in use daily for 20 years. The workings of the dryer rarely break  as a result of a manufacturing defect.  Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true. I bought this for my Mom after I&#x27;ve had one for 12 years. My Mom&#x27;s old one finally broke and she&#x27;s had it for 22 years. These things are the tanks of the industry. Yes, its expensive but unlike crappy cheap dryers, this one will NEVER get too hot and fry your hair. When I go to my sister&#x27;s house and have to use her awful little drugstore dryer, it just keeps getting hotter &amp; hotter and has no power at all--UGH! The SS is the Mercedes Benz of hair dryers. I love it. Did I say that already? I&#x27;ll say it again, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> my hair tends to be frizzy - this dryer is what my stylist uses and it works well for my hair</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just ok product for the price. You can get the same result from a drug store product.</li>
            <li> My Wife and I love this hair dryer, it takes 2 minutes to dry my short hair and 5 minutes to dry her thick, lower back length, hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer was recommended by my hairdresser, and I love it! I would recommend this product to anyone because its not heavy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this would be like, re heat, choices and weight.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this dryer.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi hairdryer for about 5 years, it was great.  the super Solano is very powerful and I like the long cord.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works fast and my hair hair came out really smooth. I felt like it looked like I got it done at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Great price too. I looked at others that were twice as much. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a professional blow dryer so it has the power necessary to blow dry hair, but the hot air could be hotter.  Other than that I have no complaints-- it&#x27;s durable, powerful, and even though it&#x27;s powerful it&#x27;s weight is not an issue even after blow drying for a while. I had to get rid of my old solano bc I dropped it and now only high power works, not medium power-- but it still works!</li>
            <li> Focused stream of air with lots of power.  Long cord is good for salons but bit big for home unless you like being able to move around while drying your hair.  Excellent choice for the money. Would definitely buy it again and wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If my house caught on fire, I would run back in to get this hair dryer.  I didn&#x27;t think a dryer would make that much of a difference in the health, style and look of my hair.  When I tearfully confessed that I was thinking of going to my natural hair color (gasp! no!), my hairdresser suggested I upgrade from my $15.00 travel sized dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an amazing decision.  I looked at $80.00 dryers, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be much difference between a $20.00 dryer and an $80.00 dryer.  Then I picked up this dryer, my new best friend, my secret weapon, my happy place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts drying time.  It makes your hair soft, smooth and silky.  It sings you a song while you put on your makeup.  Well, maybe not the last one.  But, in all honesty, this is one of the best beauty purchases I&#x27;ve made.  Ever.</li>
            <li> I have a decent amount of thick hair, and like everyone else in a similar scenario, blow through hair dryers about every 6 mos.  Usually the demise is accompanied by smokey fumes, maybe a spark or two, or just a complete shutdown. I keep thinking that it can&#x27;t be that hard to make a good dryer, especially when that&#x27;s one of the main purposes of your company.  Well, I took a gamble with the Supersolano and could not be happier.  Here is a dryer that looks (sorry) like it jumped out of 1972.  However, it dries in half the time of my old Rusk dryer.  It has only basic functions, but joy, they actually work.  I go to clean the lint filter, and there&#x27;s nothing in it. The cord is actually long.  The noise level will not cause a loss of hearing.  No nasty chemical smells that take 15 uses to burn off.  In short, I hope this dryer lasts forever, and even if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m going right back to Solano for another.</li>
            <li> I have used Supersolano before, years ago. I love the extra long cord for getting to the other side of my chair easily. The placement of the controls make it easy to change temperature when I want but not accidentally. It is also quieter than most blowdryers. I highly recommend this dryer for professional use!</li>
            <li> This is still the best hair blower on the market. No wonder all of the professional stylists use it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I thought this hair dryer was stronger. I purchased one of these from a Sally&#x27;s beauty salon a few years ago and it was great. This one however is nowhere near as powerful as the other one. It&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> Powerful and durable and quiet.  I got mine from my daughter-in-law who&#x27;s a stylist and my daughter kept stealing it so bought her the same one for Christmas</li>
            <li> This is my second Solano and I absolutely love it.  My hair is very thick and wavy.  With this blow dryer, I am able to achieve a smooth straight finish for my hair every time.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Dries hair much faster than an average hair dryer you buy at the store.  It is heavier than a standard dryer but the dry time is so much faster it evens out.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer on the advise of my stylist.  You know how you always want to get the look that your stylist creates.  The hairdryer is the secret.  It is great.  I never knew there could be this much of a difference.  The most power I&#x27;ve had in any hairdryer. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been a Solano user for a long time.  I find the #232 model dries my hair faster and&lt;br /&gt;gives it a smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer to replace my old T3 that died. I like this one. It  has a lot of power and seems to be well made. It isn&#x27;t ear-piercing loud like the cheap hair dryer I was using until this one arrived. The only disappointing aspect is that the air isn&#x27;t as hot like my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> For the money you cant beat it. I use these in my salon. They dont last long if you drop them. THe motor mounts will break. So keep ahold of it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is everything I wanted</li>
            <li> I already own one and needed another.  I ordered this and it has poor power...losing power each day -- and I am unable to return it due to Amason&#x27;s return policy.  DEFECTIVE UNIT!  SCREWED!</li>
            <li> Seriously the BEST hairdryer there is. Lightweight and powerful. Super long cord makes it so easy too. My other hairdryers weould leave my hair just a little bit frizzy and brittle. This dryer dries my hair fast and leave it feeling silky and smooth. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a super solano before but a slightly different one.  I love this blow dryer, it works spectacular.  However, since I&#x27;m a hairdresser and use it all day long I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten the lighter one.</li>
            <li> For the price difference, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more powerful or dry hair any faster that a much less expensive brand like Conair. That said, the blowdryer worked just fine, and I was happy with it until it broke after just 5 months. The dryer wasted used more than a few times a week, and still only lasted 5 months. I plugged it in one day, and it just decided it wasn&#x27;t turning on anymore so I had to revert back to my trusty Conair that has been kicking for years. I&#x27;m also very disappointed with the way that Amazon handled this...they didn&#x27;t take any responsibility for selling me a defective product. They basically forwarded me a link to the dryer where I could find a link to the manufacture warranty, but apparently I&#x27;m out of luck because in order to get the warranty, you had to know to register the product within 30 days of purchase. Another option was to pay 30+ bucks to fix the dryer, but I chose to take the 30 bucks and buy another brand.  I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this product, but if you do purchase it, make sure you register it!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. It is a bit heavy but it blows really hard on the high setting.  I like that it has so many different settings from cool and low speed to high speed and hot.  One negative is the attachements they include don&#x27;t stay on the barrel when the air is going.  They don&#x27;t fit tight enough to stay on.  I figure I&#x27;ll add some duct tape around the barrel and the extra layer would make the attachments stay on.  I would recommend this hair dryer.  One big plus is that the cord is very long and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned. I have long treated hair, plus I go to the gym 5 times a week. That means that I have to wash my hair almost every day. It takes me like 20 minutes to dry, and it leaves the hair soft and shiny. Everyone has noticed a big difference on how healthy my hair looks. My previous hair dryer was killing my hair, and would leave it dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is a very heavy blowdryer</li>
            <li> I love this dryer- I was able to cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half (to 10 minutes) because it&#x27;s pretty powerful. The best part is I no longer need to use my straightening iron because this does such a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say the dryer is too heavy, it&#x27;s professional quality so, yes it&#x27;s going to be more substantial, but the weight doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Additionally, it comes with 2 attachments that make a big difference when drying the hair.</li>
            <li> I live in the South and here we only have 2 seasons, winter and summer. Because of this our hair gets thrown through the ringer. I had bought at least a dozen hair dryers before this one and I will never buy any other after using it. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully made dryer.  It has a lot of heat/speed settings and the temperature remains consistent while you dry your hair.  Not like some dryers that get hotter and hotter.  The problem for me is that is doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair  in the way that my previous dryer did.  Unfortunately I have to keep it because I didn&#x27;t have time to return it before I went away for a weekend.  I would recommend this dryer for regular hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer ! Being a professional, I could not recommend any other dryer. Plain and simple!</li>
            <li> This is my third Solano  Hairdryer (same red &amp; black model) and wldnt have had to replace it if grand daughter hadn&#x27;t knocked it off counter. These are powerful machines that last for years and years!</li>
            <li> I can honestly recommend this dryer to another who wants a good substantial product.  I used this dryer while vacationing at a friends house for  a week.  I came right home and ordered my own.  Must have product.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer.  My gym uses it and both my husband and I fell in love with it, so purchased one for home.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife (at her request).  She loves everything about it and hates nothing about it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quiet but very heavy and a very long cord. Otherwise I like this hair dryer. It works quickly and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Okay product but gave it 3 stars because it is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> This is my second one. The first one I owned lasted 10 years. Excellent product. Great quality. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I swallowed hard when i bought this hair dryer  over 10 years ago. Fortunately despite 3-4 day a week use it has lasted and i&#x27;ve never had a single problem with it. It is expensive but well-made.</li>
            <li> I went to visit a friend and didn&#x27;t take my hair dryer, assuming that I could use hers. She had this Supersolano and from the first time I used it I noticed that my fine hair looked so much shinier and healthy than ever before - like when you leave the salon!  As I said I have fine hair follicles at a normal density and my end split easily.  I have always used a conair or whatever brand of hair dryer was affordable.  I never knew there was really a difference - my goodness, is there ever!  THIS IS HUGE! after borrowing my friend&#x27;s dryer (and doing everything else the same - same washing temp, same shampoo/conditioner and other hair products) I realized that it may be worth the investment.  I got it here on Amazon.com a couple weeks ago and I have had SEVERAL people ask me what I did to my hair! It looks so much more beautiful and shiny and healthy and all I changed was the dryer! who woulda known??  A MUST have!</li>
            <li> This unit is often seen in professional salons and really does the job. I think you could remove paint with this baby. Guaranteed to last and last. There is a company back east ( RBI Distributors in Skokie, Il,) that will repair/recondition Solano Dryers. Good value! Our unit is in its 5th year with no problems. Crank it up. This will be your last hairdryer. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I have had my solano hair dryer for 27 years and counting. I started beauty school in 1985 and this dryer was recommended buy a fellow student and 27 years later it is still going strong. This was one of the best purchases I ever made.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I ever use.  My wife and my two daughters love it.  We have years using this brand</li>
            <li> Only four stars since I&#x27;ve only had it a few days and it&#x27;s heavy. But otherwise this blow dryer is amazing! I have frizzy curly hair that I am always trying to tame. This blows enough heat at a high enough temperature so I can minimize flat ironing. Highly recommended by my hairdresser cousin, who says it will last 5 years! Let&#x27;s hope for this price!</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick hair! My daughter loves it. Blow drying her hair was a long process before this Supersolano dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to women with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Wow - this is one special dryer.  Really appreciate the variety of settings, power and extra long cord.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy but that means quality to me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because it&#x27;s used at my gym.  I love it, it was exactly what I expected.  My hair dries very quickly.  Also, it&#x27;s not too loud, which is nice</li>
            <li> This is a powerful hair dryer. I know by reputation and previous experience this dryer will last.  My daughter was using mine often and finally asked for one of her own. Highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought my Super Solano in the early 90&#x27;s when I was a working professional. I paid a fortune for it then, but it was the best investment I ever made in a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;My previous dryers had been the \\&quot;snail shell\\&quot; type with the motor on the side. They had many drawbacks including noise, gyroscopic torque and sucking hair into the air intake. Some reviewers say the dryer is heavy, I don&#x27;t remember the dryer being heavier than the old type, but it was much less fatiguing to use because it did not fight you when changing angles or direction.&lt;br /&gt;It was powerful, got hot, but could be turned down to low and the cold air switch was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad news...mine broke quite a number of years ago, and I did not know of the repair policy. I tossed it out. It was like losing an old friend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see they are still available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about a month.  I love how quickly it dries my hair and the long cord.  I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are because it&#x27;s easy to switch settings while holding it. It is heavier than an blowdryer I&#x27;ve owned but I think this is because of its high quality. It&#x27;s supposed to last for years.  Overall, I like it so much I ordered another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending this much money on a hair dryer but this one really delivers a strong consistent air flow.  My wife loves it and it does seem to work faster than the 1250 and 1500 watt cheaper products on the market.</li>
            <li> Solano is always a sure bet for quality.. I have used them for 30 years and they last and last,...</li>
            <li> This works great and is much cheaper online compared to buying it at Ulta. Blue forty two, hut, hut..... Hike</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, to replace the same model. She absolutely loves it and wouldn&#x27;t let me purchase any other model.</li>
            <li> The consistent flow of air this hair dryer has is amazing! Get the red one, so cute. I have had a CHI for years burnt out on me and now I have a new hair dryer I&#x27;m expecting to last 7+ years easily with mild self cleaning. Not to mention my hair looks beyond shinny, I&#x27;m in love. Get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer. Drys hair quicker then other dryers that I have had in the past. Good brand. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Bought this JANUARY 2012.  It is April 3, 2012 and it no longer turns on.  When it did work, I liked it very much.  Am returning it to manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I had borrowed a friends Supersolano on a few occasions and liked it so much I bought my own.  More expensive than some, but  the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> She says it lived up to the hype that she had heard. And she has very thick hair, so she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 Supersolano&#x27;s because I LOVE the dryer but wish they held up! The first one lasted about a year, then just stopped working. The second one started making a grinding noise (like the first one did before it stopped working) and I&#x27;d only had it a little over 4 months!  Very expensive for just a few months use but I&#x27;ve never found anything close to this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, super loud and drys really really fast.  Amazon pricing is the best around.  just doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s worth all the extra money then the $30 one i bought, other then some extra weight to it.  guess it might last longer, but i could buy 2.5 of the other one for this one&#x27;s price, and i don&#x27;t see it lasting more then twice as long.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and blows a lot of air. Great dryer and really fast service. Very happy! What more can I say?</li>
            <li> My frizz is gone and my hair never looked so good. I love this hair dyer and recommended it to  my friends.  My hair stylist was the one who told me that this is the only brand hair styler she uses.</li>
            <li> Like the dryer but couldn&#x27;t register to activate the warranty online. When I went to the website all the \\&quot;beware of this web address\\&quot; warnings went off no matter which browser I used. So warranty is now useless to me.  It better not break!</li>
            <li> I have really thick fine hair and this drier dries my hair quickly as leaving it smooth. I used the babliss before for years which I loved but I may love this one more.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Supersolano after my old Ultra Chi was dropped and broken. (I didn&#x27;t buy a new one because it occasionally would blow cold air only and I learned this is a consistent problem with the Ultra Chi.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the heat and speed functions work really well, and my hair is generally smooth after a blow dry. My main issue isn&#x27;t the result but the actual dryer... it&#x27;s really heavy. If I were to go back in time, I&#x27;d definitely buy a lighter option.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and dries hair quickly. Similar to a dryer they&#x27;d use at a salon. Same hair dryers they have at Equinox.</li>
            <li> Best dryer on the market. Worth the money. Dries your hair very quickly without burning. Absolutely love the Cold setting, really does work to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the style. There are a few settings for hot and cold, all work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have had a Supersolano for about five years now.  I needed a new hair dryer for my vacation home.  With the reliability and performance of this product, there was no other choice for me.  Italian made so no worries about EMFs or Chinese junk.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to drop it.  Plastic case is weak.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that these units can be fixed at the factory for a very reasonable price...</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s me after blow drying my long hair with my old Conair 1875 Lite (bought circa 1999 around $10): \\&quot;Why&#x27;s my hair always so frizzy and looks so dry and fluffy?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s me after blow drying my long hair with the Super Solano 1875 Professional Dryer (bought 2012 around $130): \\&quot;Whoa....have we met?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, it cut my drying time in half, despite the fact I was fussing with my sectioning clips, it dried very quickly.  My hair came out shiny and smooth and laid beautifully.  The only disadvantage is that it is a little heavier than what I&#x27;m used to but I am sure I&#x27;ll acclimate to it.  Plus the longer nozzle will take adjusting.  All minor.  A bit expensive but I&#x27;ve been told by my hairdresser that if you want a good hair dryer, you should be prepared to spend around the $100+ mark.  But I love the way my hair looks so I think it&#x27;s worth it. Also, in the past I would put some Moroccan oil before and after styling as my hair felt so dry.  With the Super Solano, I only had to use the oil before as it looked soft and shiny after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pity I didn&#x27;t get it on Amazon taking advantage of some great prices, but I wanted to talk to someone in the industry so I forked out to a local business and I&#x27;m glad for them to have the $$ given the guidance they gave me.  But thought I&#x27;d write the review to help anyone who&#x27;s considering this product.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this blow dryer.  I read the other reviews and decided to buy it and I am so pleased!  I use this with a paddle brush and I have soft shiny hair and absolutely no &amp;#34;bushy-head&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a hair stylist some time ago, I wish I would have bought it sooner! Best hair dryer I have had!</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research before buying this hair dryer and I love it.  It dries my hair really fast.  It has a loop to hang it just like in a salon.  When traveling, I can really tell the difference when I have to use the hotel&#x27;s hair dryer.  I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. It is powerful and lasts forever. This is my second and i&#x27;ve had the first for years.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best hair dryer on the market.  I had a Solano about 30 years ago that lasted a very long time and have not found another one as good since then - I was elated to find this.  I blow dry my hair everyday and need one that is sturdy, well constructed and, one that will last longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t really get that hot - but with that said, may be better for your hair.  Takes me a long time to dry my hair however, so that is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> My hair dries very fast with this- isn&#x27;t that the whole point?  I wish the cord didn&#x27;t get so tangled all the time but at least I don&#x27;t feel like I&amp;#34;m frying my hair which is how it seems with other dryers.  They say this lasts a long time so if you&#x27;re going to buy a dryer, go ahead and get a good one.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries your hair quickly. It&#x27;s so powerful that if you&#x27;re not careful, your hair will be totally dry; you may have to wet it a bit to style.</li>
            <li> I buy a new \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; blow-dryer almost every year ($25-60)- and after a year they either seem to lose power or just break completely.  I got a $110 Chi a few years ago with a discount from my old stylist and it had a 1 year warranty and it broke down a week after the warranty was up.  Even the Chi didn&#x27;t at all seem worth the extra cash - so I have been reluctant to buy another more expensive one.  I asked my new stylist what he thinks and he recommended this $250 Solano that he sells, and then went on and on about why Solano is awesome, how it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair like other brands, etc...  I have fine thin hair, I am not going to spend $250 on a hair dryer!  So, I did some research on Solano and other brands, and this seemed by far the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;I got this in the mail yesterday and tried it out today.  AMAZING!  My hair dried faster than ever, and it also dried smooth- unlike the frizz from all other blowdryers including the Chi.  The air didn&#x27;t get all that hot so I was skeptical that it would dry smooth or fast at first but it was better than ever - so whatever technology they put into this actually works.  The dryer itself feels nice and solid- not plasticy cheap like my other ones, and so I was worried my arm would hurt after holding it up too long- but it dried so fast that didn&#x27;t become an issue.  The cord is long but not an issue- would be nice if they  made a slightly shorter cord - my bathroom isn&#x27;t a salon - I don&#x27;t need all that length.  I still cannot get over how smooth my hair is, almost like I used a straightening iron - but I didn&#x27;t!  I love this and wish I would&#x27;ve figured this one out years ago.  Nice to buy from your stylist so they can get a cut and stay in business, but this one was such a better deal I couldn&#x27;t resist!  I got the red/black one.</li>
            <li> Works as promised - no frizz - dries my medium long frizzy hair fast!  Would give it 5 stars if it was a bit lighter!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for granddaughter, she researched hair dyers and this was the best.  Really likes it and it does what it promised</li>
            <li> love my dryer its a great dryer for a great price, am a hairdresser and love it. love the warrenty on them to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best dryer for the money, and customer service and support is top notch. Solano has a warranty that not many can match.</li>
            <li> I am just an ordinary girl with really thick hair that LOVES my blow dryer.  Dries my hair in a fraction of the time that it took all of the other blow dryers that I have ever owned.  And I have gone through a lot of blow dryers!  I&#x27;ve had it for 5 years and not a single problem.  Just ordered one for my daughter.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this hairdryer, but it really didn&#x27;t work for me. I have long, very thick straight hair that is about five inches past my shoulders. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry with my Wigo hairdryer, so I was hoping to cut that time down by investing in a nicer hairdryer. While this one is pretty powerful (the airflow is very strong), it left my hair very tangled and difficult to brush. Even after brushing my hair the entire time I was drying it, I still could barely get my brush through my hair after drying with this hairdryer. The \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting on it is also just sort of warm-ish. I don&#x27;t want my hairdryer to be ridiculously hot, but I need more heat than this one offers to dry my hair within a reasonable amount of time. It still took me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair completely with this dryer. It also did not reduce frizz as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer does have a nice, sturdy cord that looks as though it&#x27;s resistant to curling up and tangling (a nice feature). It&#x27;s a little heavy, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> I am glad I mad the change!!  I have long been the person who did not see the need to spend money on a hairdryer.  I just could not comprehend why I needed to spend more that $20.  Well as someone with think and frizzy hair, I can tell you I was working way harder then I needed to. I purchased this hairdryer, at my stylist&#x27;s recommendation and I could see the difference right away.  I could actually achieve the soft silky hair that I walked out of her salon with in half the time and effort.  With that I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world.  I would caution you that it is a tad heavy and the on/off and temperature control buttons are easy to hit when you are holding it.  The noise level is acceptable and does not have that high pitched humm that many of them do.  Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  It dries my hair without drying it out.  It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but I love how solid it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this the others.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer very strong, hair get dry quickly. love it. I will buy again in future, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I use this dryer every saturday on my daughters curly hair. Its a very good dryer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a really good hair dryer and I definately found it in this one.  It has a lot of power and dries my hair quickly.  Also, it has a really long cord, which is good for me because I tend to sit down away from the plug while drying my hair.  The only negative might be that it&#x27;s pretty heavy, so it&#x27;s not the best for travelling.  I need that 5 lbs or so for shoes!</li>
            <li> My hair drying time is greatly reduced, by hair looks smoother, shinier and frizz is eliminated... fabulous hairdryer. I would recommend to anyone who has long thick hair but wants to wash in the morning instead of before bed, because you actually have the time. I am not needing to wash as often for some reason, no oils on scalp area, so still looks clean 3rd day, where previously it was needing washed every other.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer for my fiance and she loves it. She said it dries her hair around the same time as her $20 CVS dryer but with several key exceptions. Her hair was always greasy by the end of the day and she assumed it was because her conditioner was bad and/or she just had a sweaty head. After using this dryer though, she doesn&#x27;t have that issue anymore. Her assumption is that the old $20 CVS dryer wasn&#x27;t getter her hair completely dry to the core and root of the hair. It was dry to the touch but not truly dry. This dryer dries the hair completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also noticed (as did I) that her hair stays flat and straight all day. It doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much and the volume stays true. Her hair shines and stays &amp;#34;did&amp;#34; all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t blow really hard. If you&#x27;re looking for that kind of dryer I would look elsewhere. This dryer will get your hair completely dryer while also making your hair look saloon quality. In my opinion, it works smarter, not harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We couldn&#x27;t be more excited to own this dryer.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer on the market. Great performance. Dries hair quickly. I use with a Solano diffuser. For the price....you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. Doent get too hot like many other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; dryers. Little damage. Hair shines and feels much smoother. My last dryer was Chi. Singed hair. No temperature controls, only hot or cold. Left hair coarse and broke easily.&lt;br /&gt;Wold highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Supersolano 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Dryer.  Great dryer.  Nice, long cord. Several settings to choose.  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair frizzy!</li>
            <li> I splurged for my Solano after first using one at my swanky gym, which made me realize what I had been missing by using commercial brands at home (I previously owned a cheap Revlon). Drying takes half the time; hair stays soft and less damaged. Worth every penny and works as well today as the day I bought it two years ago. Never overheats. Anyone who dries their hair regularly should invest in one! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I had my last Super Solano for 10 years!  I bought the first one based on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  I was tired of buying the drugstore hair dyers that lasted a year or two.  I loved the product. After 10 years I needed a new one but I bought a TwinTurbo at a Beauty Supply shop who said they didn&#x27;t carry Super Solano any more.  I hated it after shelling out $85.00 with a no return policy!  Never thought to look on Amazon for the Solano since I thought it was only sold in Beauty Supply shops, but after the bad buy of the Twin Turbo, I continued my search and found it on Amazon for a good price and I am happy once again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product I do recomend it. One of the best in the market and is not that expensive. just great</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer based on reviews, but ended up returning it. It didn&#x27;t get very hot and it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> Gave this to a family member and have gotten rave reviews of its quality and improvement to the hair ever since.</li>
            <li> Powerful with multiple settings.  Easy to use.  Includes two accessories for drying straight hair.  Love the color!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my daughter because she loved using mine so much - it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Update: Received item long ago and its perfect, well made and will last another 18 years, probably longer since I no longer travel for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been in the entertainment business for over 24 years, and needed a product that would cut my drying time in half, and leave my hair looking great. I have a thick head full of straight, fine hair. After using a few different professional brands, of which all died rather quickly for their high price, I decided to ask my local beauty supply dealer his recommendation. Without hesitation he told me about how the Supersolano was an Italian masterpiece. I quickly purchased it. After years of use, abuse (dropping it, loaning it out), traveling around the nation and world, my super solano finally quit working yesterday. I was mortified, thinking I would never find the same model again. Surely the company has updated it several times over the years. However, I was happy to find the same model, same handle, same settings, shape, and size was still being made, and being sold right here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get use to something, and it works, its hard to switch. Two weeks ago my favorite chefs knife broke recently, after 20 years of use. After looking and searching, I finally had to settle on a different one. Its still a quality brand, with great reviews. I love my new knife, but am still getting use to it. Its kind of a love/hate relationship actually. It takes several months even years to really get use to a product. Like a knife, a musical instrumenet, etc...the hairdryer is a tool your hands get use to, which takes practice, precision, acurracy in finally achieving consistent results....This is how I feel about my new knife, learning all over again, and this is how I would have felt if I had to purchased an updated model of the Supersolano. Learning a new tool can be fun and rewarding, but when it comes to hair, I really want my trusted tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SOLANO for keeping it the same, making strong, long lasting dependable products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back to update this product review once I receive the item!</li>
            <li> It was all I thought it would be. Worth the prize I spent. I would recommend this to a friend. I also bought the solano diffuser.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! I never had a professional dryer before &amp; was a bit nervous putting out the $$ but it is totally worth it. The dryer is somewhat heavy in comparison to my drug store version but not a big deal. I love that it never gets too hot to touch. My hair looks much smoother; no frizz. The extra long cord is a bit much for a small bathroom, however, when I am elsewhere I don&#x27;t have to be overly concerned that a mirror &amp; outlet are not right next to each other. It is powerful; yet quiet.</li>
            <li> Smooth drying, easy to use, does not overheat you or or bathroom, effective and fast to dry long hair. &amp;#34;High-end salon&amp;#34; quality blow dryer.</li>
    </ol>
