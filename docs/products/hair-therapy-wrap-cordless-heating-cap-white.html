            <li>but it does get very, very warm</li>
            <li>After one use, my hair felt amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved this product because it is a great idea for hair treatment without bulky electrical cords to plug into outlets.  </li>
            <li>I heated it on the stove top per the instructions and it was heated perfectly evenly and lasted a good 20 - 30 min.</li>
            <li>The wrap turban fit on my head perfectly</li>

            <li>heat the wrap in the microwave for 40sec that will keep it warm for a good 30-50 min</li>
            <li>Use with hair oils like Argan, Coconut, or Tea Tree (for itchy scalp) Be sure to order the 100-pack plastic processing caps with it so it doesn&#x27;t get oily!</li>

            <li>Love this cap!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is amazing what 20 mins will do for your health and disposition.</li>
            <li>stays warm for about 30 min.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>Its nice.</li>
            <li>It was so convenient as there were no salons to go to, and I could do this in the comfort of my own living area.</li>
            <li>and this is bulky, but it does work well, stays warm and fits well.</li>
            <li>The gel pads do not evenly warm in the microwave.</li>
            <li>It does feel warm on my head for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>But I thought it was kind of heavier.</li>
            <li>Excellent arrival time and the product were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The packs get rather warm when I place them in water and heat them</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t own a microwave).  </li>
            <li>I use 2 mins to warm it up otherwise</li>
            <li>I boil the inserts, not microwave, and my head stayed warm for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>Worked great at first and delivered a good amount of heat to my hair</li>
            <li>All in, very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT - CONVINIENT AND PORTABLE AND ECONOMICAL -</li>
            <li>this baby is wonderful EASY to use easy on easy off easy in every way ..</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>very easy to assemble, you can heat the heating pads on stove top or microwave.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This works amazing, and a true energy saver!</li>
            <li>Easy to warm up and use.</li>
            <li>someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I  absolutely love love love the wrap.</li>
            <li>This was simple to use and heated up perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I took a chance and place this order.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these hair wrap.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow heating directions.</li>
            <li>Works better than the electrical type.</li>
            <li>You be more mobile when using it.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>so u keep having to give it more time in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I think using the thermal cap helps to maintain the heat and provides better distribution of heat.</li>
            <li>This cap with the use of the items, I indicated above provides impressive heat</li>
            <li>I can give this item 1-2 more stars.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It just seems more convenient as well.</li>
            <li>This thing is magic.</li>
            <li>This system made me love doing the hair masks.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good to have this heating cap.</li>
            <li>maybe making it like the satin sleep bonnet would be a better way of constructing it for a better fit.  </li>
            <li>i love that you are free to walk around.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freedom that this wireless :-)</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product so far, but I will say I found that the cap did not heat evenly in the microwave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and convenient!</li>
            <li>convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and as it says cordless, no worries of being electrocuted or being stuck with the cord.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy and convenient if you need heat to condition or color your hair.</li>
            <li>The out of stock ones that I did see online were $10 for a pack (no singles) so even in the best case scenario I would have to pay half the price of the product 6 weeks after purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable!</li>
            <li>and fortunately I haven&#x27;t had any explosions, but</li>
            <li>My deep conditioning sessions have greatly improved since purchasing this heat cap.  </li>
            <li>I will do a face mask and hair mask at the same time and this thing is great to really keep the hair mask warm and help it to absorb.</li>
            <li>, IT DOESN&#x27;T QUITE FIT.</li>
            <li>This makes my and electric cap or sitting under a hood dryer more economical.  </li>
            <li>They stay heated longer comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>FYI, if you&#x27;re looking for something to fit over curlers, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;wraps&amp;#34; closely but comfortably around the head.</li>
            <li>reality is that this cap did not even begin to fit.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the gel packs can be removed, which turns the cap into a convenient head towel when I&#x27;m done to catch all the water while keeping my hands free.</li>
            <li>Ideal for deep condition and Hot Oil therapy.</li>
            <li>Good whole head coverage.i recommend heating it up the packs in hot water as opposed to microwaving them.</li>
            <li>I love that fact that you aren&#x27;t under a hot dryer  </li>
            <li>i was really excited for this hair therapy warp</li>
            <li>My adult daughters and I share this wrap because we all love it!</li>
            <li>It is very helpful in my healthy hair growing regimen.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of entirely covering the hair (including the nape of the neck, the hairline in front, and the area around the ears).</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the gel packs heat all over and heat my entire head.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat cap for a while</li>
            <li>then I let it cool for 15min</li>
            <li>But overall still a good product</li>
            <li>Its not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, just put it in the microwave until it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great product</li>
            <li>The wrap doesn&#x27;t quite fit slimmingly to the head like the picture appears but it does cover fully and hits the key points of the hair line to be effective</li>
            <li>I make sure to use this cap after coloring my hair every time with the special conditioner that the color product comes with, hair turns out so soft and shinny!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and cools rapidly, so you have to keep rewarming it every 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Convenient, great quality, DC for 20-30 mns after heating for one minute and a half in microwave.</li>
            <li>Gets hot!</li>
            <li>The only con I have is that it is kind of cumbersome on my head-</li>
            <li>SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG AS IT DOES MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SO SOFT AFTER USING.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>I use it, but it&#x27;s only minimally effective.</li>
            <li>worth well</li>
            <li>u can move around and complete ur chores while taking care of ur hair :)</li>
            <li>I use it every two week on my natural hair and I am in love.</li>
            <li>I actually fall asleep with this on my head because it&#x27;s so soothing &amp; warm</li>
            <li>I am using another product right now</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find it here for such a low price.</li>
            <li>You have to ensure that the plastic inserts are warm to make sure you get the full potential for heating and wrap it tight.</li>
            <li>and I did the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I love this deep conditioning cap.</li>
            <li>It stays hot for over 30 minutes, though.  </li>
            <li>I wish the hot pack stayed hotter longer.</li>
            <li>Just a note to remember, it works best if you have a small to medium head and hair size since its a one size fits all so it can wrap properly all over.</li>
            <li>So I was lukewarm on the cap in the first place.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking/hoping for, I want something that I can sleep in as well</li>
            <li>Definitely more committed to a deep conditioning process.</li>
            <li>I used it twice for a hot oil treatment and it worked well.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to skip my routine while away from home (if you go on vacation somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have a microwave, you can heat the gel packs up with hot water).</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I like my packs to get hot</li>
            <li>and when you wam them up it want feel like they are hot</li>
            <li>it may not feel hot</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on and get going but not it does not cover full head if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>The gels get very warm, and retain the warmth for about 20 minutes, which is how long I prefer to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice heat wrap, although if you have a lot of hair it can be it bit difficult to fit under the wrap.</li>
            <li>But when the first time I used it, wow!!!</li>
            <li>After so much usage (I used it every week for three months straight), the gel packs doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li>Easy and simple!</li>
            <li>Did not get hot enough for real hot treatment.</li>
            <li>I held out hope that it would fit, despite some reviews that commented about a tight fit for those with a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just throw this heating cap in microwave for a minute and half, it keeps my hair warm for at least 20 minutes which is an ideal timing for deep conditioning in summer.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>: the cap itself is microwave-safe, so you can just put the whole thing in (assuming, of course, that you follow the heating directions).</li>
            <li>I really like the hair therapy wrap.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really notice the temperature until its on Your Head.</li>
            <li>so I appreciated the fact it covered my nape area.  </li>
            <li>I found it very nerve racking to heat it in the microwave before use.</li>
            <li>My hair is much smoother, silkier, softer.</li>
            <li>Too much work to do to heal it up.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting too much from this Hair wrap.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting my whole head would have some contact and get some heat.  </li>
            <li>Very useful cap that allows me to deep condition my hair.  </li>
            <li>When I am home and condition my hair in between appointments, I can clean, care for my baby, do laundry, etc... and it definitely makes the time go faster.</li>
            <li>The only unique benefit I see to this cap is that it cools gradually which eliminates the extra step of waiting for your hair to cool before rinsing.</li>
            <li>It really holds the heat for more than half hour.</li>
            <li>Replacing the gel packs cost as much as buying a new product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Highly buying recommend this item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instant return and start of a new product search...</li>
            <li>The rewarming process requires watching it very carefully and doing it in increments letting it cool for a little bit before reheating some more.</li>
            <li>The gel pack inside the cap does not get hot enough</li>
            <li>Prior to washing my hair, I gave myself a hot oil treatment and used my electric cap.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The gel inserts gets hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>The product itself does what exactly it described here, but just wish it could have last longer than 2 months</li>
            <li>but the first time I stuck this thing in the microwave, one of the gel packs burst and started sparking and burning almost instantly.</li>
            <li>You also need to move it around otherwise some packs overheat while other parts remain cool.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to overheat it like I did the first time!</li>
            <li>The box clearly states that included with the wrap</li>
            <li>My whole head is heated and has been for the last twenty minuets and still counting!!!</li>
            <li>I got this to replace a different microwaveable heat cap, and much prefer this one.</li>
            <li>I despise sitting under hair dryers to saturate products on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I like the freedom it offers</li>
            <li>, I needed some heat action for my herbs hair mask</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t make it through the natural journey without it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after using this</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this out as an alternative to sitting under the hair dryer when doing my deep conditionting treatment, but I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and one of the gel packs exploded!!!</li>
            <li>I had to let it cool down then put it on.  </li>
            <li>The gel packs are a pain to remove and heat up properly, then you have to put the hot gel packs back into the cap...</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this a 2 star is because of the quality, the first one I ordered only last 2 months.</li>
            <li>(Be careful gel insets can be heated to become too hot, follow manufactures instructions.)  </li>
            <li>It has really helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t stay hot long enough, 15 mins top.</li>
            <li>I like to deep condition my hair, put on a face mask, and maybe do a clay foot bath at the same time and really give myself the spa treatment.  </li>
            <li>and now they barely heat up.  </li>
            <li>I was deployed and used it on my natural hair weekly during my deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>The one thing is that it is a bit hot on your ears, especially if you heat to packs too long, but it does hold the heat needed for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>This cap seemed promising based upon other reviews.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like at first was the feeling of having a heavy head</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can get a good 20-30 minutes of heat out of the wrap and can continue moving about the house.  </li>
            <li> it so easy to use and works well!!</li>
            <li> I love it works beautiful for me</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> heat the wrap in the microwave for 40sec that will keep it warm for a good 30-50 min</li>
            <li> Use with hair oils like Argan, Coconut, or Tea Tree (for itchy scalp) Be sure to order the 100-pack plastic processing caps with it so it doesn&#x27;t get oily!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this cap!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is amazing what 20 mins will do for your health and disposition.</li>
            <li> stays warm for about 30 min.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> Its nice.</li>
            <li> It was so convenient as there were no salons to go to, and I could do this in the comfort of my own living area.</li>
            <li> and this is bulky, but it does work well, stays warm and fits well.</li>
            <li> The gel pads do not evenly warm in the microwave.</li>
            <li> It does feel warm on my head for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> But I thought it was kind of heavier.</li>
            <li> Excellent arrival time and the product were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The packs get rather warm when I place them in water and heat them</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t own a microwave).  </li>
            <li> I use 2 mins to warm it up otherwise</li>
            <li> I boil the inserts, not microwave, and my head stayed warm for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> Worked great at first and delivered a good amount of heat to my hair</li>
            <li> All in, very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT - CONVINIENT AND PORTABLE AND ECONOMICAL -</li>
            <li> this baby is wonderful EASY to use easy on easy off easy in every way ..</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> very easy to assemble, you can heat the heating pads on stove top or microwave.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This works amazing, and a true energy saver!</li>
            <li> Easy to warm up and use.</li>
            <li> someone else will have better luck.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love love love the wrap.</li>
            <li> This was simple to use and heated up perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I took a chance and place this order.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love these hair wrap.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to follow heating directions.</li>
            <li> Works better than the electrical type.</li>
            <li> You be more mobile when using it.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> so u keep having to give it more time in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I think using the thermal cap helps to maintain the heat and provides better distribution of heat.</li>
            <li> This cap with the use of the items, I indicated above provides impressive heat</li>
            <li> I can give this item 1-2 more stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It just seems more convenient as well.</li>
            <li> This thing is magic.</li>
            <li> This system made me love doing the hair masks.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good to have this heating cap.</li>
            <li> maybe making it like the satin sleep bonnet would be a better way of constructing it for a better fit.  </li>
            <li> i love that you are free to walk around.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the freedom that this wireless :-)</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product so far, but I will say I found that the cap did not heat evenly in the microwave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and convenient!</li>
            <li> convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and as it says cordless, no worries of being electrocuted or being stuck with the cord.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy and convenient if you need heat to condition or color your hair.</li>
            <li> The out of stock ones that I did see online were $10 for a pack (no singles) so even in the best case scenario I would have to pay half the price of the product 6 weeks after purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Super comfortable!</li>
            <li> and fortunately I haven&#x27;t had any explosions, but</li>
            <li> My deep conditioning sessions have greatly improved since purchasing this heat cap.  </li>
            <li> I will do a face mask and hair mask at the same time and this thing is great to really keep the hair mask warm and help it to absorb.</li>
            <li> , IT DOESN&#x27;T QUITE FIT.</li>
            <li> This makes my and electric cap or sitting under a hood dryer more economical.  </li>
            <li> They stay heated longer comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> FYI, if you&#x27;re looking for something to fit over curlers, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;wraps&amp;#34; closely but comfortably around the head.</li>
            <li> reality is that this cap did not even begin to fit.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the gel packs can be removed, which turns the cap into a convenient head towel when I&#x27;m done to catch all the water while keeping my hands free.</li>
            <li> Ideal for deep condition and Hot Oil therapy.</li>
            <li> Good whole head coverage.i recommend heating it up the packs in hot water as opposed to microwaving them.</li>
            <li> I love that fact that you aren&#x27;t under a hot dryer  </li>
            <li> i was really excited for this hair therapy warp</li>
            <li> My adult daughters and I share this wrap because we all love it!</li>
            <li> It is very helpful in my healthy hair growing regimen.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of entirely covering the hair (including the nape of the neck, the hairline in front, and the area around the ears).</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the gel packs heat all over and heat my entire head.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat cap for a while</li>
            <li> then I let it cool for 15min</li>
            <li> But overall still a good product</li>
            <li> Its not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, just put it in the microwave until it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great product</li>
            <li> The wrap doesn&#x27;t quite fit slimmingly to the head like the picture appears but it does cover fully and hits the key points of the hair line to be effective</li>
            <li> I make sure to use this cap after coloring my hair every time with the special conditioner that the color product comes with, hair turns out so soft and shinny!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and cools rapidly, so you have to keep rewarming it every 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Convenient, great quality, DC for 20-30 mns after heating for one minute and a half in microwave.</li>
            <li> Gets hot!</li>
            <li> The only con I have is that it is kind of cumbersome on my head-</li>
            <li> SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG AS IT DOES MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SO SOFT AFTER USING.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> I use it, but it&#x27;s only minimally effective.</li>
            <li> worth well</li>
            <li> u can move around and complete ur chores while taking care of ur hair :)</li>
            <li> I use it every two week on my natural hair and I am in love.</li>
            <li> I actually fall asleep with this on my head because it&#x27;s so soothing &amp; warm</li>
            <li> I am using another product right now</li>
            <li> and I was happy to find it here for such a low price.</li>
            <li> You have to ensure that the plastic inserts are warm to make sure you get the full potential for heating and wrap it tight.</li>
            <li> and I did the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioning cap.</li>
            <li> It stays hot for over 30 minutes, though.  </li>
            <li> I wish the hot pack stayed hotter longer.</li>
            <li> Just a note to remember, it works best if you have a small to medium head and hair size since its a one size fits all so it can wrap properly all over.</li>
            <li> So I was lukewarm on the cap in the first place.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking/hoping for, I want something that I can sleep in as well</li>
            <li> Definitely more committed to a deep conditioning process.</li>
            <li> I used it twice for a hot oil treatment and it worked well.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to skip my routine while away from home (if you go on vacation somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have a microwave, you can heat the gel packs up with hot water).</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I like my packs to get hot</li>
            <li> and when you wam them up it want feel like they are hot</li>
            <li> it may not feel hot</li>
            <li> It is easy to put on and get going but not it does not cover full head if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> The gels get very warm, and retain the warmth for about 20 minutes, which is how long I prefer to deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice heat wrap, although if you have a lot of hair it can be it bit difficult to fit under the wrap.</li>
            <li> But when the first time I used it, wow!!!</li>
            <li> After so much usage (I used it every week for three months straight), the gel packs doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple!</li>
            <li> Did not get hot enough for real hot treatment.</li>
            <li> I held out hope that it would fit, despite some reviews that commented about a tight fit for those with a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just throw this heating cap in microwave for a minute and half, it keeps my hair warm for at least 20 minutes which is an ideal timing for deep conditioning in summer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> : the cap itself is microwave-safe, so you can just put the whole thing in (assuming, of course, that you follow the heating directions).</li>
            <li> I really like the hair therapy wrap.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t really notice the temperature until its on Your Head.</li>
            <li> so I appreciated the fact it covered my nape area.  </li>
            <li> I found it very nerve racking to heat it in the microwave before use.</li>
            <li> My hair is much smoother, silkier, softer.</li>
            <li> Too much work to do to heal it up.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much from this Hair wrap.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting my whole head would have some contact and get some heat.  </li>
            <li> Very useful cap that allows me to deep condition my hair.  </li>
            <li> When I am home and condition my hair in between appointments, I can clean, care for my baby, do laundry, etc... and it definitely makes the time go faster.</li>
            <li> The only unique benefit I see to this cap is that it cools gradually which eliminates the extra step of waiting for your hair to cool before rinsing.</li>
            <li> It really holds the heat for more than half hour.</li>
            <li> Replacing the gel packs cost as much as buying a new product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Highly buying recommend this item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instant return and start of a new product search...</li>
            <li> The rewarming process requires watching it very carefully and doing it in increments letting it cool for a little bit before reheating some more.</li>
            <li> The gel pack inside the cap does not get hot enough</li>
            <li> Prior to washing my hair, I gave myself a hot oil treatment and used my electric cap.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The gel inserts gets hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> The product itself does what exactly it described here, but just wish it could have last longer than 2 months</li>
            <li> but the first time I stuck this thing in the microwave, one of the gel packs burst and started sparking and burning almost instantly.</li>
            <li> You also need to move it around otherwise some packs overheat while other parts remain cool.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to overheat it like I did the first time!</li>
            <li> The box clearly states that included with the wrap</li>
            <li> My whole head is heated and has been for the last twenty minuets and still counting!!!</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a different microwaveable heat cap, and much prefer this one.</li>
            <li> I despise sitting under hair dryers to saturate products on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I like the freedom it offers</li>
            <li> , I needed some heat action for my herbs hair mask</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t make it through the natural journey without it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using this</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this out as an alternative to sitting under the hair dryer when doing my deep conditionting treatment, but I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and one of the gel packs exploded!!!</li>
            <li> I had to let it cool down then put it on.  </li>
            <li> The gel packs are a pain to remove and heat up properly, then you have to put the hot gel packs back into the cap...</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 2 star is because of the quality, the first one I ordered only last 2 months.</li>
            <li> (Be careful gel insets can be heated to become too hot, follow manufactures instructions.)  </li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t stay hot long enough, 15 mins top.</li>
            <li> I like to deep condition my hair, put on a face mask, and maybe do a clay foot bath at the same time and really give myself the spa treatment.  </li>
            <li> and now they barely heat up.  </li>
            <li> I was deployed and used it on my natural hair weekly during my deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> The one thing is that it is a bit hot on your ears, especially if you heat to packs too long, but it does hold the heat needed for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> This cap seemed promising based upon other reviews.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like at first was the feeling of having a heavy head</li>
            <li> It was alright for the first two times I used it and then after that the gel packs shrunk and became hard</li>
            <li> But seeing how easy it is to burst gel packs and difficult it is to reheat (especially since microwave strengths vary)</li>
            <li> You have to go through to much to get a small amount of heat.</li>
            <li> and it will not last long at all..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;THE MINUS SIDE ( FOR ME ) IS I HAVE A SHORT HAIRSTYLE ( TO THE SHOULDERS )</li>
            <li> I can sit for a long time with this on my head.  </li>
            <li> I only have it a 4 because I tried to order it in pink</li>
            <li> This cap allows me to get other things done while deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> You can reheat it if you think its not hot enough for you.</li>
            <li> Dry heat alone no longer does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a little while and the gel packs didn&#x27;t hold up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little larger to cover all of my hair/head.</li>
            <li> it was comfortable and it came with plastic hair capes  to wear underneath to protect it for getting dirty  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my electric cap will not be used much in the future.    </li>
            <li> Which was the only time I used it because the heating packs melted and where no longer operable not to mention the heavy weight of the wrap.</li>
            <li> Be careful when heating the gel inserts.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL not to overheat the plastic inserts.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful when you heat the packs....</li>
            <li> Works just like any other corded heated hair wrap.</li>
            <li> I like that I can do other things while I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> and you can move around doing other stuff.</li>
            <li> Most disappointing!</li>
            <li> I was concerned with some of the reviews I read about uneven heating,  but if it&#x27;s wrapped properly and tightly there should be no problem.</li>
            <li> Gel things keep my hair toasty for at least a solid hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing braids that I take down every 3 weeks to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> once you do it once you get the routine down pat.  </li>
            <li> This cap might work for those with tiny heads and little hair, but it is hard to believe that it fits the average</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m getting a little weary of purchasing things that have to be plugged in, I decided to try this cordless wrap.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to get them into the sleeves, but</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S A LITTLE HEAVY BECAUSE OF THE PACKS,</li>
            <li> I was afraid i would heat it too much.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Even came with a few plastic caps.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend but please be patient when heating up because it takes a few spins in the microwave before it gets going.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> heating tubes are heavy and don&#x27;t work well with cap when it is tied on head,</li>
            <li> Otherwise it might be a little too small if you have a big head and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was restricted to one small area.</li>
            <li> Fits snugly on my head so I can move around and take of my business or just lay on the couch and be lazy.</li>
            <li> Not very good and the heat cap does not hold heat well.</li>
            <li> akward and hard to wrap.</li>
            <li> Not a good concept.</li>
            <li> Not for anyone with very thick or curly hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll never buy this again sorry</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the manufacturer&#x27;s customer service.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> White is a terrible color</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the fabric got destroyed after one wash.</li>
            <li> I used to use my blow-dryer to deep condition hair for 20 minutes over a shower cap which was very inconvenient and quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Aside from it being dirty</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was afraid of the electric ones.</li>
            <li> i found it there is no replacement :(</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this heat cap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!! It really holds the heat for more than half hour. Great for hair treatments!</li>
            <li> My adult daughters and I share this wrap because we all love it! Use with hair oils like Argan, Coconut, or Tea Tree (for itchy scalp) Be sure to order the 100-pack plastic processing caps with it so it doesn&#x27;t get oily!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this and I did the first time I used it.  Which was the only time I used it because the heating packs melted and where no longer operable not to mention the heavy weight of the wrap. .although I could walk around and do things. .I was a bobble head while doing So. ..constantly having to adjust the straps didn&#x27;t help either. .maybe someone else will have better luck. but I&#x27;ll never buy this again sorry</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I can deep condition my hair and cook dinner!  You have to ensure that the plastic inserts are warm to make sure you get the full potential for heating and wrap it tight. I was concerned with some of the reviews I read about uneven heating,  but if it&#x27;s wrapped properly and tightly there should be no problem.</li>
            <li> Replacing the gel packs cost as much as buying a new product. Not impressed with the manufacturer&#x27;s customer service. I&#x27;ve only had the product a little while and the gel packs didn&#x27;t hold up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I love it works beautiful for me</li>
            <li> Works well.  stays warm for about 30 min.  good cordless product!</li>
            <li> Im using this wrap as I type. I boiled the gel packs instead of microwave. Love it. My whole head is heated and has been for the last twenty minuets and still counting!!! I. Sold. Will update if any changes!</li>
            <li> Very nice heat wrap, although if you have a lot of hair it can be it bit difficult to fit under the wrap.</li>
            <li> It does the job perfectly. I don&#x27;t have to sit in one spot, I can do stuff around the house and still deep condition my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioning cap. I&#x27;m wearing braids that I take down every 3 weeks to wash my hair. This cap allows me to get other things done while deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love love love the wrap. I would definitely recommend it. I love that fact that you aren&#x27;t under a hot dryer  and you can move around while conditioning your hair. Amazing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I used this for my deep conditiong treatment for my hair. This was simple to use and heated up perfectly. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The gel packs are a pain to remove and heat up properly, then you have to put the hot gel packs back into the cap... Not a good concept. I&#x27;ll admit, the handful of times I&#x27;ve used this cap, I put the entire thing in the microwave and fortunately I haven&#x27;t had any explosions, but it doesn&#x27;t matter how you heat it, the cap misses the mark. You&#x27;ll get the same results if you wrap your hair in a plastic bag and a towel.</li>
            <li> This does not work. It was alright for the first two times I used it and then after that the gel packs shrunk and became hard and now they barely heat up.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> My deep conditioning sessions have greatly improved since purchasing this heat cap.  The only con I have is that it is kind of cumbersome on my head- maybe making it like the satin sleep bonnet would be a better way of constructing it for a better fit.  It stays hot for over 30 minutes, though.  It is very helpful in my healthy hair growing regimen.</li>
            <li> I wish the hot pack stayed hotter longer. Other than that this is a great product and I am so glad that I took a chance and place this order. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a different microwaveable heat cap, and much prefer this one. It does a good job of entirely covering the hair (including the nape of the neck, the hairline in front, and the area around the ears). And I like that you don&#x27;t have to remove the heat packs from the cap to microwave them: the cap itself is microwave-safe, so you can just put the whole thing in (assuming, of course, that you follow the heating directions). All in, very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I love it.</li>
            <li> Not very good and the heat cap does not hold heat well.</li>
            <li> I had one before but I left it at a friends house and she got kicked out/moved so I&#x27;m not gonna bother getting that one. I haven&#x27;t used this one yet but if I have problems I will update.</li>
            <li> Mobile Deep Conditioning.  I despise sitting under hair dryers to saturate products on my natural hair. I have had this product almost  6 months and have not had to replace the gel paks yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like at all... I am very unhappy with this heat cap.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to use the microwave for heating and it will not last long at all..  I wanted to return it but the cost.  So it&#x27;s just sitting in my trunk...</li>
            <li> This is great if you&#x27;re having a pamper day! I will do a face mask and hair mask at the same time and this thing is great to really keep the hair mask warm and help it to absorb. It&#x27;s super easy to use, just put it in the microwave until it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> I really like the hair therapy wrap. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient and easy to use. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t stay hot long enough, 15 mins top. Still, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It came with some stains on it. But it worked when I used it. Aside from it being dirty it works</li>
            <li> I love these hair wrap. Easy to use and as it says cordless, no worries of being electrocuted or being stuck with the cord. Works just like any other corded heated hair wrap. Just a note to remember, it works best if you have a small to medium head and hair size since its a one size fits all so it can wrap properly all over. Otherwise it might be a little too small if you have a big head and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> i read some of the review and i was worried that it wont work on me.  But when the first time I used it, wow!!! Amazing!! it so easy to use and works well!!</li>
            <li> I liked it. It is easy to put on and get going but not it does not cover full head if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> The wrap doesn&#x27;t quite fit slimmingly to the head like the picture appears but it does cover fully and hits the key points of the hair line to be effective</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It is easy to use. It holds heat very good. When I used it on my hair it gave me a very good heat treatment. My hair was moisturized and conditioned after using it . I recommend  this product. It does what it says it will do. I give it 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> i was really excited for this hair therapy warp&lt;br /&gt;dose work !?&lt;br /&gt;yes it dose and its wonderful i used it with mask (hair mayonnaise +avocado and honey ) it was comfortable and it came with plastic hair capes  to wear underneath to protect it for getting dirty  but the downside and what got me give this a 2 stars is my gel pads started leaking from the sides i don&#x27;t know if i can use it again i will have to try but what if i couldn&#x27;t how would i use this again and then i came back here i found it there is no replacement :( any idea where or how i can fix this ?!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Never cared for sitting under a dryer and never used a heating cap before.  Surprisingly, the gel packs heat all over and heat my entire head.  Even came with a few plastic caps.  Highly recommend this.  Be sure to follow heating directions.</li>
            <li> THE PLUS SIDE IS I CAN MOVE AROUND WHILE USING IT.&lt;br /&gt;THE MINUS SIDE ( FOR ME ) IS I HAVE A SHORT HAIRSTYLE ( TO THE SHOULDERS ) AND I HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING MY HAIR UP UNDER THE HAT, IT DOESN&#x27;T QUITE FIT. AND IT&#x27;S A LITTLE HEAVY BECAUSE OF THE PACKS, MAYBE THAT&#x27;S WHY IT SLIPS.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;LL STILL USE IT TIL SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG AS IT DOES MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SO SOFT AFTER USING.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I WISH IT HELD THE HEAT LONGER,  I ORDERED 2 OF THEM SO THAT I CAN HEAT ANOTHER UP, SO I JUST SWITCH &amp; CONTINUE !</li>
            <li> Its nice. I use this to do oil treatments once a week. Its not bad. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not get hot enough for real hot treatment.</li>
            <li> Works better than the electrical type. Let&#x27;s You be more mobile when using it. Gets hot! Be careful when heating the gel inserts. You won&#x27;t really notice the temperature until its on Your Head. Ideal for deep condition and Hot Oil therapy. Suggest using the plastic cap/ liner that is included.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I&#x27;ve been looking for a heat cap for a while and I was happy to find it here for such a low price. Just be careful not to overheat it like I did the first time! I thought it wasn&#x27;t heating up until I put it on my head</li>
            <li> i love this heating cap!! very easy to assemble, you can heat the heating pads on stove top or microwave. i love that you are free to walk around.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair therapy wrap!! I was deployed and used it on my natural hair weekly during my deep conditioner. It was so convenient as there were no salons to go to, and I could do this in the comfort of my own living area. After so much usage (I used it every week for three months straight), the gel packs doesn&#x27;t get as hot. I may be purchasing more gel packs, but the bonnet is a miracle!!</li>
            <li> Its ok. The gel pack inside the cap does not get hot enough so u keep having to give it more time in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I am on my computer with my hair therapy wrap on my head.  I have a plastic cap and an thermal hair conditioning cap by Urban Essence under the therapy wrap.  I can feel the heat. I think using the thermal cap helps to maintain the heat and provides better distribution of heat. The best part is I can move around while conditioning my hair.    I wanted to compare my electric heating cap with this cordless one. Prior to washing my hair, I gave myself a hot oil treatment and used my electric cap.  I was restricted to one small area. This cap with the use of the items, I indicated above provides impressive heat and I do not have to worry about it overheating. Needless to say, my electric cap will not be used much in the future.    The only problem with this wrap is that the Velcro pieces that are supposed to hold the two ends together does not stick so I had to tie the ends together.    Bottom line is that it works for me and I will purchase another one to have as a back-up.</li>
            <li> Great product .. works well !</li>
            <li> Product worked as stated,  I just wish it could get hotter for what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and convenient! U can still walk around the house and talk on the phone without screaming or repeatedly saying, &amp;#34;huh,&amp;#34; like if you were sitting under a hooded dryer!</li>
            <li> So I was lukewarm on the cap in the first place. The wrap turban fit on my head perfectly and I have a big head and very low hairline in both the front and the back so I appreciated the fact it covered my nape area.  I like the freedom it offers but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and cools rapidly, so you have to keep rewarming it every 15 minutes. The rewarming process requires watching it very carefully and doing it in increments letting it cool for a little bit before reheating some more. You also need to move it around otherwise some packs overheat while other parts remain cool. I have an 1000W microwave and It takes me about three cycles of heat and wait to get 15 minutes of heat. Add baby and chores to the mix and I often get distracted, overcool and have to start from scratch. It is not as simple as reheating a cup of coffee.  I use it 1-2 times a week for 6 weeks and the gel pack burst. The return/replacement window for Amazon is one month on this product so I missed it by almost 2 weeks. I have looked in vain for gel pack replacements and there are none to be had on October 19, 2014.  I have contacted the manufacturer, They currently do not have a webstore. If they get back to me and have replacement gel packs for sale I can give this item 1-2 more stars. But seeing how easy it is to burst gel packs and difficult it is to reheat (especially since microwave strengths vary) I would have to give this only 1 star since there are no replacement gel packs for sale. The out of stock ones that I did see online were $10 for a pack (no singles) so even in the best case scenario I would have to pay half the price of the product 6 weeks after purchasing it. This makes my and electric cap or sitting under a hood dryer more economical.  The only unique benefit I see to this cap is that it cools gradually which eliminates the extra step of waiting for your hair to cool before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Loved the practicality and ease! I like a lot that you can wash the cap and you can heat up the elements in the microwave</li>
            <li> Love this cap! It has really helped my dry hair. And there&#x27;s no cord! It works great!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking/hoping for, I want something that I can sleep in as well and this is bulky, but it does work well, stays warm and fits well.</li>
            <li> Good whole head coverage.i recommend heating it up the packs in hot water as opposed to microwaving them. They stay heated longer comfortable fit. Very satisfied. Good price.</li>
            <li> I use it, but it&#x27;s only minimally effective.</li>
            <li> works well. have to heat it for longer than suggested though. may be the power of my microwave.</li>
            <li> You have to go through to much to get a small amount of heat.</li>
            <li> This wrap has changed the way I deep condition.  I enjoy the freedom that this wireless :-) cap allows me to move around while applying heat to my scalpe.  BE CAREFUL not to overheat the plastic inserts.  I think I almost burned my scaple.  I had to let it cool down then put it on.  Awesome.....</li>
            <li> The gel pads do not evenly warm in the microwave. It does feel warm on my head for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  I can sit for a long time with this on my head.  I like that I can do other things while I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT - CONVINIENT AND PORTABLE AND ECONOMICAL - DOES THE JOB GREAT!!! I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO NEED TO CURE THEIR HAIR</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Easy and simple!</li>
            <li> I like this because it has no cord and you can move around doing other stuff. The one thing is that it is a bit hot on your ears, especially if you heat to packs too long, but it does hold the heat needed for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is I can put it on and work around the house.  I didn&#x27;t like being stuck under a hair dryer or steamer.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like at first was the feeling of having a heavy head but you get used to it and forget you have it on.</li>
            <li> This item I would recomend it worked the way everyone said it would work. I wish it was a little larger to cover all of my hair/head. Great item overal!</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Gel things keep my hair toasty for at least a solid hour. Works great with my conditioning treatments!</li>
            <li> Easy to warm up and use. It does seem to help with the conditioning process.</li>
            <li> My biggest challenge with deep conditioning is that I don&#x27;t like to feel immobilized for the heat time.  This product eliminates that.  I can get a good 20-30 minutes of heat out of the wrap and can continue moving about the house.  Definitely more committed to a deep conditioning process.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT , I needed some heat action for my herbs hair mask this baby is wonderful EASY to use easy on easy off easy in every way ..&lt;br /&gt;I heat the wrap in the microwave for 40sec that will keep it warm for a good 30-50 min then I let it cool for 15min be4 re-heat it again ... my herb mask use to take 2-3 hours, with hair therapy babe 1:30 hour and the work is done!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Hair</li>
            <li> worth well the price and u can move around and complete ur chores while taking care of ur hair :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once. I found it very nerve racking to heat it in the microwave before use. I was afraid i would heat it too much. I plan to try it again.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product so far, but I will say I found that the cap did not heat evenly in the microwave. I heated it on the stove top per the instructions and it was heated perfectly evenly and lasted a good 20 - 30 min. I will definitely use it weekly to enhance my at home deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was afraid of the electric ones. It just seems more convenient as well. Just microwave and there you go.</li>
            <li> I bought this cap last year and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. I use it every two week on my natural hair and I am in love. I wouldn&#x27;t make it through the natural journey without it. I don&#x27;t know how I would make it.. I only have it a 4 because I tried to order it in pink and it came in brown, ugh! Well it&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault so I guess it&#x27;s a 5! No complaints.</li>
            <li> This hair therapy wrap/cordless heating cap is awesome!  So easy and convenient if you need heat to condition or color your hair. FYI, if you&#x27;re looking for something to fit over curlers, this is NOT the product for you. It&#x27;s for &amp;#34;hair therapy&amp;#34; with heat. It &amp;#34;wraps&amp;#34; closely but comfortably around the head.</li>
            <li> Works great but the gel packs get folded. White is a terrible color</li>
            <li> This cap seemed promising based upon other reviews.  I held out hope that it would fit, despite some reviews that commented about a tight fit for those with a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that this cap did not even begin to fit.  The straps that hold it on did not reach around to fasten via the velcro pad on the front of the cap.  This cap might work for those with tiny heads and little hair, but it is hard to believe that it fits the average user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instant return and start of a new product search...</li>
            <li> This thing is magic. My hair is so soft after using this</li>
            <li> I like the design.You can reheat it if you think its not hot enough for you. But I thought it was kind of heavier. I used it twice for a hot oil treatment and it worked well.</li>
            <li> This wrap is perfect. Because I&#x27;m getting a little weary of purchasing things that have to be plugged in, I decided to try this cordless wrap. The gels get very warm, and retain the warmth for about 20 minutes, which is how long I prefer to deep condition my hair. I also like that the gel packs can be removed, which turns the cap into a convenient head towel when I&#x27;m done to catch all the water while keeping my hands free. I&#x27;ve even packed this up in my suitcase to go on vacation for a couple weeks so I didn&#x27;t have to skip my routine while away from home (if you go on vacation somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have a microwave, you can heat the gel packs up with hot water). The only con that I see is that I wish the back flap were a couple inches longer.</li>
            <li> I loved this product because it is a great idea for hair treatment without bulky electrical cords to plug into outlets.  The gel inserts gets hot enough to do the job. (Be careful gel insets can be heated to become too hot, follow manufactures instructions.)  Excellent arrival time and the product were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  The reason I gave this a 2 star is because of the quality, the first one I ordered only last 2 months. Then the wrap burst at the edge.  The product itself does what exactly it described here, but just wish it could have last longer than 2 months ( I only use it once a week)!</li>
            <li> Well maybe it&#x27;s me but the first time I stuck this thing in the microwave, one of the gel packs burst and started sparking and burning almost instantly. Could have been my fault. But it burned a hole in one of the sides. It&#x27;s tiny, so I still used it with a rag covering the part that would touch me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of this so I&#x27;ll probably order another one or something similar.</li>
            <li> It does make a difference! My hair is much smoother, silkier, softer. I use it now on weekly bases. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the Hair Therapy Wrap, set up the gel packs in the wrap in anticipation of using it, to find that no plastic disposable caps had been sent with it. The box clearly states that included with the wrap come 3 plastic disposable caps to wear under the wrap but there were none included in my box...Most disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very useful cap that allows me to deep condition my hair.  The packs get rather warm when I place them in water and heat them (I don&#x27;t own a microwave).  It is a little tricky to get them into the sleeves, but once you do it once you get the routine down pat.  I like to deep condition my hair, put on a face mask, and maybe do a clay foot bath at the same time and really give myself the spa treatment.  It is amazing what 20 mins will do for your health and disposition.</li>
            <li> works great &amp; does the job! Super comfortable! I actually fall asleep with this on my head because it&#x27;s so soothing &amp; warm</li>
            <li> This works amazing, and a true energy saver! I used to use my blow-dryer to deep condition hair for 20 minutes over a shower cap which was very inconvenient and quite annoying. Just throw this heating cap in microwave for a minute and half, it keeps my hair warm for at least 20 minutes which is an ideal timing for deep conditioning in summer. I make sure to use this cap after coloring my hair every time with the special conditioner that the color product comes with, hair turns out so soft and shinny!</li>
            <li> It really works! Yes, you have to heat it up in the microwave but it does get very, very warm and you can move around while deep conditioning your hair. My hairdresser uses an electric heat cap which must be plugged in and I can&#x27;t move while it&#x27;s on. When I am home and condition my hair in between appointments, I can clean, care for my baby, do laundry, etc... and it definitely makes the time go faster. I would recommend but please be patient when heating up because it takes a few spins in the microwave before it gets going. Also, do not over heat because it will scorch your ears!</li>
            <li> It does the job. I use 2 mins to warm it up otherwise don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I boil the inserts, not microwave, and my head stayed warm for quite awhile.  I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> This system made me love doing the hair masks. Very easy to use and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Convenient, great quality, DC for 20-30 mns after heating for one minute and a half in microwave. Can&#x27;t leave without it. Fits snugly on my head so I can move around and take of my business or just lay on the couch and be lazy. I want to buy another as backup next payday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Not for anyone with very thick or curly hair</li>
            <li> I like it.  You have to be careful when you heat the packs....bc I like my packs to get hot and when you wam them up it want feel like they are hot and you will keep heating thrm and they can explode.  Bottomline follow the direction.  it may not feel hot but it is.  It&#x27;s pretty good to have this heating cap.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first and delivered a good amount of heat to my hair and I could see a difference after I remove the cap. Unfortunately the fabric got destroyed after one wash. I kept using it until the gel packs burst in the microwave which could be my fault for keeping it for 1 min inside the microwave. I am using another product right now but it doesn&#x27;t give the same amount of heat to my hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem moisturized now.</li>
            <li> Only used once. Too much work to do to heal it up. But overall still a good product</li>
            <li> I like the wrap it work thank you</li>
            <li> This is my second one...love it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this out as an alternative to sitting under the hair dryer when doing my deep conditionting treatment, but I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and one of the gel packs exploded!!! I will not but again.</li>
            <li> akward and hard to wrap. heating tubes are heavy and don&#x27;t work well with cap when it is tied on head,</li>
            <li> After one use, my hair felt amazing! Dry heat alone no longer does the job. Highly buying recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting too much from this Hair wrap.  I was expecting my whole head would have some contact and get some heat.  With this wrap it was not the case.  The back part of my head did not have contact with the gel packs therefore not getting any heat at all.  So back under the hooded dryer I go.</li>
