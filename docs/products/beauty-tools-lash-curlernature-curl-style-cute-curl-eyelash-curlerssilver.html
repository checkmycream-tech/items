            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>shipment was prompt and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but so happy Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found it here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and grip and curls my lashes perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this curler!!</li>
            <li>Very nice quality and durability.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, haven&#x27;t had any eyelid pinching incidents.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I prefer this brand because it doesn&#x27;t break your eyelashes, it fits against the eye perfectly, has the correct angulation, and it works well with or without the use of heat (blowdrying it for a better curl).  </li>
            <li>This works okay not the best</li>
            <li>Dont know why Sephora stopped selling these because they truly are the best, but I am glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and they are always great!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this one tis the best</li>
            <li>Love it, the best eyelash curler ever purchased !</li>
            <li>Many years ago I bought a Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler which curled my eyelashes perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It Is the best curler I have ever tried:)</li>
            <li>It really curls your eye lashes best best eye lash curler</li>
            <li>This is the most AMAZING eyelash curler ever!!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>This is easily the best eyelash curler on the market.</li>
            <li>The BEST EYELASH CURLER recommended by my 2 make-up artist friends who are stylists on huge shoots (vogue, Elle, Nylon mag,...) and tons of celebrities.</li>
            <li>but they no longer make a good one.</li>
            <li>The product does what it says - a good product - it does work like the curler is supposed too....</li>
            <li>So I thought $20 was a good investment for my blinking beauties.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me and it is a good product.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>and I have not found another one that works this good</li>
            <li>The curler I used before this came yanked out a good amount of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize how good they are until you try something else.</li>
            <li>I have owned this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li>is a knock off that is not any good.</li>
            <li>But...that being said, it is a good eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Good curler.  </li>
            <li>This curler is really good at getting each and every eyelash curled.</li>
            <li>I would like everyone to know how good it works.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s for good reason.</li>
            <li>Seems like good quality</li>
            <li>Good quality and works well.</li>
            <li>Would not buy again, cheaper ones work just as good.</li>
            <li>I have always used the good ole faithful Shiseido curler...</li>
            <li>and together they make a good addition to my make up collection</li>
            <li>It felt flimsy and the hinge part squishes into my cheek when I try to curl my eyelashes, preventing me from getting a good position to curl.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Does a fair job curling.</li>
            <li>cleansing oil is good.  </li>
            <li>eslow is just as good and cheaperwill</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>It pinches, pulls, and doesn&#x27;t give a good curl.  </li>
            <li>Have loved these curlers for years.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It was in perfect condition and my friend was really excited.  </li>
            <li>These are my very first set of eyelash curlers and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>It works much better and longer--very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>I saw so many raves about this curler that I thought it had to be great, and maybe I just got a bum box, but it&#x27;s just ...</li>
            <li>I DEFINITELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT, it makes your eyelash looks so curly and great after u put masacara on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how good this curler is compared to all the others.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the drugstore eyelash curlers but not as great as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>I had a Shu Uemura eyelash curler many years ago and thought it was great.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I took a chance and shelled out for this.</li>
            <li>AND SHE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT AND TRIED TO CURL EVERYONES LASHES.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this based on all the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad i did.</li>

            <li>This curler is easy to use and curls eyelashes beautifully.</li>

            <li>Love my shu uemura eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I bought more as gifts!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about this curler and the rumors are true!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t poke my eye.</li>
            <li>You think to yourself &amp;#34;This is amazing, but the curl will fall as soon as I put some mascara on.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>my lashes look amazing and they stay curled forever.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a retail store and the product was amazing at curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>These eyelash curlers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>but my 2 cents is that this curler is really amazing.</li>
            <li>After seeing great reviews in my local paper, I was expecting a wonderful curler.  </li>
            <li>I have used eyelash curlers for many years and was looking for a really good one.</li>
            <li>It fits my eyes very well, and best of all, it DOESN&#x27;T PINCH!</li>
            <li>It fits my eyelid area nicely and curls my stubby lashes.</li>
            <li>Ok, As good as it was cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>so I bought her her own</li>
            <li>My lashes curled nicely and stayed curled with mascara.</li>
            <li>and they curled so nicely.  </li>
            <li>When they stopped selling this at Sephora my sister and I were devastated but after years of using unsatisfactory eyelash cullers we tried looking for it on AMAZON and were thrilled.</li>
            <li>The curler seems well made and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d be buying a 20 dl eyelash curler, to be honest</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice is</li>
            <li>It gives a really nice curl.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is really one of the best that I have found.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good curler, I recommend Tarte, however I just purchased one from &amp;#34;Bella and Bear&amp;#34; which I absolutely LOVE.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this eyelash curler because I heard it worked really good.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve always wanted great eyelashes, it&#x27;s definitely worth splurging on!</li>
            <li>Best eyelash curler by far!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>

            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t pinch or tug my eyelashes, which is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li>Love that it has rubber refills and fits well in my hand and on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eyelash curler for life.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would even work better.   </li>
            <li>I was introduced to shu uemura eyelash curler two years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>but im glad amazon sells</li>
            <li>I have been using this eyelash curler for many years.  </li>
            <li>Had this for six months or more.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li>Have used Shu Uemura Eyelash curler for many years.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many others, no comparison to Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li>since noticed a lot of the best reviews are from people who are Asian.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyelash curler ever</li>
            <li>BUT I TRIED IT ON AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT,  </li>
            <li>Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Does not pinch your eyelids and provides a perfect curl in a short time frame.  </li>
            <li>and I have to admit I like Shu Uemura more.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times in the past--it is a staple.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon as I often save a lot of money--</li>
            <li>The one thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s nothing too flamboyant</li>
            <li>What a fantastic curler!</li>
            <li>The eye piece fits comfortably without catching my skin.</li>
            <li>a healthy thing for any product that is used around the eyes, not to mention misrepresentation.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this eylash curler for many years.</li>
            <li>and I love that one.  </li>
            <li>How many curlers does a women have to go thru in her life?</li>
            <li>Have used for years - nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li>The Shiseido curler shape is wider and do a better job to reaching the lashes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eye curler...</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the $5 drugstore curler I had, but it&#x27;s not something I LOVE.</li>
            <li>One of the things I do to guarantee that it&#x27;s authentic is to make sure you know where your product is being shipped from.</li>
            <li>Korean sellers are also relatively reputable.</li>
            <li>for the curler, it is definitely one of the best eyelash curlers you can purchase on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used many many curlers</li>
            <li>LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>I bought the AUTHENTIC Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler from MINOYA.</li>
            <li>Love love love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>IT IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE STORE OR AT SEPHORA.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it any where else.  </li>
            <li>Had used this curler for many years and then it was gone.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It looks to be authentic, I included some pictures here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find better reviews elsewhere</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crimp your eyelashes, just gives your eyelashes a nice smooth curve to it.</li>
            <li>and so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>Love the shuuemura eye lash curler.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best eyelash curlers I have used.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the AUTHENTIC one I have</li>
            <li>If there is a better eyelash curler for skimpy lashes I have never found it.</li>
            <li>It also curls better.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I also love that the rubber strip on this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t crease so my eyelashes and makeup don&#x27;t get caught in it.</li>
            <li>Love this curler.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>Wonderful, the only thing, I can not buy this at Sephora any more.</li>
            <li>but it truely is better.</li>
            <li>Get them one even if they already have one, which if they really love makeup, they probably do.</li>
            <li>The only curler to use,it is the best</li>
            <li>I seem to be able to get more lashes in one</li>
            <li>Love this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I really love it ,it can curl my eyelash well</li>
            <li>This is my favorite item in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Shu Uemura eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend for her bridal shower because she has been in love with my eyelash curler and could not find it at any store.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The Shu Uemura is better than the rest.</li>
            <li>Unlike most curlers, this one it shaped better for the eye and doesn&#x27;t pull out lashes as it is used.</li>
            <li>The one I received is authentic... and AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely see why so many people rave about this being THE best curler.</li>
            <li>Authentic Shu Uemura eyelash curler from Port Trading US.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>and they come out perfect and last all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it from the Shu Uemura website.  </li>
            <li>love this eyelash curler and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but sometimes pulls lashes outp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others.</li>
            <li>A drugstore eyelash curler works better than this.</li>
            <li>No company makes these better</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of eyelash curlers and had not found one that I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>and I love the shape and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull on your lashes.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, you can&#x27;t buy refills for the silicone pad.</li>
            <li>I regret not reading more reviews before I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for many years and needed to get a replacement rubber pad.</li>
            <li>It worked ok</li>
            <li>and I like that even better.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like my Maybelline eyelash curler much better.  </li>
            <li>I believe this to be authentic.</li>
            <li>My favorite eye lash curler that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying some more for all the women in my family for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This one is like magic and it&#x27;s all you need</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any recent reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure how to look for them, so I thought I&#x27;d tell everyone in case they still believe they can&#x27;t get the greatest eyelash curler ever.  </li>
            <li>Use to love, love,</li>
            <li>love SHU UEMURA but the frame has  changed.</li>
            <li>so glad I was able to find it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The shu uemura eyelash curler is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Seems ok to me.</li>
            <li>I have a 10 dollar Sally Hansen lash curler that is better quality.</li>
            <li>I do love the cushion of the silicone curling pad.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to purchase through Amazon (Sephora no longer carries it)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend enough, it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I thought this curler was better than most.</li>
            <li>The cheaper ones are 100 times better</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>and you will be able to tell.</li>
            <li>The genuine article!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>Best curler I&#x27;ve used--have purchased several of these for myself and&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Was advertised as a top eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an eyelash curler for many years--always dreading it...</li>
            <li>just wish it came with more rubber replacements.</li>
            <li>Works great like the real ones</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite eyelash curler on the market.  </li>
            <li>Read the reviews before ordering and glad I went with this purchase-</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>This curls my lashes better than any curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My friend who is a beauty products enthusiast recommended this Japanese curler as the best in the world (as did the internet), so I decided to try.</li>
            <li>Glad I got.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes do not stay curled for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>its the firs curler I&#x27;ve had and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Best curler out there, easy to clean and works very well.</li>
            <li>Could have gotten a crappy one from Walmart and it would be better</li>
            <li>It never pinches, and I love the rounded pad.</li>
            <li>I love it, once you use it, you will not be able to use anyone elses.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My lashes aren&#x27;t getting older; they are getting better because of this great beauty tool.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It is the classic and does a great job but the thing I&#x27;ll never get is why it doesn&#x27;t make it in the shape of a curled eyelash.</li>
            <li>Make certain you don&#x27;t misplace the spare rubber piece because it seems that piece is what make the product so completely successful.</li>
            <li>I did not understand what all the fuss was about regarding the shu uemura eyelash curler, as I thought the cheaper curler I bought at Target was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Beautiful natural looking curl...</li>
            <li>Easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love how well it lasts and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Personally I think the quality and effects of the Shu Uemura curler is just as good as the Anna Sui one, but price wise</li>
            <li>found the curler to be nice to handle and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It curls without pinching and  the fit is sturdy in your hand for a skilled and safe curl.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is by far one of the best; with the right mascara your eyelashes stay curled all day.</li>
            <li>I think the key is the cushy pads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a welcome charge to your old curler.</li>
            <li>I purchased this eyelash curler from the seller MINOYA, and it is a fantastic curler, as well as an authentic shu uemera product.</li>
            <li>This was authentic, received yesterday with free rubber replacement.  </li>
            <li>I got the authentic curler for a cheaper price and with free shipping.</li>
            <li>great for professional use</li>
            <li>ordered a genuine one from Shu&#x27;s website for $5 more and now that it&#x27;s arrived</li>
            <li>SO much better than the cheap drugstore curlers, and since I wear mascara every day</li>
            <li>My sister never used a eyelash curler, but she has gorgeous lashes and didn&#x27;t really feel she needed one.  </li>
            <li>good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>my lashes are already fairly curly but have stubborn ones at the ends that like to lay straight for some reason.</li>
            <li>For my eye shape, this is truly the best curler available, I&#x27;ve tried many other brands including Sephora&#x27;s line as well as Tweezerman, but my Shu always fit better and never pinched my lids.  </li>
            <li>Bought one in October, from Super Fast Shipping from JP, and  it was great, but I lost it.  </li>
            <li>It works so good because its strong and curls fast.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see it available.</li>
            <li>MOST DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>I have no idea what makes this curler so unique, but it curls my lashes better than any eyelash curler I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I bought the original from the She Uemura website and was pleased.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip</li>
            <li>If not, you might want to consider buying this curler from a place you can easily return it to without paying shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Need to do a way better job packaging and shipping the product but overall happy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any experience with eyelash curlers, but I will say this one is easy to use and met all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does not pinch eyelid.</li>
            <li>I have never pinched my eyelid and it curls my lashes easily.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes are easily curled.</li>
            <li>It is not always easy to find.</li>
            <li>4 starts if because the amazing effect doesn&#x27;t last long after about 5 uses it wasn&#x27;t as good but still very good</li>
            <li>It works best for me and seems to get high ratings in many major magazines.  </li>
            <li>(mine had shot up a bit where i normally get it) crossing my fingers that this would be just as good and when I tried it, the curl didnt even stay for but maybe 4 hrs..</li>
            <li>the best eyelash curler, hands down</li>
            <li>is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down THE best.</li>
            <li>I was just fine using my eyelash curler from MAC.</li>
            <li>and it is fine.  </li>
            <li>It curls my eyelashes just fine and</li>
            <li>love love thessse eyelash curlersss ;)</li>
            <li>and easily.and it is very convenient to use, love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this curler for several months now and am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an eyelash curler expert &amp; have only owned a cheap one before this, but I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li>The best, hands down!</li>
            <li>This is the best eyelash curler hands down!</li>
            <li>This is the true story of how my first day went with this amazing curler.</li>
            <li>A huge difference with how they were shaped.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of the Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and so smooth to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch my skin so that was a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have turned into a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>Great for asian eyes!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t available in the US</li>
            <li>You can purchase this eyelash curler from the Shu Uemura web site for 19.99 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>If the web site does not offer free shipping browse Shu Uemura coupons on the web.  </li>
            <li>The coupon sites offer a code number for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It came as a free gift with a Lancôme purchase.</li>
            <li>my cheap Revlon model (that is nothing).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a genuine one before</li>
            <li>Then one day, you come across an article that lists top makeup tools that are worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>To your surprise, the cost is 12 bucks and has free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with it that I actually curl my lashes every day now.</li>
            <li>I have tried and tried and tried every eyelash curler available on the market.</li>
            <li>I wonder if its being a genuine product?</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel as great or the same!</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference between a cheap curler and this one.</li>
            <li>The rubber is cheap, and can&#x27;t hold up to even the light pressure of the curling edge.</li>
            <li>worth the wait ,  i will buy more in case they stop making them</li>
            <li>The curler has a wider angle and gets all of your lashes comfortably.</li>
            <li>It opens wider than many curlers and rarely pinches.  </li>
            <li>I had to return mine because I purchased this thinking that I was getting an amazing deal for a real Shu Uemura</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, eyelash curling is not rocket science; it&#x27;s not even advanced calculus, so</li>
            <li>I checked Sephora and found that indeed the shu uemura curler is no longer available in the US, but they offer a Sephora Collection substitute for $16 with a silicone pad that customers have given glowing reviews.    </li>
            <li>Just a light pressure for about 10 seconds will do the trick.</li>
            <li>makes it comfortable.</li>
            <li>THE SILICONE IS CHEAP AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SHU UEMURA LOGO IMPRINT.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE WAS SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li>The silicone pads are not as nice as I would like, but I found one that LASTS really well</li>
            <li>I liked that the Seller shipped it fast too.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, nothing happened to the product.</li>
            <li>The box was opened the product inside was unwrapped, the material cheap and</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my eyes&#x27; shape or something.</li>
            <li>Also, you get to choose a free sample product.</li>
            <li>Such a great curler and</li>
            <li>curler came from vendor \\&quot;effective shop japan\\&quot; and I&#x27;d say I got the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I have doubts that this is a genuine Shu eyelash curler, but</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel like all your lashes fit into curler.</li>
            <li>Mine is GENUINE and I went through the checklist [...]</li>
            <li>It used to be available at Ulta and Sephora</li>
            <li>Pulled eyelashes out, which has never happened to me with a genuine Shu Uemera.</li>
            <li>I use it daily, with great results.</li>
            <li>Just feels cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have a light coat of mascara on.</li>
            <li>Seems like a cheap metal</li>
            <li>Thought the quality was cheap, not a fan</li>
            <li>This looks likes a cheap curler anyone can buy from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>They fit in the eye and do the job without pinching.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good with the curler.  </li>
            <li>It works almost as good as my old Maybelline.</li>
            <li>want to buy this a long time for it&#x27;s good reputation, it&#x27;s really easy to use!</li>
            <li>so I wanted to make sure I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as smooth when curling as my original.</li>
            <li>I first tried a Shu Uemura eyelash curler about 15 years ago when a friend worked for L&#x27;Oreal (they own Shu Uemura) and fell in love with it straight away.</li>
            <li>I lost the refill for my first one and loved the eyelash curler so much I had to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Curls quickly and easily..</li>
            <li>I think this is my new favorite one!</li>
            <li>With free shipping, the cost is only $1 more than on Amazon, and you will be sure to get a top quality product.</li>
            <li>Bought a new one from sephora two days later and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love this, just bought it for my daughter (her first).</li>
            <li>like the original ones, and doesnt even match sizes with the original ones, neider do they match the joints of the parts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to find one on line for my daughters stocking.  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it took over a month to arrive, I&#x27;m pretty sure my curler is a knock off too, as some people have also wrote.</li>
            <li>If the seller is from China/Hong Kong/South East Asia or sometimes even in the US, then you should probably email or contact the seller first to guarantee that you are receiving an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and it was flimsy and wasn&#x27;t even in packaged in plastic like the original one I purchased.</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>When I received this curler in the mail, I was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>People beware if you wish to buy one, I suggest you go to the oficial original</li>
            <li>Was not able to get it in stores so happy amazon had this!!</li>
            <li>It did not match the shape and size of the original</li>
            <li>Def worth it!</li>
            <li>You will love it after the first use.</li>
            <li>Having had the SHUSHEIDO eyelash curler in the past, which used to be THE BEST, I was eager to be upgrading to the SHU UEMURA eyelash curler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find these on Amazon, but was so upset when I got it.</li>
            <li>Resent that Amazon needs more words for this review than what I said in the first sentence.</li>
            <li>Not the quality of my original shu uemera.  </li>
            <li>Curl is very smooth and natural, unlike many that kink or bend eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Jessica alba suggested it in her new book the honest life.</li>
            <li>It is more rounded, rather than the traditional kind of squared of edges of that part.  </li>
            <li>Curls lashes smoothly, and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected but still ok.</li>
            <li>Once you use this curler, you will never be able to go back to another kind.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several eyelash curlers and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>They curl beautifully and outlast any other curler.  </li>
            <li>as a professional makeup artist, most of the time I still need to use a mini-curler, like the Preo to get those evasive outer-lashes!</li>
            <li>So far I love this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>I ordered 3, due to them discontinuing the item (and for free shipping - LOL).</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product I was so excited that I found it for such a good price.</li>
            <li>Specially for the price.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because this persona did as advertised and had a special treat and note inside.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this eyelash curler to be anything special.  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find it all that special.</li>
            <li>Later reviews seemed more positive, so I was hopeful I would be a getting a good product.  </li>
            <li>Very durable, easy to use, and the parts glide easily.</li>
            <li>No other eyelash curler can surpass the Shu Uemura which curls so perfectly and keeps the curl lasting all day.</li>
            <li>It is better than its competitors and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I measured it with my true Shu uemura eyelash curler and this product</li>
            <li>so I used the extra pad and still did not get a good result,  </li>
            <li>Not as much pinching but could still be better.</li>
            <li>It is a good curler, very similar than Japonese brand.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>They are pricey compared to brands available in makeup department at drug store but the results are worth the price for me.</li>
            <li>I read an article in a fashion magazine about this eyelash curler and how good it is for asian eyes.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice natural curl.</li>
            <li>THE REAL SHU UEMURA CURL THE EYELASH LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li>You might as well go to CVS and pay $6.00 for a better eyelash curler or order the real thing from the company website.</li>
            <li>and you have to buy the entire curler again once that is no longer good.</li>
            <li>For my think asian lashes, I think this eyelash curler does a good job in keep my lashes curled.</li>
            <li>It works but not any better than a much cheaper eye lash curler you can get at Target or Wal-mart.</li>
            <li>And surprisingly, it&#x27;s the same</li>
            <li>it makes my lashes really stand out more than before (before applying mascara)</li>
            <li>Totally true.  </li>
            <li>the American production is just not as good.</li>
            <li>This was the only curler that I loved.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and great to curl all those little eyelashes in the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li>The original was/is worth all the hype.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant spending more that $10 on an eyelash curler because I am so particular.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many curlers and this one simply knocks it out of the park.</li>
            <li>Round, lovely curls are achieved by good tools and practiced technique.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and packaged accordingly.</li>
            <li>this brand is shaped much better for Asian shaped eyes and works much better to get all the lashes curled</li>
            <li>After buying countless crappy drugstore eyelash curlers, I finally found the perfect one!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Curls lashes quickly and easily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight eyelashes and this curler works!</li>
            <li>It was great to be able to have the actual one for her to open instead of just telling her that it was coming in the mail.  </li>
            <li>It curls my lashes nicely and the curl lasts for hours unlike most of the other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li>When I first received this lash curler it looked like a cheap version I could buy in a drug store.</li>
            <li>It gives me a piece of mind knowing that I bought a genuine product and not a fake one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet strong.</li>
            <li>Good eyelash curler, I have purchase japonesque in the past, and it seemed to grab ALL my lashes more than this one.</li>
            <li>I indeed received the real thing, so can easily recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared this one with two of my old Shu curlers I own (both of which are exactly identical) and here are just the differences I&#x27;ve noticed after comparing them for a minute:&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she said it was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li>This is the only eyelash curler I will buy and I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and it was the real thing!!</li>
            <li>Heat it up with a hair dryer and really curl your lashes!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine to sell eyelash curlers, but selling under the brand name Shu Uemura is very misleading and unethically.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing eye lash curler, worth taking the extra time to order online since it can&#x27;t be found in the states any longer!</li>
            <li>the mechanism is smooth and gentle on your lashes.  </li>
            <li>These curl the lash very well, and feel comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>No problems whatsoever and worth the money</li>
            <li>I am able to get a natural looking curl that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li>There is nothing similar about it to the one I own.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth one star.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price considering others pinch.</li>
            <li>I never had success curling my lashes with drugstore curlers and this one works as all the makeup artists testify.</li>
            <li>I hoped it would be worth the money, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>It works much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>This one is shaped slightly different and seems to fit on the lashes much better.</li>
            <li>I KNOW that the one I got is authentic, because I have compared side by side with the Shu Curler that I got directly from the shu uemura website.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the angle of the curler is different and the quality of the Amazon curler is inferior.  </li>
            <li>It looks like someone already opened it and the curler itself is not seal in the plastic bag, which it proves my point,</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to press on my lashes but about once, rarely twice to get them curled.</li>
            <li>They curl nicely and last.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t bother to buy ten cheap ones thinking you are saving money - you are so much better off to just go with this one to start.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and the pads</li>
            <li>, I figured it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Not disappointing.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price but did not come with any replacement rubber seal&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>this is my favorite curler by far.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>Took a while to ship from Japan, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>However, $20 a year for this eyelash curler is still worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>metal curler portion dips into a middle cut in the rubber bottom...which effectively &amp;#34;trims&amp;#34; eyelashes...</li>
            <li>This curler got right up to the base of your eyelashes and created the most perfect curl without pinching your precious eyelid.</li>
            <li>I returned it right away.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>, you should buy them right now.</li>
            <li>you should probably just buy them right now too.</li>
            <li>It does hold the curl with the right mascara.</li>
            <li>Had one with grips on finger tips in past which I liked better.</li>
            <li>The one I received is small, cheaply made, and does not do a good job of curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Add a hair dryer for a little heat, amazing results!</li>
            <li>It shipped so quickly and was able to use it as soon as possible~!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, usually.</li>
            <li>and when I compared them, this one was cheaply made, much lighter than the authentic one, and the hardware was completely different.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many, many a eyelash curler from as much as 30+ $ to as little as 2.99.....</li>
            <li>This curler is a cut above your drugstore curler, it is soft and gentle on the lashes but very effective.</li>
            <li>I then compared the SU I already have and confirmed that the new one is a knock-off.</li>
            <li>So, I won&#x27;t be ordering from GOOD STUFF FOR EVEN LESS.</li>
            <li>Not even close to as good as my previous Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>Curls easily and naturally without damaging your lashes.</li>
            <li>I have very straight eyelashes and have had to use an eyelash curler for years.</li>
            <li>eyelashes are very straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s a great curler, if I could get it to work; but its opening is only about 1/2 as wide as my old curler and therein lies the problem.   </li>
            <li>VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li>No pinching of eyelid skin and a good curl with little effort</li>
            <li>Prime&#x27;s shipping is really fast!</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first</li>
            <li>It was flimsy and had a lot of differences from my current (authentic) eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not a fake like some of the people received from this vendor.</li>
            <li>Sure there were the occasional pinches and pulls.</li>
            <li>Both pads should be soft, smooth, somewhat pliable to the touch and have \\&quot;shu uemura\\&quot; stamped on the underside.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>it saves me so much money on mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this curler and will never go back to the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>And sure enough, there it was!</li>
            <li>Pay the $20 and buy the authentic product on there actual website.</li>
            <li>On the first use, I knew it wasn&#x27;t a quality Shu Uemura curler.  </li>
            <li>This one definitely was more flimsy, and the pieces rattled, it didn&#x27;t even compare to the quality of my original.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I guess this deserves 5 stars because it works exactly as it should and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any drawbacks.</li>
            <li>Purchased as this product had been proven superb in the past when purchased at a local boutique.</li>
            <li>Consistently pulled out 1-2 eyelashes, even when I greased it with petroleum jelly or lotion.</li>
            <li>so I could have one automatically on hand when my first one goes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than the regular ones you can buy at a store.</li>
            <li>a makeup artist and know pretty well the Shue mura eylash curler.</li>
            <li>I have seen a number of reviews that claim the Shu Uemura eyelash curler sold here is fake, but regardless, this is the best eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li>do not buy from amazon, there&#x27;s no way to tell if seller is selling the real deal!</li>
            <li>First, let me say I am the queen of side by side testing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this eyelash curler from Organic Direct at the beginning of August when I heard they were no longer going to be available in the US.  </li>
            <li>The curler I received was in an authentic box and looks real enough, but I think it must be a knock off.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much cheaper on Amazon anyway!</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail promptly, and it is most definitely NOT a Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li>If you are unimpressed by most lash curlers, I can assure you that this one is definitely the game-changer of all lash curlers.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have the crimping power of the first one I purchased....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this eyelash curler</li>
            <li>i try using it on my bare eyelashes and it doesn&#x27;t do much, it works better for me with a bit of mascara on.  </li>
            <li>My short and straight lashes always stay up! :)</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look so much longer!</li>
            <li>Similar to Lancôme eye lash curler where an associate informed me that you have to angle it out to have a better curl effect.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of mixed reviews on here, many from about 2010-11 bemoaning receipt of a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; curler.  </li>
            <li>white inner box was stylish and looked authentic.  </li>
            <li>funny bonus...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Not being able to buy them locally any longer, I turned to the internet.  </li>
            <li>First time I purchased with this company and the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The markings on the curler are slightly different and I feel like it may not be &#x27;authentic&#x27; Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is not a fake curler-</li>
            <li>I ordered extra refill, they haven&#x27;t arrived yet, just better to have on hand than try to replace.</li>
            <li>It really opens your eye!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and this one tops them all!</li>
            <li>its not even a hot day</li>
            <li>Pardon the pun ;-)</li>
            <li>My eye lashes really curl well with this curler!  </li>
            <li>and this consistently beats them all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come away with some interesting red lines on the side of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Buy the real thing if you really want to get true Shu Uemura results.</li>
            <li>so I can keep the first one in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>When purchasing this new product I expected the curl to be superior, however, was unsatisfied with the lack of curl factor it had.  </li>
            <li>i get a better curl from a cheap eyelash curler from odd lots than this one , dont like it at all</li>
            <li>The profit is being used to purchase more black hair dye and gluten free chow mien.</li>
            <li>Was never very good at curling my eyelashes, but this wonderful product has assisted me in confidence and proper use of an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>After using it, however, I realized it definitely  made my straight fine lashes curl and stay curled, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li>Alternately, if you don&#x27;t wear any makeup ever, but want to make your face look brighter, your eyes larger and more awake, and your whole face better...</li>
            <li>Since I cannot find the original refills for my old Maybelline, I needed something.</li>
            <li>Curls my eyelashes more quickly than other models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that Shu Uemura is the way to go for eyelash curlers, but I wish I had listened earlier, because this is an amazing product that is superior to any other similar product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Best eyelash curler ever but getting harder and harder to find!!!</li>
            <li>So you decide to check out your favorite online shopping website to see how much this &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; will set you back.</li>
            <li>So much so that I will be ordering a second one for my mom for her birthday :)</li>
            <li>If you go to the Shu Uemura USA website, you can definitely order this curler and make sure it&#x27;s the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why, but this one isn&#x27;t as good as the first Shu Uemura</li>
            <li>i just wish the silicon pads lasted a little longer and the shu uemura would provide more than just 1 pad refills or allow buyers to purchase more pads instead of having to buy a whole new curler.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well although not as well as the real deal.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on other curlers this is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as an ordinary eyelash curler, except the price.</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve discovered the importance of having a good eyelash curler (I&#x27;m Asian with short straight lashes</li>
            <li>I have requested a full refund from Organic Direct.  </li>
            <li>It feels flimsy, while my older Shu Uemura curler seems more solid.  </li>
            <li>Worked good first couple of time and now it doesn&#x27;t even hardly curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Buyers beware it is a cheap imitation and does not perform anywhere near as well as the Authentic Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler.</li>
            <li>Note: I slightly heat by curler with warm air from my hair dryer (checking the temperature on may hand before using on my eye).</li>
            <li>but this is the only one that easily does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this eyelash curler, just go to the shu uemura website, and you can buy it for a GENUINE one for the exact same price.</li>
            <li>They even have the newer Japanese design with the open sides for smaller and more precise attention available.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found my old one...</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler most certainly was used, NOT NEW from Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li>I think that manufactures are no making them with a deliberate need to hold via a certain angle in order to get your eyelash to curl.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty straight forward, it gets all the lashes, &amp; I feel like my eyelashes look much longer &amp; really let my eyes shine.</li>
            <li>new eyelash curler has a tightness which this did not have; it was more likely than not \\&quot;recycled\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared it to my original Shu Uemera and it&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
            <li>I take that back, the lashes closer to the inside of my eye are curled fine, it&#x27;s the ones toward the outer part of my eye that look bent, \\&quot;L shaped\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I think a standard curler would be just fine.</li>
            <li>This item is on the expensive side (it is a very good product) and you can&#x27;t purchase the replacement pads separatly.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t open and close smoothly, and it did not have a silicone pad the way the real ones do.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few, this one is amazing</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it out a whole lot yet</li>
            <li>Even $19.99 is to much for this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>When it curls eyelashed are bent straight up instead of curled.  </li>
            <li>It feels much cheaper and lighter than the one I have.  </li>
            <li>This is a knockoff and is nothing like the real Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler.  </li>
            <li>thanks Amazon for still supplying it.</li>
            <li>I am still on a Quest for the real thing.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler works really well.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt even resemble the real shu uemura.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the Shu curler after reading all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>Mine are naturally straight, and all it takes are a couple of 15-second presses to keep them curled all day (with the help of a coat or two of mascara).</li>
            <li>Besides the Shu Uemura site, Sephora and Ulta are the only vendors that I know of that always sell the genuine product.</li>
            <li>MY SISTER BOUGH THE REAL SHU UEMURA ON SAPHORA.COM FOR $20, I COULD NOT BELIVE SOMEONE WOULD BUY A $20 EYE CURLER.</li>
            <li>It is posted as the real thing</li>
            <li>It rattles too much -</li>
            <li>no broken lashes...</li>
            <li>Save yourself the doubt and buy it from the shu uemura website, that way you know you will get the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, not a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed...should have known by the price.  </li>
            <li>how it curls eyelashes straight up.  </li>
            <li>The harder I squeezed, the more eyelashes got pulled out.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived a week before its earliest expected arrival date and the seller threw a snack with the order (awe how cute).</li>
            <li>Is very well made.</li>
            <li>I have straight eye lashes and with the shu uemura eye lash curler my lashes stayed curled for days on out even after I washed and cleaned them with make up remover.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think a curler could make a difference</li>
            <li>Not the real product .This</li>
            <li>I have been buying the real product for years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like the Shu Eemura eyelash curler for my straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>the shape (which the real Shu Uemura is known for) is on point</li>
            <li>I was hoping I would get a seller with the real thing</li>
            <li>I ordered the real one from the official site</li>
            <li>they are trying to pretend that what they are selling is even close to the real thing.</li>
            <li>SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND BUY THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li>you want to a comparison of this curler to the real one, check out this blog</li>
            <li>She loves it and uses it very often.</li>
            <li>it was because my eyelashes  are to short to fit in the curler, I have had this problem before.</li>
            <li>i ordered this from seller Elecet Tai, not having had a real Shu Uemura curler before.</li>
            <li>this one looks JUST like the real one, comparing pictures i couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>I had one I had purchased locally at Sephora, which was fantastic.    </li>
            <li>I trusted amazon.com to only list genuine products.</li>
            <li>The one I received was real.</li>
            <li>This product after I used it on my straight lashes really curled them for me.</li>
            <li>Really curls the eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>$17 is not that much.</li>
            <li>Every Christmas my wife wants this eyelash curler and my daughter</li>
            <li>It bends my lashes straight up towards the sky and they stay that way all day, even without mascara, until I wash my face at night.  </li>
            <li>Was just what I was hoping it would be very pleasef</li>
            <li>I curled my lashes as soon as I got the real Shu Uemura eyelash curler, I didn&#x27;t use mascara and my lashes were stayed curled....</li>
            <li>Didnt even come close to curling lashes the way the real one does...</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t hurt myself, it DIDN&#x27;T CURL the LASHES very well.</li>
            <li>Well, it´s ok but doesn´t curl as I expected .</li>
            <li>I did my research and found out what a REAL one looks like.</li>
            <li>BTW, the extra pad they give you doesn&#x27;t fit the curler.  </li>
            <li>this really does curl your lashes as opposed to bend them.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is not the real Shu Uemera curler.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t anything like the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have the real one from when shu uemura sold in the US and compared it.  </li>
            <li>One gentle</li>
            <li>Looks like this vendor changed what they were shipping because my two Shu Uemura eyelash curlers appear to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>However, with the pricing and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It literally makes your eyelashes stand straight up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just get the cheap one from the grocery store next time.</li>
            <li>My mistake for thinking I was getting a deal and getting the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well and is NOT  a Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, pinches eyelid and does not curl properly!!</li>
            <li>very rounded, i have to really go around and curl the ends.&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly</li>
            <li>VERY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended seller!</li>
            <li>The REAL curlers&#x27; metal pieces do not raffle when you shake it like this one does;&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>The REAL curler&#x27;s silicone pads has the raised words &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; along the inside of the curler, which this one does not.</li>
            <li>I have board straight eyelashes</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This curls the eyelashes really well and does not pull and tug on them.  </li>
            <li>It is made of a much lighter, cheaper metal and</li>
            <li>Very shady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never had much luck with eyelash curlers-</li>
            <li>But once I tried this I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to those cheap eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>THe shipping was fast and appreciated since there is no retail outlet for purchasing this product anymore.</li>
            <li>I compared it with the REAL Shu Uemura eyelash curler</li>
            <li>no matter how much I curl them, they ended up straight.</li>
            <li>It felt very worn out.</li>
            <li>It does not curl my lashes very well (some stay straight, others curl) and they do not stay curled.</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t pulled out any of my lashes yet, haha.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this product through this seller on Amazon to see if this was the real thing, and also ordered one on Shu Uemura&#x27;s website for comparison.</li>
            <li>Must not be the real thing...</li>
            <li>I warm mine up, slightly, with my blow dryer to make it work even faster!</li>
            <li>Okay, so maybe I&#x27;m not the most coordinated individual in the world, and, as previously mentioned, most eyelash curling takes place when I&#x27;m still half asleep, but nothing&#x27;s changed in my routine but the curler.       </li>
            <li>It is not really different than the other brands; it&#x27;s just a good eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>A big plus is that you don&#x27;t have to look down and crimp hard to get that perfect lift and curl, just a light press</li>
            <li>Luckily I kept my old one and just used the new rubber.</li>
            <li>definitively it is not an original shu uemura, (although the seller told me the opposite by mail)</li>
            <li>This curler works better than any other curler I&#x27;ve ever tried-</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler fits the shape of my eyelid better than any other.</li>
            <li>and i have tried to like it for the fact that its supposed to be a better eye lash curler than the other brands.</li>
            <li>Works for me better than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li>The brand name was not in the same font as the original.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive to order it based on the other reviews I read about it not being authentic, but since I never tried a Shu Uemura curler, I had nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually post comments/reviews but this is not an authentic Shu Uemura eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>It still works better than any other, but it&#x27;s almost like it has been used.  </li>
            <li>Strongly suggest Asian girls to but it, or other girls whose eyelash shape is not very deep and round, this one fits you perfectly!</li>
            <li>When my 3 twenty-something daughters first told me how great shu uemura eyelash curlers are, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not too much of a worry as long as I have this fantastic curler.</li>
            <li>I am returning it for a full refund and springing the extra $10 for the real thing.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and it gets EVERY eyelash including the far outside eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My lashes look fabulous for the first time all the time, and this curler is easier to use than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Our landfills and full enough and my consumer habits need curbing here and there.</li>
            <li>Cheaper metal frame, the name imprinted on the back of the curved part is different, smaller font,  and most of all it does not perform at all like the original.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my SU eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>For those who are newly purchasing the Shu Uemura eyelash curler, this is not the real one.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a whole new one just because I needed a refill.</li>
            <li>but I think tarte has a better one for less money.</li>
            <li>Perhaps because there are so many knock-offs that sell for a lot less.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t care less about its authenticity, this thing is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>After using several curlers that quick working after a couple of months, I purchased this based on reviews.</li>
            <li>but i still want to look decent.</li>
            <li>I tried the second pad, just to make sure I hadn&#x27;t had a faulty one, but it was the same.  </li>
            <li>It is super flimsy and very low quality.  </li>
            <li>I quickly learned that not all eyelash curlers are created equal!</li>
            <li>Only curler that I can use because it fits the Asian eye better.</li>
            <li>The silver curler had an authentic looking Shu Uemura engraving on it and seemed tight and well sprung.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to those who want to try it out.</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>This curler came highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this is the high end</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Back in the days I&#x27;d buy curlers at Daiso (Japanese dollar store) and drug stores but none of them lasted very long or did a good job on curling my lashes.</li>
            <li>The curler always arrives on or before due date, is packaged well, and there is always an additional free surprise, nothing big, but just a sweet surprise.</li>
            <li>it curls naturally and does not crimp your lashes!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but it does curl your lashes so much better with little effort.</li>
            <li>so I do suspect that it might be a cheap imitation of the real brand</li>
            <li>Other curlers would crimp the lashes, not really give it that nice, smooth curl, but this one actually did that.</li>
            <li>So good, for small eyelash!!</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and just wasnt happy--either didnt curl well or pinched the lid too easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve repurchased this before and will do it again, definitely my favorite eyelash curler hands down!</li>
            <li>Much like the old fashioned ones in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Expensive at $20 but great results.</li>
            <li>I have naturally short-ish pin straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked amazed and happy!!!!</li>
            <li>A great eyelash curler is a necessity for me,as cheaper curlers tend to either rip out my lashes or fail to capture all the lashes in the crimping process.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is I purchased it from Shu Uemura and only spent $19.99.  </li>
            <li>Most of the curlers I have used in the past did not curl my lashes very well and they did not hold a curl even with my use of water proof mascara.</li>
            <li>It was completely unusable, and I sent it back for a full refund.    </li>
            <li>It is completely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>This is the only eyelash curler worth using - does all as advertised, without breaking lashes.</li>
            <li>I did not need to do as suggested, by pulling back and doing a second squeeze at the middle of the lashes, and another at the tips, because one good line up did enough, and very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When this arrived it looked like a poorly made version of my beloved SHU UEMURA Eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>and there is really nothing special about this product other than it being pricier.</li>
            <li>The silicone pad also lasts much longer than the standard rubber pad on most other curlers.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like these, not long enough to fit all my eye lashes in.</li>
            <li>Comparing them with the real shu uemura eyelash curlers that we do have, they are cheaply made and clearly not the same product.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was imagining stuff, but the other reviewers confirmed it for me.</li>
            <li>I need to find a new replacement.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need a new curler every 12-18 months...</li>
            <li>I am promptly returning it and buying a new one from Nordstrom or Sephora instead.  </li>
            <li>At that point it is time for a new curler.  </li>
            <li>This new one is a poorer quality.  </li>
            <li>With all the knock-offs appearing on the market now, I honestly believe, as does the other person who uses this same product regularly, that this one is not the real item.  </li>
            <li>A cheap imitation knock off.  </li>
            <li>For those who claim that they bought fake curlers: I&#x27;ve always been very cautious about online shopping and the one that I received was an authentic curler from seller MILD Japan.</li>
            <li>You can see it particularly at the welding joints, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to feel &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; in my hand like my old one.  </li>
            <li>Others are more expensive but don&#x27;t fit eye contours as well as Shu Uemura&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it makes much of a difference compared to a decent drug store one.</li>
            <li>They seem to be the only ones that fit my eye well enough to a grip on all of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I purchased it with high hopes of replacing my old eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>The curl is very natural.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes curl better with this than other eyelash curlers, but lasting curl</li>
            <li>Because the silicone pad cracks, it crimps my already short lashes and makes them look funny.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Im not sure this is authentic Shu.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only curler that really works!</li>
            <li>just order it direct!</li>
            <li>Not sure about some of for reviews here in regard to this eyelash curler not being authentic.</li>
            <li>But I was willing to let that go, since each pad was supposed to last 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I want to return a product and not sure this is authentic shu uemura product.</li>
            <li>Now for the product, it&#x27;s ok, not sure about all the hype</li>
            <li>I had stopped using curlers because they were such a hassle, and now that I have one that works simply, and I use it regularly, I can actually SEE better!  </li>
            <li>I have used them for many years and would never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, simple to keep clean and to change the pads.</li>
            <li>Felt like my old one just with a new rubber band.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement inserts for my old one, so I just bought a new one.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes grow straight out - i mean super straight!</li>
            <li>So whether this is an imitation or not, the one I purchased was the original, and I found it far inferior to any eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But after using it only once, I could tell they are definitely not the same, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to notice the differences in quality and craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was not intact, the rubber replacement was in a large baggie, not the tiny sealed bag that comes with Shu Uemura products when bought</li>
            <li>&quot; but I had to press hard and do it more than 5 times.</li>
            <li>It curls my lashes quickly and doesn&#x27;t make them look kinky like other eyelash curlers do.</li>
            <li>A real Shu Uemura eyelash curler should open and close smoothly and take little effort for you to work it.</li>
            <li>I wish you could buy the rubber replacements pieces but whe it wears out, you have to buy complete set.</li>
            <li>I got a eyelash curler that is boxed and labeled as &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t feel or work like my old curler.</li>
            <li>I have been buying them on line direct from Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine directly from the Shu website, so</li>
            <li>I have been using a Shu Uemura eyelash curler for the last 5 years and know it very well.</li>
            <li>This is a total knock off of the real brand.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li>The actual eyelash curler is the exact same shape as the one I got at Target, but the pads are much rounder, and apparently that&#x27;s the secret to getting amazingly curly lashes.</li>
            <li>I still had my old Shu hanging around, so I could compare both curlers.  </li>
            <li>some time as hassle and just buy directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>The one I received is very flimsy and the rubber pad doesn&#x27;t fill in the entire curler, almost like the pad needs to be longer.  </li>
            <li>It also seems like it doesn&#x27;t curl as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>I just never had that problem with my old one.</li>
            <li>Start at the root, release, slide up to the middle, release and gently crease the tips of your lashes.</li>
            <li>Buy direct at Shuuemura.com.</li>
            <li>I used my last one so much, the rubber kept falling out.  </li>
            <li>Curl is soft and natural.</li>
            <li>I compared the Amazon curler with the my old one from Sephora.</li>
            <li>This curler is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>I compared this to my old one that I got directly from the Shu Uemura website awhile ago.</li>
            <li>My mom has a real one and there is definitely a difference.</li>
            <li>This item was recommended in &amp;#34;How Not to Look Old...</li>
            <li>I am completely bummed that they don&#x27;t sell it anywhere</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li>The REAL curlers are slightly smaller than this one, in both length and width;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The REAL curlers never squeaks when you open and close the curlers like this one does;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>When used, the REAL curlers actually curl my lashes and never crimps and bend them like this one does; and&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it is the holiday time, I&#x27;ve been busy, so I  </li>
            <li>I lost my old Shu Uemura eyelash curler after about 10 years.</li>
            <li>your time, money, and efforts and order directly from the brand&#x27;s US website or try Shiseido&#x27;s eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I held the pad refill up to my old one and it was a cm or so shorter.)</li>
            <li>My wife says this is &amp;#34;by far the best&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura eyelash curlers for years and this recent purchase may very well be a knock off.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t get all the hype about this - it doesn&#x27;t seem that different from my much cheaper Revlon lash curler.</li>
            <li>I received both items and this is definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li>(Usually nice things have a bunch of unnecessary packaging on the inside in my experience)</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s ok, not amazing for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, not amazing and didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li>Eyelash curlers are put under significant pressure by your grasping little make up applying hands, causing them to be bent out of alignment- the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li>So I have been searching high and low for a curler that will actually curl my straight eyelashes...</li>
            <li>and this one is a cheap imitation with the Shu Uemura simply printed on it.</li>
            <li>It curls each lash with precision and my flat eyes are very grateful to this curler for the wonders it does.</li>
            <li>The bar is long enough to fit around your entire lash line and get every lash you have.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricier than a lot of other curlers but since I use it every day it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used other eyelash curlers before but haven&#x27;t ever had very positive results.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money, as it lasts a long time and gives me enough curl that I don&#x27;t even need to apply mascara.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t open up enough so positioning it over your lashes is a hassle.</li>
            <li>That problem seems to be past now going by most recent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the second one I have bought, the first lasted several years.  </li>
            <li>Super little eyelash curler, my old one just wore out.</li>
            <li>although the reviews left me expecting magic, I guess only time will tell if this little device stands the test of time.</li>
            <li>After trying many eyelash curlers that claim to be as good as Shu Uemura, I have wasted  a lot of money on bad substitutes.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely not as wide as my old one</li>
            <li>I have always had long straight eyelashes and</li>
            <li>The one purchased directly from the company worked exactly how I remembered but the one I purchased here barely worked and was very loose.  </li>
            <li>I have stick straight lashes and with lots of lightweight mascara and curling several several times it definitely helps them keep somewhat of a decent curl.</li>
            <li>I just thought it looked a little cheap when you open it.</li>
            <li>The other feature that makes the curler better than others is the black pad, which goes under the lashes.</li>
            <li>This is light years above any other brand curler!!  </li>
            <li>When I recently tried to buy a new curler, I was told that Shu Umera was no longer selling in the U.S.</li>
            <li>They say you have to buy an entire new curler.  </li>
            <li>The actual eyelash curler is worn and was provided in a box two new silicone refills.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s the same as most drugstore one (that cost $18 less), but if you&#x27;re looking to buy an actual Shu Umera, this isnt it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover the entire eye, therefore you can not curl your whole lash at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have Asian almond eyes with a double eyelid with straight downward pointing lashes, just for reference.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes stick straight out and this product is the only one that can actually curl them.</li>
            <li>so im very dissapointed...just ordering the more expensive one</li>
            <li>Was exactly what other reviewers promised.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tug on your eyelashes (unless you don&#x27;t know how to use an eyelash curler and tug in the wrong direction), and cleans pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money compared to Revlon or any other cheaper makeup brand.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit pricier than others, but definitely worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Although a little on the pricey side it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I was willing to splurge a little and buy another when my 5 year old Paula Dorf eyelash curler gave it up.  </li>
            <li>It only offers the slightest curl, really it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely gentle on your lashes with long lasting results!</li>
            <li>It was a complete knock off of the actual eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>The product is not the same as I have been buying direct.  </li>
            <li>so the next one I ordered directly from Shu Uemura,  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s 3 years old and the same brand / product.  </li>
            <li>The curler on this doesn&#x27;t see to curl as well as I remembered, but still far above the rest out there.</li>
            <li>This was not the same eyelash curler that you get from Shu Uemura direct.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a one-off non-functional product, but this barely curls my lashes.</li>
            <li>but apparently that isn&#x27;t an option...</li>
            <li>This arrived today and I was surprised at the low quality (and we are talking eyelash curlers...).  </li>
            <li>So I compared it to my old one and noticed the font was different.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it works for some people, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality does not seem similar to my old curler.  </li>
            <li>I am so relieved to find the perfect curler for big wide eyes with long eyelashes, so that even the outer corners are included instead of getting bunched up and matted with an awkward crimp.</li>
            <li>I am going back to my old Maybelline.</li>
            <li>I am so use to Revlon eyelash curlers that pinch and pull and then the cushion becomes useless till when I tried these, it was so nice NOT to be pinched</li>
            <li>I thought I for sure it would be broken.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but this is the kind of beauty device you buy once every 20 years.</li>
            <li>Athough the eyelash curlers look similar at first glance there are some slight differences (I also used an old Shu Uemura curler I had on-hand for the comparison).</li>
            <li>It was brand new, in what looked like the same white box as the one that I had purchased from Sephora.  </li>
            <li>This particular curler in one month&#x27;s time has a screw that has pulled loose and the rubber insert has fallen out.</li>
            <li>I purchased the gold-plated version of this eyelash curler and put it up against my trusty Maybelline curler that is probably older than, aww, let&#x27;s say it at least goes  back to the Clinton Administration.  </li>
            <li>The tool is worth a little extra money if you truly want \\&quot;bang for your buck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>A Friend brought me back one from actual JAPAN, and the quality is so much better and the tiny print on the curler next to the logo letters is &amp;#34;v&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;w&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve bought in the past from American based sellers.</li>
            <li>the curler doesn&#x27;t open up far enough to get your eyelashes in there.</li>
            <li>I had tried the drug store brands and they are just shaped differently and do not create a natural lasting curl like this one does!</li>
            <li>ive use so far that can curl my short asian lashes evenly and make my lashes visible.</li>
            <li>The silicone pad also seems different and did not curl my lashes the same as my old curler (which makes me question the authenticity of this product).</li>
            <li>the only good thing i can say about this is it came in a few days after i ordered, however its not what i expected its not a very good item</li>
            <li>all of my eyelashes easily without them getting caught in the sides or ripping them out or doing too much damage to them (I only have to press down a few times for it to work- where as other lash curlers</li>
            <li>Silicone refills last much longer than the rubber ones which come with other curlers.  </li>
            <li>It actually works even if you just got out of the shower and your eyelashes are too wet, or if you had to remove all of your eyemakeup for some reason, it still curls very well (a recent mascara, eyeshadow, and eyeliner application).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s advertised as exactly what I purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, it&#x27;ll make a slight improvement, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable in general and nothing compared to other previous ones I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>days later, a little box arrives with your new toy: your brand new curler.</li>
            <li>so my eyelashes are not very long.</li>
            <li>It really lifts and curls well, as I tend to have big eyes with long eyelashes that angle down toward the eye rather than curling upward naturally.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a tad pricey for an eyelash curler, but decided to purchase due to high praises.</li>
            <li>The edges are too high and sharp and dig into my eye</li>
            <li>only use WATERPROOF mascara if you don&#x27;t your lashes will weigh down and become straight.</li>
            <li>Although this is the only eyelash curler may look the same as others, there is a very subtle difference in the curve that is more suited to the actual shape of your eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Curler looks exactly the same as other shu umuera curlers I have bought in the past, but the pad is different, doesn&#x27;t have the logo on the bottom and is much stiffer silicone.</li>
            <li>the last month I was able to buy an actual SHU UEMURA eyelash curler in Hong Kong, at a SHU UEMURA location, and having the real thing to compare, it is completely obvious that the curler I purchased on amazon is a fake!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good eyelash curler for a while after buying less expensive one&#x27;s from drug stores.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do as good a job as others that are much less expensive.</li>
            <li>But as far as comfort and all of the claims it doesn&#x27;t pinch - not true as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s way too expensive and seriously not that special.</li>
            <li>It is rounded, not flat, and seems to me to be the key to getting a curl and not a crease in lashes.</li>
            <li>I found the shape awkward to use since it is more straight and not perfectly curved to fit the eye.</li>

            <li> shipment was prompt and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but so happy Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found it here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and grip and curls my lashes perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this curler!!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and durability.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, haven&#x27;t had any eyelid pinching incidents.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I prefer this brand because it doesn&#x27;t break your eyelashes, it fits against the eye perfectly, has the correct angulation, and it works well with or without the use of heat (blowdrying it for a better curl).  </li>
            <li> This works okay not the best</li>
            <li> Dont know why Sephora stopped selling these because they truly are the best, but I am glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and they are always great!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this one tis the best</li>
            <li> Love it, the best eyelash curler ever purchased !</li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought a Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler which curled my eyelashes perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It Is the best curler I have ever tried:)</li>
            <li> It really curls your eye lashes best best eye lash curler</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING eyelash curler ever!!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li> This is easily the best eyelash curler on the market.</li>
            <li> The BEST EYELASH CURLER recommended by my 2 make-up artist friends who are stylists on huge shoots (vogue, Elle, Nylon mag,...) and tons of celebrities.</li>
            <li> but they no longer make a good one.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says - a good product - it does work like the curler is supposed too....</li>
            <li> So I thought $20 was a good investment for my blinking beauties.  </li>
            <li> Good quality product.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me and it is a good product.</li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> and I have not found another one that works this good</li>
            <li> The curler I used before this came yanked out a good amount of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how good they are until you try something else.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li> is a knock off that is not any good.</li>
            <li> But...that being said, it is a good eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Good curler.  </li>
            <li> This curler is really good at getting each and every eyelash curled.</li>
            <li> I would like everyone to know how good it works.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s for good reason.</li>
            <li> Seems like good quality</li>
            <li> Good quality and works well.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again, cheaper ones work just as good.</li>
            <li> I have always used the good ole faithful Shiseido curler...</li>
            <li> and together they make a good addition to my make up collection</li>
            <li> It felt flimsy and the hinge part squishes into my cheek when I try to curl my eyelashes, preventing me from getting a good position to curl.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Does a fair job curling.</li>
            <li> cleansing oil is good.  </li>
            <li> eslow is just as good and cheaperwill</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> It pinches, pulls, and doesn&#x27;t give a good curl.  </li>
            <li> Have loved these curlers for years.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It was in perfect condition and my friend was really excited.  </li>
            <li> These are my very first set of eyelash curlers and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> It works much better and longer--very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I saw so many raves about this curler that I thought it had to be great, and maybe I just got a bum box, but it&#x27;s just ...</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT, it makes your eyelash looks so curly and great after u put masacara on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how good this curler is compared to all the others.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the drugstore eyelash curlers but not as great as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> I had a Shu Uemura eyelash curler many years ago and thought it was great.  </li>
            <li> Very glad I took a chance and shelled out for this.</li>
            <li> AND SHE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT AND TRIED TO CURL EVERYONES LASHES.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this based on all the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This curler is easy to use and curls eyelashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> and I guess for those who prefer the more sophisticated look (the Anna Sui one might be too &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;??!!)</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> I already love the product, but that&#x27;s not what I got!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>

            <li> This is now my favorite eyelash curler!  </li>
            <li> Love this purchase!</li>
            <li> my eye makeup gets mostly melted off by my 1200 med pass (yay nursing!)</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love my shu uemura eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought more as gifts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this curler and the rumors are true!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t poke my eye.</li>
            <li> You think to yourself &amp;#34;This is amazing, but the curl will fall as soon as I put some mascara on.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> my lashes look amazing and they stay curled forever.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a retail store and the product was amazing at curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> These eyelash curlers are amazing.  </li>
            <li> but my 2 cents is that this curler is really amazing.</li>
            <li> After seeing great reviews in my local paper, I was expecting a wonderful curler.  </li>
            <li> I have used eyelash curlers for many years and was looking for a really good one.</li>
            <li> It fits my eyes very well, and best of all, it DOESN&#x27;T PINCH!</li>
            <li> It fits my eyelid area nicely and curls my stubby lashes.</li>
            <li> Ok, As good as it was cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> so I bought her her own</li>
            <li> My lashes curled nicely and stayed curled with mascara.</li>
            <li> and they curled so nicely.  </li>
            <li> When they stopped selling this at Sephora my sister and I were devastated but after years of using unsatisfactory eyelash cullers we tried looking for it on AMAZON and were thrilled.</li>
            <li> The curler seems well made and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be buying a 20 dl eyelash curler, to be honest</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice is</li>
            <li> It gives a really nice curl.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is really one of the best that I have found.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good curler, I recommend Tarte, however I just purchased one from &amp;#34;Bella and Bear&amp;#34; which I absolutely LOVE.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this eyelash curler because I heard it worked really good.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve always wanted great eyelashes, it&#x27;s definitely worth splurging on!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler by far!!</li>

            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t pinch or tug my eyelashes, which is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> Love that it has rubber refills and fits well in my hand and on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> My favorite eyelash curler for life.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would even work better.   </li>
            <li> I was introduced to shu uemura eyelash curler two years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> but im glad amazon sells</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelash curler for many years.  </li>
            <li> Had this for six months or more.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li> Have used Shu Uemura Eyelash curler for many years.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many others, no comparison to Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> since noticed a lot of the best reviews are from people who are Asian.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelash curler ever</li>
            <li> BUT I TRIED IT ON AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT,  </li>
            <li> Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Does not pinch your eyelids and provides a perfect curl in a short time frame.  </li>
            <li> and I have to admit I like Shu Uemura more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times in the past--it is a staple.  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon as I often save a lot of money--</li>
            <li> The one thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s nothing too flamboyant</li>
            <li> What a fantastic curler!</li>
            <li> The eye piece fits comfortably without catching my skin.</li>
            <li> a healthy thing for any product that is used around the eyes, not to mention misrepresentation.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this eylash curler for many years.</li>
            <li> and I love that one.  </li>
            <li> How many curlers does a women have to go thru in her life?</li>
            <li> Have used for years - nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li> The Shiseido curler shape is wider and do a better job to reaching the lashes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye curler...</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the $5 drugstore curler I had, but it&#x27;s not something I LOVE.</li>
            <li> One of the things I do to guarantee that it&#x27;s authentic is to make sure you know where your product is being shipped from.</li>
            <li> Korean sellers are also relatively reputable.</li>
            <li> for the curler, it is definitely one of the best eyelash curlers you can purchase on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used many many curlers</li>
            <li> LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> I bought the AUTHENTIC Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler from MINOYA.</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> IT IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE STORE OR AT SEPHORA.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it any where else.  </li>
            <li> Had used this curler for many years and then it was gone.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It looks to be authentic, I included some pictures here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can find better reviews elsewhere</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t crimp your eyelashes, just gives your eyelashes a nice smooth curve to it.</li>
            <li> and so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Love the shuuemura eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best eyelash curlers I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the AUTHENTIC one I have</li>
            <li> If there is a better eyelash curler for skimpy lashes I have never found it.</li>
            <li> It also curls better.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I also love that the rubber strip on this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t crease so my eyelashes and makeup don&#x27;t get caught in it.</li>
            <li> Love this curler.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li> Wonderful, the only thing, I can not buy this at Sephora any more.</li>
            <li> but it truely is better.</li>
            <li> Get them one even if they already have one, which if they really love makeup, they probably do.</li>
            <li> The only curler to use,it is the best</li>
            <li> I seem to be able to get more lashes in one</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I really love it ,it can curl my eyelash well</li>
            <li> This is my favorite item in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Shu Uemura eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for her bridal shower because she has been in love with my eyelash curler and could not find it at any store.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> The Shu Uemura is better than the rest.</li>
            <li> Unlike most curlers, this one it shaped better for the eye and doesn&#x27;t pull out lashes as it is used.</li>
            <li> The one I received is authentic... and AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely see why so many people rave about this being THE best curler.</li>
            <li> Authentic Shu Uemura eyelash curler from Port Trading US.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> and they come out perfect and last all day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it from the Shu Uemura website.  </li>
            <li> love this eyelash curler and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but sometimes pulls lashes outp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many others.</li>
            <li> A drugstore eyelash curler works better than this.</li>
            <li> No company makes these better</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of eyelash curlers and had not found one that I was satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> and I love the shape and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull on your lashes.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, you can&#x27;t buy refills for the silicone pad.</li>
            <li> I regret not reading more reviews before I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for many years and needed to get a replacement rubber pad.</li>
            <li> It worked ok</li>
            <li> and I like that even better.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> In fact, I like my Maybelline eyelash curler much better.  </li>
            <li> I believe this to be authentic.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye lash curler that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying some more for all the women in my family for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This one is like magic and it&#x27;s all you need</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any recent reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure how to look for them, so I thought I&#x27;d tell everyone in case they still believe they can&#x27;t get the greatest eyelash curler ever.  </li>
            <li> Use to love, love,</li>
            <li> love SHU UEMURA but the frame has  changed.</li>
            <li> so glad I was able to find it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The shu uemura eyelash curler is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Seems ok to me.</li>
            <li> I have a 10 dollar Sally Hansen lash curler that is better quality.</li>
            <li> I do love the cushion of the silicone curling pad.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to purchase through Amazon (Sephora no longer carries it)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend enough, it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I thought this curler was better than most.</li>
            <li> The cheaper ones are 100 times better</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> and you will be able to tell.</li>
            <li> The genuine article!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve used--have purchased several of these for myself and&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Was advertised as a top eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an eyelash curler for many years--always dreading it...</li>
            <li> just wish it came with more rubber replacements.</li>
            <li> Works great like the real ones</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyelash curler on the market.  </li>
            <li> Read the reviews before ordering and glad I went with this purchase-</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> This curls my lashes better than any curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My friend who is a beauty products enthusiast recommended this Japanese curler as the best in the world (as did the internet), so I decided to try.</li>
            <li> Glad I got.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes do not stay curled for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> its the firs curler I&#x27;ve had and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Best curler out there, easy to clean and works very well.</li>
            <li> Could have gotten a crappy one from Walmart and it would be better</li>
            <li> It never pinches, and I love the rounded pad.</li>
            <li> I love it, once you use it, you will not be able to use anyone elses.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t getting older; they are getting better because of this great beauty tool.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It is the classic and does a great job but the thing I&#x27;ll never get is why it doesn&#x27;t make it in the shape of a curled eyelash.</li>
            <li> Make certain you don&#x27;t misplace the spare rubber piece because it seems that piece is what make the product so completely successful.</li>
            <li> I did not understand what all the fuss was about regarding the shu uemura eyelash curler, as I thought the cheaper curler I bought at Target was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural looking curl...</li>
            <li> Easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love how well it lasts and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Personally I think the quality and effects of the Shu Uemura curler is just as good as the Anna Sui one, but price wise</li>
            <li> found the curler to be nice to handle and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It curls without pinching and  the fit is sturdy in your hand for a skilled and safe curl.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is by far one of the best; with the right mascara your eyelashes stay curled all day.</li>
            <li> I think the key is the cushy pads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a welcome charge to your old curler.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyelash curler from the seller MINOYA, and it is a fantastic curler, as well as an authentic shu uemera product.</li>
            <li> This was authentic, received yesterday with free rubber replacement.  </li>
            <li> I got the authentic curler for a cheaper price and with free shipping.</li>
            <li> great for professional use</li>
            <li> ordered a genuine one from Shu&#x27;s website for $5 more and now that it&#x27;s arrived</li>
            <li> SO much better than the cheap drugstore curlers, and since I wear mascara every day</li>
            <li> My sister never used a eyelash curler, but she has gorgeous lashes and didn&#x27;t really feel she needed one.  </li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> my lashes are already fairly curly but have stubborn ones at the ends that like to lay straight for some reason.</li>
            <li> For my eye shape, this is truly the best curler available, I&#x27;ve tried many other brands including Sephora&#x27;s line as well as Tweezerman, but my Shu always fit better and never pinched my lids.  </li>
            <li> Bought one in October, from Super Fast Shipping from JP, and  it was great, but I lost it.  </li>
            <li> It works so good because its strong and curls fast.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see it available.</li>
            <li> MOST DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what makes this curler so unique, but it curls my lashes better than any eyelash curler I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I bought the original from the She Uemura website and was pleased.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip</li>
            <li> If not, you might want to consider buying this curler from a place you can easily return it to without paying shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Need to do a way better job packaging and shipping the product but overall happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with eyelash curlers, but I will say this one is easy to use and met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does not pinch eyelid.</li>
            <li> I have never pinched my eyelid and it curls my lashes easily.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are easily curled.</li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find.</li>
            <li> 4 starts if because the amazing effect doesn&#x27;t last long after about 5 uses it wasn&#x27;t as good but still very good</li>
            <li> It works best for me and seems to get high ratings in many major magazines.  </li>
            <li> (mine had shot up a bit where i normally get it) crossing my fingers that this would be just as good and when I tried it, the curl didnt even stay for but maybe 4 hrs..</li>
            <li> the best eyelash curler, hands down</li>
            <li> is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down THE best.</li>

            <li> To your surprise, the cost is 12 bucks and has free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it that I actually curl my lashes every day now.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried and tried every eyelash curler available on the market.</li>
            <li> I wonder if its being a genuine product?</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel as great or the same!</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference between a cheap curler and this one.</li>
            <li> The rubber is cheap, and can&#x27;t hold up to even the light pressure of the curling edge.</li>
            <li> worth the wait ,  i will buy more in case they stop making them</li>
            <li> The curler has a wider angle and gets all of your lashes comfortably.</li>
            <li> It opens wider than many curlers and rarely pinches.  </li>
            <li> I had to return mine because I purchased this thinking that I was getting an amazing deal for a real Shu Uemura</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, eyelash curling is not rocket science; it&#x27;s not even advanced calculus, so</li>
            <li> I checked Sephora and found that indeed the shu uemura curler is no longer available in the US, but they offer a Sephora Collection substitute for $16 with a silicone pad that customers have given glowing reviews.    </li>
            <li> Just a light pressure for about 10 seconds will do the trick.</li>
            <li> makes it comfortable.</li>
            <li> THE SILICONE IS CHEAP AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SHU UEMURA LOGO IMPRINT.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE WAS SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li> The silicone pads are not as nice as I would like, but I found one that LASTS really well</li>
            <li> I liked that the Seller shipped it fast too.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, nothing happened to the product.</li>
            <li> The box was opened the product inside was unwrapped, the material cheap and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my eyes&#x27; shape or something.</li>
            <li> Also, you get to choose a free sample product.</li>
            <li> Such a great curler and</li>
            <li> curler came from vendor \\&quot;effective shop japan\\&quot; and I&#x27;d say I got the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I have doubts that this is a genuine Shu eyelash curler, but</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel like all your lashes fit into curler.</li>
            <li> Mine is GENUINE and I went through the checklist [...]</li>
            <li> It used to be available at Ulta and Sephora</li>
            <li> Pulled eyelashes out, which has never happened to me with a genuine Shu Uemera.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, with great results.</li>
            <li> Just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have a light coat of mascara on.</li>
            <li> Seems like a cheap metal</li>
            <li> Thought the quality was cheap, not a fan</li>
            <li> This looks likes a cheap curler anyone can buy from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> They fit in the eye and do the job without pinching.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good with the curler.  </li>
            <li> It works almost as good as my old Maybelline.</li>
            <li> want to buy this a long time for it&#x27;s good reputation, it&#x27;s really easy to use!</li>
            <li> so I wanted to make sure I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as smooth when curling as my original.</li>
            <li> I first tried a Shu Uemura eyelash curler about 15 years ago when a friend worked for L&#x27;Oreal (they own Shu Uemura) and fell in love with it straight away.</li>
            <li> I lost the refill for my first one and loved the eyelash curler so much I had to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Curls quickly and easily..</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favorite one!</li>
            <li> With free shipping, the cost is only $1 more than on Amazon, and you will be sure to get a top quality product.</li>
            <li> Bought a new one from sephora two days later and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this, just bought it for my daughter (her first).</li>
            <li> like the original ones, and doesnt even match sizes with the original ones, neider do they match the joints of the parts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to find one on line for my daughters stocking.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it took over a month to arrive, I&#x27;m pretty sure my curler is a knock off too, as some people have also wrote.</li>
            <li> If the seller is from China/Hong Kong/South East Asia or sometimes even in the US, then you should probably email or contact the seller first to guarantee that you are receiving an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was flimsy and wasn&#x27;t even in packaged in plastic like the original one I purchased.</li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> When I received this curler in the mail, I was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> People beware if you wish to buy one, I suggest you go to the oficial original</li>
            <li> Was not able to get it in stores so happy amazon had this!!</li>
            <li> It did not match the shape and size of the original</li>
            <li> Def worth it!</li>
            <li> You will love it after the first use.</li>
            <li> Having had the SHUSHEIDO eyelash curler in the past, which used to be THE BEST, I was eager to be upgrading to the SHU UEMURA eyelash curler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these on Amazon, but was so upset when I got it.</li>
            <li> Resent that Amazon needs more words for this review than what I said in the first sentence.</li>
            <li> Not the quality of my original shu uemera.  </li>
            <li> Curl is very smooth and natural, unlike many that kink or bend eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Jessica alba suggested it in her new book the honest life.</li>
            <li> It is more rounded, rather than the traditional kind of squared of edges of that part.  </li>
            <li> Curls lashes smoothly, and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected but still ok.</li>
            <li> Once you use this curler, you will never be able to go back to another kind.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several eyelash curlers and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> They curl beautifully and outlast any other curler.  </li>
            <li> as a professional makeup artist, most of the time I still need to use a mini-curler, like the Preo to get those evasive outer-lashes!</li>
            <li> So far I love this eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3, due to them discontinuing the item (and for free shipping - LOL).</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I was so excited that I found it for such a good price.</li>
            <li> Specially for the price.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this persona did as advertised and had a special treat and note inside.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this eyelash curler to be anything special.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find it all that special.</li>
            <li> Later reviews seemed more positive, so I was hopeful I would be a getting a good product.  </li>
            <li> Very durable, easy to use, and the parts glide easily.</li>
            <li> No other eyelash curler can surpass the Shu Uemura which curls so perfectly and keeps the curl lasting all day.</li>
            <li> It is better than its competitors and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I measured it with my true Shu uemura eyelash curler and this product</li>
            <li> so I used the extra pad and still did not get a good result,  </li>
            <li> Not as much pinching but could still be better.</li>
            <li> It is a good curler, very similar than Japonese brand.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> They are pricey compared to brands available in makeup department at drug store but the results are worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I read an article in a fashion magazine about this eyelash curler and how good it is for asian eyes.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice natural curl.</li>
            <li> THE REAL SHU UEMURA CURL THE EYELASH LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li> You might as well go to CVS and pay $6.00 for a better eyelash curler or order the real thing from the company website.</li>
            <li> and you have to buy the entire curler again once that is no longer good.</li>
            <li> For my think asian lashes, I think this eyelash curler does a good job in keep my lashes curled.</li>
            <li> It works but not any better than a much cheaper eye lash curler you can get at Target or Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> And surprisingly, it&#x27;s the same</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes really stand out more than before (before applying mascara)</li>
            <li> Totally true.  </li>
            <li> the American production is just not as good.</li>
            <li> This was the only curler that I loved.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and great to curl all those little eyelashes in the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li> The original was/is worth all the hype.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant spending more that $10 on an eyelash curler because I am so particular.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many curlers and this one simply knocks it out of the park.</li>
            <li> Round, lovely curls are achieved by good tools and practiced technique.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly and packaged accordingly.</li>
            <li> this brand is shaped much better for Asian shaped eyes and works much better to get all the lashes curled</li>
            <li> After buying countless crappy drugstore eyelash curlers, I finally found the perfect one!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Curls lashes quickly and easily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight eyelashes and this curler works!</li>
            <li> It was great to be able to have the actual one for her to open instead of just telling her that it was coming in the mail.  </li>
            <li> It curls my lashes nicely and the curl lasts for hours unlike most of the other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> When I first received this lash curler it looked like a cheap version I could buy in a drug store.</li>
            <li> It gives me a piece of mind knowing that I bought a genuine product and not a fake one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet strong.</li>
            <li> Good eyelash curler, I have purchase japonesque in the past, and it seemed to grab ALL my lashes more than this one.</li>
            <li> I indeed received the real thing, so can easily recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this one with two of my old Shu curlers I own (both of which are exactly identical) and here are just the differences I&#x27;ve noticed after comparing them for a minute:&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she said it was exactly what she wanted!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler I will buy and I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and it was the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Heat it up with a hair dryer and really curl your lashes!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine to sell eyelash curlers, but selling under the brand name Shu Uemura is very misleading and unethically.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye lash curler, worth taking the extra time to order online since it can&#x27;t be found in the states any longer!</li>
            <li> the mechanism is smooth and gentle on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> These curl the lash very well, and feel comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> No problems whatsoever and worth the money</li>
            <li> I am able to get a natural looking curl that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li> There is nothing similar about it to the one I own.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth one star.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the price considering others pinch.</li>
            <li> I never had success curling my lashes with drugstore curlers and this one works as all the makeup artists testify.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be worth the money, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> It works much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> This one is shaped slightly different and seems to fit on the lashes much better.</li>
            <li> I KNOW that the one I got is authentic, because I have compared side by side with the Shu Curler that I got directly from the shu uemura website.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the angle of the curler is different and the quality of the Amazon curler is inferior.  </li>
            <li> It looks like someone already opened it and the curler itself is not seal in the plastic bag, which it proves my point,</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to press on my lashes but about once, rarely twice to get them curled.</li>
            <li> They curl nicely and last.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t bother to buy ten cheap ones thinking you are saving money - you are so much better off to just go with this one to start.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and the pads</li>
            <li> , I figured it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Not disappointing.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the price but did not come with any replacement rubber seal&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> this is my favorite curler by far.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> Took a while to ship from Japan, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> However, $20 a year for this eyelash curler is still worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> metal curler portion dips into a middle cut in the rubber bottom...which effectively &amp;#34;trims&amp;#34; eyelashes...</li>
            <li> This curler got right up to the base of your eyelashes and created the most perfect curl without pinching your precious eyelid.</li>
            <li> I returned it right away.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> , you should buy them right now.</li>
            <li> you should probably just buy them right now too.</li>
            <li> It does hold the curl with the right mascara.</li>
            <li> Had one with grips on finger tips in past which I liked better.</li>
            <li> The one I received is small, cheaply made, and does not do a good job of curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Add a hair dryer for a little heat, amazing results!</li>
            <li> It shipped so quickly and was able to use it as soon as possible~!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, usually.</li>
            <li> and when I compared them, this one was cheaply made, much lighter than the authentic one, and the hardware was completely different.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many, many a eyelash curler from as much as 30+ $ to as little as 2.99.....</li>
            <li> This curler is a cut above your drugstore curler, it is soft and gentle on the lashes but very effective.</li>
            <li> I then compared the SU I already have and confirmed that the new one is a knock-off.</li>
            <li> So, I won&#x27;t be ordering from GOOD STUFF FOR EVEN LESS.</li>
            <li> Not even close to as good as my previous Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> Curls easily and naturally without damaging your lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very straight eyelashes and have had to use an eyelash curler for years.</li>
            <li> eyelashes are very straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s a great curler, if I could get it to work; but its opening is only about 1/2 as wide as my old curler and therein lies the problem.   </li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li> No pinching of eyelid skin and a good curl with little effort</li>
            <li> Prime&#x27;s shipping is really fast!</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first</li>
            <li> It was flimsy and had a lot of differences from my current (authentic) eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not a fake like some of the people received from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Sure there were the occasional pinches and pulls.</li>
            <li> Both pads should be soft, smooth, somewhat pliable to the touch and have \\&quot;shu uemura\\&quot; stamped on the underside.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> it saves me so much money on mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this curler and will never go back to the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> And sure enough, there it was!</li>
            <li> Pay the $20 and buy the authentic product on there actual website.</li>
            <li> On the first use, I knew it wasn&#x27;t a quality Shu Uemura curler.  </li>
            <li> This one definitely was more flimsy, and the pieces rattled, it didn&#x27;t even compare to the quality of my original.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I guess this deserves 5 stars because it works exactly as it should and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Purchased as this product had been proven superb in the past when purchased at a local boutique.</li>
            <li> Consistently pulled out 1-2 eyelashes, even when I greased it with petroleum jelly or lotion.</li>
            <li> so I could have one automatically on hand when my first one goes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than the regular ones you can buy at a store.</li>
            <li> a makeup artist and know pretty well the Shue mura eylash curler.</li>
            <li> I have seen a number of reviews that claim the Shu Uemura eyelash curler sold here is fake, but regardless, this is the best eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li> do not buy from amazon, there&#x27;s no way to tell if seller is selling the real deal!</li>
            <li> First, let me say I am the queen of side by side testing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash curler from Organic Direct at the beginning of August when I heard they were no longer going to be available in the US.  </li>
            <li> The curler I received was in an authentic box and looks real enough, but I think it must be a knock off.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much cheaper on Amazon anyway!</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail promptly, and it is most definitely NOT a Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> If you are unimpressed by most lash curlers, I can assure you that this one is definitely the game-changer of all lash curlers.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the crimping power of the first one I purchased....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this eyelash curler</li>
            <li> i try using it on my bare eyelashes and it doesn&#x27;t do much, it works better for me with a bit of mascara on.  </li>
            <li> My short and straight lashes always stay up! :)</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look so much longer!</li>
            <li> Similar to Lancôme eye lash curler where an associate informed me that you have to angle it out to have a better curl effect.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of mixed reviews on here, many from about 2010-11 bemoaning receipt of a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; curler.  </li>
            <li> white inner box was stylish and looked authentic.  </li>
            <li> funny bonus...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Not being able to buy them locally any longer, I turned to the internet.  </li>
            <li> First time I purchased with this company and the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The markings on the curler are slightly different and I feel like it may not be &#x27;authentic&#x27; Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is not a fake curler-</li>
            <li> I ordered extra refill, they haven&#x27;t arrived yet, just better to have on hand than try to replace.</li>
            <li> It really opens your eye!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and this one tops them all!</li>
            <li> its not even a hot day</li>
            <li> Pardon the pun ;-)</li>
            <li> My eye lashes really curl well with this curler!  </li>
            <li> and this consistently beats them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come away with some interesting red lines on the side of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Buy the real thing if you really want to get true Shu Uemura results.</li>
            <li> so I can keep the first one in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this new product I expected the curl to be superior, however, was unsatisfied with the lack of curl factor it had.  </li>
            <li> i get a better curl from a cheap eyelash curler from odd lots than this one , dont like it at all</li>
            <li> The profit is being used to purchase more black hair dye and gluten free chow mien.</li>
            <li> Was never very good at curling my eyelashes, but this wonderful product has assisted me in confidence and proper use of an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> After using it, however, I realized it definitely  made my straight fine lashes curl and stay curled, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Alternately, if you don&#x27;t wear any makeup ever, but want to make your face look brighter, your eyes larger and more awake, and your whole face better...</li>
            <li> Since I cannot find the original refills for my old Maybelline, I needed something.</li>
            <li> Curls my eyelashes more quickly than other models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that Shu Uemura is the way to go for eyelash curlers, but I wish I had listened earlier, because this is an amazing product that is superior to any other similar product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever but getting harder and harder to find!!!</li>
            <li> So you decide to check out your favorite online shopping website to see how much this &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; will set you back.</li>
            <li> So much so that I will be ordering a second one for my mom for her birthday :)</li>
            <li> If you go to the Shu Uemura USA website, you can definitely order this curler and make sure it&#x27;s the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this one isn&#x27;t as good as the first Shu Uemura</li>
            <li> i just wish the silicon pads lasted a little longer and the shu uemura would provide more than just 1 pad refills or allow buyers to purchase more pads instead of having to buy a whole new curler.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well although not as well as the real deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on other curlers this is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as an ordinary eyelash curler, except the price.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve discovered the importance of having a good eyelash curler (I&#x27;m Asian with short straight lashes</li>
            <li> I have requested a full refund from Organic Direct.  </li>
            <li> It feels flimsy, while my older Shu Uemura curler seems more solid.  </li>
            <li> Worked good first couple of time and now it doesn&#x27;t even hardly curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware it is a cheap imitation and does not perform anywhere near as well as the Authentic Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler.</li>
            <li> Note: I slightly heat by curler with warm air from my hair dryer (checking the temperature on may hand before using on my eye).</li>
            <li> but this is the only one that easily does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this eyelash curler, just go to the shu uemura website, and you can buy it for a GENUINE one for the exact same price.</li>
            <li> They even have the newer Japanese design with the open sides for smaller and more precise attention available.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found my old one...</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler most certainly was used, NOT NEW from Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li> I think that manufactures are no making them with a deliberate need to hold via a certain angle in order to get your eyelash to curl.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty straight forward, it gets all the lashes, &amp; I feel like my eyelashes look much longer &amp; really let my eyes shine.</li>
            <li> new eyelash curler has a tightness which this did not have; it was more likely than not \\&quot;recycled\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared it to my original Shu Uemera and it&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
            <li> I take that back, the lashes closer to the inside of my eye are curled fine, it&#x27;s the ones toward the outer part of my eye that look bent, \\&quot;L shaped\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I think a standard curler would be just fine.</li>
            <li> This item is on the expensive side (it is a very good product) and you can&#x27;t purchase the replacement pads separatly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t open and close smoothly, and it did not have a silicone pad the way the real ones do.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few, this one is amazing</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it out a whole lot yet</li>
            <li> Even $19.99 is to much for this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> When it curls eyelashed are bent straight up instead of curled.  </li>
            <li> It feels much cheaper and lighter than the one I have.  </li>
            <li> This is a knockoff and is nothing like the real Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler.  </li>
            <li> thanks Amazon for still supplying it.</li>
            <li> I am still on a Quest for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works really well.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt even resemble the real shu uemura.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the Shu curler after reading all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Mine are naturally straight, and all it takes are a couple of 15-second presses to keep them curled all day (with the help of a coat or two of mascara).</li>
            <li> Besides the Shu Uemura site, Sephora and Ulta are the only vendors that I know of that always sell the genuine product.</li>
            <li> MY SISTER BOUGH THE REAL SHU UEMURA ON SAPHORA.COM FOR $20, I COULD NOT BELIVE SOMEONE WOULD BUY A $20 EYE CURLER.</li>
            <li> It is posted as the real thing</li>
            <li> It rattles too much -</li>
            <li> no broken lashes...</li>
            <li> Save yourself the doubt and buy it from the shu uemura website, that way you know you will get the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, not a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed...should have known by the price.  </li>
            <li> how it curls eyelashes straight up.  </li>
            <li> The harder I squeezed, the more eyelashes got pulled out.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived a week before its earliest expected arrival date and the seller threw a snack with the order (awe how cute).</li>
            <li> Is very well made.</li>
            <li> I have straight eye lashes and with the shu uemura eye lash curler my lashes stayed curled for days on out even after I washed and cleaned them with make up remover.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think a curler could make a difference</li>
            <li> Not the real product .This</li>
            <li> I have been buying the real product for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shu Eemura eyelash curler for my straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> the shape (which the real Shu Uemura is known for) is on point</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would get a seller with the real thing</li>
            <li> I ordered the real one from the official site</li>
            <li> they are trying to pretend that what they are selling is even close to the real thing.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND BUY THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> you want to a comparison of this curler to the real one, check out this blog</li>
            <li> She loves it and uses it very often.</li>
            <li> it was because my eyelashes  are to short to fit in the curler, I have had this problem before.</li>
            <li> i ordered this from seller Elecet Tai, not having had a real Shu Uemura curler before.</li>
            <li> this one looks JUST like the real one, comparing pictures i couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I had one I had purchased locally at Sephora, which was fantastic.    </li>
            <li> I trusted amazon.com to only list genuine products.</li>
            <li> The one I received was real.</li>
            <li> This product after I used it on my straight lashes really curled them for me.</li>
            <li> Really curls the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> $17 is not that much.</li>
            <li> Every Christmas my wife wants this eyelash curler and my daughter</li>
            <li> It bends my lashes straight up towards the sky and they stay that way all day, even without mascara, until I wash my face at night.  </li>
            <li> Was just what I was hoping it would be very pleasef</li>
            <li> I curled my lashes as soon as I got the real Shu Uemura eyelash curler, I didn&#x27;t use mascara and my lashes were stayed curled....</li>
            <li> Didnt even come close to curling lashes the way the real one does...</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t hurt myself, it DIDN&#x27;T CURL the LASHES very well.</li>
            <li> Well, it´s ok but doesn´t curl as I expected .</li>
            <li> I did my research and found out what a REAL one looks like.</li>
            <li> BTW, the extra pad they give you doesn&#x27;t fit the curler.  </li>
            <li> this really does curl your lashes as opposed to bend them.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is not the real Shu Uemera curler.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything like the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have the real one from when shu uemura sold in the US and compared it.  </li>
            <li> One gentle</li>
            <li> Looks like this vendor changed what they were shipping because my two Shu Uemura eyelash curlers appear to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> However, with the pricing and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It literally makes your eyelashes stand straight up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just get the cheap one from the grocery store next time.</li>
            <li> My mistake for thinking I was getting a deal and getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well and is NOT  a Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, pinches eyelid and does not curl properly!!</li>
            <li> very rounded, i have to really go around and curl the ends.&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended seller!</li>
            <li> The REAL curlers&#x27; metal pieces do not raffle when you shake it like this one does;&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The REAL curler&#x27;s silicone pads has the raised words &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; along the inside of the curler, which this one does not.</li>
            <li> I have board straight eyelashes</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This curls the eyelashes really well and does not pull and tug on them.  </li>
            <li> It is made of a much lighter, cheaper metal and</li>
            <li> Very shady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never had much luck with eyelash curlers-</li>
            <li> But once I tried this I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to those cheap eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> THe shipping was fast and appreciated since there is no retail outlet for purchasing this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I compared it with the REAL Shu Uemura eyelash curler</li>
            <li> no matter how much I curl them, they ended up straight.</li>
            <li> It felt very worn out.</li>
            <li> It does not curl my lashes very well (some stay straight, others curl) and they do not stay curled.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t pulled out any of my lashes yet, haha.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product through this seller on Amazon to see if this was the real thing, and also ordered one on Shu Uemura&#x27;s website for comparison.</li>
            <li> Must not be the real thing...</li>
            <li> I warm mine up, slightly, with my blow dryer to make it work even faster!</li>
            <li> Okay, so maybe I&#x27;m not the most coordinated individual in the world, and, as previously mentioned, most eyelash curling takes place when I&#x27;m still half asleep, but nothing&#x27;s changed in my routine but the curler.       </li>
            <li> It is not really different than the other brands; it&#x27;s just a good eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> A big plus is that you don&#x27;t have to look down and crimp hard to get that perfect lift and curl, just a light press</li>
            <li> Luckily I kept my old one and just used the new rubber.</li>
            <li> definitively it is not an original shu uemura, (although the seller told me the opposite by mail)</li>
            <li> This curler works better than any other curler I&#x27;ve ever tried-</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler fits the shape of my eyelid better than any other.</li>
            <li> and i have tried to like it for the fact that its supposed to be a better eye lash curler than the other brands.</li>
            <li> Works for me better than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> The brand name was not in the same font as the original.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to order it based on the other reviews I read about it not being authentic, but since I never tried a Shu Uemura curler, I had nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post comments/reviews but this is not an authentic Shu Uemura eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> It still works better than any other, but it&#x27;s almost like it has been used.  </li>
            <li> Strongly suggest Asian girls to but it, or other girls whose eyelash shape is not very deep and round, this one fits you perfectly!</li>
            <li> When my 3 twenty-something daughters first told me how great shu uemura eyelash curlers are, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not too much of a worry as long as I have this fantastic curler.</li>
            <li> I am returning it for a full refund and springing the extra $10 for the real thing.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and it gets EVERY eyelash including the far outside eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes look fabulous for the first time all the time, and this curler is easier to use than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Our landfills and full enough and my consumer habits need curbing here and there.</li>
            <li> Cheaper metal frame, the name imprinted on the back of the curved part is different, smaller font,  and most of all it does not perform at all like the original.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my SU eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> For those who are newly purchasing the Shu Uemura eyelash curler, this is not the real one.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a whole new one just because I needed a refill.</li>
            <li> but I think tarte has a better one for less money.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because there are so many knock-offs that sell for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t care less about its authenticity, this thing is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> After using several curlers that quick working after a couple of months, I purchased this based on reviews.</li>
            <li> but i still want to look decent.</li>
            <li> I tried the second pad, just to make sure I hadn&#x27;t had a faulty one, but it was the same.  </li>
            <li> It is super flimsy and very low quality.  </li>
            <li> I quickly learned that not all eyelash curlers are created equal!</li>
            <li> Only curler that I can use because it fits the Asian eye better.</li>
            <li> The silver curler had an authentic looking Shu Uemura engraving on it and seemed tight and well sprung.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to those who want to try it out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This curler came highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is the high end</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Back in the days I&#x27;d buy curlers at Daiso (Japanese dollar store) and drug stores but none of them lasted very long or did a good job on curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> The curler always arrives on or before due date, is packaged well, and there is always an additional free surprise, nothing big, but just a sweet surprise.</li>
            <li> it curls naturally and does not crimp your lashes!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but it does curl your lashes so much better with little effort.</li>
            <li> so I do suspect that it might be a cheap imitation of the real brand</li>
            <li> Other curlers would crimp the lashes, not really give it that nice, smooth curl, but this one actually did that.</li>
            <li> So good, for small eyelash!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and just wasnt happy--either didnt curl well or pinched the lid too easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased this before and will do it again, definitely my favorite eyelash curler hands down!</li>
            <li> Much like the old fashioned ones in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Expensive at $20 but great results.</li>
            <li> I have naturally short-ish pin straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked amazed and happy!!!!</li>
            <li> A great eyelash curler is a necessity for me,as cheaper curlers tend to either rip out my lashes or fail to capture all the lashes in the crimping process.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is I purchased it from Shu Uemura and only spent $19.99.  </li>
            <li> Most of the curlers I have used in the past did not curl my lashes very well and they did not hold a curl even with my use of water proof mascara.</li>
            <li> It was completely unusable, and I sent it back for a full refund.    </li>
            <li> It is completely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler worth using - does all as advertised, without breaking lashes.</li>
            <li> I did not need to do as suggested, by pulling back and doing a second squeeze at the middle of the lashes, and another at the tips, because one good line up did enough, and very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When this arrived it looked like a poorly made version of my beloved SHU UEMURA Eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> and there is really nothing special about this product other than it being pricier.</li>
            <li> The silicone pad also lasts much longer than the standard rubber pad on most other curlers.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these, not long enough to fit all my eye lashes in.</li>
            <li> Comparing them with the real shu uemura eyelash curlers that we do have, they are cheaply made and clearly not the same product.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was imagining stuff, but the other reviewers confirmed it for me.</li>
            <li> I need to find a new replacement.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need a new curler every 12-18 months...</li>
            <li> I am promptly returning it and buying a new one from Nordstrom or Sephora instead.  </li>
            <li> At that point it is time for a new curler.  </li>
            <li> This new one is a poorer quality.  </li>
            <li> With all the knock-offs appearing on the market now, I honestly believe, as does the other person who uses this same product regularly, that this one is not the real item.  </li>
            <li> A cheap imitation knock off.  </li>
            <li> For those who claim that they bought fake curlers: I&#x27;ve always been very cautious about online shopping and the one that I received was an authentic curler from seller MILD Japan.</li>
            <li> You can see it particularly at the welding joints, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to feel &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; in my hand like my old one.  </li>
            <li> Others are more expensive but don&#x27;t fit eye contours as well as Shu Uemura&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it makes much of a difference compared to a decent drug store one.</li>
            <li> They seem to be the only ones that fit my eye well enough to a grip on all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased it with high hopes of replacing my old eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> The curl is very natural.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes curl better with this than other eyelash curlers, but lasting curl</li>
            <li> Because the silicone pad cracks, it crimps my already short lashes and makes them look funny.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Im not sure this is authentic Shu.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only curler that really works!</li>
            <li> just order it direct!</li>
            <li> Not sure about some of for reviews here in regard to this eyelash curler not being authentic.</li>
            <li> But I was willing to let that go, since each pad was supposed to last 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I want to return a product and not sure this is authentic shu uemura product.</li>
            <li> Now for the product, it&#x27;s ok, not sure about all the hype</li>
            <li> I had stopped using curlers because they were such a hassle, and now that I have one that works simply, and I use it regularly, I can actually SEE better!  </li>
            <li> I have used them for many years and would never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, simple to keep clean and to change the pads.</li>
            <li> Felt like my old one just with a new rubber band.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement inserts for my old one, so I just bought a new one.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grow straight out - i mean super straight!</li>
            <li> So whether this is an imitation or not, the one I purchased was the original, and I found it far inferior to any eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But after using it only once, I could tell they are definitely not the same, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to notice the differences in quality and craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was not intact, the rubber replacement was in a large baggie, not the tiny sealed bag that comes with Shu Uemura products when bought</li>
            <li> &quot; but I had to press hard and do it more than 5 times.</li>
            <li> It curls my lashes quickly and doesn&#x27;t make them look kinky like other eyelash curlers do.</li>
            <li> A real Shu Uemura eyelash curler should open and close smoothly and take little effort for you to work it.</li>
            <li> I wish you could buy the rubber replacements pieces but whe it wears out, you have to buy complete set.</li>
            <li> I got a eyelash curler that is boxed and labeled as &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t feel or work like my old curler.</li>
            <li> I have been buying them on line direct from Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine directly from the Shu website, so</li>
            <li> I have been using a Shu Uemura eyelash curler for the last 5 years and know it very well.</li>
            <li> This is a total knock off of the real brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> The actual eyelash curler is the exact same shape as the one I got at Target, but the pads are much rounder, and apparently that&#x27;s the secret to getting amazingly curly lashes.</li>
            <li> I still had my old Shu hanging around, so I could compare both curlers.  </li>
            <li> some time as hassle and just buy directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The one I received is very flimsy and the rubber pad doesn&#x27;t fill in the entire curler, almost like the pad needs to be longer.  </li>
            <li> It also seems like it doesn&#x27;t curl as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> I just never had that problem with my old one.</li>
            <li> Start at the root, release, slide up to the middle, release and gently crease the tips of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Buy direct at Shuuemura.com.</li>
            <li> I used my last one so much, the rubber kept falling out.  </li>
            <li> Curl is soft and natural.</li>
            <li> I compared the Amazon curler with the my old one from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This curler is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li> I compared this to my old one that I got directly from the Shu Uemura website awhile ago.</li>
            <li> My mom has a real one and there is definitely a difference.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended in &amp;#34;How Not to Look Old...</li>
            <li> I am completely bummed that they don&#x27;t sell it anywhere</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> The REAL curlers are slightly smaller than this one, in both length and width;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The REAL curlers never squeaks when you open and close the curlers like this one does;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> When used, the REAL curlers actually curl my lashes and never crimps and bend them like this one does; and&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it is the holiday time, I&#x27;ve been busy, so I  </li>
            <li> I lost my old Shu Uemura eyelash curler after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> your time, money, and efforts and order directly from the brand&#x27;s US website or try Shiseido&#x27;s eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I held the pad refill up to my old one and it was a cm or so shorter.)</li>
            <li> My wife says this is &amp;#34;by far the best&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura eyelash curlers for years and this recent purchase may very well be a knock off.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t get all the hype about this - it doesn&#x27;t seem that different from my much cheaper Revlon lash curler.</li>
            <li> I received both items and this is definitely not the real thing.</li>
            <li> (Usually nice things have a bunch of unnecessary packaging on the inside in my experience)</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s ok, not amazing for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, not amazing and didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> Eyelash curlers are put under significant pressure by your grasping little make up applying hands, causing them to be bent out of alignment- the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li> So I have been searching high and low for a curler that will actually curl my straight eyelashes...</li>
            <li> and this one is a cheap imitation with the Shu Uemura simply printed on it.</li>
            <li> It curls each lash with precision and my flat eyes are very grateful to this curler for the wonders it does.</li>
            <li> The bar is long enough to fit around your entire lash line and get every lash you have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than a lot of other curlers but since I use it every day it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used other eyelash curlers before but haven&#x27;t ever had very positive results.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money, as it lasts a long time and gives me enough curl that I don&#x27;t even need to apply mascara.</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t open up enough so positioning it over your lashes is a hassle.</li>
            <li> That problem seems to be past now going by most recent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the second one I have bought, the first lasted several years.  </li>
            <li> Super little eyelash curler, my old one just wore out.</li>
            <li> although the reviews left me expecting magic, I guess only time will tell if this little device stands the test of time.</li>
            <li> After trying many eyelash curlers that claim to be as good as Shu Uemura, I have wasted  a lot of money on bad substitutes.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not as wide as my old one</li>
            <li> I have always had long straight eyelashes and</li>
            <li> The one purchased directly from the company worked exactly how I remembered but the one I purchased here barely worked and was very loose.  </li>
            <li> I have stick straight lashes and with lots of lightweight mascara and curling several several times it definitely helps them keep somewhat of a decent curl.</li>
            <li> I just thought it looked a little cheap when you open it.</li>
            <li> The other feature that makes the curler better than others is the black pad, which goes under the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is light years above any other brand curler!!  </li>
            <li> When I recently tried to buy a new curler, I was told that Shu Umera was no longer selling in the U.S.</li>
            <li> They say you have to buy an entire new curler.  </li>
            <li> The actual eyelash curler is worn and was provided in a box two new silicone refills.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s the same as most drugstore one (that cost $18 less), but if you&#x27;re looking to buy an actual Shu Umera, this isnt it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover the entire eye, therefore you can not curl your whole lash at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have Asian almond eyes with a double eyelid with straight downward pointing lashes, just for reference.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes stick straight out and this product is the only one that can actually curl them.</li>
            <li> so im very dissapointed...just ordering the more expensive one</li>
            <li> Was exactly what other reviewers promised.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tug on your eyelashes (unless you don&#x27;t know how to use an eyelash curler and tug in the wrong direction), and cleans pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra money compared to Revlon or any other cheaper makeup brand.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit pricier than others, but definitely worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Although a little on the pricey side it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I was willing to splurge a little and buy another when my 5 year old Paula Dorf eyelash curler gave it up.  </li>
            <li> It only offers the slightest curl, really it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely gentle on your lashes with long lasting results!</li>
            <li> It was a complete knock off of the actual eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> The product is not the same as I have been buying direct.  </li>
            <li> so the next one I ordered directly from Shu Uemura,  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s 3 years old and the same brand / product.  </li>
            <li> The curler on this doesn&#x27;t see to curl as well as I remembered, but still far above the rest out there.</li>
            <li> This was not the same eyelash curler that you get from Shu Uemura direct.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a one-off non-functional product, but this barely curls my lashes.</li>
            <li> but apparently that isn&#x27;t an option...</li>
            <li> This arrived today and I was surprised at the low quality (and we are talking eyelash curlers...).  </li>
            <li> So I compared it to my old one and noticed the font was different.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it works for some people, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality does not seem similar to my old curler.  </li>
            <li> I am so relieved to find the perfect curler for big wide eyes with long eyelashes, so that even the outer corners are included instead of getting bunched up and matted with an awkward crimp.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my old Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I am so use to Revlon eyelash curlers that pinch and pull and then the cushion becomes useless till when I tried these, it was so nice NOT to be pinched</li>
            <li> I thought I for sure it would be broken.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but this is the kind of beauty device you buy once every 20 years.</li>
            <li> Athough the eyelash curlers look similar at first glance there are some slight differences (I also used an old Shu Uemura curler I had on-hand for the comparison).</li>
            <li> It was brand new, in what looked like the same white box as the one that I had purchased from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> This particular curler in one month&#x27;s time has a screw that has pulled loose and the rubber insert has fallen out.</li>
            <li> I purchased the gold-plated version of this eyelash curler and put it up against my trusty Maybelline curler that is probably older than, aww, let&#x27;s say it at least goes  back to the Clinton Administration.  </li>
            <li> The tool is worth a little extra money if you truly want \\&quot;bang for your buck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A Friend brought me back one from actual JAPAN, and the quality is so much better and the tiny print on the curler next to the logo letters is &amp;#34;v&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;w&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve bought in the past from American based sellers.</li>
            <li> the curler doesn&#x27;t open up far enough to get your eyelashes in there.</li>
            <li> I had tried the drug store brands and they are just shaped differently and do not create a natural lasting curl like this one does!</li>
            <li> ive use so far that can curl my short asian lashes evenly and make my lashes visible.</li>
            <li> The silicone pad also seems different and did not curl my lashes the same as my old curler (which makes me question the authenticity of this product).</li>
            <li> the only good thing i can say about this is it came in a few days after i ordered, however its not what i expected its not a very good item</li>
            <li> all of my eyelashes easily without them getting caught in the sides or ripping them out or doing too much damage to them (I only have to press down a few times for it to work- where as other lash curlers</li>
            <li> Silicone refills last much longer than the rubber ones which come with other curlers.  </li>
            <li> It actually works even if you just got out of the shower and your eyelashes are too wet, or if you had to remove all of your eyemakeup for some reason, it still curls very well (a recent mascara, eyeshadow, and eyeliner application).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s advertised as exactly what I purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, it&#x27;ll make a slight improvement, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable in general and nothing compared to other previous ones I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> days later, a little box arrives with your new toy: your brand new curler.</li>
            <li> so my eyelashes are not very long.</li>
            <li> It really lifts and curls well, as I tend to have big eyes with long eyelashes that angle down toward the eye rather than curling upward naturally.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a tad pricey for an eyelash curler, but decided to purchase due to high praises.</li>
            <li> The edges are too high and sharp and dig into my eye</li>
            <li> only use WATERPROOF mascara if you don&#x27;t your lashes will weigh down and become straight.</li>
            <li> Although this is the only eyelash curler may look the same as others, there is a very subtle difference in the curve that is more suited to the actual shape of your eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Curler looks exactly the same as other shu umuera curlers I have bought in the past, but the pad is different, doesn&#x27;t have the logo on the bottom and is much stiffer silicone.</li>
            <li> the last month I was able to buy an actual SHU UEMURA eyelash curler in Hong Kong, at a SHU UEMURA location, and having the real thing to compare, it is completely obvious that the curler I purchased on amazon is a fake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good eyelash curler for a while after buying less expensive one&#x27;s from drug stores.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as good a job as others that are much less expensive.</li>
            <li> But as far as comfort and all of the claims it doesn&#x27;t pinch - not true as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s way too expensive and seriously not that special.</li>
            <li> It is rounded, not flat, and seems to me to be the key to getting a curl and not a crease in lashes.</li>
            <li> I found the shape awkward to use since it is more straight and not perfectly curved to fit the eye.</li>
            <li> heck even a gas station, for so little; especially something that seems pretty cut and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the right pressure.</li>
            <li> I always go for JAPANESE sellers even at a slightly higher cost because there are very few knock-offs/fake items in Japan.</li>
            <li> This is poorly made, much smaller than the original, and the mechanism sticks.  </li>
            <li> For me, it doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than any other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been expecting this for long~ I am Asian and some eyelash curler does not fit my eyes, but this one, my dream SHU, fits very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curler and was surprised that it did not work nearly as well as the ones I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> :/ When it closes all the way one side stays just slightly open, it is very saddening.</li>
            <li> If they only sold the little rubber insert separately I would have purchased 10 of them and not needed an entirely new curler.</li>
            <li> My wife was disappointed when she received a cheap imitation clothed in a genuine looking box.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new curler since it is such a waste.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, compared to some that I have bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> No better, no worse.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be basically the same as any other curler I have ever used, only more expensive.</li>
            <li> LONG STORY SHORT, COMPARED</li>
            <li> but the Shiseido was a bit too flat for my eye</li>
            <li> had really wondered if I was buying into a myth by paying $20 for an eyelash curler that might be got at a drugstore for far less, but I am wondering no more.  </li>
            <li> last a long time!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of previous reviews that state that people are receiving fakes, but it appears as if Amazon has clearly remedied that issue.  </li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection, the logo was different on the fake and the silicone refill was cheaply made and was not stamped &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Save your money and wait for the real ones (which are at least $19 EVERYWHERE) to come back in stock.</li>
            <li> but it has such a delicate touch and feel and really does an expert job of curling the lashes and keeping them curled, it just enhances any mascara product you might use.  </li>
            <li> Does not curl half as good as others I have tried and they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> No matter my attempts to use it in different ways to be as careful as possible with my lashes it still breaks my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> One explained how it changes the look of your lash closer to the base and is angled in such a way that it bends your eyelashes up higher and &amp;#34;harsher&amp;#34; so they stay and make your lashes look HUGE.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the plain Jane Sally Hansen &amp;#34;flirty eyes&amp;#34; drugstore curler, but was hoping this new curler would hold the curl longer.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I wish it would open more, sometimes I have a hard time getting all my lashes through, but my lashes are very difficult to curl and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Curls lashes more completely than other products I&#x27;ve used, but is a little difficult to position on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to squeeze so hard with this curler.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to justify spending so much money on something that you can buy at the drug store,</li>
            <li> This is one of the few purchases where I&#x27;ve had to write a less than positive review.</li>
            <li> I know this was a fake because I compared it against my genuine Shu Uemura that I was still using.</li>
            <li> The Shu Uemura eye lash curler gently caresses your lashes like a ballet dancer in a pas de deux, delicately, until they lengthen and expand radiantly-- like an arabesque.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t make any curl at all, so I am going to have to be satisfied with my old one---it may not hold the curl all day, but at least it curled (and the hinge part doesn&#x27;t squish into my face).</li>
            <li> (mine&#x27;s a few years old and still opens/shuts well...</li>
            <li> Inferior product and a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am blessed with long lashes and it doesn&#x27;t kink them.</li>
            <li> Will have to see if it lasts a long time or not.</li>
            <li> and they stayed that way for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Shu Uemura is similar...does not open as wide...</li>
            <li> Not surprised when you look at the price you got.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy from another seller and wait a long time for it.</li>
            <li> how long that will</li>
            <li> When I sent an email to the company asking why it was taking so long, they stated &amp;#34;Amazon doesn&#x27;t tell you we are shipping from Japan.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The curl also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> (I also do not have tons of lashes, just a long eye I guess.</li>
            <li> that long anyway.</li>
            <li> my fault for not contacting the seller as my window of time already closed on this item last week.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a crying CRYING shame that this curler is no longer offered in the US.</li>
            <li> Due to the reviews for this product and the claims that this eyelash curler may be an imitation, I decided to order directly from the shu uermura website.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get a gift for someone new to makeup, or who doesn&#x27;t wear any (or wears very little makeup), you should get them these too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that you have to buy a whole new curler instead of just the refill pads, but I suppose you get what you pay</li>
            <li> The bag inside held the curler, and another tiny ziplock bag with an extra replacement black silicone pad.  </li>
            <li> The REAL curlers has a slightly flatter round curve compared to this curler;&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that at a quick glance, you only see that this product got an avg of 3 out of 5 stars b/c of the fakes being sold.</li>
            <li> The one I had was probably 15 years old and just plain worn out</li>
            <li> This is NOT an authentic Shu Uemura product, it is a fake knock off!</li>
            <li> I do and have tried other curlers, but they are just not the same.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is selling this item for $29.95 but the other retail outlets, including the manufacturer is selling this very same product for $17.00.</li>
            <li> And curler effect with any other curlers lasted only about 20 min</li>
            <li> What a difference a more expensive curler makes!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but always come back to Shu Uemera.</li>
            <li> So I compared it to my Shu when I got home, and there are several other differences in size, shape &amp; feel.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews, they mention that the Shu name should be imprinted on both the curler, and the back of the rubber pads.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other curlers but always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> recommend this for all Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Vietnemese and other Asian eye lids</li>
            <li> I, like other reveiwers, was a bit hesitant to shell out big bucks on some Mercedes of curlers when my Toyota was doing quite well, thank you.  </li>
            <li> I tried again on the other eye and got the same result.    </li>
            <li> and I  notice the difference other curlers wouldn&#x27;t get all of my lashes especially the ones in the outer eye, this one does!</li>
            <li> cant compare it to any other simply because i have not tried any other,but i like it and the the silicone pad</li>
            <li> Based on another reviewer&#x27;s advice, I bought this eyelash curler on the Shu Eumura website for $19.00 which is the same price if not cheaper than some other sellers here.</li>
            <li> Tried several other premium brands.  </li>
            <li> eyelashes are thick and dark but they stick STRAIGHT forward from my face, parallel to the floor.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible quality compared to the real Shu Uemura eyelash curler that I currently own.</li>
            <li> This fake one doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes as well as the real one, actually, it barely curls them at all!!!</li>
            <li> It does not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for sending me a broken product I just adore that.</li>
            <li> switched from a cheapo Covergirl curler to this, so my experience is limited.</li>
            <li> It feels loose, it does not open nearly as wide as my other ones, and it is uneven on one side when closed completely.</li>
            <li> I use the curler five to six times a week, and the two pads last about an average of seven months for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased direct from the retailer in the past.</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries this product as it is very difficult to find in the store.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned there is a certain way to do it, I&#x27;ll play around with it again, but how hard could/should it be?!</li>
            <li> if the new curlers are all made like this, I will sadly have to find a new brand of eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> In the past my problem with curlers was that they were hard to get in deep and close enough to grasp the lashes at the base, and even when maneuvering as best as possible, at least three attempts per eye were needed to get all the lashes (not just the majority at the center) by doing center, inner, and then outer</li>
            <li> the fact that it loose and does not serve the purpose intended.</li>
            <li> The hinge is loose and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, it&#x27;s all down to personal preference, accessibility and price.</li>
            <li> I have to press down several times.)  </li>
            <li> The piece that goes against your eye is not as small as my other Shu Uemura which means you can actually pinch your eye area if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> With this one you have to really press down hard to get any type of curl, and then your lashes just have dent marks in them.</li>
            <li> I could pay a lot less at Walgreens and get the same thing cheaper.</li>
            <li> My lashes are naturally long and curly, but recently received a few compliments on them since I&#x27;ve purchased this.  </li>
            <li> When compared to my previous Shu Uemura eyelash curler, the craftsmanship was completely different.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like the product was new because it curled my eyelashes worse then my current eyelash curler</li>
            <li> Also, when I squeeze the shu curler too tight, it&#x27;s possible to pull out some eyelashes</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but went right back even quicker because it was fake!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t open or close properly, it was very stiff and not aligned.  </li>
            <li> Its getting a little hard to find so thanks to Amazon, I get it</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get my first pair to only be disappointed when I recieved it!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would somehow be &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; than other curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past (especially for the $$), but it was the same.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that one of the pads had a hole towards one end from the start or either it happened with only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Crushed when they stopped selling it in Sephora --</li>
            <li> Be me: you&#x27;ve owned a drugstore concealer for years and though curling your eye lashes was a waste of time because the curl was basically nonexistent and didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> However, I always need to decide these things for myself, so I shelled out a few extra dollars for this curler, and YOWZA!</li>
            <li> The metal is cheaper and the width of the curler is not as wide.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never really curled until I bought the Shu Uemura curler.  </li>
            <li> This item was not a real Shu Uemura product.</li>
            <li> Product does just what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one from Sephora a few years ago and wanted a second one.  </li>
            <li> NOT REAL SHU UEMURA</li>
            <li> It tries but it still can look bent.  </li>
            <li> This is not a real Shu Uemura.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no perceptible difference at all in the curl, but the Shu Uemura&#x27;s design for the pad eliminates the lashes getting pinched and caught.  </li>
            <li> Bonus, it&#x27;s also harder to hurt yourself with these...</li>
            <li> The box arrived completely crushed when shipped that</li>
            <li> However, this one is NOT REAL.</li>
            <li> The box looked as though it had been crushed which I thought could be because of the delivery man/methods but</li>
            <li> Directions for use were on the inner box, along with a few tips.  </li>
            <li> So needless to say, they&#x27;re worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> so you can get it closed to your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few seconds to use and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and would not use any other eyelash curler!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many inexpensive curlers hoping to get half of the volume and curl, only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because the shu uemera imprint can be VERY hard to see, and it was for me until the seller told me very explicitly how to find it -</li>
            <li> I have super stubborn Asian lashes that are impossible to keep curled.</li>
            <li> Years ago I learned that this Shu Umera eyelash curler was like no other and now they are hard to find in the US.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for other sellers but</li>
            <li> I dont use any other eyelash curler but this one.</li>
            <li> Everytime I have purchased this from other vendors it has come with a replacement pad.</li>
            <li> Keeps the lashes curled longer than any other product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT....as expected!</li>
            <li> like the other reviewers had said, the refills did not have the brand imprinted on them.</li>
            <li> This seller is extremely helpful and patient, and she also gave me alot of other helpful tips re:</li>
            <li> I have purchased other ones and given as gifts.</li>
            <li> Other curlers give lashes a bend.</li>
            <li> Will never use any other than this again.</li>
            <li> Throwing the dozen other curlers away.</li>
            <li> But this curler doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid like the other one did.</li>
            <li> Bought two will return the other one.</li>
            <li> This is not a real Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler!</li>
            <li> Two weeks later when it arrived I was so anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it tighter and longer than usual, and shortly my lashes look like I didn&#x27;t use the product at all.</li>
            <li> the small inner box was packed in another heavier cardboard box with newspaper for padding.  </li>
            <li> The other eye went as well.  </li>
            <li> Still on the fence if it&#x27;s any different than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> No need to use any other one.</li>
            <li> The other one had some tension in the mechanism; this one has none; it does not curl.</li>
            <li> The Font and shape looked different than usual.</li>
            <li> but really, I never knew my eyelashes could curl this well!  </li>
            <li> I wore my other Shu Uemura curler out</li>
            <li> It has sharp edges and doesn&#x27;t squeeze evenly on both sides.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Shu Uemura eyelash curler for years and won&#x27;t use any other curlers.</li>
            <li> Just feels a little loose and lighter than ones</li>
            <li> the finger grip holes are really small and it doesn&#x27;t open real wide.</li>
            <li> this eyelash curler is nothing like the orignal one I purchaced on QVC.It&#x27;s very loose and doesnt have that tight feeling the other one had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad, I should have read the reviews before I got excited and purchased this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time to buy a whole new curler :(</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl lashes and this is the only curler that I have found that works for me.</li>
            <li> Very upset to have ordered 4 and opened the box to fake flimsy eye lash curlers.</li>
            <li> Had to wait for my Shu order online to come in, so in the meantime, I bought another one from Sephora which was pretty expensive, but what a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I didnt get the real thing and now this piece of junk is sitting in its fake box in my closet.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $ in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately - my only negative is that there are no refills - once you&#x27;ve used the 2 that are in the package</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is that there are NO REFILLS for the rubber pieces.  </li>
            <li> I finally got it late...</li>
            <li> When I try to get it over my eyelashes, they either get mushed against the inside of the curler or shoved down into my eyeball.   </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> I have never seen any other curler do that!</li>
            <li> Do not spend money on any other lash curler!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> I will never use any other curler!</li>
            <li> Will never use any other!</li>
            <li> I never knew there were other options out there!  </li>
            <li> Difficult to position the curler high enough that it doesn&#x27;t make a crimp instead of a curl.&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely hard to get it around my corner</li>
            <li> MUCH LESS $17 PLUS S.H. NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money buying any other eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> One was purchased at the Shu Uemura shop in SF when it was still here years ago, and the other two from a department store in Tokyo, Japan when I was there a few years ago.</li>
            <li> And I KNOW it was fake because I took the little rubber pad out to inspect it and it was hard, had a different texture, and mainly, did NOT have \\&quot;Shu</li>
            <li> We will see if this one holds up as well as my previous ones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly cheaper</li>
            <li> This morning, after less than two months of use, the thing broke into pieces.    </li>
            <li> In the 35 (!) years that I have been using an eyelash curler, I have never had such a lousy one.</li>
            <li> I was sorry I bought this product, as it didn&#x27;t work ANY BETTER than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, less expensive eyelash curlers you can find in stores like CVS, etc.</li>
            <li> There are those that have thin and sparse lashes and there are those who have thick lashes that are stick straight.</li>
            <li> I could get the curler right in close to the base of my lashes, and I didn&#x27;t need to make multiple attempts to get it lined up - before squeezing down, I could see ALL my lashes sticking through the curler.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend both this eyelash curler and this seller, and you cannot go wrong with a shu uemera</li>
            <li> You do not need to press long and hard on the curler in order to achieve the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Not a true shu urmura...</li>
            <li> This is NOT a true Shu Uemura eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the box it comes in was damaged once I received it due to poor packaging on behalf of the sender.</li>
            <li> The part that holds the curler to the handle is not as tight and catches skin around the eye when being used.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as tight feeling when squeezed.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to tight and hurts to use.</li>
            <li> Sadly you have to buy a new curler every time the insert wears out.</li>
            <li> But seriously, you won&#x27;t get any of those weird right angles you can get (and then can&#x27;t get rid of) with your run of the mill gas station curler.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this curler, I assumed they were all the same, but I was delightfully surprised.  </li>
            <li> The reason it&#x27;s half the price is because it is not a genuine Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for an eyelash curler</li>
            <li> I follow the directions about holding it for 10 seconds and moving it out a little and doing it again.  </li>
            <li> I had not realized how much my drooping lashes had been cutting into my field of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In order to save some a few bucks I bought one here.</li>
            <li> The price should be a dead giveaway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy eyelash curler consumer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not something you buy everyday</li>
            <li> Never has broken or given me any problems after 2+ years and numerous uses.</li>
            <li> But I thought there may be a few still around thru amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The shape does not fit my eyes.  </li>
            <li> That said, crying will just make your eyelashes flop, so don&#x27;t do it, they don&#x27;t sell the Shu Uemura in the US anymore</li>
            <li> what a waste of money...</li>
            <li> The box was damaged, the refill was missing, and the box was wrapped with some plastic paper.  </li>
            <li> It is not as heavy for one thing.</li>
            <li> ( it sounded like a few people had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a terrifying-looking, approximately eye-sized metal appliance that you jam as close as possible to your eyeball,</li>
            <li> Purchased one a few years back and then began using a different brand which was horribly disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it pinched my outer lashes &amp; now they have all broken off.  </li>
            <li> I pinched my eyelid a few times.</li>
            <li> Since sephora stopped selling these, I&#x27;ve tried a few others..</li>
            <li> am i missing something?</li>
            <li> This  does not curl well at all, it takes a lot of effort and duration which is harsh on the lashes and the surrounding eye area.  </li>
            <li> These transform my lashes to where I occasionally get asked if they&#x27;re false- a compliment in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Feels harsh and stiff.  </li>
            <li> Works in less that 2 seconds!</li>
            <li> This curler is too stiff and so are the refills.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve noticed it how awkward this particular curler is to use yet</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I got the curler, it is not the same as the ones I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li> There is no pinching and it&#x27;s hard to slip when you press down.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it a fake, but it was worse than a generic Wal-Mart curler.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this eyelash curler for years and was excited to find some online but was extremely angry when the fake one arrived I can tell its fake because the size is different and the imprinted name is not fully imprinted on it .Besides</li>
            <li> Not very thrilled with this order.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that it does nothing more then</li>
            <li> I feel bad if someone who has never used the real product orders it and thinks that&#x27;s how the Shu Uemura curler is...</li>
            <li> so I usually order mine from the company.</li>
            <li> The curlers that are currently listed are FAKE.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> In addition, I was not able to locate the refund option to return it.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve used this eyelash curler, I cannot use any of my past ones.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s no better than the $3 curler from Target.  </li>
            <li> As an Asian girl, it was difficult for me to find an eyelash curler that worked on my flatter eyes.</li>
            <li> But after several months, I can officially say - purchase fail.</li>
            <li> A definite fake.</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline, Revlon and Tweezerman curlers in the past and, while they add a curve to my lashes, it takes longer than it should</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes look the same even when I return home otherwise haggard and exhausted!</li>
            <li> I did order one from a seller on Amazon and it was a total fake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these curlers for the past 5+ years</li>
            <li> I have used Shu Uemura eyelash curlers for the past 8 years...</li>
            <li> they are surely going to be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> USUALLY THEY GO FOR $20.00 -FROM</li>
            <li> but this second one looked and worked like a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura&#x27;s eyelash curler for years and the minute I grabbed the box I instantly knew it was fake.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> curl well not sure yet</li>
            <li> I have had a Shu uemura curler in the past, and this one didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if the quality has just changed in the past 10 years or what,</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler was a bit expensive but it actually works!</li>
            <li> Multiple reviews claim it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> In fact I have been so disappointed in eyelash curlers that I had stopped curling them (and using mascara) for years and years due to some of my lashes on the outer side being curled naturally downward.</li>
            <li> It was very tight and hard to press.</li>
            <li> (Not particularly pleasant at any time; much less at 0600 in the morning.)   </li>
            <li> Does not not even curl tight like it should feels broken</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try they just stick out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find</li>
            <li> Someone is misrepresenting this hard to get item, substituting with  an inferior product and passing it off as legitimate.  </li>
            <li> I did stray a couple of times because this curler is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> - the rubber pad was extra stiff making it impossible to curl my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Its very difficult to find now in samller cities, like mine,  since major retailers are not carrying it .  </li>
            <li> this is my one complaint about the company, and why it I knocked off a star.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just got regular old boring Caucasian almond-shaped eyes, which could explain why the Shu is just so-so for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s just rude).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a shoddy damaged box and was OPENED.</li>
            <li> And when I finally took the curler out, it was dirty like it was already used and someone else returned it before me, and they just gave it to me!&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> It works on all different cultures of lashes, and when my lashes are going all crazy - sometimes it happens....</li>
            <li> Came dirty and the package was open.</li>
            <li> Becuase it was removed from Sephora I was forced to look for it somewhere else to buy it.</li>
            <li> And I mean hard.  </li>
            <li> Although the item I received was wrapped and in a new box, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have the tiniest lashes ever and all the lash curlers I&#x27;ve owned in the past would pinch, but not the Shu Uemura!</li>
            <li> No better or worse than the Maybelline one that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> A little expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> When I received this product in the mail I was shocked to find the box written entirely in chinese!  </li>
            <li> and I have to re-curl after applying mascara (which is probably not good for the lashes).  </li>
            <li> But much to my disappointment, the curler was extremely flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I do not live in the USA and brought my purchases from amazon through the service of a currier, which makes me impossible to resend it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It is not a real Shu Uemura product and to falsely sell it as one should be illegal!</li>
            <li> never own another brand!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using drugstore eyelash curlers only to be disappointed time and time again with their performance.  </li>
            <li> The silicone was very hard.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!  </li>
            <li> It was such a bad product that we thought it could be a fake.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a poor business practice.</li>
            <li> and I ended up spending my day with mascara covered lash either pointing at my eye or just annoying me by interrupting my vision.&lt;br /&gt;No such problems with Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> The curler edge cut a thin slit in the rubber pad immediately, in which my eyelashes got stuck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shu uemura eyelash curlers for years - when it came time to replace my tired one, I ordered from amazon instead of making the trip to the department store.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this eyelash curler and am returning it.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> I noticed some negative reviews about this being fake after I had already ordered it.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t look broken and it still works.</li>
            <li> This purchase was worthless and I wish that I had asked for my money back.  </li>
            <li> False.  </li>
            <li> I use this with Max Factor False Lash Effect Mascara, also recommended by Lisa Eldridge, and I now have eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It is virtually impossible to mess up your lashes using this thing.</li>
            <li> I spent the money and will use it again, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister for Christmas but was disappointed to find out it was not a real Shu Uemura!</li>
            <li> this is no good!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear this one was FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake, and a poor one at that.</li>
            <li> In addition to it being flimsy, the one I received was a fake AND broken eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Lame product, poorly built and doesn&#x27;t curl lashes well.  </li>
            <li> and I am a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to find that I wasted my money on this and the seller won&#x27;t respond to me.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake knock-off.  </li>
            <li> This product was a FAKE Shu Uemura Curler.  </li>
            <li> Its sad that Sephora discontinued it</li>
            <li> I was so sad to find out that Shu Uemura pulled all of their products out of the U.S.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I am definitely not impressed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s laughable.</li>
            <li> they are fake.  </li>
            <li> and it was fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m questionable about the item I received.</li>
            <li> I can send pictures to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to have bought it from that seller.</li>
            <li> I even thought for a minute that the curler could be a fake.</li>
            <li> I believe it was a fake.  </li>
            <li> This product is fake.</li>
            <li> It appears to be fake, it does not work and does not have the Shu Uemura stamp, Shu Uemura does not warraty the company as its distributor.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mediocre eyelash curler</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for years, and can tell a fake when I see it.</li>
            <li> So sad ...</li>
            <li> The curve doesn&#x27;t conform to my eye so it is difficult to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a fake.  </li>
            <li> This product was a fake.</li>
            <li> I thought my daughter had on fake eye lashes.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Sephora no longer carries it</li>
            <li> fake or someone opened it before</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sad</li>
            <li> THIS HELPS TO AVOID PEOPLE GETTING A FAKE ONE.</li>
            <li> People are always asking me if I have fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda expensive, but I told myself it was an investment</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong because my lashes aren&#x27;t curled.</li>
            <li> Quite sad.</li>
            <li> Shu Uemura was over exaggerated</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sell fake stuff...</li>
            <li> FAKE.</li>
            <li> fake product, doesn&#x27;t even curl your lashes and it pinches your skin.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li> This is a fake and it&#x27;s being returned.</li>
            <li> This was a fake.</li>
            <li> Looks fake.</li>
            <li> Feels fake.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> The curler itself was an insane $4 and change, while the shipping brought the total up to $21.  </li>
            <li> They both have the shu uemura stamp on the rubbery pads - it is faint</li>
            <li> This is clearly fake.  </li>
            <li> Fake.  </li>
            <li> Be wary if you buy this online.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt fake, and I&#x27;m SO disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is without any shadow of a doubt a fake Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> Mine was a fake as well.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I was sad when Sephora stopped selling it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wanted someone else to see and use it before I did a review.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad they are not making it anymore</li>
            <li> definitely fake, but does the job.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s either fake or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst, but for me, it was a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, something felt off, the strange printing on the box to the terrible quality of the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> The silicone base where you do the pressure curl is hard.  </li>
            <li> This one is completely fake and a bad knock off.</li>
            <li> I had it in my hand, not to mention it made my eyelashes look all crazy.  </li>
            <li> its just awkward.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything dangerous?</li>
            <li> How disappointing......</li>
            <li> I hear it helps to heat it up under a hairdryer before use; I don&#x27;t because I&#x27;m afraid of burning myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting rid of this product and rather unhappy</li>
            <li> the item I received from &amp;#34;Discountteam&amp;#34; was a fake!  </li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> BOTH PRODUCTS AND MY CURLER IS A FAKE :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the item I received appears to be a &#x27;knock-off&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I mistook this one for one I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that is the bomb diggety!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a FAKE!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a FAKE folks!</li>
            <li> this is now a very expensive item.</li>
            <li> Very sad for my daugher.</li>
            <li> This one SUCKS horribly and I would never purchase again..</li>
            <li> A very expensive tool to have my eye lashes breaking.</li>
            <li> Very sorry I cannot find it in retail stores any longer in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> almost impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Definitively it is a copy, a bad one: the rubber pads does not even have an inscription  (shu uemura)  </li>
            <li> What it does do well is remove lashes, yes it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered this despite the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its so bad I wont even use it as my travel eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I even found it painful to use.</li>
            <li> I purchase hundreds of items every year from Amazon and this makes me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this! :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I purchased this.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this thing without reading any reviews - STUPID.</li>
            <li> However, I hate to say it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best eyelash curlers you will ever buy.  I have bought them for friends after I got mine.  I wish you could buy the rubber replacements pieces but whe it wears out, you have to buy complete set.</li>
            <li> The best eye lashes ever. I have 3 of them. Never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Arrived bent in two and unusable.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for a friend and she said it was exactly what she wanted! It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me but the curler is literally a curler inside a box (no inside packaging). It wasn&#x27;t a problem for me I just thought it looked a little cheap when you open it. (Usually nice things have a bunch of unnecessary packaging on the inside in my experience)</li>
            <li> After using several curlers that quick working after a couple of months, I purchased this based on reviews. It works much better and longer--very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler! Great for asian eyes! It shipped so quickly and was able to use it as soon as possible~!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler! I have very straight eyelashes and this curler works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eyelash curler. Shu Uemura is well-known for this product. Prime&#x27;s shipping is really fast!</li>
            <li> I have used this eyelash curler for over 10 years.  Anyone is doesn&#x27;t like it hasn&#x27;t replaced theirs, which should be replaced every 6 months to ensure the best curl.</li>
            <li> The best! Used to use Revlon but they no longer make a good one. This works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It is better than its competitors and is reasonably priced.  This product was made in Japan and not a knockoff as some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Just as great as everyone says it is. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received mine which I purchased from Rock Oriental here on Amazon and it looks legit to me.  Admittedly, I&#x27;ve never owned one so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but mine doesn&#x27;t have any of the red flags this website describes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.myeyeshadowconsultant.com/2011/06/24/how-to-spot-a-fake-shu-uemura-eyelash-curler/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good with the curler.  I haven&#x27;t tested it out a whole lot yet but I&#x27;ll be back to update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Love that it has rubber refills and fits well in my hand and on my eyelashes.  It&#x27;s gentle yet strong.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelash curler for life.</li>
            <li> This is a fake knock-off.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Awful!!! Was so excited to get my first pair to only be disappointed when I recieved it!!!! FAKE FAKE FAKE!!! Well learn to read reviews before purchasing anything again!!! Printed label to drop in mail tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the Shu Eumura eye lash curler is the BEST eyelash curler on the market! They aren&#x27;t available in the US so I usually order mine from the company. In order to save some a few bucks I bought one here. BIG MISTAKE!!! I should have read the reviews first but I didn&#x27;t think I needed to... I already love the product, but that&#x27;s not what I got! I got a eyelash curler that is boxed and labeled as &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t feel or work like my old curler. Upon closer inspection, the logo was different on the fake and the silicone refill was cheaply made and was not stamped &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t vouch for other sellers but the item I received from &amp;#34;Discountteam&amp;#34; was a fake!  It is not a real Shu Uemura product and to falsely sell it as one should be illegal!</li>
            <li> You can purchase this eyelash curler from the Shu Uemura web site for 19.99 and free shipping.  If the web site does not offer free shipping browse Shu Uemura coupons on the web.  The coupon sites offer a code number for free shipping.  Do not overpay.     I have hard to curl eyelashes.  No matter how hard I try they just stick out.  I found only one eyelash curler that works.  It came as a free gift with a Lancôme purchase. I want to replace it but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I read an add for the Shu Uemura curler in a beauty magazine article.   I purchased it with high hopes of replacing my old eyelash curler.  Maybe it would even work better.   I was very disappointed that it does nothing more then my cheap Revlon model (that is nothing).  And yes, I know how to curl eyelashes.  I have been struggling for the last 20 years.   The only good thing is I purchased it from Shu Uemura and only spent $19.99.  I send the product back two days ago to see if I can get a refund.  Even $19.99 is to much for this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> BEWARE... This product was a FAKE Shu Uemura Curler.  I&#x27;ve used a genuine one before so I know how the product should have been.  Not only was it a fake, but it was worse than a generic Wal-Mart curler.  I am so upset. If I could, I would give this zero stars.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an authentic Shu Uemura product, it is a fake knock off! BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> I was introduced to shu uemura eyelash curler two years ago and fell in love with it.It works so good because its strong and curls fast.I have medium length eyelashes so this curler definitely makes them look longer.I dont use any other eyelash curler but this one.This eyelash curler last up to six months plus another six months when you switch cushion pad on the curler.Its sad that Sephora discontinued it but im glad amazon sells it!I would recommend it to anyone.MOST DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> I was so sad to find out that Shu Uemura pulled all of their products out of the U.S. Their eyelash curlers are by far the best ones made. When I purchased this product I was so excited that I found it for such a good price. When I received it I realized why. It was a complete knock off of the actual eyelash curler. It was flimsy and had a lot of differences from my current (authentic) eyelash curler. If you purchase one, both pads (the one in the eyelash curler and the replacement) should say Shu Uemura on the bottom. I learned that you get what you pay for and now will only order this product from Shu Uemura&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this eyelash curler because I heard it worked really good. Sadly, this doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. It&#x27;s just as good as an ordinary eyelash curler, except the price. I am definitely not impressed. Please, don&#x27;t even bother!</li>
            <li> When I received this product in the mail I was shocked to find the box written entirely in chinese!  I compared the curler to the one at the store and it looks similar but works differently: The part that holds the curler to the handle is not as tight and catches skin around the eye when being used.  When it curls eyelashed are bent straight up instead of curled.  Overall, it&#x27;s the same as most drugstore one (that cost $18 less), but if you&#x27;re looking to buy an actual Shu Umera, this isnt it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelash curler for many years.  Being I can&#x27;t find them in any stores any longer I have been buying them on line direct from Shu Uemura.  I decided to try Amazon and I am a little disappointed.  The product is not the same as I have been buying direct.  It feels much cheaper and lighter than the one I have.  I am wondering if this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> Had this for six months or more. I love it! Much like the old fashioned ones in the 70&#x27;s. You know, when quality mattered. A good buy!</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff and is nothing like the real Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler.  I was so disappointed to find that I wasted my money on this and the seller won&#x27;t respond to me.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this seller who sells knockoffs.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Everytime I have purchased this from other vendors it has come with a replacement pad. This item is on the expensive side (it is a very good product) and you can&#x27;t purchase the replacement pads separatly. Therefore once the pad is used up you have to buy another curler. Having the one extra pad that comes with it helps spread out the cost of the curler. Since this vendor does not include and extra pad this is now a very expensive item. The vendor was great with everything else except this. I will not buy this product from them again.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler out there! Crushed when they stopped selling it in Sephora -- thanks Amazon for still supplying it. Keeps the lashes curled longer than any other product.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler by far!!</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed when Shu Uemura decided to just sell internatinally . I have been buying this eyelash curler for years and was excited to find some online but was extremely angry when the fake one arrived I can tell its fake because the size is different and the imprinted name is not fully imprinted on it .Besides the fact that it loose and does not serve the purpose intended. I am still on a Quest for the real thing.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says - a good product - it does work like the curler is supposed too....</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler works really well.  I like the design of the cushion part that actually touches the lashes.  It is more rounded, rather than the traditional kind of squared of edges of that part.  Comfortable and effective.</li>
            <li> The curlers that are currently listed are FAKE. The price should be a dead giveaway. I just received this in the mail and it&#x27;s laughable. Doesnt even resemble the real shu uemura. Save your money and wait for the real ones (which are at least $19 EVERYWHERE) to come back in stock.</li>
            <li> Only curler I would ever use!</li>
            <li> Have used Shu Uemura Eyelash curler for many years.  They curl beautifully and outlast any other curler.  They are pricey but I keep coming back.  I do and have tried other curlers, but they are just not the same.  The only draw back the curlers have to come from Japan, so, you either have to wait 38 to 42 days to receive the item or pay about $24.00 for express mail.  The curler always arrives on or before due date, is packaged well, and there is always an additional free surprise, nothing big, but just a sweet surprise.</li>
            <li> BEST EYELASH CURLER ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li> It really curls your eye lashes best best eye lash curler I&#x27;ve used .</li>
            <li> I heard all the reviews and had some friend referrals for the Shu Uemera eyelash curler.  So I thought $20 was a good investment for my blinking beauties.  I have had my curler now for about 4 years and it is still holding up well. Good quality product.  I like the way it curls my lashes.  I think the key is the cushy pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of pads..... this is my one complaint about the company, and why it I knocked off a star.  I cannot find the eyelash curler refill pads anywhere for the life of me.  I have looked on Amazon, on-line, Sephora, Nordstroms, Macy&#x27;s, etc.  No luck.  I don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new curler since it is such a waste.  Our landfills and full enough and my consumer habits need curbing here and there. Anybody have any ideas?</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyelash curler I have found. I had used this for years, then I couldn&#x27;t find them. I tried so many others, no comparison to Shu Uemura. Thank you Amazon for carrying them, always a happy customer when I purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After seeing great reviews in my local paper, I was expecting a wonderful curler.  I found it to be basically the same as any other curler I have ever used, only more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler that has kept the curl in my lashes.  I used to travel 45 minutes to the store to purchase but found it on amazon and was so happy! I would definately recommend this eyelash curler above all others!</li>
            <li> they are fake.  I&#x27;m a heavy eyelash curler consumer.  these are totally counterfeit.</li>
            <li> this eyelash curler is nothing like the orignal one I purchaced on QVC.It&#x27;s very loose and doesnt have that tight feeling the other one had. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Shu Uemura&#x27;s eyelash curlers and decided to purchase it from Amazon since Sephora doesn&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore. My only complaint was that one of the pads had a hole towards one end from the start or either it happened with only a couple of uses. I had to use the replacement pad that came with it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the Shu curler after reading all the rave reviews. I bought mine directly from the Shu website, so I know it&#x27;s not a fake like some of the people received from this vendor. Nonetheless, I think my eye shape (almond) isn&#x27;t suited to the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pull out lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Durable (mine&#x27;s a few years old and still opens/shuts well...I don&#x27;t use it daily though)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- To get the curler to encompass my lashes, I have to practically close my eye, which obviously makes it more difficult to see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to position the curler high enough that it doesn&#x27;t make a crimp instead of a curl.&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely hard to get it around my corner lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since noticed a lot of the best reviews are from people who are Asian. I&#x27;ve just got regular old boring Caucasian almond-shaped eyes, which could explain why the Shu is just so-so for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, try before you buy if at all possible. If not, you might want to consider buying this curler from a place you can easily return it to without paying shipping. It&#x27;s not the worst, but for me, it was a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Bought this eyelash curler as a present and she said its one of the best curlers out there. No problems whatsoever and worth the money</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT....as expected!</li>
            <li> Fake! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend. Heard very good reviews about this eyelash curler, my friend loves it! Eventually going to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Not something you buy everyday so I wanted to make sure I made the right choice.  It curls as it says and although the reviews left me expecting magic, I guess only time will tell if this little device stands the test of time.</li>
            <li> Fake! Shame on me for not reading the reviews! What a waste of time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad, I should have read the reviews before I got excited and purchased this product. It&#x27;s a fake, and a poor one at that. I will be returning it tomorrow!</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I prefer this brand because it doesn&#x27;t break your eyelashes, it fits against the eye perfectly, has the correct angulation, and it works well with or without the use of heat (blowdrying it for a better curl).  Never has broken or given me any problems after 2+ years and numerous uses.</li>
            <li> Be me: you&#x27;ve owned a drugstore concealer for years and though curling your eye lashes was a waste of time because the curl was basically nonexistent and didn&#x27;t last. Then one day, you come across an article that lists top makeup tools that are worth the splurge. You read that this curler is the best curler out there. So you decide to check out your favorite online shopping website to see how much this &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; will set you back. To your surprise, the cost is 12 bucks and has free Prime shipping. Boom! Into the shopping cart it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, a little box arrives with your new toy: your brand new curler. You open the box, take it out of its packaging, grab a compact mirror you had hanging around you, and curl your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAM! It happens: you curl your lashes and there&#x27;s an actual curl! It&#x27;s not like your eye lashes have been pushed up - no, there is an actual curl and your eyes like so open and awake. This curler got right up to the base of your eyelashes and created the most perfect curl without pinching your precious eyelid. You think to yourself &amp;#34;This is amazing, but the curl will fall as soon as I put some mascara on.&amp;#34; You grab some mascara and ... what? ... you still have a curl? And it lasted a couple of hours? This can&#x27;t be real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, but it is. This is the true story of how my first day went with this amazing curler. I am so happy with it that I actually curl my lashes every day now. The curl doesn&#x27;t last the entire workday (10 hours - work in a school) but it lasts way longer than it ever has before. My advice: try this! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I was just fine using my eyelash curler from MAC. Sure there were the occasional pinches and pulls. I ran out of fillers for it so I figured I try Shu Uemura curler to see what the hype was about. No pinches, no pulls, no creases.. This thing is great! Just get it. It&#x27;s a welcome charge to your old curler.</li>
            <li> The Shu Uemura Eyelash curler works wonders on eyelashes. Mine are naturally straight, and all it takes are a couple of 15-second presses to keep them curled all day (with the help of a coat or two of mascara). I use the curler five to six times a week, and the two pads last about an average of seven months for me. It&#x27;s unfortunate that you have to buy a whole new curler instead of just the refill pads, but I suppose you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a word of caution to anyone who purchases from websites such as Amazon or Ebay: beware of imitations! A real Shu Uemura eyelash curler should open and close smoothly and take little effort for you to work it. It should come with two pads, one already in the curler and one wrapped separately. Both pads should be soft, smooth, somewhat pliable to the touch and have \\&quot;shu uemura\\&quot; stamped on the underside. Also check the packaging: the print should not be crooked on any of the flaps or sides. Besides the Shu Uemura site, Sephora and Ulta are the only vendors that I know of that always sell the genuine product.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware....I know for a fact that Shu uemura is not manufacturing this product anymore.  But I thought there may be a few still around thru amazon.com.  False.  I measured it with my true Shu uemura eyelash curler and this product is smaller all the way around.</li>
            <li> I decided to refer to Amazon to order this eyelash curler since I was informed that Shu Uemura eyelash curlers would not be sold in the US anymore. When I received this curler, it came in a weathered box and the curler was, as another reviewer referred to it, \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot;. In addition to it being flimsy, the one I received was a fake AND broken eyelash curler. I know this was a fake because I compared it against my genuine Shu Uemura that I was still using. I will take the $13 loss but I&#x27;m posting this review so future customers don&#x27;t run into this. This is truly a poor business practice.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelash curler ever</li>
            <li> MY SISTER BOUGH THE REAL SHU UEMURA ON SAPHORA.COM FOR $20, I COULD NOT BELIVE SOMEONE WOULD BUY A $20 EYE CURLER. BUT I TRIED IT ON AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT,  ME BEING A BARGAIN HUNTER FOUND IT HERE FOR MUCH LESS $17 PLUS S.H. NOT WORTH IT. LONG STORY SHORT, COMPARED BOTH PRODUCTS AND MY CURLER IS A FAKE :(</li>
            <li> I have used eyelash curlers for many years and was looking for a really good one. I found the shape awkward to use since it is more straight and not perfectly curved to fit the eye. It was very tight and hard to press. I even found it painful to use. Would never purchase again or recommend to anyone and it was fairly expensive. Maybelline is better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! However, I hate to say it but I&#x27;m questionable about the item I received. I have been using a Shu Uemura eyelash curler for the last 5 years and know it very well. Although the item I received was wrapped and in a new box, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the product itself. It feels loose, it does not open nearly as wide as my other ones, and it is uneven on one side when closed completely. Luckily I kept my old one and just used the new rubber.</li>
            <li> Love this, just bought it for my daughter (her first). She is so happy.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler I will buy and I&#x27;ve tried many!  My sister never used a eyelash curler, but she has gorgeous lashes and didn&#x27;t really feel she needed one.  Anyways, got her one also and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a total knock off of the real brand. When I got the eyelash curler it was flimsy like it has been bent and like the other reviewers had said, the refills did not have the brand imprinted on them. In addition, I was not able to locate the refund option to return it. So, I won&#x27;t be ordering from GOOD STUFF FOR EVEN LESS.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler. It is posted as the real thing but it isn&#x27;t. Buyers beware it is a cheap imitation and does not perform anywhere near as well as the Authentic Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler.</li>
            <li> Was never very good at curling my eyelashes, but this wonderful product has assisted me in confidence and proper use of an eyelash curler.  Again, thank you.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler out there.</li>
            <li> it saves me so much money on mascara! i especially like it on days where i cant wear makeup- gym, swimming- but i still want to look decent. thank you!</li>
            <li> This curler was received as ordered and I love it!  It was recommended to me and it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is my second Shu Uemura Eyelasher Curler. The best, hands down!</li>
            <li> When my 3 twenty-something daughters first told me how great shu uemura eyelash curlers are, I was skeptical.  However, I bought one and was immediately sold on it.  I am able to get a natural looking curl that lasts all day.  WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is light years above any other brand curler!!  it curls naturally and does not crimp your lashes!!  I am buying another to go in my bag for traveling so I don&#x27;t forget it!!</li>
            <li> Yes, a total OUTRAGE! Amazon is selling this item for $29.95 but the other retail outlets, including the manufacturer is selling this very same product for $17.00. Amazon, you should be ASHAMED. I purchase hundreds of items every year from Amazon and this makes me sick to my stomach. Change your ways Amazon or you&#x27;ll greedily find yourself out of business!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the item I received appears to be a &#x27;knock-off&#x27;!  There is nothing similar about it to the one I own.  Cheaper metal frame, the name imprinted on the back of the curved part is different, smaller font,  and most of all it does not perform at all like the original.  Not only does it not curl the lashes, it pulls.  I cannot use this! :(  I would like to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been expecting this for long~ I am Asian and some eyelash curler does not fit my eyes, but this one, my dream SHU, fits very well. Strongly suggest Asian girls to but it, or other girls whose eyelash shape is not very deep and round, this one fits you perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried and tried every eyelash curler available on the market. This is one is still the best. My lashes aren&#x27;t getting older; they are getting better because of this great beauty tool. Easy and safe to use. It gives perfect curl every time.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for years but this one is FAKE for sure. Never buy this product. I am gonna ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.  Does not pinch your eyelids and provides a perfect curl in a short time frame.  Love it!  Don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling them in stores in the U.S.!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant spending more that $10 on an eyelash curler because I am so particular. I think this is my new favorite one! Will definatly buy again</li>
            <li> My eyelashes curl better with this than other eyelash curlers, but lasting curl I dont think so and there is really nothing special about this product other than it being pricier. I would definite recommend the tweezerman one.</li>
            <li> There are two eyelash curlers that are making the waves - Shu Uemura and Shiseido. I got them both and I have to admit I like Shu Uemura more. Shiseido one still pinched my left eyelid but Shu Uemura does not. Plus, just to test it out I curled my lashes with out adding any mascara and I have to say my lashes are still curled 5 hours later and counting! I have never seen any other curler do that! I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible. In fact I have been so disappointed in eyelash curlers that I had stopped curling them (and using mascara) for years and years due to some of my lashes on the outer side being curled naturally downward. And curler effect with any other curlers lasted only about 20 min and I ended up spending my day with mascara covered lash either pointing at my eye or just annoying me by interrupting my vision.&lt;br /&gt;No such problems with Shu Uemura. Really impressive! Thank heaven I received the authentic product!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Shu Uemura. It doesn&#x27;t do the job. I went back to Chanel. I wonder if its being a genuine product?</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times in the past--it is a staple.  This one did not seem like the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  It did not work well,  so I used the extra pad and still did not get a good result,  so the next one I ordered directly from Shu Uemura,  and it is fine.  I love Amazon as I often save a lot of money--I did not in this case.</li>
            <li> This works okay not the best</li>
            <li> I did not understand what all the fuss was about regarding the shu uemura eyelash curler, as I thought the cheaper curler I bought at Target was pretty good. However, I always need to decide these things for myself, so I shelled out a few extra dollars for this curler, and YOWZA! What a difference a more expensive curler makes! The actual eyelash curler is the exact same shape as the one I got at Target, but the pads are much rounder, and apparently that&#x27;s the secret to getting amazingly curly lashes. I love this curler and will never go back to the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler i have ever owned. The one thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s nothing too flamboyant, it&#x27;s simple and practical. Also, it gives you TOTAL control over your lashes. After I&#x27;ve used this eyelash curler, I cannot use any of my past ones. It just doesn&#x27;t feel as great or the same!</li>
            <li> I purchased three of these items for my daughters and myself.  All three were an inferior product, not keeping with the standards for this product.  It was such a bad product that we thought it could be a fake.  Comparing them with the real shu uemura eyelash curlers that we do have, they are cheaply made and clearly not the same product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyelash curler from the seller MINOYA, and it is a fantastic curler, as well as an authentic shu uemera product. I was skeptical at first because the shu uemera imprint can be VERY hard to see, and it was for me until the seller told me very explicitly how to find it - And sure enough, there it was! This seller is extremely helpful and patient, and she also gave me alot of other helpful tips re: this curler, etc. I highly recommend both this eyelash curler and this seller, and you cannot go wrong with a shu uemera product![[ASIN:B000VSG1PO shu uemura Eyelash Curler 1 ea]]</li>
            <li> What a fantastic curler! Very durable, easy to use, and the parts glide easily. The eye piece fits comfortably without catching my skin. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this curler and the rumors are true!</li>
            <li> I bought a shu uemura eyelash curler sold by: healthandpersonalcare and when I received it  I realized  that it is not like the others  shu uemura eyelash curler I still have. Definitively it is a copy, a bad one: the rubber pads does not even have an inscription  (shu uemura)  like the original ones, and doesnt even match sizes with the original ones, neider do they match the joints of the parts.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I do not live in the USA and brought my purchases from amazon through the service of a currier, which makes me impossible to resend it.&lt;br /&gt;And definitively it is not an original shu uemura, (although the seller told me the opposite by mail) I only use that eyelash curlers and I have and them by hand to compare them. I can send pictures to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to have bought it from that seller.</li>
            <li> My best friend was lamenting over Sephora&#x27;s inability to stock Shu Uemura eyelash curlers and I asked her why she couldn&#x27;t just try a different brand... She looked at me like I was nuts. After testing out the curler she insisted on ordering, I totally got her preference! This curler works better than any other curler I&#x27;ve ever tried- my lashes look amazing and they stay curled forever.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler most certainly was used, NOT NEW from Shu Uemura.  The packaging was not intact, the rubber replacement was in a large baggie, not the tiny sealed bag that comes with Shu Uemura products when bought direct.&lt;br /&gt;A new eyelash curler has a tightness which this did not have; it was more likely than not \\&quot;recycled\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Not a healthy thing for any product that is used around the eyes, not to mention misrepresentation.  It came from China, not the U.S. so there was no way to identify the company.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend buying this product from this company.</li>
            <li> This was authentic, received yesterday with free rubber replacement.  Best eyelash curler I have ever used.  You will notice a difference between a cheap curler and this one.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this eylash curler for many years. When I recently tried to buy a new curler, I was told that Shu Umera was no longer selling in the U.S. So, I looked on-line to see if I could find a place that still had some in stock. Unfortunately, when I got the curler, it is not the same as the ones I have previously purchased. This one does not seem to be the same quality at all and it is definitely NOT the same size. The metal is cheaper and the width of the curler is not as wide. It doesn&#x27;t cover the entire eye, therefore you can not curl your whole lash at the same time. Not sure what the deal is. I even thought for a minute that the curler could be a fake. I would not buy this item again. [[ASIN:B000VSG1PO shu uemura Eyelash Curler 1 ea]]</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is great!  It does not pinch your eye and curls eyelashes well.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!  This is poorly made, much smaller than the original, and the mechanism sticks.  I wish I had read a review like this prior to making the purchase.</li>
            <li> Product came just as described. Shu Uemera makes the best eyelash curler.  I have tried other brands but always come back to Shu Uemera.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have been using shu uemura culers for years.  I was excited to find one on line for my daughters stocking.  When she went to use it - it was so not the shu eumura curler that sephora&#x27;s use to sell.  It would not even curl one eyelash. I believe it was a fake.  Very sad for my daugher.</li>
            <li> This product is fake. Very upset to have ordered 4 and opened the box to fake flimsy eye lash curlers. DO NOT BUY. Not even worth one star. Already returned them. Shu uemura is a great brand and I knew immediately the product was a knock off. Pay the $20 and buy the authentic product on there actual website.</li>
            <li> This is not a Shu Uemera lash curler. I knew as soon as I took it out of the box. It rattles too much - the Shu doesn&#x27;t make noise when you move it. So I compared it to my Shu when I got home, and there are several other differences in size, shape &amp; feel. Also there are two included replacement pads. Shu Uemera only comes with one. It definitely doesn&#x27;t curl like the Shu. This was a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> For my eye shape, this is truly the best curler available, I&#x27;ve tried many other brands including Sephora&#x27;s line as well as Tweezerman, but my Shu always fit better and never pinched my lids.  I think it&#x27;s different for everyone, depending on the shape of your eyelids and lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this eye lash curler for years, buying it through Sephora.  But when they stopped supplying the brand, I looked to Amazon for a replacement.  On the first use, I knew it wasn&#x27;t a quality Shu Uemura curler.  The curler edge cut a thin slit in the rubber pad immediately, in which my eyelashes got stuck.  Like other reviews, they mention that the Shu name should be imprinted on both the curler, and the back of the rubber pads.  I tried the second pad, just to make sure I hadn&#x27;t had a faulty one, but it was the same.  The rubber is cheap, and can&#x27;t hold up to even the light pressure of the curling edge. I still had my old Shu hanging around, so I could compare both curlers.  This one definitely was more flimsy, and the pieces rattled, it didn&#x27;t even compare to the quality of my original.&lt;br /&gt;Save some time as hassle and just buy directly from the manufacturer.  With free shipping, the cost is only $1 more than on Amazon, and you will be sure to get a top quality product.</li>
            <li> Lame product, poorly built and doesn&#x27;t curl lashes well.  What it does do well is remove lashes, yes it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> perfect, just what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> I bought a curler from Tarte and I love that one.  This curler is too stiff and so are the refills.</li>
            <li> almost impossible to use. the curler doesn&#x27;t open up far enough to get your eyelashes in there. it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased this before and will do it again, definitely my favorite eyelash curler hands down!</li>
            <li> It appears to be fake, it does not work and does not have the Shu Uemura stamp, Shu Uemura does not warraty the company as its distributor.    [...]</li>
            <li> I have always heard that this was the number one eyelash curler. I finally bought it and it is certainly different from all others. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but it does curl your lashes so much better with little effort. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It does not live up to my expectations. Everybody is raving about this but I don&#x27;t see the big deal. It&#x27;s a mediocre eyelash curler and it&#x27;s totally a waste of money. I followed the instructions on \\&quot;walking it up the eyelashes,\\&quot; but I had to press hard and do it more than 5 times. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this.   The service for it to ship to my house was very good, though.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this eyelash curler for several years and this one just didn&#x27;t seem to do the job they used to.  It wasn&#x27;t as tight feeling when squeezed.  Felt like my old one just with a new rubber band.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Curled lashes stay curled all day</li>
            <li> I guess this deserves 5 stars because it works exactly as it should and doesn&#x27;t seem to have any drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use Shu Uemura eyelash curlers exclusively for years. They&#x27;re great, usually. This one stuck to itself. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye lash curler, worth taking the extra time to order online since it can&#x27;t be found in the states any longer!</li>
            <li> How many curlers does a women have to go thru in her life? A little pricey for an eyelash curler but it&#x27;s a GOOD one!!</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail of eyelash curlers.  Have used for years - nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler on the market!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Shu Uemura is one of the best brands for eyelash curlers out there.</li>
            <li> This curler is great--totally lives up to all the accolades that I&#x27;ve been rearing for years. It fits my eyes very well, and best of all, it DOESN&#x27;T PINCH! Also, it arrived very quickly. Totally recommended.</li>
            <li> I received this product and after 1 month I had a feeling that the silicone pad was starting to harden and crack at the seam where the two parts come together at the squeeze. So I figured that it may be a defect with the pad. So I put the replacement silicone pad in and the same thing happened again 2 weeks ago. Because the silicone pad cracks, it crimps my already short lashes and makes them look funny. I used this Shu Uemura curler for ages before receiving this one and now because it&#x27;s not sold in the USA anymore I need to find a new replacement. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl lashes at all. Fake. Returned.</li>
            <li> Purchased as this product had been proven superb in the past when purchased at a local boutique. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this curler, I assumed they were all the same, but I was delightfully surprised.  I have no idea what makes this curler so unique, but it curls my lashes better than any eyelash curler I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple lash curlers and after multiple recommendations, I finally bought THE ONE. Do not spend money on any other lash curler! Beautiful natural looking curl...no broken lashes...no pain...Only thing holding this baby back from 5 stars is that it only last 6 months!</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied with the product.  I purchased this product at a retail store and the product was amazing at curling my eyelashes.  When purchasing this new product I expected the curl to be superior, however, was unsatisfied with the lack of curl factor it had.  I don&#x27;t feel like the product was new because it curled my eyelashes worse then my current eyelash curler that&#x27;s 3 years old and the same brand / product.  Don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> good product but I think tarte has a better one for less money.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler does not pinch me. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t. It fits my eyelid area nicely and curls my stubby lashes. This is a great product. Worth the price considering others pinch.</li>
            <li> Ok, As good as it was cracked up to be. Specially for the price.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it took over a month to arrive, I&#x27;m pretty sure my curler is a knock off too, as some people have also wrote. I regret not reading the reviews before I actually bought it, but who would have ever thought people actually make knock off shu uemura curlers. The one I received is very flimsy and the rubber pad doesn&#x27;t fill in the entire curler, almost like the pad needs to be longer.  It also seems like it doesn&#x27;t curl as well as my old one. With this one you have to really press down hard to get any type of curl, and then your lashes just have dent marks in them. It&#x27;s hard to find the right pressure. I just never had that problem with my old one. Save yourself the doubt and buy it from the shu uemura website, that way you know you will get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Inferior product and a complete waste of money.  Either this is a knock off or Shu Uemura&#x27;s quality has drastically declined.  Not even close to as good as my previous Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  Pulls lashes, doesn&#x27;t curl lashes well, no tension and pinches skin.  It&#x27;s a rip off, same quality as cheapest drug store brand.  Won&#x27;t buy again and looking for a different brand to buy now..</li>
            <li> Although I have Asian eyes, this eye curler does not cover from corner to corner.  The shape does not fit my eyes.  The Shiseido curler shape is wider and do a better job to reaching the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, not a knockoff. I never had success curling my lashes with drugstore curlers and this one works as all the makeup artists testify. I am blessed with long lashes and it doesn&#x27;t kink them. Takes some practice. Start at the base and squeeze, moving outward.</li>
            <li> Consistently pulled out 1-2 eyelashes, even when I greased it with petroleum jelly or lotion. I would find them on the the rubber part of the device.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many curlers and this one simply knocks it out of the park. My lashes have never really curled until I bought the Shu Uemura curler.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is so-so.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than any other, well actually maybe it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as Revlon&#x27;s.  I follow the directions about holding it for 10 seconds and moving it out a little and doing it again.  It only offers the slightest curl, really it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  I have no idea why it&#x27;s gotten rave reviews from some people.  I hoped it would be worth the money, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s a crying CRYING shame that this curler is no longer offered in the US. That said, crying will just make your eyelashes flop, so don&#x27;t do it, they don&#x27;t sell the Shu Uemura in the US anymore and you&#x27;ll not get a perfect curl without it. The original was/is worth all the hype. If you don&#x27;t wear a stitch of makeup, pluck your eyebrows and curl your lashes, and curl them with this curler. Round, lovely curls are achieved by good tools and practiced technique.  Start at the root, release, slide up to the middle, release and gently crease the tips of your lashes. Mascara afterward and keep the chemicals off the silicone. Eyelash curlers are put under significant pressure by your grasping little make up applying hands, causing them to be bent out of alignment- the nature of the beast. That is why Shu Uemura did not sell replacement pads above and beyond those that came with the curler...you&#x27;ll need a new curler every 12-18 months... Anyway...it&#x27;s an incredible curler, truly rated #1 for a good reason.  Buy direct at Shuuemura.com.</li>
            <li> I have use eye lash curlers for over 15 years and although this one may be pricier it is the best one.</li>
            <li> This is not a shu uemura curler!  I have been using the product for years, and can tell a fake when I see it. Very disapointed...should have known by the price.  If it is too good to be true, it probably is.  what a waste of money...</li>
            <li> Had the Shu Uemura before this is not it. This is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work well at all. So sad ...</li>
            <li> This is the best eye lash curler! Easy to use and I have not found another one that works this good</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING eyelash curler ever!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye curler...My favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> the finger grip holes are really small and it doesn&#x27;t open real wide.</li>
            <li> Not a true shu urmura...I returned it right away.</li>
            <li> This item was not a real Shu Uemura product. A huge difference with how they were shaped. I bought 5 of them cuz the price were cheaper. Now I know why. Back to shuuemura.com.</li>
            <li> best eyelash curler on the market. worth the wait ,  i will buy more in case they stop making them</li>
            <li> I like this curler. It works much better than my old one. Will have to see if it lasts a long time or not.</li>
            <li> The curve doesn&#x27;t conform to my eye so it is difficult to get it to work.  The end result is alright though.</li>
            <li> Great Product and great service when I bought it from Loseweightnow.</li>
            <li> This is the second Shu Uemura eyelash curler I&#x27;ve purchased. I lost the refill for my first one and loved the eyelash curler so much I had to buy it again. It curls my lashes quickly and doesn&#x27;t make them look kinky like other eyelash curlers do. It also doesn&#x27;t pinch or tug my eyelashes, which is a huge bonus! The curler I used before this came yanked out a good amount of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 1/2 Japanese.  For the price, it&#x27;s no better than the $3 curler from Target.  She sees no difference in this curler.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Shu eyelash curlers.  I used my last one so much, the rubber kept falling out.  Had to wait for my Shu order online to come in, so in the meantime, I bought another one from Sephora which was pretty expensive, but what a waste of money.  Can&#x27;t beat the design of the Shu and how it curls eyelashes straight up.  Wow!  You don&#x27;t realize how good they are until you try something else.</li>
            <li> I have very straight eyelashes and have had to use an eyelash curler for years. Most of the curlers I have used in the past did not curl my lashes very well and they did not hold a curl even with my use of water proof mascara. I have to say that Shu Uemura ia the best curler I have ever used and I think I have probably used them all. The tool is worth a little extra money if you truly want \\&quot;bang for your buck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shu uemura eyelash curlers for years - when it came time to replace my tired one, I ordered from amazon instead of making the trip to the department store.  I was very disappointed with this curler - the rubber pad was extra stiff making it impossible to curl my eyelashes.  The harder I squeezed, the more eyelashes got pulled out.  I am promptly returning it and buying a new one from Nordstrom or Sephora instead.  Kudos to Amazon though for being prompt with my refund.</li>
            <li> Here is to another 10 years. We will see if this one holds up as well as my previous ones. But Shu Umera is still my fav curler.</li>
            <li> I saw so many raves about this curler that I thought it had to be great, and maybe I just got a bum box, but it&#x27;s just ... okay. It&#x27;s better than the $5 drugstore curler I had, but it&#x27;s not something I LOVE. When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll try another one.</li>
            <li> For those who claim that they bought fake curlers: I&#x27;ve always been very cautious about online shopping and the one that I received was an authentic curler from seller MILD Japan. My order arrived a week before its earliest expected arrival date and the seller threw a snack with the order (awe how cute). One of the things I do to guarantee that it&#x27;s authentic is to make sure you know where your product is being shipped from. I always go for JAPANESE sellers even at a slightly higher cost because there are very few knock-offs/fake items in Japan. Korean sellers are also relatively reputable. If the seller is from China/Hong Kong/South East Asia or sometimes even in the US, then you should probably email or contact the seller first to guarantee that you are receiving an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;As for the curler, it is definitely one of the best eyelash curlers you can purchase on the market. Back in the days I&#x27;d buy curlers at Daiso (Japanese dollar store) and drug stores but none of them lasted very long or did a good job on curling my lashes. Ever since I&#x27;ve discovered the importance of having a good eyelash curler (I&#x27;m Asian with short straight lashes and I&#x27;d NEVER apply mascara without curling my lashes), I&#x27;ve stuck to Anna Sui. Personally I think the quality and effects of the Shu Uemura curler is just as good as the Anna Sui one, but price wise it&#x27;s slightly cheaper and I guess for those who prefer the more sophisticated look (the Anna Sui one might be too &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;??!!) this is the one to go. I&#x27;d place the Anna Sui, Shu Uemura and Shiseido curlers all at no.1 on my recommendation list and I personally consider them to be interchangeable. Aside from that, it&#x27;s all down to personal preference, accessibility and price.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product. I believe this is a fake. It broke off my lashes,it hurt when I tried to curl my lashes. I am not happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler I have ever used that keeps my lashes&lt;br /&gt;Curled. I have purchased other ones and given as gifts. Well worth&lt;br /&gt;Its price.</li>
            <li> Product does just what I expected it to do.  Curls my eyelashes more quickly than other models. Is very well made.</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT, it makes your eyelash looks so curly and great after u put masacara on. strongly recommend every girl to get one !</li>
            <li> I received a knock-off also.  I do not understand why Amazon continues to do business with these companies.  The box was damaged, the refill was missing, and the box was wrapped with some plastic paper.  I will order from Shu Uemura, if they are still selling them in the US.  This will be sent back.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product before and loved it. This particular curler in one month&#x27;s time has a screw that has pulled loose and the rubber insert has fallen out. Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler does a wonderful job of curling the lashes without crimping them. I have used other eyelash curlers before but haven&#x27;t ever had very positive results. This one is shaped slightly different and seems to fit on the lashes much better. The other feature that makes the curler better than others is the black pad, which goes under the lashes. It is rounded, not flat, and seems to me to be the key to getting a curl and not a crease in lashes. (An extra pad is included with this item which is a bonus!) Note: I slightly heat by curler with warm air from my hair dryer (checking the temperature on may hand before using on my eye). I have been using this curler for several months now and am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom and she loves it. I have the same one and she wanted mine so I bought her her own and it was a great decision!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how good this curler is compared to all the others.  I have hard to curl lashes and this is the only curler that I have found that works for me.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I ever had. I have used many many curlers but this is the only one that easily does what it is suppose to do. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Curls lashes more completely than other products I&#x27;ve used, but is a little difficult to position on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> LOVE this.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey for an eyelash curler but it has such a delicate touch and feel and really does an expert job of curling the lashes and keeping them curled, it just enhances any mascara product you might use.  Will definitely repurchase when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  They had been sold out on their site since Christmas and I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  Well, it&#x27;s a fake.  Totally obvious the second I had it in my hand, not to mention it made my eyelashes look all crazy.  Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for six years. Other curlers give lashes a bend. Not this one. Curl is soft and natural.</li>
            <li> I bought the AUTHENTIC Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler from MINOYA. I KNOW that the one I got is authentic, because I have compared side by side with the Shu Curler that I got directly from the shu uemura website. Also, when I squeeze the shu curler too tight, it&#x27;s possible to pull out some eyelashes so I don&#x27;t do that anymore. You really don&#x27;t need to squeeze so hard with this curler. I got the authentic curler for a cheaper price and with free shipping. AWESOME. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyelash curler. Will never use any other than this again. Throwing the dozen other curlers away. Love</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler ever. IT IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE STORE OR AT SEPHORA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the drugstore eyelash curlers but not as great as I&#x27;d hoped.  Not as much pinching but could still be better.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it any where else.  I was very excited to see it available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that Shu Uemura is the way to go for eyelash curlers, but I wish I had listened earlier, because this is an amazing product that is superior to any other similar product I&#x27;ve tried. This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This product was a fake. I bought the original from the She Uemura website and was pleased. I ordered this product and it was flimsy and wasn&#x27;t even in packaged in plastic like the original one I purchased. I threw it in the garbage because I didn&#x27;t want to be bothered with returning the product. Buyer beware!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler  I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> Had used this curler for many years and then it was gone. No curler compares to this one. Glad to find it on Amazon. The curler on this doesn&#x27;t see to curl as well as I remembered, but still far above the rest out there.</li>
            <li> These eyelash curlers are amazing.  I ordered two so I could have one automatically on hand when my first one goes.  It also comes with a replacement rubber pad, which makes the already seemingly forever lasting product last infinity longer.  I probably won&#x27;t need to purchase another one for 10 years.  Thank you, Shu Eumura!!</li>
            <li> As an Asian girl, it was difficult for me to find an eyelash curler that worked on my flatter eyes. Shu Uemura curler was the fix. It is a little bit pricier than others, but definitely worth every cent. It curls each lash with precision and my flat eyes are very grateful to this curler for the wonders it does. Yay, Shu Uemura!</li>
            <li> I thought my daughter had on fake eye lashes.....Best eyelash curler ever ~ she bought 3 to give as gifts...&lt;br /&gt;Will never own another brand!</li>
            <li> Im not sure this is authentic Shu. Packaging was the same. Came with the spare rubber piece. Just feels a little loose and lighter than ones I hit a Sephora back when the sold them. Maybe this is a \\&quot;second\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a true Shu Uemura eyelash curler. I purchased one from Sephora a few years ago and wanted a second one.  Unfortunately, Sephora no longer carries it so I went on a limb and bought one from Amazon.  I checked the reviews.  Earlier ones stated that the product was inferior and not a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; Shu Uemura.  Later reviews seemed more positive, so I was hopeful I would be a getting a good product.  I compared the Amazon curler with the my old one from Sephora. It was brand new, in what looked like the same white box as the one that I had purchased from Sephora.  But after using it only once, I could tell they are definitely not the same, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to notice the differences in quality and craftsmanship.  Most importantly, the angle of the curler is different and the quality of the Amazon curler is inferior.  You can see it particularly at the welding joints, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to feel &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; in my hand like my old one.  I thought it was just me and that it would just take some time to get used to it.  But after several months, I can officially say - purchase fail. I&#x27;m disappointed that I purchased this.  I buy a lot from Amazon, from books/DVDs, to food items and clothing.  This is one of the few purchases where I&#x27;ve had to write a less than positive review.</li>
            <li> when i open the package i see the shu uemura box with tape around it. It looks like someone already opened it and the curler itself is not seal in the plastic bag, which it proves my point, fake or someone opened it before</li>
            <li> Best Eyelash curler ever!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and would not use any other eyelash curler!  So worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought it from Cosmetic Trading. It looks to be authentic, I included some pictures here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from a cheapo Covergirl curler to this, so my experience is limited. But this curler doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid like the other one did. My lashes curled nicely and stayed curled with mascara. I have Asian almond eyes with a double eyelid with straight downward pointing lashes, just for reference. I&#x27;m sure you can find better reviews elsewhere but my 2 cents is that this curler is really amazing. Expensive at $20 but great results. I was between this and the Shiseido one but the Shiseido was a bit too flat for my eye so I kept getting too close to my eyeball.</li>
            <li> These are fakes! NOT REAL SHU UEMURA</li>
            <li> I find this to be a wonderful eyelash curler, one of the best. It doesn&#x27;t crimp your eyelashes, just gives your eyelashes a nice smooth curve to it.</li>
            <li> The only eyelash curler I have used my entire life - tried another brand once and threw it away after 3 days - nothing on the market compares to this</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler that I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother insists that all curlers are the same but that statement is not true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are very straight. So I have tried alot of different curlers and methods to have curled eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard that these were one of the best in the category so I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They curled my eyelashes perfectly and they stayed that way for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great for professional use</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this persona did as advertised and had a special treat and note inside.  So much so that I will be ordering a second one for my mom for her birthday :)</li>
            <li> This is the only curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids. It&#x27;s hard to find and so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Love the shuuemura eye lash curler. The best one out there! I have straight eye lashes and with the shu uemura eye lash curler my lashes stayed curled for days on out even after I washed and cleaned them with make up remover. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this eyelash curler and am returning it.  It pulled out my lashes so I am not a fan!</li>
            <li> the best eyelash curler, hands down</li>
            <li> Because this came from Japan, it took about 2wks before I got it......but it was worth the wait....it&#x27;s a very good product....lightweight and gentle on my lashes</li>
            <li> I like this eyelash curler. I don&#x27;t need to press on my lashes but about once, rarely twice to get them curled. This is definitely one of the best eyelash curlers I have used. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the AUTHENTIC one I have and when I compared them, this one was cheaply made, much lighter than the authentic one, and the hardware was completely different.  And to top it off I am having problems returning it!</li>
            <li> So good, for small eyelash!!</li>
            <li> If there is a better eyelash curler for skimpy lashes I have never found it. This one is my friend.</li>
            <li> want to buy this a long time for it&#x27;s good reputation, it&#x27;s really easy to use! only one or twice to see the effect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler i have bought! i can&#x27;t find any shortcomings now.&lt;br /&gt;will recomment to my friends.</li>
            <li> This curler is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  I really didn&#x27;t think a curler could make a difference but I was wrong. I use this with Max Factor False Lash Effect Mascara, also recommended by Lisa Eldridge, and I now have eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I really like it, compared to some that I have bought in the past.  The only thing is that I wish it would open more, sometimes I have a hard time getting all my lashes through, but my lashes are very difficult to curl and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Not the real product .This is a knock off that is not any good.I have been buying the real product for years.You can buy it through the Shu Uemura website.</li>
            <li> When Sephora quit carrying these, I had to find another source. It is the classic and does a great job but the thing I&#x27;ll never get is why it doesn&#x27;t make it in the shape of a curled eyelash. It tries but it still can look bent.  I will keep looking for one that is designed to actually CURVE the eyelashes rather than bend them.</li>
            <li> I have tried other curlers but always come back to this one.  It works best for me and seems to get high ratings in many major magazines.  Its getting a little hard to find so thanks to Amazon, I get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyelash curler for years, and I found the best price ever on Amazon.  $15.00!  This product is great for the perfect eyelash curl.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I mistook this one for one I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply that is the bomb diggety!  This one SUCKS horribly and I would never purchase again..I have bought many, many a eyelash curler from as much as 30+ $ to as little as 2.99.....this one was horrible!!</li>
            <li> I have super stubborn Asian lashes that are impossible to keep curled. When I received this curler in the mail, I was excited to try them out. But much to my disappointment, the curler was extremely flimsy. I bought it through a third party distributor so I do suspect that it might be a cheap imitation of the real brand but so far...not doing the job :(</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler I heard about through a YouTube video. It&#x27;s definitely better than the regular ones you can buy at a store. The curler has a wider angle and gets all of your lashes comfortably. It also curls better. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are the real deal. I believe Shu Uemura stopped making these awhile ago. Perhaps because there are so many knock-offs that sell for a lot less. I compared this to my old one that I got directly from the Shu Uemura website awhile ago. It is not the same. It is not as heavy for one thing. But...that being said, it is a good eyelash curler. I have gotten knock-offs from Ebay and I have sent them back. This is the best I have come across and that is why I gave it four stars. It works pretty well although not as well as the real deal. I wish they would make them again!!!</li>
            <li> found the curler to be nice to handle and easy to clean.  I might buy another for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Good curler.  Silicone refills last much longer than the rubber ones which come with other curlers.  This eyelash curler fits the shape of my eyelid better than any other.</li>
            <li> Dont know why Sephora stopped selling these because they truly are the best, but I am glad I found it here.  I had tried the drug store brands and they are just shaped differently and do not create a natural lasting curl like this one does!</li>
            <li> I really like the Shu Eemura eyelash curler for my straight eyelashes.  They curl nicely and last.  They do not pinch my eyelids like some curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very Happy with this purchase.  I would highly recommend this product to those who want to try it out.</li>
            <li> I think they make the best manual eyelash curler.  I have used for a number of years and have never been disappointed</li>
            <li> I am so use to Revlon eyelash curlers that pinch and pull and then the cushion becomes useless till when I tried these, it was so nice NOT to be pinched and they curled so nicely.  Got some for each of my daughters and they are enjoying theirs too!</li>
            <li> I curl my eyelashes each day.  This product does the job without pulling out lashes or requiring multiple pressures on the curler - just once and it is done.  So glad Amazon carries this product as it is very difficult to find in the store.</li>
            <li> Love. This. Eyelash curler.  I have naturally short-ish pin straight eyelashes.  This lash curler curls all of my eyelashes easily without them getting caught in the sides or ripping them out or doing too much damage to them (I only have to press down a few times for it to work- where as other lash curlers I have to press down several times.)  I recently started using Latisse and my eyelashes are getting longer and thicker.. And I&#x27;d say this still works great.  I&#x27;ll update my review if I have any issues as they get longer but I doubt i will.  I also love that the rubber strip on this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t crease so my eyelashes and makeup don&#x27;t get caught in it.</li>
            <li> These were not made like they used to be. They do not curl my eyelashes. I could pay a lot less at Walgreens and get the same thing cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this curler. The best one I have ever used. Definitely will continue to buy it as it works and works well.</li>
            <li> Good eyelash curler, I have purchase japonesque in the past, and it seemed to grab ALL my lashes more than this one.</li>
            <li> Ordered a Shu Uemura eyelash curler.... received a lens case with a Shu Uemura eyelash curler label stuck on it.</li>
            <li> best curler on the market today!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler. It fits my eyes. They are almond shaped. I also have a revlon one that has worn out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because I used my points and didn&#x27;t actually pay $14 for a knock off, but I don&#x27;t have any complaints. It curls my eyelashes just fine and the shape (which the real Shu Uemura is known for) is on point so yeah. If you&#x27;re okay having a knock off, this one works just fine!</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite eyelash curler!  It opens wider than many curlers and rarely pinches.  I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this despite the bad reviews.  I was hoping I would get a seller with the real thing ( it sounded like a few people had.  I didnt get the real thing and now this piece of junk is sitting in its fake box in my closet.  Its so bad I wont even use it as my travel eyelash curler.  I ordered the real one from the official site and it&#x27;s sad they are trying to pretend that what they are selling is even close to the real thing. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND BUY THE REAL THING. I wish I had taken the hint from the hundreds before me...</li>
            <li> the only good thing i can say about this is it came in a few days after i ordered, however its not what i expected its not a very good item i get a better curl from a cheap eyelash curler from odd lots than this one , dont like it at all and i have tried to like it for the fact that its supposed to be a better eye lash curler than the other brands.</li>
            <li> This curler is really good at getting each and every eyelash curled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only curler that really works! Others are more expensive but don&#x27;t fit eye contours as well as Shu Uemura&#x27;s does.</li>
            <li> For Asians with almond shaped eyes that doesn&#x27;t have deep curvature underneath your brow bone, this is the number one lash curler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You no longer have to worry about pinching you eye lid or worry about mis-shaped curling at the edges from a mis-fit curler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for all Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Vietnemese and other Asian eye lids</li>
            <li> I wish I read this comments before, I got robbed too. Im a makeup artist and know pretty well the Shue mura eylash curler. Becuase it was removed from Sephora I was forced to look for it somewhere else to buy it. *********It is FAKE!!!!!!!**********  People beware if you wish to buy one, I suggest you go to the oficial original website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The seller that I baught it from in amazon is named From Mr. MAGOKORO (Fulfilled by Amazon)-&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY IT FROM THEM!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS HELPS TO AVOID PEOPLE GETTING A FAKE ONE.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the authentic Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler, sadly this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;I do think this is a great alternative. I had to return mine because I purchased this thinking that I was getting an amazing deal for a real Shu Uemura product.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to a comparison of this curler to the real one, check out this blog post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://myeyeshadowconsultant.com/2011/06/24/how-to-spot-a-fake-shu-uemura-eyelash-curler/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will help you decide on your purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and they are always great! I would recommend highly. My daughter and sister use it too</li>
            <li> doesnt seem to curl like they used to years ago.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my friend. She loves it and uses it very often.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler out there! It is worth the extra money compared to Revlon or any other cheaper makeup brand.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister for Christmas but was disappointed to find out it was not a real Shu Uemura! My mom has a real one and there is definitely a difference.</li>
            <li> This is not a real Shu Uemura.  It is super flimsy and very low quality.  A definite fake.</li>
            <li> I have the tiniest lashes ever and all the lash curlers I&#x27;ve owned in the past would pinch, but not the Shu Uemura! They are indeed the best eyelash curler on the market. Why, no pinch!!!!!  Shu Uemura is awesome and I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> I tried all different lash curlers, nonoe of them can compare tp this one, does not pinch at all, and my lashed curl too!!  Wonderful, the only thing, I can not buy this at Sephora any more.</li>
            <li> This curler did not work for me but it was not the fault of the curler it was because my eyelashes  are to short to fit in the curler, I have had this problem before. I keep looking for a way to make them look longer.&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie Cape Coral FL</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find anything particularly terrific with this eyelash curler.  It pinches just like the rest of them do.  I do like the shape - it&#x27;s not so curved, which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars and not one.  But as far as comfort and all of the claims it doesn&#x27;t pinch - not true as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I have seen a number of reviews that claim the Shu Uemura eyelash curler sold here is fake, but regardless, this is the best eyelash curler I have ever used. I have used Maybelline, Revlon and Tweezerman curlers in the past and, while they add a curve to my lashes, it takes longer than it should and I have to re-curl after applying mascara (which is probably not good for the lashes).  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Very good and good quality.</li>
            <li> a must have for anyone who has eyelashes.</li>
            <li> i ordered this from seller Elecet Tai, not having had a real Shu Uemura curler before. it arrived and wasn&#x27;t that great, and after googling i discovered there are counterfeits floating around, which i hadn&#x27;t considered (who makes counterfeit eyelash curlers?!). this one looks JUST like the real one, comparing pictures i couldn&#x27;t tell. ordered a genuine one from Shu&#x27;s website for $5 more and now that it&#x27;s arrived it&#x27;s clear this one was FAKE!!! do not buy from amazon, there&#x27;s no way to tell if seller is selling the real deal! just order it direct!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared it to my original Shu Uemera and it&#x27;s pretty obvious this is a knock off product. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is awful! It is the knock off version and is nothing like Shu Uemura. The shipping takes forever and then when you get it, it&#x27;s so disappointing!</li>
            <li> Does not work like the ones I purchased at cosmetic counters.  Would not suggest buying.  Bought two will return the other one.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  I would like everyone to know how good it works.  I didn&#x27;t think that there was a difference but it truely is better.</li>
            <li> Good product, it so easy to make the curves, I love it. give five stars, and I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous eyelash curlers and nothing compares to this one. The one I had was probably 15 years old and just plain worn out I am so glad I found this one tis the best</li>
            <li> First, let me say I am the queen of side by side testing.  So....I purchased the gold-plated version of this eyelash curler and put it up against my trusty Maybelline curler that is probably older than, aww, let&#x27;s say it at least goes  back to the Clinton Administration.  Absolutely no perceptible difference at all in the curl, but the Shu Uemura&#x27;s design for the pad eliminates the lashes getting pinched and caught.  So I am going to put aside my Maybelline and protect my lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase! Very happy!! Have been looking for the perfect item and found it! Very pleased with this! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I&#x27;ve been using the tried-and-true Revlon/Maybelline curlers since the Carter administration.  Let&#x27;s face it, eyelash curling is not rocket science; it&#x27;s not even advanced calculus, so I, like other reveiwers, was a bit hesitant to shell out big bucks on some Mercedes of curlers when my Toyota was doing quite well, thank you.  But I did.  And as my mom always says, \\&quot;Caveat Emptor!\\&quot;    I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s a great curler, if I could get it to work; but its opening is only about 1/2 as wide as my old curler and therein lies the problem.   When I try to get it over my eyelashes, they either get mushed against the inside of the curler or shoved down into my eyeball.   (Not particularly pleasant at any time; much less at 0600 in the morning.)   Okay, so maybe I&#x27;m not the most coordinated individual in the world, and, as previously mentioned, most eyelash curling takes place when I&#x27;m still half asleep, but nothing&#x27;s changed in my routine but the curler.       After strugging for three consecutive mornings, and ending up resorting to my Revlon/Maybelline curler, I&#x27;ve given up.       Want a bargain Shu curler???    Check out ebay in about two days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t bother to buy ten cheap ones thinking you are saving money - you are so much better off to just go with this one to start.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash curler from Organic Direct at the beginning of August when I heard they were no longer going to be available in the US.  I had one I had purchased locally at Sephora, which was fantastic.    The curler I received was in an authentic box and looks real enough, but I think it must be a knock off.  Almost immediately, the supposedly silicone pad wore a deep grove that pinched my eyelashes.  This morning, after less than two months of use, the thing broke into pieces.    I checked Sephora and found that indeed the shu uemura curler is no longer available in the US, but they offer a Sephora Collection substitute for $16 with a silicone pad that customers have given glowing reviews.    I have requested a full refund from Organic Direct.  I am awaiting their response.  For now, I am heading over to Sephora!</li>
            <li> The Shu Uemura eye lash curler has dominated every beauty must-have list for over a decade now... and it&#x27;s for good reason. I know it&#x27;s hard to justify spending so much money on something that you can buy at the drug store, heck even a gas station, for so little; especially something that seems pretty cut and dry. It&#x27;s just a terrifying-looking, approximately eye-sized metal appliance that you jam as close as possible to your eyeball, right? No. No. No, it is not. The Shu Uemura eye lash curler gently caresses your lashes like a ballet dancer in a pas de deux, delicately, until they lengthen and expand radiantly-- like an arabesque. But seriously, you won&#x27;t get any of those weird right angles you can get (and then can&#x27;t get rid of) with your run of the mill gas station curler. It is virtually impossible to mess up your lashes using this thing. Bonus, it&#x27;s also harder to hurt yourself with these... it&#x27;s just not as aggressively pinchy. If you wear a lot of makeup and you don&#x27;t have these, you should buy them right now. Alternately, if you don&#x27;t wear any makeup ever, but want to make your face look brighter, your eyes larger and more awake, and your whole face better... you should probably just buy them right now too. If you&#x27;re looking to get a gift for a devout make-up lover, you should get her/him these. Get them one even if they already have one, which if they really love makeup, they probably do. Who wouldn&#x27;t want an extra one?! If you&#x27;re looking to get a gift for someone new to makeup, or who doesn&#x27;t wear any (or wears very little makeup), you should get them these too (well, only if they&#x27;re expressing interest in makeup/face improving things... don&#x27;t get it out of the blue for somebody that doesn&#x27;t wear makeup, that&#x27;s just rude). What I&#x27;m saying is you don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup at all for this eyelash curler to make a difference in your beauty routine. I&#x27;ve recently been wearing only mascara to work because I&#x27;m too lazy/tired in the mornings to do anythingelse slash my eye makeup gets mostly melted off by my 1200 med pass (yay nursing!) anyway. And with this eye lash curler (and my Dior Show mascara, that obviously helps too), I look awake and presentable in the morning and my eyelashes look the same even when I return home otherwise haggard and exhausted! Just get this eye lash curler now. Join the cult. They&#x27;re so much cheaper on Amazon anyway! It would basically be unwise not to get it now. Happy curling!</li>
            <li> This item was recommended in &amp;#34;How Not to Look Old...&amp;#34; by Krupp and it does not disappoint.  My lashes look fabulous for the first time all the time, and this curler is easier to use than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I had no idea that brand could make such a difference, but it does.</li>
            <li> This curler has been the best I have tried so far. I have stick straight lashes and with lots of lightweight mascara and curling several several times it definitely helps them keep somewhat of a decent curl. The box arrived completely crushed when shipped that I thought I for sure it would be broken. It was thankfully alright though when unpacked. Need to do a way better job packaging and shipping the product but overall happy.</li>
            <li> Purchased one a few years back and then began using a different brand which was horribly disappointing.  I thought how different can eye lash curlers be?  Guess what there is a difference -- so I ordered another.  This product is easy to use and does a wonderful job.  Make certain you don&#x27;t misplace the spare rubber piece because it seems that piece is what make the product so completely successful.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have bought. 5 star product. But I just got my second one in and it didn&#x27;t come with the refill. So I made it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The only curler to use,it is the best</li>
            <li> I purchased this curler and was surprised that it did not work nearly as well as the ones I have used in the past.  I ordered one directly from Shu Uemura for comparison and they were not even remotely close.  The one purchased directly from the company worked exactly how I remembered but the one I purchased here barely worked and was very loose.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Curls lashes smoothly, and quickly.  I seem to be able to get more lashes in one go with this curler than with others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Although as a professional makeup artist, most of the time I still need to use a mini-curler, like the Preo to get those evasive outer-lashes!</li>
            <li> It is a good curler, very similar than Japonese brand.</li>
            <li> Best eye lash curler ever!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my sister who is a makeup fiend. I thought it was a tad pricey for an eyelash curler, but decided to purchase due to high praises. Well consider me now in the fan club! What a miracle tool, no skin pinching, eyelashes look beautiful and curly even without mascara, stays put (even after I washed my face,wow). I don&#x27;t really go out in full makeup, however I am reconsidering adding eyelash curling with this awesome tool to my routine. Don&#x27;t scrimp on this, go out and get it, and you will be batting those perfectly curled lashes soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyelash curler forever and ever and will never venture away from it.  I am completely bummed that they don&#x27;t sell it anywhere but online anymore, but Amazon has it for the best price I&#x27;ve ever found.  This eyelash curler curves your lashes...not bends or crimps them.  The bar is long enough to fit around your entire lash line and get every lash you have.  There is no pinching and it&#x27;s hard to slip when you press down.  I love this curler!! Worth every penny and the pads last a long time!</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash curler.  Was not able to get it in stores so happy amazon had this!! It&#x27;s the best curler out there!!</li>
            <li> This is not a real Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler! It&#x27;s a rip off. I returned it the day after I received it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would somehow be &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; than other curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past (especially for the $$), but it was the same.  No better, no worse.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really love it ,it can curl my eyelash well and easily.and it is very convenient to use, love it!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used. When they stopped selling this at Sephora my sister and I were devastated but after years of using unsatisfactory eyelash cullers we tried looking for it on AMAZON and were thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> Love it, the best eyelash curler ever purchased !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite item in my make up bag. People are always asking me if I have fake eyelashes and it is because of this eyelash curler. I will only ever buy this brand eyelash curler. It&#x27;s easy to clean and so smooth to use.</li>
            <li> Uhhh...I will never look for another eyelash curler again. Great price, great product. Has me lookin fly all over town.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl lashes as promised.  No longer use it.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Shu Uemura eyelash curler. It&#x27;s the best. However, this one is NOT REAL. Please do not get duped like me. I trusted amazon.com to only list genuine products. I got this in the mail promptly, and it is most definitely NOT a Shu Uemura. It was horrible quality compared to the real Shu Uemura eyelash curler that I currently own. It was completely unusable, and I sent it back for a full refund.    If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this eyelash curler, just go to the shu uemura website, and you can buy it for a GENUINE one for the exact same price.</li>
            <li> it works and i find it to be the best curler on the market. i just wish the silicon pads lasted a little longer and the shu uemura would provide more than just 1 pad refills or allow buyers to purchase more pads instead of having to buy a whole new curler.</li>
            <li> I saw a makeup artist on TV who said the Shu Uemura eyelash curler is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for every woman.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I don&#x27;t have any experience with eyelash curlers, but I will say this one is easy to use and met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been talking myself out of buying this curler for a while. It&#x27;s kinda expensive, but I told myself it was an investment so when I saw one used I pulled the trigger. Two weeks later when it arrived I was so anxious to try it out. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong because my lashes aren&#x27;t curled. I take that back, the lashes closer to the inside of my eye are curled fine, it&#x27;s the ones toward the outer part of my eye that look bent, \\&quot;L shaped\\&quot;. I tried again on the other eye and got the same result.    I spent the money and will use it again, but I am disappointed. Another reviewer mentioned there is a certain way to do it, I&#x27;ll play around with it again, but how hard could/should it be?! If I had it to do all over again I would not have purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for her bridal shower because she has been in love with my eyelash curler and could not find it at any store.  I was nervous that it would not come before the shower since the shipping said it might not, but it came the morning of.  It was in perfect condition and my friend was really excited.  It was great to be able to have the actual one for her to open instead of just telling her that it was coming in the mail.  She immediately opened it to use it and loved it!</li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought a Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler which curled my eyelashes perfectly.  After several years and daily plus usage, the piece of rubber split.  I ran out and bought a drugstore curler thinking that any curler could do the same trick.  Not only did I try one, I tried three.  Was I wrong!!! No other eyelash curler can surpass the Shu Uemura which curls so perfectly and keeps the curl lasting all day.</li>
            <li> Great eye lash curler, the best I have had yet! It is completely worth the extra money. Don&#x27;t waste money on other curlers this is the best.</li>
            <li> A friend was looking for this eyelash curler;  so I bought one for her as a birthday gift and one for me.  We both like them and are happy with them.  The curler seems well made and does a nice job.  Because of the curved pad, it doesn&#x27;t crimp the lashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure about some of for reviews here in regard to this eyelash curler not being authentic. The one I received was real. This curler is the best I have ever used. It curls my lashes nicely and the curl lasts for hours unlike most of the other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> This product after I used it on my straight lashes really curled them for me. They looked longer. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used! I have purchased many inexpensive curlers hoping to get half of the volume and curl, only to be disappointed. It is definitely worth the money, as it lasts a long time and gives me enough curl that I don&#x27;t even need to apply mascara.</li>
            <li> This was not the same eyelash curler that you get from Shu Uemura direct.  Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> One of the best I ever used. Really curls the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I saw review in a magazine and decided I would try it. So far I love this eyelash curler! I hope it will last for a while. Seems like good quality and I expect that it will.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s very compact so it&#x27;s great for travel. Very durable. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have used all these products for years.I love them.So do my friends.I pray they don.t discontinue any of them. Dede Bassin Las Vegas NV</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good eyelash curler for a while after buying less expensive one&#x27;s from drug stores.  The Shu Uemura is better than the rest.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite beauty tool. It grabs all my lashes and never pinches. It&#x27;s pricier than a lot of other curlers but since I use it every day it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and durability. Unlike most curlers, this one it shaped better for the eye and doesn&#x27;t pull out lashes as it is used.</li>
            <li> When this arrived it looked like a poorly made version of my beloved SHU UEMURA Eyelash curler. The logo was not placed properly and the fills had seams on both sides. I used three times, the third time the seam on the fill pulled out eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;In the last month I was able to buy an actual SHU UEMURA eyelash curler in Hong Kong, at a SHU UEMURA location, and having the real thing to compare, it is completely obvious that the curler I purchased on amazon is a fake!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler I will use.  Works for me better than any other I have used.  I always purchase multiples because when the pad wears out the replacement does not always stay in place.  At that point it is time for a new curler.  They are pricey compared to brands available in makeup department at drug store but the results are worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Shu Uemura eyelash curlers and this one was defective.  It didn&#x27;t open or close properly, it was very stiff and not aligned.  Would have sent it back but opened it when leaving for vacation, so it was that or nothing.  Bought a new one from sephora two days later and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care whether it has an etched S or U or whatever on the eyelash curler. This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used, and it puts all others to shame. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but this is the kind of beauty device you buy once every 20 years. $17 is not that much.</li>
            <li> Shu Uemura makes the best eyelash curler. Never hurts, works perfectly. Great for a gift.</li>
            <li> Love!!! It&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> This is the gold standard of all lash curlers. Truly the most effective one I&#x27;ve used yet.  If you are unimpressed by most lash curlers, I can assure you that this one is definitely the game-changer of all lash curlers.  My lashes are naturally long and curly, but recently received a few compliments on them since I&#x27;ve purchased this.  No need for heated lash curlers, hairspray technique or repeated curling.  This one will do!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the crimping power of the first one I purchased....I am thinking of returning it.</li>
            <li> No matter my attempts to use it in different ways to be as careful as possible with my lashes it still breaks my eye lashes. A very expensive tool to have my eye lashes breaking. Quite sad.</li>
            <li> Only lash curler ive use so far that can curl my short asian lashes evenly and make my lashes visible. whenever my friends ask how my shu umera eyelash curler is... i just say: &amp;#34;my lashes now exist!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been through chemotherapy where all of my eyelashes fell out and when they came back I was hesitant to use an eyelash curler but this one works with no breakage.</li>
            <li> Every Christmas my wife wants this eyelash curler and my daughter and I chuckle thinking she could not have possibly worn the last one out.  My wife was disappointed when she received a cheap imitation clothed in a genuine looking box.  Someone is misrepresenting this hard to get item, substituting with  an inferior product and passing it off as legitimate.  The profit is being used to purchase more black hair dye and gluten free chow mien.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Minoya, fulfilled by Amazon.  There are a lot of previous reviews that state that people are receiving fakes, but it appears as if Amazon has clearly remedied that issue.  The one I received is authentic... and AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are thick and dark but they stick STRAIGHT forward from my face, parallel to the floor.  I&#x27;ve tried every lash curler in Sephora (yes, EVERY one, even the heated ones, even the Dior heated one, even Tweezerman, etc etc etc), and nothing even comes close to this thing.  It bends my lashes straight up towards the sky and they stay that way all day, even without mascara, until I wash my face at night.  Best beauty purchase of my life.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> I had a Shu Uemura eyelash curler many years ago and thought it was great.  I bought others when it needed to be replaced because of the price.  I was willing to splurge a little and buy another when my 5 year old Paula Dorf eyelash curler gave it up.  I did not know that replacement pads are not sold.  But I was willing to let that go, since each pad was supposed to last 6 months.  Both of the included silicone pads split within 6 weeks.  In the 35 (!) years that I have been using an eyelash curler, I have never had such a lousy one. Some reviewers have speculated that they received knockoffs, but mine is imprinted with the brand on the bottom of the pads.</li>
            <li> After trying many eyelash curlers that claim to be as good as Shu Uemura, I have wasted  a lot of money on bad substitutes.  Although this is the only eyelash curler may look the same as others, there is a very subtle difference in the curve that is more suited to the actual shape of your eyelid.  The silicone pad also lasts much longer than the standard rubber pad on most other curlers.  I will never use any other curler!</li>
            <li> SO much better than the cheap drugstore curlers, and since I wear mascara every day, I figured it was worth it. Doesn&#x27;t tug on your eyelashes (unless you don&#x27;t know how to use an eyelash curler and tug in the wrong direction), and cleans pretty easily. I definitely see why so many people rave about this being THE best curler.</li>
            <li> Authentic Shu Uemura eyelash curler from Port Trading US. Good quality and works well.</li>
            <li> love love thessse eyelash curlersss ;)</li>
            <li> The box looked as though it had been crushed which I thought could be because of the delivery man/methods but upon looking further, it seems as though the product had been used already. There was also no silicone refill included.</li>
            <li> This came with no refill. It also seems to tight and hurts to use. Would not buy again, cheaper ones work just as good.</li>
            <li> The best eye lash curler ever made !!!!!and it was the real thing!!</li>
            <li> I have always used the good ole faithful Shiseido curler...the Shu Uemura is similar...does not open as wide...I use both.</li>
            <li> Was just what I was hoping it would be very pleasef</li>
            <li> When I first received this lash curler it looked like a cheap version I could buy in a drug store. After using it, however, I realized it definitely  made my straight fine lashes curl and stay curled, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does not pinch eyelid.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler that I have ever found. Use it, and you do not have to worry about pulling out your lashes as part of the price of curling them. You do not need to press long and hard on the curler in order to achieve the desired effect. Just a light pressure for about 10 seconds will do the trick. It is easy to use and works beautifully. I am extremely happy with this product !</li>
            <li> I have owned a Shiseido eyelash curler for about a year and I love it but someone I know was raving about the Shu Uemura they had tried once so I decided to give it a try. I curled one eyelash with the Shiseido and one with the Shu Uemura and put on my regular coat of mascara. By the end of the day they looked the same but I didn&#x27;t like that it took longer to curl my eyelashes with the Shu Uemura. With my Shiseido I give it one go through and they come out perfect and last all day. Shu Uemura was over exaggerated but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading such big hype on this eyelash curler and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it from the Shu Uemura website.  I did order one from a seller on Amazon and it was a total fake.  As soon as I received this, it was flimsy.  So I ordered from the Shu Uemura website and compared them side by side.  The differences were present but it could only be told if you had an actual Shu Uemura eyelash curler to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this eyelash curler and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I curled my lashes as soon as I got the real Shu Uemura eyelash curler, I didn&#x27;t use mascara and my lashes were stayed curled....all day.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch my skin so that was a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this curler....from Shu Uemura website or an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> I read an article in a fashion magazine about this eyelash curler and how good it is for asian eyes. Since trying it, I can&#x27;t get myself to go back to the cheapy Revlon curlers I used before. This doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelashes and I get a great curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but sometimes pulls lashes outp</li>
            <li> Best lash curler out there. I&#x27;ve tried so many others. I&#x27;ll always return to this one. It gives a nice natural curl.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes stick straight out and this product is the only one that can actually curl them. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, haven&#x27;t had any eyelid pinching incidents.  A little expensive for what it is.  It&#x27;s shaped slightly different than the drug store brand but it&#x27;s constructed with the same materials</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these curlers for the past 5+ years and I use them daily -- they work wonders. Maybe I just got a one-off non-functional product, but this barely curls my lashes. I have to hold it tighter and longer than usual, and shortly my lashes look like I didn&#x27;t use the product at all. It&#x27;s not horrible, it&#x27;ll make a slight improvement, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable in general and nothing compared to other previous ones I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently learned these are no longer sold in the US. I&#x27;m returning this one and I bought a lancome one from sephora instead; supposedly it&#x27;s the same designer (or perhaps maker) of shu&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but went right back even quicker because it was fake!!! Don&#x27;t sell fake stuff...I have used Shu Uemura eyelash curlers for the past 8 years...I can tell! It didn&#x27;t open and close smoothly, and it did not have a silicone pad the way the real ones do. And I KNOW it was fake because I took the little rubber pad out to inspect it and it was hard, had a different texture, and mainly, did NOT have \\&quot;Shu Uemura\\&quot; printed/lasered on the bottom of it! Didnt even come close to curling lashes the way the real one does...I feel bad if someone who has never used the real product orders it and thinks that&#x27;s how the Shu Uemura curler is...they are surely going to be disappointed!! I&#x27;ve learned my lesson though...I&#x27;m sticking to ordering from the shu uemura website since the line is no longer carried in US shops like Sephora. I would have given it zero stars but apparently that isn&#x27;t an option...</li>
            <li> Always wanted it, even before the shoutout in &amp;#34;Devil Wears Prada&amp;#34;. Not disappointing.</li>
            <li> Totally overated. Paying for the brand name. A drugstore eyelash curler works better than this. First, it doesn&#x27;t open up enough so positioning it over your lashes is a hassle. Second, it caught my skin almost every time i used it. Third, because of all the manuvering to place the curler so I wouldn&#x27;t hurt myself, it DIDN&#x27;T CURL the LASHES very well. Bought a Sephora curler and it it works great.</li>
            <li> Going to get another one</li>
            <li> Well, it´s ok but doesn´t curl as I expected .</li>
            <li> For those who are newly purchasing the Shu Uemura eyelash curler, this is not the real one. As soon as I opened the package, something felt off, the strange printing on the box to the terrible quality of the eyelash curler. It&#x27;s fine to sell eyelash curlers, but selling under the brand name Shu Uemura is very misleading and unethically.</li>
            <li> No company makes these better</li>
            <li> Absolutely a FAKE!  Don&#x27;t buy it.  I retuned mine even though I had to pay return shipping.</li>
            <li> FAKE. I did my research and found out what a REAL one looks like. Here&#x27;s the link: http://myeyeshadowconsultant.com/2011/06/24/how-to-spot-a-fake-shu-uemura-eyelash-curler/&lt;br /&gt;It came in a shoddy damaged box and was OPENED. And when I finally took the curler out, it was dirty like it was already used and someone else returned it before me, and they just gave it to me!&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> After many others, found this one, love it, will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler I but. I even give them as gifts to my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be buying a 20 dl eyelash curler, to be honest I haven&#x27;t had the time to do my makeup correctly always in a rush, but I do see the difference. It&#x27;s my first time using this eyelash curler and I  notice the difference other curlers wouldn&#x27;t get all of my lashes especially the ones in the outer eye, this one does! So very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It takes almost one month.  I don&#x27;t get it. I want to return a product and not sure this is authentic shu uemura product.</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down.</li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not Shu Uemura.  This is a knock off product.</li>
            <li> best eye lash curler ever. actually makes me have eye lashes. can not get them in stores in the usa anymore</li>
            <li> i bought it because lisa eldridge uses it and says its good.and i am not disappointed.i cant compare it to any other simply because i have not tried any other,but i like it and the the silicone pad makes it comfortable. It seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> Best in the world!  This is the only eyelash curler worth using - does all as advertised, without breaking lashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of eyelash curlers and had not found one that I was satisfied with.  A friend suggested I try Shu Uemura and I love the shape and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t pull on your lashes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. IT IS A FAKE!!! THE SILICONE IS CHEAP AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SHU UEMURA LOGO IMPRINT. A VERY DISAPPOINTING PURCHASE; FEELS LIKE A COUNTERFEIT. DOES NOT CURL EYELASH AT ALL. I AM RETURNING IT. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY!! I MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT READING THE REVIEWS. THE REAL SHU UEMURA CURL THE EYELASH LIKE MAGIC. NO WONDER THIS ONE WAS SO CHEAP. USUALLY THEY GO FOR $20.00 -FROM THE GF</li>
            <li> fake product, doesn&#x27;t even curl your lashes and it pinches your skin.</li>
            <li> This was the second curler I bought on Amazon by this brand but this second one looked and worked like a fake. The brand name was not in the same font as the original. It didn&#x27;t curl lashes. It did not match the shape and size of the original so I returned it.</li>
            <li> the shipping and everything was awesome, got this super fast.  Now for the product, it&#x27;s ok, not sure about all the hype, i have heard this is the best eyelash curler.  Again, it&#x27;s ok. i try using it on my bare eyelashes and it doesn&#x27;t do much, it works better for me with a bit of mascara on.  Again, it&#x27;s ok, not amazing for me.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a fake. This arrived today and I was surprised at the low quality (and we are talking eyelash curlers...).  So I compared it to my old one and noticed the font was different. I thought it could be an updated look, but then I turned over the silicone part and it did not have shu uemura printed on it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as good a job as others that are much less expensive. And to top it off, you can&#x27;t buy refills for the silicone pad.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk knockoff.  The hinge is loose and flimsy.  I regret not reading more reviews before I purchased this.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Curler looks exactly the same as other shu umuera curlers I have bought in the past, but the pad is different, doesn&#x27;t have the logo on the bottom and is much stiffer silicone. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as ones I have bought from shu umueras website.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is the best curler ever! It doesn&#x27;t pinch and you eyelashes look great. Will never use any other!</li>
            <li> An excellent eyelash curler. The silicone pads are not as nice as I would like, but I found one that LASTS really well and together they make a good addition to my make up collection</li>
            <li> KNOCK-OFF. I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura curlers for 20 years. This is a fake and it&#x27;s being returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for many years and needed to get a replacement rubber pad. Couldn&#x27;t find one so I purchased another Shu Uemura curler. Some others here said they didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brand. I indeed received the real thing, so can easily recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> It worked ok but I have one from tarte and I like that even better.</li>
            <li> Years ago I learned that this Shu Umera eyelash curler was like no other and now they are hard to find in the US. Do not try another brand because this is the one to have!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a great eyelash curler.  I bought the MAC one and winded up returning it when I received this one.  Love it!!!! I liked that the Seller shipped it fast too.</li>
            <li> This was a fake. Disappointed so I returned the two I purchased.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these, not long enough to fit all my eye lashes in.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever!</li>
            <li> It is as if I received a different one than everyone else is raving about.  It felt flimsy and the hinge part squishes into my cheek when I try to curl my eyelashes, preventing me from getting a good position to curl.  I guess I could put up with that if it worked, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference at all with my lashes.  Apparently, it works for some people, but not for me.  I have been using the plain Jane Sally Hansen &amp;#34;flirty eyes&amp;#34; drugstore curler, but was hoping this new curler would hold the curl longer.  Sadly, it didn&#x27;t make any curl at all, so I am going to have to be satisfied with my old one---it may not hold the curl all day, but at least it curled (and the hinge part doesn&#x27;t squish into my face).</li>
            <li> Still not convinced it&#x27;s everything You Tubers say it is.</li>
            <li> I was sorry I bought this product, as it didn&#x27;t work ANY BETTER than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, less expensive eyelash curlers you can find in stores like CVS, etc.</li>
            <li> The BEST eyelash curler out there and I&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> perfect addition to anyone&#x27;s cosmetic tools!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler. It was purchased s a gift for someone</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the box it comes in was damaged once I received it due to poor packaging on behalf of the sender. Fortunately, nothing happened to the product. I was pleased with my purchase and would do it all over again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this eyelash curler to be anything special.  In fact, I like my Maybelline eyelash curler much better.  This one curls my outer lashes, but not any others.  Actually, it pinched my outer lashes &amp; now they have all broken off.  Not worth the $ in my opinion.  BTW, the extra pad they give you doesn&#x27;t fit the curler.  It&#x27;s too short...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura&#x27;s eyelash curler for years and the minute I grabbed the box I instantly knew it was fake. I&#x27;ve even compared the curler to the ones I have and it was completely different.</li>
            <li> This item is  a counterfeit, I have been buying this curler for over 15 years. The box was opened the product inside was unwrapped, the material cheap and the logo did not match. I have current one that I even used to compare. Very disappointed. Should have read the reviews, contacted Amazon and their response was to investigate.</li>
            <li> this really does curl your lashes as opposed to bend them.  the mechanism is smooth and gentle on your lashes.  i would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Now I understand why everyone raves about this. My short and straight lashes always stay up! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shu uemura eyelash curler for years.  It was time for replacement purchase.  I believe this to be authentic.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye lash curler that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best brand on the market!</li>
            <li> Worked good first couple of time and now it doesn&#x27;t even hardly curl my eyelashes. Not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many eyelash curlers and this is by far the best I have found. My eyelashes grow straight out - i mean super straight! This curler doesn&#x27;t pinch and the curl lasts all day! Worth every penny. Unfortunately - my only negative is that there are no refills - once you&#x27;ve used the 2 that are in the package it&#x27;s time to buy a whole new curler :(</li>
            <li> Looks fake. Feels fake. I think it&#x27;s fake. The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t look like the quality is there. Not surprised when you look at the price you got.</li>
            <li> The best in the world and I can only find it online.  I hope they never stop making it or I would be lost.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gentle on your lashes with long lasting results! Best curler for me!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my eyes&#x27; shape or something. Switched to a Revlon curler that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> Best tool I&#x27;ve ever used for makeup. Works in less that 2 seconds!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyelash curler of all times!</li>
            <li> The best curler ever! Add a hair dryer for a little heat, amazing results!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look so much longer! Is totally pain-free, too. I&#x27;ll be buying some more for all the women in my family for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best eyelash curler you can buy.  It gives you lashes a wonderful curl not just a bend.</li>
            <li> Based on another reviewer&#x27;s advice, I bought this eyelash curler on the Shu Eumura website for $19.00 which is the same price if not cheaper than some other sellers here. Also, you get to choose a free sample product. It gives me a piece of mind knowing that I bought a genuine product and not a fake one. It&#x27;s sad that at a quick glance, you only see that this product got an avg of 3 out of 5 stars b/c of the fakes being sold.</li>
            <li> Believe the hype people.  This is the best eyelash curler. My last one broke after 10 years.  I had to get another one asap.  It works on all different cultures of lashes, and when my lashes are going all crazy - sometimes it happens....this instrument whips them back in shape.&lt;br /&gt;BEST curler ever.</li>
            <li> Shu Umemura Eyelash Curler was recommended to me by my best friends and family. It actually works even if you just got out of the shower and your eyelashes are too wet, or if you had to remove all of your eyemakeup for some reason, it still curls very well (a recent mascara, eyeshadow, and eyeliner application). I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> These curl the lash very well, and feel comfortable to hold. An extra rubber insert was provided. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love how well it lasts and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Shu Uemera curler. It isn&#x27;t anything like the real thing. You might as well go to CVS and pay $6.00 for a better eyelash curler or order the real thing from the company website.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;lovely\\&quot;. the perfect present for my little girl  the color the size all is perfect, im really happy when i see use</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money buying any other eyelash curler.  This one is like magic and it&#x27;s all you need</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have used so far!</li>
            <li> Beat eyelash curler ever!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler ever!!!!  It curls without pinching and  the fit is sturdy in your hand for a skilled and safe curl.</li>
            <li> I have the real one from when shu uemura sold in the US and compared it.  It appears the same in size and quality.</li>
            <li> I love this! Such a great curler and you can&#x27;t find this is any store in the US. Def worth it!</li>
            <li> If you go to the Shu Uemura USA website, you can definitely order this curler and make sure it&#x27;s the real thing.  I didn&#x27;t see any recent reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure how to look for them, so I thought I&#x27;d tell everyone in case they still believe they can&#x27;t get the greatest eyelash curler ever.  They even have the newer Japanese design with the open sides for smaller and more precise attention available.</li>
            <li> What is up with eye lash curlers? I think that manufactures are no making them with a deliberate need to hold via a certain angle in order to get your eyelash to curl.  Use to love, love, love SHU UEMURA but the frame has  changed. Similar to Lancôme eye lash curler where an associate informed me that you have to angle it out to have a better curl effect.  its just awkward.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler ever but getting harder and harder to find!!! Especially rubber replacements.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of mixed reviews on here, many from about 2010-11 bemoaning receipt of a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; curler.  That problem seems to be past now going by most recent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curler came from vendor \\&quot;effective shop japan\\&quot; and I&#x27;d say I got the real deal.  The curler itself was an insane $4 and change, while the shipping brought the total up to $21.  It arrived well packaged- the small inner box was packed in another heavier cardboard box with newspaper for padding.  The newspaper was in Japanese, and the mailing stickers on the box indicated shipment from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white inner box was stylish and looked authentic.  The bag inside held the curler, and another tiny ziplock bag with an extra replacement black silicone pad.  Directions for use were on the inner box, along with a few tips.  The silver curler had an authentic looking Shu Uemura engraving on it and seemed tight and well sprung.  The replacement pad was similarly stamped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight to the mirror I went.  I have very fine lashes on deep-set eyes.  In the past my problem with curlers was that they were hard to get in deep and close enough to grasp the lashes at the base, and even when maneuvering as best as possible, at least three attempts per eye were needed to get all the lashes (not just the majority at the center) by doing center, inner, and then outer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This baby was a different story.  It must be how the product is angled away from the face, and the curve of the pad.  I could get the curler right in close to the base of my lashes, and I didn&#x27;t need to make multiple attempts to get it lined up - before squeezing down, I could see ALL my lashes sticking through the curler.  One gentle, sustained squeeze later, ALL my lashes were curled from corner to corner.  Beautiful!  The other eye went as well.  I did not need to do as suggested, by pulling back and doing a second squeeze at the middle of the lashes, and another at the tips, because one good line up did enough, and very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One funny bonus... I had stopped using curlers because they were such a hassle, and now that I have one that works simply, and I use it regularly, I can actually SEE better!  I had not realized how much my drooping lashes had been cutting into my field of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had really wondered if I was buying into a myth by paying $20 for an eyelash curler that might be got at a drugstore for far less, but I am wondering no more.  Very glad I took a chance and shelled out for this.</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler ever!  Curl is very smooth and natural, unlike many that kink or bend eyelashes.  Fits the curvature of the eye perfectly, therefore curling every lash from end to end.  Very sorry I cannot find it in retail stores any longer in the U.S.  so glad I was able to find it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thing without reading any reviews - STUPID. I have doubts that this is a genuine Shu eyelash curler, but seeing as I&#x27;ve never owned one, I&#x27;m unsure. I would just order one from the Shu Uemura website if I were you!</li>
            <li> I have Asian blood (bout 25%) so my eyelashes are not very long. But it&#x27;s not too much of a worry as long as I have this fantastic curler. It&#x27;s very easy to use and grip and curls my lashes perfectly. I just pinch, count to 10, and voila! curled lashes all day with or without mascara. But of course I prefer wearing mascara for added volume.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what other reviewers promised.  Is sturdy and well functioning.</li>
            <li> So I have been searching high and low for a curler that will actually curl my straight eyelashes...I have read that this is number 1 several times so I finally decides to splurge and get it and thank God I did! Amazing! I have a very important tip...only use WATERPROOF mascara if you don&#x27;t your lashes will weigh down and become straight. This eyelash curler keeps your lashes curled the entire day I&#x27;m shocked amazed and happy!!!! Buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!  It Is the best curler I have ever tried:) Jessica alba suggested it in her new book the honest life. She was totally accurate it is the bet curler on the market!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use to get this brand all the time. I loved it. these ones I just ordered from amazon hardly open so I can&#x27;t even use them.I would not recommend these to anyone. thank you Ms. Lehman</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler I have ever used in my 40 years of wearing make-up.  I hope they never stop producing it!</li>
            <li> The shu uemura eyelash curler is my favorite. But the one I have received was a defect. The clasp was not working and seemed like someone had used it and broke it. Thank you very much for sending me a broken product I just adore that. Now I have to buy from another seller and wait a long time for it.</li>
            <li> Shu has they Cadillac of all eye lash curlers!&lt;br /&gt;This is the best, hands down. I will only use a SHU curler</li>
            <li> Looks like this vendor changed what they were shipping because my two Shu Uemura eyelash curlers appear to be the real thing.  They both have the shu uemura stamp on the rubbery pads - it is faint but it is there.  They actually appear to have come through customs from Japan.  Seems ok to me.</li>
            <li> Worth the price but did not come with any replacement rubber seal&lt;br /&gt;Does curl well not sure yet how long that will last.&lt;br /&gt;I was told they don&#x27;t sell rubber insert and you have to buy the entire curler again once that is no longer good.</li>
            <li> I took it out of the box and threw it away. I have a 10 dollar Sally Hansen lash curler that is better quality. You get what you pay for //sigh.</li>
            <li> The slant of the curler takes a bit of getting used to. I pinched my eyelid a few times. It also doesn&#x27;t feel like all your lashes fit into curler. I do love the cushion of the silicone curling pad. Still on the fence if it&#x27;s any different than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyelash curler for years. It is one of the best on the market.. Try it!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler. No need to use any other one. You will love it after the first use. Heat it up with a hair dryer and really curl your lashes!!</li>
            <li> For my think asian lashes, I think this eyelash curler does a good job in keep my lashes curled. I have only tried Revlon and Shu Uemura, so view might be skewed. However, with the pricing and the fast shipping. The Shu Uemura is a great choice. There are those that have thin and sparse lashes and there are those who have thick lashes that are stick straight. That&#x27;s me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with (2) rubber replacers. I try my best to take care of it by wiping the metal and rubber after each use, so that there isn&#x27;t any residue that latches on. It does hold the curl with the right mascara. Doesn&#x27;t blow me away, but definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> THIS EYELASH CURLER WAS ALSO A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER AND SHE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT AND TRIED TO CURL EVERYONES LASHES.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is by far one of the best; with the right mascara your eyelashes stay curled all day. I love it and will continue to purchase through Amazon (Sephora no longer carries it)</li>
            <li> These transform my lashes to where I occasionally get asked if they&#x27;re false- a compliment in my opinion. Can&#x27;t recommend enough, it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on buying here. I thought this curler was better than most.</li>
            <li> I have had a Shu uemura curler in the past, and this one didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> This Eyelash Curler is amazing!!! It literally makes your eyelashes stand straight up. They only reason I have it 4 starts if because the amazing effect doesn&#x27;t last long after about 5 uses it wasn&#x27;t as good but still very good</li>
            <li> Hands down THE best. It holds your curl throughout the day. I&#x27;ve always bought cheapies and finally found this one. I will never go back.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is very good but I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about.  I think a standard curler would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a good eye lash curler...heard it was the best thete is .... The cheaper ones are 100 times better</li>
            <li> Meh.  Feels harsh and stiff.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  I&#x27;ll just get the cheap one from the grocery store next time.</li>
            <li> Bought one in October, from Super Fast Shipping from JP, and  it was great, but I lost it.  Bought again this month, and not the same quality at all, I am returning it. The other one had some tension in the mechanism; this one has none; it does not curl. Vendor this time was West Trade Express; I think they may have bought from a bogus supplier. Another reviewer said the refill should have &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; stamped on the bottom - mine did not.</li>
            <li> best lash curl ata great price</li>
            <li> Beware, do not buy!  This is a total knockoff.  I&#x27;ve been using the Shu Uemura eyelash curler for over 12 years and noticed the difference immediately.  My mistake for thinking I was getting a deal and getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is clearly fake.  The quality isn&#x27;t even close to the Shu Uemura curler I lost.  I didn&#x27;t read reviews first.  Hope you did!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. Thanks</li>
            <li> Not very thrilled with this order.  I have used Shu Uemura curlers for years.  Not being able to buy them locally any longer, I turned to the internet.  First time I purchased with this company and the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order took over a month to arrive.  When I sent an email to the company asking why it was taking so long, they stated &amp;#34;Amazon doesn&#x27;t tell you we are shipping from Japan.&amp;#34;  Seriously?  I could mail almost anything within a week to Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality does not seem similar to my old curler.  The markings on the curler are slightly different and I feel like it may not be &#x27;authentic&#x27; Shu Uemura.  Does it work? Yes, but at that price, I could have bought a dozen drugstore curlers that would have worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Fake.  Pinches the skin around the eyes.  Doesn&#x27;t work very well and is NOT  a Shu Uemura.  A cheap imitation knock off.  Do NOT waste your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> Awesome eyelash curler!  This is the best curler that I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve tried a ton from Sephora!</li>
            <li> I heard that this was the best eyelash curler out there, so I decided to give it a try. Honestly, I don&#x27;t love it. I have a Sonia K eyelash curler that I bought from Target that I think works beautifully. I use the Sonia K one every day.</li>
            <li> metal thin, feels cheap. Had one with grips on finger tips in past which I liked better. Does a fair job curling.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent eyelash curler. The only one I&#x27;ve ever found that does not pull out my eyelashes. Also, this is not a fake curler- it&#x27;s a Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> Bought this without reading reviews. It&#x27;s a total knock off! Cheaply made, pinches eyelid and does not curl properly!!</li>
            <li> Super little eyelash curler, my old one just wore out. (Same brand) I ordered extra refill, they haven&#x27;t arrived yet, just better to have on hand than try to replace.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything dangerous? I feel people forget that everyone has different texture hair/eye lashes. I am asian mixed and it has not cut my eyelashes what so ever. Curls nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-Not very rounded, i have to really go around and curl the ends.&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly bent at one corner. :/ When it closes all the way one side stays just slightly open, it is very saddening. Be wary if you buy this online.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I have heard this is THE BEST eyelash curler ever. Having had the SHUSHEIDO eyelash curler in the past, which used to be THE BEST, I was eager to be upgrading to the SHU UEMURA eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Due to the reviews for this product and the claims that this eyelash curler may be an imitation, I decided to order directly from the shu uermura website. I ordered 3, due to them discontinuing the item (and for free shipping - LOL). Anyway, got the product yesterday, and it does a HORRIBLE JOB curling! It basically does NOTHING. So whether this is an imitation or not, the one I purchased was the original, and I found it far inferior to any eyelash curler I have ever used. Very disappointed. Going to go to the Shusheido makeup counter to get one of those again. Shusheido by far has the best eyelash curler!!!</li>
            <li> cleansing oil is good.  eslow is just as good and cheaperwill probably not order again but will stick with eslow.</li>
            <li> It works but not any better than a much cheaper eye lash curler you can get at Target or Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> greatest eyelash curler ever owned, even purchased one for my daughter for Christmas, was recommended from a make-up artist and she loved it also</li>
            <li> I noticed some negative reviews about this being fake after I had already ordered it. Mine is GENUINE and I went through the checklist [...]&lt;br /&gt;go to this website and you will be able to tell. This is the best eyelash curler I have ever used. It really opens your eye!</li>
            <li> The genuine article!  This is my favorite eyelash curler. Thank you!  LT</li>
            <li> this is my favorite curler by far.  It is the second one I have bought, the first lasted several years.  I have tried other brands and just wasnt happy--either didnt curl well or pinched the lid too easily.  This brand is perfect</li>
            <li> for a reason ...this one works!!! Its very difficult to find now in samller cities, like mine,  since major retailers are not carrying it .  YES...strong Rec!</li>
            <li> I have bought this curler for YEARS. I have never pinched my eyelid and it curls my lashes easily. The curl also lasts a long time.It comes with an extra rubber insert as well.  It used to be available at Ulta and Sephora but now it&#x27;s only exclusive online. I bought this as a gift for a friend who has never used an eyelash curler and she loves it.</li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li> My lashes seem to hold its curl all day! Love it! Although a little on the pricey side it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent curler. It is not really different than the other brands; it&#x27;s just a good eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The best eye lash curler I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> Love it. Really works well.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Love my shu uemura eyelash curler! Fast delivery! Highly recommended seller! One happy customer here😊</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these on Amazon, but was so upset when I got it. This is without a doubt fake, and I&#x27;m SO disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned three Shu Uemura curlers in the last 10 years (cheaper to buy the curler with refill than refills). One was purchased at the Shu Uemura shop in SF when it was still here years ago, and the other two from a department store in Tokyo, Japan when I was there a few years ago. I&#x27;ve compared this one with two of my old Shu curlers I own (both of which are exactly identical) and here are just the differences I&#x27;ve noticed after comparing them for a minute:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The REAL curlers are slightly smaller than this one, in both length and width;&lt;br /&gt;2) The REAL curlers&#x27; metal pieces do not raffle when you shake it like this one does;&lt;br /&gt;3) The REAL curlers never squeaks when you open and close the curlers like this one does;&lt;br /&gt;4) The REAL curlers has a slightly flatter round curve compared to this curler;&lt;br /&gt;5) When used, the REAL curlers actually curl my lashes and never crimps and bend them like this one does; and&lt;br /&gt;6) The REAL curler&#x27;s silicone pads has the raised words &amp;#34;Shu Uemura&amp;#34; along the inside of the curler, which this one does not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a FAKE folks! DON&#x27;T ORDER IT! The reason it&#x27;s half the price is because it is not a genuine Shu Uemura. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and ordered this one because I had run out of pad refills. You get what you pay for. When I took it out of the box it looked different to me immediately. The Font and shape looked different than usual. I thought that perhaps it was an updated font. Used it anyway. Pulled eyelashes out, which has never happened to me with a genuine Shu Uemera. As it is the holiday time, I&#x27;ve been busy, so I  just got around to researching now. I Googled &amp;#34;Fake Shu Umeura Eyelash Curler&amp;#34; and found sites that help you in spotting the fakes. I then compared the SU I already have and confirmed that the new one is a knock-off. I am returning it for a full refund and springing the extra $10 for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler on earth.</li>
            <li> always the best...shu uemura</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler hands down! I have board straight eyelashes and this is the best! Can&#x27;t live without my SU eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference between the Shu Uemura and Maybelline.  What&#x27;s nice is you get the extra  rubber replacement.  Last time I bought one several years ago it didn&#x27;t come with that.  And surprisingly, it&#x27;s the same price.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and packaged accordingly.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this based on all the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad i did. my eye lashes stay up and curled through out the day. great eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> This curler is a cut above your drugstore curler, it is soft and gentle on the lashes but very effective.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used. Took a while to ship from Japan, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Fantastic eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and I love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good! Eyelashes are easily curled.</li>
            <li> My last Shu Uemura curler lasted from when I was 17 to now...Im 31. And that&#x27;s with the same pad. So needless to say, they&#x27;re worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> I lost my old Shu Uemura eyelash curler after about 10 years. Ordered this one and I don&#x27;t know if the quality has just changed in the past 10 years or what, but this seemed chintzy and felt very different from my originals (I had gone through 2-3). The silicone pad also seems different and did not curl my lashes the same as my old curler (which makes me question the authenticity of this product). Luckily I found my old one...if the new curlers are all made like this, I will sadly have to find a new brand of eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected but still ok.</li>
            <li> These are my very first set of eyelash curlers and I am very happy with them. Very easy to use and they do their job well.</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve used--have purchased several of these for myself and&lt;br /&gt;for others, as gifts.  I use it daily, with great results.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed when this item became unavailable in retail stores.  Tried several other premium brands.  This is the only curler that reaches my lashes evenly, fits my lash line, and doesn&#x27;t pull out lashes.</li>
            <li> not all eyelash curlers are shaped the same (who knew?) this brand is shaped much better for Asian shaped eyes and works much better to get all the lashes curled</li>
            <li> Curls easily and naturally without damaging your lashes. I would recommend it to anyone who curls their eyelashes. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Once you use this curler, you will never be able to go back to another kind.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about the design but it curls your lashes in one use instead of having to do it twice.</li>
            <li> This curls the eyelashes really well and does not pull and tug on them.  It gives a really nice curl.</li>
            <li> This is the very best eyelash curler on the planet. I have used them for many years and would never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> This curler came highly recommended so I purchased one and I&#x27;m glad I did. It lives up to the hype. No pinching of eyelid skin and a good curl with little effort</li>
            <li> Was advertised as a top eyelash curler.  Does not curl half as good as others I have tried and they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is one of the best eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve used. Doesnt pinch at all. My eyelashe&#x27;s stayed curled all day. I would buy this curler again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an eyelash curler for many years--always dreading it...UNTIL the Shu Uemura!! Now I actually look forward to it! So easy to use, and it gets EVERY eyelash including the far outside eyelashes. It works in seconds! I warm mine up, slightly, with my blow dryer to make it work even faster! Love, love, LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Since sephora stopped selling these, I&#x27;ve tried a few others.. nothing compares to this curler.  Curls quickly and easily.. just wish it came with more rubber replacements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and this one tops them all! Works great, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t poke my eye.</li>
            <li> This is my second eyelash curler from Shu Uemura.  I have used eyelash curlers since I started wearing make up over 35 years ago and this product is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This is without any shadow of a doubt a fake Shu Uemura eyelash curler.  It is made of a much lighter, cheaper metal and it jangles when moved around.  It comes from some seller in Las Vegas with a business name completely different from the store name posted on Amazon... Very shady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your time, money, and efforts and order directly from the brand&#x27;s US website or try Shiseido&#x27;s eyelash curler.  Shiseido&#x27;s version is very good and is being distributed out to the US so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it running out and coming across contraband.</li>
            <li> This curler is great!  However you can&#x27;t buy replacement cushions.  I tried using another brand of refills but it wasn&#x27;t the same. They say you have to buy an entire new curler.  However, $20 a year for this eyelash curler is still worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used Shu uemera curlers for years, but now can&#x27;t find them in the U.S. This one is completely fake and a bad knock off. DO NOT BUY!!! How disappointing......</li>
            <li> Does not not even curl tight like it should feels broken</li>
            <li> This is easily the best eyelash curler on the market. The only thing that sucks is that there are NO REFILLS for the rubber pieces.  Total scam. Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Best.. eyelash curler... EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Shu Uemura curler I&#x27;ve had for years. I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement inserts for my old one, so I just bought a new one. This is definitely not as wide as my old one and I have a problem getting all of my eyelashes in it at once. (I also do not have tons of lashes, just a long eye I guess. I held the pad refill up to my old one and it was a cm or so shorter.) I wish they had labeled sizes or different options, until then I&#x27;ll just suffer!</li>
            <li> Works great like the real ones</li>
            <li> will buy this curler over and over again.</li>
            <li> Not a shu umbra ...no way.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the Shu Uemura eyelash curler I purchased direct from the retailer in the past. The edges are too high and sharp and dig into my eye and it&#x27;s not as smooth when curling as my original. Just feels cheap. Definitely not the same.</li>
            <li> I gave it a two because ive had a shu before for about two yrs and I bought this one for its price (mine had shot up a bit where i normally get it) crossing my fingers that this would be just as good and when I tried it, the curl didnt even stay for but maybe 4 hrs..its not even a hot day no humidity so im very dissapointed...just ordering the more expensive one</li>
            <li> i have quite a collection of curlers. but this one is by far the best product. great curl that lasts</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. After buying countless crappy drugstore eyelash curlers, I finally found the perfect one! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it!! She says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s for Asian eyes&amp;#34; lol. It&#x27;s not so rounded so you can get it closed to your eyelids. So anyone with Asian eyes should get this one.</li>
            <li> My wife says this is &amp;#34;by far the best&amp;#34;.  &amp;#34;Curls lashes quickly and easily&amp;#34;.  Resent that Amazon needs more words for this review than what I said in the first sentence.</li>
            <li> Not original!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: E-SONIC</li>
            <li> Mine was a fake as well. I thought maybe I was imagining stuff, but the other reviewers confirmed it for me. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfectly balanced, even the smallest eyelashes curl with ease-- and no pinching! Simple to use, simple to keep clean and to change the pads.</li>
            <li> Out performs my shiseido eyelash curler! It really lifts and curls well, as I tend to have big eyes with long eyelashes that angle down toward the eye rather than curling upward naturally. A great eyelash curler is a necessity for me,as cheaper curlers tend to either rip out my lashes or fail to capture all the lashes in the crimping process. A big plus is that you don&#x27;t have to look down and crimp hard to get that perfect lift and curl, just a light press and you are done. I am so relieved to find the perfect curler for big wide eyes with long eyelashes, so that even the outer corners are included instead of getting bunched up and matted with an awkward crimp.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyelash curler on the market.  Your eyelashes curl easily and stayed curled all day!</li>
            <li> Never had much luck with eyelash curlers- my lashes are already fairly curly but have stubborn ones at the ends that like to lay straight for some reason. Other curlers would crimp the lashes, not really give it that nice, smooth curl, but this one actually did that. Read the reviews before ordering and glad I went with this purchase- it makes my lashes really stand out more than before (before applying mascara) and some days I don&#x27;t wear mascara at all, just curl my lashes. It looks like I have a light coat of mascara on. My daughter borrows it and loves the effect on her lashes, too. Great product!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Revlon curler you can find in stores. It was ok. But once I tried this I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to those cheap eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler. I think it does the best job&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was prompt and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s way too expensive and seriously not that special. Kinda disappointed. I&#x27;ll stick to drugstore versions! Just okay.</li>
            <li> I did like it a lot but it didn&#x27;t come with one extra silicone refill and thats why i gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I never knew there were other options out there!  For years I&#x27;ve been using drugstore eyelash curlers only to be disappointed time and time again with their performance.  But not this baby!  Out of the box it has been eye opening!  Pardon the pun ;-) but really, I never knew my eyelashes could curl this well!  And keep the curl!  I was apprehensive to order it based on the other reviews I read about it not being authentic, but since I never tried a Shu Uemura curler, I had nothing to compare it to.  I couldn&#x27;t care less about its authenticity, this thing is fabulous!  I highly, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This curls my lashes better than any curler I have ever used. I bought more as gifts! The curl lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This curler is easy to use and curls eyelashes beautifully. After using this, you will never go back to drugstore curlers, and it&#x27;ll last you years anyway, so why not invest? My only complaint is that the curl doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours, but I&#x27;ve never had a curler that made curls last that long anyway. I hear it helps to heat it up under a hairdryer before use; I don&#x27;t because I&#x27;m afraid of burning myself. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; Anyway, this eyelash curler has been voted the best for years for a REASON! You cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Not the quality of my original shu uemera.  Does not curl as well and it is not as well built.</li>
            <li> I first tried a Shu Uemura eyelash curler about 15 years ago when a friend worked for L&#x27;Oreal (they own Shu Uemura) and fell in love with it straight away. It curls my lashes beautifully and never snags them. I did stray a couple of times because this curler is hard to find in stores but I always come back because nothing works as well</li>
            <li> It works best of any curler I&#x27;ve used and continues to do so. THe shipping was fast and appreciated since there is no retail outlet for purchasing this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this purchase.  When compared to my previous Shu Uemura eyelash curler, the craftsmanship was completely different.  It feels flimsy, while my older Shu Uemura curler seems more solid.  The weight is also different in the two and when I crimp, the feel is not what I feel it should be.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of them!  One for my home and an extra for travel!  My eye lashes really curl well with this curler!  Well made, and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Best Eyelash curler on the market.  I was sad when Sephora stopped selling it but so happy Amazon has it.  Been using it for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it makes much of a difference compared to a decent drug store one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is the high end Shu Umeura curler that I have heard about.  The one I received is small, cheaply made, and does not do a good job of curling my eyelashes.  It pinches, pulls, and doesn&#x27;t give a good curl.  Seems like a cheap metal, maybe a knock off?</li>
            <li> This is no longer sold in the us so I had to wait awhile but it was worth it. Only curler I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bend lashes. If they only sold the little rubber insert separately I would have purchased 10 of them and not needed an entirely new curler. Sadly you have to buy a new curler every time the insert wears out. It does come with one extra.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler in my opinion. I have tried so many....brand name and drugstore and this consistently beats them all. I always go back to my trusted Shu Uemura curler. It comes with an extra rubber so this will last you some time. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My friend who is a beauty products enthusiast recommended this Japanese curler as the best in the world (as did the internet), so I decided to try. I&#x27;m not an eyelash curler expert &amp; have only owned a cheap one before this, but I am very satisfied! It&#x27;s pretty straight forward, it gets all the lashes, &amp; I feel like my eyelashes look much longer &amp; really let my eyes shine. Because of this, I&#x27;ve stopped using eyeliner and instead just use mascara (CG Lash Blast 24).</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler that does not grab your eyelid. It works great. I just wish it was sold in stores and that you can get refills. I had to buy a whole new one just because I needed a refill.</li>
            <li> I excepted a lot from this curler since it&#x27;s suppose to be the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; and there&#x27;s a lot of hype about it. However, I didn&#x27;t find it all that special. It&#x27;s just okay, not amazing and didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> Its a counterfeit, DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> best eye lash curler, does the trick</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler on the market.</li>
            <li> Best eye leash cutler made in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I finally got it late...side was bent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shu Uemura eyelash curlers for years and this recent purchase may very well be a knock off.  It&#x27;s 100% my fault for not contacting the seller as my window of time already closed on this item last week. Unfortunately, I wanted someone else to see and use it before I did a review.  What I&#x27;ve noticed it how awkward this particular curler is to use yet it&#x27;s advertised as exactly what I purchased a few years ago.  The piece that goes against your eye is not as small as my other Shu Uemura which means you can actually pinch your eye area if you&#x27;re not careful. The silicone base where you do the pressure curl is hard.  And I mean hard.  No cushion effect whatsoever.  I&#x27;ve come away with some interesting red lines on the side of my eyes.  I&#x27;ll be getting rid of this product and rather unhappy I can&#x27;t contact the seller now.  With all the knock-offs appearing on the market now, I honestly believe, as does the other person who uses this same product regularly, that this one is not the real item.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Thought the quality was cheap, not a fan</li>
            <li> The only eyelash curler you need in your life</li>
            <li> Favourite eyelash curler ever. Don&#x27;t forget to change the silicone pad once a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake. I compared it with the REAL Shu Uemura eyelash curler I bought years ago and this one is a cheap imitation with the Shu Uemura simply printed on it. The bevels do not even touch evenly on the curling pad. This looks likes a cheap curler anyone can buy from the dollar store. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> It is very good. I have very short eyelash. It can curve them and does not hurt my skin. I like it!</li>
            <li> The BEST EYELASH CURLER recommended by my 2 make-up artist friends who are stylists on huge shoots (vogue, Elle, Nylon mag,...) and tons of celebrities. They both use this one and recommended it to me.  One explained how it changes the look of your lash closer to the base and is angled in such a way that it bends your eyelashes up higher and &amp;#34;harsher&amp;#34; so they stay and make your lashes look HUGE.  Totally true.  Totally awesome.  Glad I got. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I only use Shu Uemura curlers.  Nothing else compares to them.  They fit in the eye and do the job without pinching.  This one is perfect.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler was a bit expensive but it actually works! I have always had long straight eyelashes and no matter how much I curl them, they ended up straight. With these curlers, you curl them once and they stay curled...even the next day! My Mom tried them and ended up buying them for herself and all her sisters. If you&#x27;ve always wanted great eyelashes, it&#x27;s definitely worth splurging on!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t get all the hype about this - it doesn&#x27;t seem that different from my much cheaper Revlon lash curler. am i missing something?</li>
            <li> I have turned into a huge fan of this product. I quickly learned that not all eyelash curlers are created equal! Only takes a few seconds to use and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull. The curl is very natural. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve found.  I will only use this brand!  It is not always easy to find.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a makeup artist on Utube, who I follow and it is bigger than your regular curler, I do think you will like this item.  I am glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> I wore my other Shu Uemura curler out so I ordered another one.  This new one is a poorer quality.  It has sharp edges and doesn&#x27;t squeeze evenly on both sides.  I think their quality control has slipped.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. Multiple reviews claim it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> No better or worse than the Maybelline one that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> I have owned several eyelash curlers and this is the best by far. It I very comfortable to use. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Instant difference in your lashes  I have tried a few, this one is amazing</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. Very disappointing for that price.</li>
            <li> truly awful.  not well made.  metal curler portion dips into a middle cut in the rubber bottom...which effectively &amp;#34;trims&amp;#34; eyelashes...yikes.  Went out and bought a Shiseido at Nordstroms.</li>
            <li> I believe this item was used. The actual eyelash curler is worn and was provided in a box two new silicone refills. When using, the metal touched when clasping. It felt very worn out. Eyelashes do not stay curled for more than 2 hours. I am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this one isn&#x27;t as good as the first Shu Uemura I purchased last year from another vendor. It does not curl my lashes very well (some stay straight, others curl) and they do not stay curled. Additionally, this curler must contain nickel because I started getting an eyelid rash after using this curler and it didn&#x27;t go away until I made the connection that the rash was from the curler and I stopped using it...rash gone.</li>
            <li> This is my fave eye curler I&#x27;m so sad they are not making it anymore, so get it while it lasts!</li>
            <li> definitely fake, but does the job. hasn&#x27;t pulled out any of my lashes yet, haha.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post comments/reviews but this is not an authentic Shu Uemura eyelash curler! I have been using the Shu Uemura eyelash curler for years and won&#x27;t use any other curlers. I decided to order this product through this seller on Amazon to see if this was the real thing, and also ordered one on Shu Uemura&#x27;s website for comparison. I received both items and this is definitely not the real thing. Athough the eyelash curlers look similar at first glance there are some slight differences (I also used an old Shu Uemura curler I had on-hand for the comparison). The biggest difference of course is how they curl the lashes. This fake one doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes as well as the real one, actually, it barely curls them at all!!! Buy the real thing if you really want to get true Shu Uemura results.</li>
            <li> its the firs curler I&#x27;ve had and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is really one of the best that I have found.</li>
            <li> Not as good as original curler that was recalled. Never had a problem with that one. Used it for 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> Have loved these curlers for years. They seem to be the only ones that fit my eye well enough to a grip on all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Best Curler ever, I use no other brand ever.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler out there!</li>
            <li> Came dirty and the package was open. But it doesn&#x27;t look broken and it still works.</li>
            <li> The silicone was very hard. Needed to use 4 times to get lashes to curl. I am going back to my old Maybelline. Save your money... this is no good! Must not be the real thing... can&#x27;t imagine Nordstrom&#x27;s selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought a Custom Grip Lash Curler by Revlon for under $5.00 from Walmart. It works almost as good as my old Maybelline. Since I cannot find the original refills for my old Maybelline, I needed something.</li>
            <li> Best eye lash curler!!</li>
            <li> Best curler out there, easy to clean and works very well.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever owned. Painless. One click is all you need to do. Eyelashes stayed curled after applying mascara for hours.</li>
            <li> Knockoff.  Could have gotten a crappy one from Walmart and it would be better</li>
            <li> Works but it&#x27;s either fake or the American production is just not as good. A Friend brought me back one from actual JAPAN, and the quality is so much better and the tiny print on the curler next to the logo letters is &amp;#34;v&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;w&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve bought in the past from American based sellers.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these years ago, and just bought this second one so I can keep the first one in my travel bag. They&#x27;re the best eyelash curler around. It never pinches, and I love the rounded pad.</li>
            <li> I love it, once you use it, you will not be able to use anyone elses. I used to buy it in Nordstroms. I do not understand why they do not sell in the United States anymore. I am so happy that I found it here.</li>
            <li> Only curler that I can use because it fits the Asian eye better. Does not pull out my lashes nor does it pinch.</li>
            <li> I was faithful to this brand but it was moved out of the US several years ago.  I was elated to find it here on Amazon but it has either changed or is an imposter.  This purchase was worthless and I wish that I had asked for my money back.  Save your money and purchase another brand.  This  does not curl well at all, it takes a lot of effort and duration which is harsh on the lashes and the surrounding eye area.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good curler, I recommend Tarte, however I just purchased one from &amp;#34;Bella and Bear&amp;#34; which I absolutely LOVE.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is fantastic! It delivers what it promises! Easy to use and great to curl all those little eyelashes in the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li> This was the only curler that I loved.  I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or if getting it shipped changed the dynamics of the curler.  It still works better than any other, but it&#x27;s almost like it has been used.  The rubber insole has already come off and I&#x27;ve only used it one month.</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curler out there!</li>
