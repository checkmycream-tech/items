            <li> One of my favorite hair products!</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, and I often straighten but this makes my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps to protect your hair from damage by heated styling aids and leaves a nice shine. I have to say it does work better on short styled hair because with long hair it leaves it kind of stiff. I also love the smell. Much cheaper on Amazon than at a salon. It&#x27;s like 2 for the price of one.</li>
            <li> This product is very light. It has a good hold but does not make hair crunchy. I was at a salon when it was first put on my hair. I then went to Amazon to buy it cheaper and it was cheaper :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  I used once and haven&#x27;t tried it again.  At some point I may try again.   I still gave 3 stars because it really isn&#x27;t fair to give only 1 when I only tried it briefly as soon as it came and I hadn&#x27;t really washed my hair - it didn&#x27;t do too well it was sticky but even if it does actually work I first have to get over that smell.</li>
            <li> I have had this product used on my hair at salons but it does not seem to give me the same effect at home.</li>
            <li> My wife saw this in a salon for much higher cost and was reluctant to purchase it. Seeing it on Amazon we gave it a shot. She is very satisfied with the results of using this product and will purchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have naturally curly and fuzzy hair it makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li> great product leave my hair shining and smooth</li>
            <li> Great stuff at a great price for two!</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews in this product from other websites before purchasing, they were all positive so I was pretty excited. I was not disappointed. I shoulder length relaxed hair and u used this on wet hair before blowdrying and on dry hair before flat ironing and it left my hair so light! I sprayed it on my roots and they were ion straight in one pass! My hair felt so soft and had so much movement. I&#x27;m going to purchase 4 more of these because I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it to Ulta because I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.  I used it several times, and my hair just wasn&#x27;t affected by it.  It didn&#x27;t produce shine, didn&#x27;t make my hair soft, didn&#x27;t add body.  I think Alterna products are the best for my hair type.  (no, I don&#x27;t Rep for Alterna, I just love their bamboo dry oil because it DOES make my hair silkier, softer, more body and adds shine, and I also love their 10-in-1)</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Hair looks luxurious!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Excellent protection for my hair &amp; it smells good too.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this stuff! Holds great like a hairspray without the hair damage!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any difference if I use it or not .</li>
