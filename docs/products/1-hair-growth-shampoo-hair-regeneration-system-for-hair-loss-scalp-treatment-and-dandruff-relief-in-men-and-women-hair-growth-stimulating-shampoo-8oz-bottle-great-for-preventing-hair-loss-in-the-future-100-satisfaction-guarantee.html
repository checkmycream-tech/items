            <li>/&gt;Thinning hair and receding hairlines are problems that many individuals will experience.</li>
            <li>One hair loss shampoo that uses the latest science to address hair loss is PRI Formula 500 shampoo hair regeneration</li>
            <li>On top of that, it also uses ingredients that will increase the strength and thickness of hair.</li>
            <li>This will provide more scalp cover and the appearance of a fuller head of hair.</li>
            <li>any person that has tried hair restoration products knows, there is no one size fits all cure for this problem, so some people will get better results than others will.</li>
            <li>a well-designed hair regeneration system, you can give yourself a chance to restore hair growth and you can provide yourself with a better degree of scalp cover.</li>

            <li>My hair looks and feels thicker, and have more body.</li>
            <li>Refreshing feeling each and every time you use this product.</li>

            <li>What worried me most was my growing widow&#x27;s peak and receding hairline.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year and absolutely love it.  </li>

            <li>It has a cooling effect and makes my scalp feel clean and invigorated!  </li>
            <li>I wish I could have wrote a longer more detailed review, However I did not fully get to use this product because it came opened all all spilled/ crusted inside the box and bottle.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that my hair and scalp does look more filled in if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Seems like his hair are becoming fuller and thicker.</li>

            <li>It lathers easily and smells well</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong smelling.</li>
            <li>Some of the most popular and effective products on the current market are the hair loss shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t give a full review until more time has been given.</li>
            <li>still need more time to give this item a full review.</li>

            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing, is full of volume and strong.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, a lady told me she would ship out my free bottle as soon as I left a good review!!!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>I was really excited and looking forward to giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a month into using Formula 500 shampoo and my hair loss seems to have stopped - which makes this product worth it for me!</li>
            <li>Most people will see some results probably after the first month of using the system.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean &amp; some body is added even on these humid days.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I have noticed that my hair seems thicker, more manageable, and back to the way it was before I had my son.</li>
            <li>have noticed that my hair does look and feel fuller after using this special hair regeneration formula.</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;nt expect such results from this product based upon the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve liked it.  </li>
            <li>Formula 500 is the only system that effectively provides clinically studied ingredients in a precise ratio designed to reproduce results seen in relevant clinical studies.</li>
            <li>Along with being effective for restoring hair, it also works well for cleaning the hair and making it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure that it will regenerate my very damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I never though I&#x27;d have a full head of hair again until I tried this product.</li>
            <li>So I am looking forward for the full result of using this product.</li>
            <li>Just bought this product and so far it&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
            <li>had some problems with a damaged package due to the carrier but the Customer service was great and they  replaced to bottle.</li>
            <li>I was very let down because after reading so many great reviews</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to find a shampoo that made my hair look healthy and voluminous at the same time.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li>One of the great things about this shampoo that I really lie is that it lathers very well and after the wash it leaves the hair very soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and a nice fresh scent unlike a lot of others, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>or if he is one of the lucky ones that his hair is growing back on its own</li>
            <li>With the PRI Formula 500 shampoo hair regeneration system, you get a product that really stands up to the claims of its manufacturer and you really stand a good chance of seeing new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I use essential oils regularly and know that peppermint oil and saw palmetto are both very good for stimulating growth and stopping hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the Phoenix Rejuvenation Institute they work relentlessly to provide the consumer with only the highest potency, highest purity, and most effectively absorbed formulations available to the consumer</li>
            <li>Amazing how simple it was.</li>
            <li>(free bottle soon to be shipped to me thanks to the Formula500 folks)</li>
            <li>i am reordering today totally worth the price</li>
            <li>I have rarely noticed any hairs falling out when using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]]</li>
            <li>So far, I need to wait for more drastic result.</li>
            <li>I chose this more for the natural ingredients and the reviews, an added benefit no dandruff</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money or effort.  </li>
            <li>To start, it uses a group of nutrients and essential oils that have been shown to be effective for restoring hair growth and for promoting scalp health.</li>
            <li>The benefits are worth the price.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried something like this before its worth a try.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair you have strong and builds up to help make all future hair just as strong.</li>
            <li>I am using this shampoo right now.</li>
            <li>i use it then use mill creek right after because it makes my scalp feel rejuvenated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to keep my hair right where it is....</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that my review is biased.</li>
            <li>exclusively for those who seek exceptional results, Formula 500 is a highly concentrated two-stage formula containing essential oils, vitamins, nutrients and clinically studied extracts.</li>
            <li>so this could just be because I&#x27;ve been paying more attention to my hair in general.  </li>
            <li>I have a sticker in the shampoo bottle like I can get a new free bottle.</li>
            <li>Since being diagnosed with PCOS my hair has greatly thinned and I&#x27;ve been using various hair supplements, DHT blockers, and shampoos and overall wellness (</li>
            <li>It is great cause it actually works after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li>Really smells, USE TWICE as much, SUPER runny, like its all water, also NO Lather at all.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this is an effective product as well as a high quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>Obviously this is an effective product as well as a high quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.my only complaint is the amount you have to use to get a good lather, it takes a lot to get a good lather going..</li>
            <li>I like this product because it rinses clean and does stimulate new hair growth.</li>
            <li>It is rather thick and doesn&#x27;t lather that great.</li>
            <li>volume I get with this shampoo is intense though!</li>
            <li>My first time using this in 1week</li>
            <li>After 2 kids your hair doesn&#x27;t look shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>first it smells like medicine you put on the corns on your feet.. and that scares me...</li>
            <li>It does not however make my hair feel soft or smooth as I still need to use conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>first noticed the scent.</li>

            <li>Please answer me thanks!</li>
            <li>Male hair-loss is mostly about genetics, hormones, and what goes in to your body.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>I have problems with the hair on top of my head looking flat, oily, and lifeless.</li>
            <li>I love that it makes your hair feel soft and natural.</li>
            <li>I have kept my hair long in hopes I&#x27;d be able to find a solution</li>
            <li>so I am not really sure if this is good or not?</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and felt fine, the style fell out before I got back home despite the load of spray.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t see any new hair growth yet, although at age 58 I would be pretty surprised if I did this quickly - for example</li>
            <li>My hair is often very lifeless and this really kicks it up a notch.</li>
            <li>It is a very neutral scent and isn&#x27;t floral or woodsy.  </li>
            <li>this product really regenerated my hair.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any changes with the volume of my hair nor has helped me much on my dandruff.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer.</li>
            <li>Been growing so much hair that I turned into a werewolf.</li>
            <li>i have been using this shampoo for 2 MONTHS IS REALLY</li>
            <li>It feels and looks much fuller.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, consumers can find a range of different products that can help to address the issue of hair fall and thinning hair.</li>

            <li>She has shown thickening in areas of her hair that were really affected by alopecia.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because didn&#x27;t really like the odor</li>
            <li>It really helped my husband with dandruff</li>
            <li>May I have a free bottle to replacement the last one.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Formula 500.</li>
            <li>this shampoo really impresses me.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely reduces scalp flakes caused by using minoxidil, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have so much fall out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I donot really know whether it is just a nature recovery</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel thicker and very manageable.</li>
            <li>However, there hasn&#x27;t been any negative results which is a good sign.</li>

            <li>Wet your hair first and rub your scalp,then apply shampoo and rub it in all over hair.needs alot of water to suds up good,so add water in palm of hand onto your head and keep soaping up to get rich lather.</li>

            <li>Most advanced Therapy for thin hair, receding hair line and hair loss.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much difference so far.</li>

            <li>His scalp is clear and free from dandruff, his hair is very soft and shiny, and he&#x27;s starting to see new growth in areas.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much when I use it and keep it near my scalp</li>
            <li>I am now dandruff free,my hair is very shiny and soft now.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and I have notices that I am not losing as much hair in the shower and in my brush.</li>
            <li>I just started using and so far I have not seen any hair gain, but I understand that it will not happen  overnight, although I notice that after I used it, then when I  comb my hair, I notice that aren&#x27;t  falling much  than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Started using this product about two months ago, so far I don&#x27;t really have any complain about it.</li>
            <li>Contains a proprietary complex of vitamins and uniquely effective extracts designed for optimal results.</li>
            <li>If it seems to work I will be buying a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>have had for a few weeks and can see a better appearance and hold.  </li>
            <li>(not sure how much that helps) to help and use monoxidil most nights.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps the thickness of my hair intact even though it took some time for the hair to get used to the new shampoo.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t see any new hair till now</li>
            <li>My hair seems fuller and I do see new growth.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair easy to comb through and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a sticker that says \\&quot;get a free bottle by calling this number\\&quot; which redirects you to leaving fake positive feedback for a free bottle of junk.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>If I see any difference after applying it more often instead of my usual once or twice every 2 days.</li>
            <li>works to smooth my hair down without leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>:Product was provided for review, thank young new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair extremely manageable and looks so full.</li>
            <li>and I recently re-ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sensitive on shampoo since I have sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and lathers up so nice.</li>
            <li>I suppose you could say that it&#x27;s working because I&#x27;m not losing what little hair I have on top, but it&#x27;s not coming back or thickening either.</li>
            <li>This proprietary complex formula is designed to restore a natural state of healthy circulation to the follicles, resulting in noticeable growth as well as thicker, fuller hair.</li>
            <li>This really helps me get some of my thickness back</li>
            <li>I starting noticing some real results.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li>..can really say anything about hair grow because I&#x27;ve only used oce</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say that so far it seems to work well.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used this shampoo enough for results in that area</li>
            <li>really) bald spot started to grow some hair back</li>
            <li>- Grow your hair back fast.</li>
            <li>She has alopecia, and me, well my grandfather blessed me with a hair loss issue which began when I was young.</li>
            <li>I believe this shampoo helps with having a fuller look and leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>At my old age (45)</li>
            <li>To help with some people who said it doesnt lather well-i use a small amount at first, and let it sit for a bit, then wash it out and repeat-it lathers very well and doesnt take much.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement but will complete the use of it and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>Will definitely return in a few more weeks for an update.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>noting progress is a challenge, however, my hair grew faster and its a bit more thick.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair yet, but it has cut down on how much my hair sheds.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use the little bit left in the bottle but saw no changes since there was not enough.</li>
            <li>so I cannot attest to the long term results, but I have noticed that I am not losing as much hair.</li>
            <li>, I observe this morning with they same aww in surprised not much to loss my hair</li>
            <li>I really miss my long hair</li>
            <li>and I can see and feel new hairs coming up in the back.</li>
            <li>and I can see where Formula 500 is starting to fill this spot in with new hair.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s great to see my hair falling less and less everyday now.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t dry out my ends too much.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has really helped with my dry scalp problems .</li>
            <li>This is a mild formula that can be used everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what people will do to get free crap...</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, your hair emerges from the shower looking and feeling a little more voluminous and I am noticing fewer hairs falling out.  </li>
            <li>It is very important so he won&#x27;t be confused of his hair loss anymore.</li>
            <li>unique proprietary complex is designed to systematically restore natural hair growth in two stages, using both the shampoo and conditioner for maximum results.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I do seem to be shedding less, my hair is softer and less brittle and looks much better nourished.</li>
            <li>I was surprise to see a hair loss somewhere at the back part of my head, so I have been searching for something natural to help with the problem.</li>
            <li>This is my second time using the product after sadly deciding to cut off too much hair and I absolutely love it .</li>
            <li>but this has definitely helped so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprise to see a hair loss somewhere at the back part of my head, so I have been searching for  something natural to help with the problem.</li>
            <li>This not only helps to restore the possibility of growing new hair, but it also means that it takes measures to prevent further hair loss.</li>
            <li>third I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair same old same old...</li>
            <li>It clarifies really well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; like some other clarifiers do</li>
            <li>You start getting results fast and it is money well spent!</li>
            <li>You will have your hair growing back in no time and you will be back to being your old self.</li>
            <li>Also, you only need a small amount, about the size of a dime, for a full cleanse.</li>
            <li>this shampoo has made my hair for sure softer and has started growing now.im early into using,2 weeks,so ill have to update at end of bottle</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a whole head of hair again even though it has been thinned out just due to the sheer volume I get!</li>
            <li>All I wanted was long lush hair.</li>
            <li>but if you have long hair (mine is medium length right below my shoulders), it will last you about a month or less depending how often you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found formula 500 and my hair grew thick once again.</li>
            <li>Since I use the other items, it&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much to attribute to this shampoo, but also results for these types of products tend to take a while</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been experiencing some hair loss due to a new medication and I came across this product.</li>

            <li> It has helped to stop my hair from falling off more.  </li>

            <li> Most people will see some results probably after the first month of using the system.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean &amp; some body is added even on these humid days.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I have noticed that my hair seems thicker, more manageable, and back to the way it was before I had my son.</li>

            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve liked it.  </li>
            <li> Formula 500 is the only system that effectively provides clinically studied ingredients in a precise ratio designed to reproduce results seen in relevant clinical studies.</li>
            <li> Along with being effective for restoring hair, it also works well for cleaning the hair and making it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> had some problems with a damaged package due to the carrier but the Customer service was great and they  replaced to bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very let down because after reading so many great reviews</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find a shampoo that made my hair look healthy and voluminous at the same time.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> One of the great things about this shampoo that I really lie is that it lathers very well and after the wash it leaves the hair very soft, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and a nice fresh scent unlike a lot of others, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> or if he is one of the lucky ones that his hair is growing back on its own</li>
            <li> With the PRI Formula 500 shampoo hair regeneration system, you get a product that really stands up to the claims of its manufacturer and you really stand a good chance of seeing new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I use essential oils regularly and know that peppermint oil and saw palmetto are both very good for stimulating growth and stopping hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the Phoenix Rejuvenation Institute they work relentlessly to provide the consumer with only the highest potency, highest purity, and most effectively absorbed formulations available to the consumer</li>
            <li> Amazing how simple it was.</li>
            <li> (free bottle soon to be shipped to me thanks to the Formula500 folks)</li>
            <li> i am reordering today totally worth the price</li>
            <li> I have rarely noticed any hairs falling out when using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]]</li>
            <li> So far, I need to wait for more drastic result.</li>
            <li> I chose this more for the natural ingredients and the reviews, an added benefit no dandruff</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money or effort.  </li>
            <li> To start, it uses a group of nutrients and essential oils that have been shown to be effective for restoring hair growth and for promoting scalp health.</li>
            <li> The benefits are worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried something like this before its worth a try.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair you have strong and builds up to help make all future hair just as strong.</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo right now.</li>
            <li> i use it then use mill creek right after because it makes my scalp feel rejuvenated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to keep my hair right where it is....</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that my review is biased.</li>
            <li> exclusively for those who seek exceptional results, Formula 500 is a highly concentrated two-stage formula containing essential oils, vitamins, nutrients and clinically studied extracts.</li>
            <li> so this could just be because I&#x27;ve been paying more attention to my hair in general.  </li>
            <li> I have a sticker in the shampoo bottle like I can get a new free bottle.</li>
            <li> Since being diagnosed with PCOS my hair has greatly thinned and I&#x27;ve been using various hair supplements, DHT blockers, and shampoos and overall wellness (</li>
            <li> It is great cause it actually works after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> Really smells, USE TWICE as much, SUPER runny, like its all water, also NO Lather at all.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this is an effective product as well as a high quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> Obviously this is an effective product as well as a high quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.my only complaint is the amount you have to use to get a good lather, it takes a lot to get a good lather going..</li>
            <li> I like this product because it rinses clean and does stimulate new hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick and doesn&#x27;t lather that great.</li>
            <li> volume I get with this shampoo is intense though!</li>
            <li> My first time using this in 1week</li>
            <li> After 2 kids your hair doesn&#x27;t look shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> first it smells like medicine you put on the corns on your feet.. and that scares me...</li>
            <li> It does not however make my hair feel soft or smooth as I still need to use conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> first noticed the scent.</li>
            <li> Saw results after using my first bottle.my hairdresser noticed as well,I didn&#x27;t even say anything to him.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use &amp; report back on more results.</li>
            <li> I will report back when I have more news</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> For many of these people, the problem not only affects the way that they look, but it can also have an impact on the way that they feel.</li>
            <li> Please answer me thanks!</li>

            <li> It is a very neutral scent and isn&#x27;t floral or woodsy.  </li>

            <li> and I recently re-ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sensitive on shampoo since I have sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and lathers up so nice.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could say that it&#x27;s working because I&#x27;m not losing what little hair I have on top, but it&#x27;s not coming back or thickening either.</li>
            <li> This proprietary complex formula is designed to restore a natural state of healthy circulation to the follicles, resulting in noticeable growth as well as thicker, fuller hair.</li>
            <li> This really helps me get some of my thickness back</li>
            <li> I starting noticing some real results.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> and wow what a difference.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d have to say that so far it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used this shampoo enough for results in that area</li>
            <li> really) bald spot started to grow some hair back</li>
            <li> - Grow your hair back fast.</li>
            <li> She has alopecia, and me, well my grandfather blessed me with a hair loss issue which began when I was young.</li>
            <li> I believe this shampoo helps with having a fuller look and leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> At my old age (45)</li>
            <li> To help with some people who said it doesnt lather well-i use a small amount at first, and let it sit for a bit, then wash it out and repeat-it lathers very well and doesnt take much.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement but will complete the use of it and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Will definitely return in a few more weeks for an update.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> noting progress is a challenge, however, my hair grew faster and its a bit more thick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair yet, but it has cut down on how much my hair sheds.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use the little bit left in the bottle but saw no changes since there was not enough.</li>
            <li> so I cannot attest to the long term results, but I have noticed that I am not losing as much hair.</li>
            <li> , I observe this morning with they same aww in surprised not much to loss my hair</li>
            <li> I really miss my long hair</li>
            <li> and I can see and feel new hairs coming up in the back.</li>
            <li> and I can see where Formula 500 is starting to fill this spot in with new hair.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s great to see my hair falling less and less everyday now.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t dry out my ends too much.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has really helped with my dry scalp problems .</li>
            <li> This is a mild formula that can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what people will do to get free crap...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, your hair emerges from the shower looking and feeling a little more voluminous and I am noticing fewer hairs falling out.  </li>
            <li> It is very important so he won&#x27;t be confused of his hair loss anymore.</li>
            <li> unique proprietary complex is designed to systematically restore natural hair growth in two stages, using both the shampoo and conditioner for maximum results.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I do seem to be shedding less, my hair is softer and less brittle and looks much better nourished.</li>
            <li> I was surprise to see a hair loss somewhere at the back part of my head, so I have been searching for something natural to help with the problem.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using the product after sadly deciding to cut off too much hair and I absolutely love it .</li>
            <li> but this has definitely helped so far.</li>

            <li> This not only helps to restore the possibility of growing new hair, but it also means that it takes measures to prevent further hair loss.</li>

            <li> It clarifies really well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; like some other clarifiers do</li>

            <li> You will have your hair growing back in no time and you will be back to being your old self.</li>
            <li> Also, you only need a small amount, about the size of a dime, for a full cleanse.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has made my hair for sure softer and has started growing now.im early into using,2 weeks,so ill have to update at end of bottle</li>
            <li> I feel like I have a whole head of hair again even though it has been thinned out just due to the sheer volume I get!</li>
            <li> All I wanted was long lush hair.</li>
            <li> but if you have long hair (mine is medium length right below my shoulders), it will last you about a month or less depending how often you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found formula 500 and my hair grew thick once again.</li>
            <li> Since I use the other items, it&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much to attribute to this shampoo, but also results for these types of products tend to take a while</li>

            <li> Was skeptical about buying another kind of hair product but read the other reviews.</li>

            <li> maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough</li>
            <li> Be a little vain and treat yourself to something new.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see little baby hairs growing back in the area of receding.</li>
            <li> it actually leaves my scalp dry after use, nothing compares to MillCreek - Biotin Shampoo for the feel.</li>
            <li> in fact my hair was left feeling dry and stripped.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing postpartum hair loss and been searching for right product to help myself out, after reading the reviews I bought this one, now I had used it for a few weeks, I did see my hair on the temples a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> Formula 500 contains over 15 different clinically studied extracts, combined with essential oils, vitamins and other nutrients, designed to address the problem of hair-loss and thinning</li>
            <li> It would just end up looking greasy and flat, or frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was bigger, a little pricey for such a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo primarily for my father who was recently very ill and developed a condition called Alopecia that leaves bald patches in your hair.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a long time user of Nioxin</li>
            <li> Expecting a long relationship with Formula 500.</li>
            <li> Research natural ways online and don&#x27;t waste time with this.</li>
            <li> and it has no clear results.</li>
            <li> and my length is slowly getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> So, while I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth or my hair getting any thicker, I will say I am at least maintaining the hair I have, which is a big improvement compared to</li>
            <li> The only problem is that when I got it it had leaked in the mail and lost almost half the shampoo because the cap flipped open.</li>
            <li> Would definitely like to continue using Formula 500 to see what other results I can get.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I did because after all the other stuff I have tried this actually showed me some results my hair is thicker and fuller and that tiny(not</li>

            <li> /&gt;Apply shampoo to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different hair loss shampoos, and from what I can tell, this has been working well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Castor Oil treatments now, to thicken my hair, and it only costs a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Everytime I applied relaxers, the soft hair would be damaged slowly until a time I discovered</li>
            <li> It was normal for me to see at least 10 hairs fall out when using previous shampoo&#x27;s before this one.  </li>
            <li> Rogaine (complete failure for me) suggested that one might see changes after around 4 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it is all due to this product</li>
            <li> other regular shampoo&#x27;s I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t thought to give it a try due to genetic problem</li>
            <li> but I&amp;#34;m giving it a 5 stars because the ingredients don&#x27;t seem to extremely toxic.</li>
            <li> for my hair issues I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo about every other day or so</li>
            <li> I usually get dandruff the next day after I wash my hair</li>
            <li> And in other areas with no hair, hair is growing.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first than I read some of the reviews and decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> I will write another review after a month and  post a photo for other customers to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Not much success with this.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair has been losing thickness recently but was once extremely thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is coming back in a bit thicker, but it is a slow process.</li>
            <li> so I found this on Amazon and it is working fabulously, no more dry scalp</li>
            <li> I also shed hair in ridiculous amounts, at first it was irritating but has become almost embarrassing as it gets everywhere</li>
            <li> Compared to other hair regeneration or loss shampoos, there is too much waste.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also losing a lot less hair in the shower since I&#x27;ve started treatments.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair is falling out less.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this shampoo: my hair is falling at a rapid rate for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a lot less shedding since I started using this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not special at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair which falls out all the time because of stress and damage from chemicals.</li>
            <li> May have to wait a little while to see results.</li>
            <li> I just have a little hair loss at both of my temples.</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot to get a little soapy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> A few shampoos and supplements have worked wonders for me and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> and my hair is falling out since I just gave birth few months ago.</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> I been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago.</li>
            <li> My hair is ultra thin from numerous medications</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo for a few days now</li>
            <li> Using their products, my hair was limp</li>
            <li> Stopped hair fallout after a few uses.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of use I am seeing fewer hairs left behind in the sink, and palms of my hands after styling.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any hair regrowth yet in a few days but that stuff doesnt happen overnight.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Will update again in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> you would have to use everyday for results.</li>
            <li> i do not wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> My hair feels so dried out and frizzy after using it even with the formula 500 conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, this is one of the few shampoos that fits on me.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of applying I was astounded.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want another bottle of this crap, free or not.</li>
            <li> My hair is not thinning, but it does seem shinier and thicker after using this for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few days now</li>
            <li> Waste of Money.  </li>
            <li> When I turned 30 I started to notice a few gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is just a rather plain smell</li>
            <li> I have noticed some extra hair growth, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for about a month I could see small thin hairs growing back in some of the spots on my father&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> And I do notice that my hair loss after a shower has seemed to slow down, see fewer shed hairs on the floor and sink.  </li>
            <li> and I would like to stop or slow this down.  </li>
            <li> My wife says she noticed some thicker parts where my scalp has been thinner, but she&#x27;s not completely sure it&#x27;s not her imagination.  </li>
            <li> I have a small spot where I&#x27;ve lost some hair</li>
            <li> I have to pump out a lot of the shampoo in order to lather my hair up. :/</li>
            <li> This shampoo has stopped that a bit since I started using it for the past 5 days.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it is even helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO pissed to have wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> So not sure if I can keep buying all the time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo got rid of my dandruff in no time and my hair feels thicker everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using formula 500 for the past 3weeks.</li>
            <li> It is expensive though for such small bottles.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say how well this works.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a hard core balder.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with shampoos because either my hair will looks greasy or they will strip my hair.</li>
            <li> but I noticed it drying out my scalp lately causing dandruff</li>
            <li> It loses it fullness and beauty, at least mine did.</li>
            <li> I just received the shampoo a couple days ago and have been using it for at least three days now.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either, and I have received a few compliments when people are up close &amp; personal.</li>
            <li> It was so thick like putting honey in my hair and didn&#x27;t lather well at all.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to add something that will create a thick lather.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any result yet, but my hair loss is not getting worse, so at least it has no adverse effect.</li>
            <li> It helps with thin hair.</li>
            <li> The package came opened, and the shampoo bottle came broken.</li>
            <li> Also, it has sulfates in it, which are not good for thinning hair!</li>
            <li> No difference,  fake reviews.  </li>
            <li> sorry...</li>
            <li> and now I have a useless bottle of shampoo that cost $11.</li>
            <li> it does have a weird smell though.</li>

            <li> I have really bad postpartum hair loss,  and my hair would just break off before it could grow. This really helps me get some of my thickness back and my length is slowly getting back to normal. I can definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Got it for my busband and haven&#x27;t heard him say anything so I am not really sure if this is good or not?</li>
            <li> No difference,  fake reviews.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> My hair is kinda growing back.</li>
            <li> i am reordering today totally worth the price</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling nice and clean</li>
            <li> Most advanced Therapy for thin hair, receding hair line and hair loss. Contains a proprietary complex of vitamins and uniquely effective extracts designed for optimal results. Dual stage, Shampoo and Conditioner containing highly concentrated extracts. I was surprise to see a hair loss somewhere at the back part of my head, so I have been searching for something natural to help with the problem. I got this product because I have heard a some good reviews about it. This shampoo smells kind of lemony to me. It is rather thick and doesn&#x27;t lather that great. I have to use a good bit to feel like I cleaned my hair well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been experiencing some hair loss due to a new medication and I came across this product. I love it that my hair is thicker and easy to style. Obviously this is an effective product as well as a high quality shampoo. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> amazing shampoo that helped my hair grow thicker! Great smell and awesome results. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I didn‚Äôt know hair is one of the beauty that defines a woman until I began loosing mine.Everytime I applied relaxers, the soft hair would be damaged slowly until a time I discovered even my boyfriend dint want to look at me. My head was terrible. I went out and about looking for a solution. Luckily I found formula 500 and my hair grew thick once again. All the dandruffs were also no more.it has been such a relieve .</li>
            <li> I like ths shampoo. It seems to be helping but I can&#x27;t tell for sure.. I know it takes time so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I havent got this item???</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and a half and it seems like it is helping. I have noticed some extra hair growth, but nothing dramatic. I wish the shampoo had more lather and a couple more ounces in each bottle.</li>
            <li> Used a bottle already, and now onto the second bottle.  Haven&#x27;t seen any result yet, but my hair loss is not getting worse, so at least it has no adverse effect.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference with my hair loss as it seemed to stop while I was using this product.</li>
            <li> Works great!, I&#x27;m a long time user of Nioxin but I noticed it drying out my scalp lately causing dandruff so I found this on Amazon and it is working fabulously, no more dry scalp and my looks better than it ever has. I highly recommend.my only complaint is the amount you have to use to get a good lather, it takes a lot to get a good lather going..</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is thicker and softer since using this shampoo.  I can see it; I can feel it.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but this cleared up my scalp. I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was long lush hair. I got that by using this shampoo. It keeps the hair you have strong and builds up to help make all future hair just as strong. Be a little vain and treat yourself to something new.</li>
            <li> a stunning experience</li>
            <li> One of the great things about this shampoo that I really lie is that it lathers very well and after the wash it leaves the hair very soft, silky and shiny. The smell is also beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing some hair loss due to a new medication and I came across this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I can&#x27;t give a full review until more time has been given. However, there hasn&#x27;t been any negative results which is a good sign. What I will say is that the smell is pleasant and I just wish the bottles were a little bigger. Will definitely return in a few more weeks for an update.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it rinses clean and does stimulate new hair growth.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so good, good product, proven and tested, i use this and my hair very shiny , i feel my hair revive and healthier.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This formula seems to have helped my hair a lot in terms of volume.  My hair has been losing thickness recently but was once extremely thick.  Since being diagnosed with PCOS my hair has greatly thinned and I&#x27;ve been using various hair supplements, DHT blockers, and shampoos and overall wellness (clean eating and moderate exercise) to get it to go back to how it was.  Because of this I was very excited to try this shampoo for free in exchange for an honest review.  A few shampoos and supplements have worked wonders for me and this is one of them.  My hair is coming back in a bit thicker, but it is a slow process. I can&#x27;t say it is all due to this product but it does help my self confidence quite a bit.  I know my overall routine is working because I have a bunch of baby hairs on my scalp again! The flyaways are annoying, but I&#x27;m happy they are there for once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume I get with this shampoo is intense though! My hair is often very lifeless and this really kicks it up a notch. I feel like I have a whole head of hair again even though it has been thinned out just due to the sheer volume I get! I have kept my hair long in hopes I&#x27;d be able to find a solution and I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this product.  It is a nice step for the in-between stages of hair growth. I&#x27;m also losing a lot less hair in the shower since I&#x27;ve started treatments.  I had finished a different shampoo for hair loss recently so this could just be because I&#x27;ve been paying more attention to my hair in general.  I was getting a lot of clumps of hair before though and they are still staying away so I think that is progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells nice and clean.  It is a very neutral scent and isn&#x27;t floral or woodsy.  I like that it is just a rather plain smell so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my soap.  I don&#x27;t have to use much when I use it and keep it near my scalp so I don&#x27;t dry out my ends too much.  It clarifies really well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; like some other clarifiers do so I can use it a couple of times a week, which is about how often I wash my hair.  It does suds up nicely if you&#x27;re into that.  I don&#x27;t mind low sudsing shampoos, but think it does help with knowing where the product is.  Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome! It helps with thin hair. Also it helps dry scalp! It&#x27;s amazing my dandruff is going away!</li>
            <li> My first time using this in 1week i seen my hair difference started growing back</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten so thick and healthy. I love how it feels in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair yet, but it has cut down on how much my hair sheds.  I have rarely noticed any hairs falling out when using this shampoo.  It was normal for me to see at least 10 hairs fall out when using previous shampoo&#x27;s before this one.  So, while I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth or my hair getting any thicker, I will say I am at least maintaining the hair I have, which is a big improvement compared to other regular shampoo&#x27;s I have used in the past.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> nice product , I will order again to use it more time for more result .</li>
            <li> had some problems with a damaged package due to the carrier but the Customer service was great and they  replaced to bottle. This is my second time using the product after sadly deciding to cut off too much hair and I absolutely love it . You start getting results fast and it is money well spent!</li>
            <li> *RECIEVED IN EXCHANGE FOR REVIEW*&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo smells incredible and lathers good, leaves my hair easy to comb through and less frizzy. Leaves my hair full of body and shiny, hopefully helps my hair grow, good product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much more stronger.</li>
            <li> After 2 kids your hair doesn&#x27;t look shiny and pretty. It loses it fullness and beauty, at least mine did. This has helped my hair get longer and thicker. It doesn&#x27;t take me 2 years to grow my hair anymore!</li>
            <li> first it smells like medicine you put on the corns on your feet.. and that scares me... second the bottles are tiny and they need to the lower price... third I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair same old same old...maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough maybe I have to buy more (scam?) ..... shame on me....  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying anymore... sorry... buyer beware</li>
            <li> I received  this product  in exchange  for a review. This is a fantastic  product! High quality and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> I thought this got lost in the mail. But finally I got it and can&#x27;t wait to try it. Hopeing this shampooh works and to see awesome results</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Makes my hair feel great and clean!</li>
            <li> I shaved my head as I often do. Ive been using this shampoo as directed for about 2 weeks now and I can see and feel new hairs coming up in the back. When my hair was a bit longer they were still very thin but this has definitely helped so far.</li>
            <li> People ask me all the time, what do you use on my your and this is it! My hair is longer and thicker now than it ever has been!</li>
            <li> I just received the shampoo a couple days ago and have been using it for at least three days now. I will be rewriting my review within a months to see if I got any improvement to share with you all. For now all I can say is that the shampoo smells great and leaves my hair feeling good</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. It smells great, and makes my hair much fuller and thicker.My husband and I both use it, along with [[ASIN:B013HAL7JC Propidol - Powerful Hair Nutrient and Growth Supplement]] (Propidol works wonders for thinning hair) and we love them both. Amazing combo whether you are losing hair, or just want healthy beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Garbage! Do not waste your money! I feel it did not even stop my shedding. In face it seemed to speed it up.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for about 2 months I starting noticing some real results. I apply and massage it in well in the shower - leave it on while I shave and by the time I am done shaving and washing it is time to rinse it out. I love it that my hair is thicker and easy to style. Obviously this is an effective product as well as a high quality shampoo. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Hair feels thicker than ever!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who is thinning at the hairline. He&#x27;s been using it for about a week and can see a noticeable difference. His scalp is clear and free from dandruff, his hair is very soft and shiny, and he&#x27;s starting to see new growth in areas. The scent of the shampoo is nice. Also, you only need a small amount, about the size of a dime, for a full cleanse. So far it seems to be working. He loves it as well. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results at the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband. After a week of using, he said he felt his hair was thicker. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for two months and my hair is becoming thicker and strong,it has a very nice smell and it also leaves my hair smoother and the scalp gently massaged.I will continue using this great product because it works 100%,i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this shampoo there is always hair falling during bath. Also a lot of hair in my brush after bath. I guess it&#x27;s not what my scalp needs.</li>
            <li> WOW! this product really regenerated my hair. I use to have a lot of split ends, and dry hair. Im starting to see the growth, but it does not happen overnight. You have to use it for at lease 3 months to see optimal results.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and this is genetic problem. I didn&#x27;t thought to give it a try due to genetic problem but when I tried this shampoo I found that my hair are getting thicker and even the salon person saw this difference.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has made my hair for sure softer and has started growing now.im early into using,2 weeks,so ill have to update at end of bottle but so fare its great and doing its job.i have no complaints!received this at discount for my review</li>
            <li> I wish I could have wrote a longer more detailed review, However I did not fully get to use this product because it came opened all all spilled/ crusted inside the box and bottle. I was very let down because after reading so many great reviews I was really excited and looking forward to giving it a try. I was able to use the little bit left in the bottle but saw no changes since there was not enough. It did have a pleasant somewhat menthol like scent and was refreshing on the scalp. Hope i get the chance to try it again and will then update this review untill now this is all I can comment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for testing and review purposes however my opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost two weeks. I have very dry scalp and my hair is falling out since I just gave birth few months ago. The consistency of the shampoo felt like putting honey to my hair. It does not however make my hair feel soft or smooth as I still need to use conditioner afterwards. I have not seen any changes with the volume of my hair nor has helped me much on my dandruff. Ill wait for few more weeks and see if it does change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product as an exchange for my opinion and experience. So far, I need to wait for more drastic result.</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo right now. I haven&#x27;t seen results as of yet but I&amp;#34;m giving it a 5 stars because the ingredients don&#x27;t seem to extremely toxic.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;nt expect such results from this product based upon the good reviews I read. I want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon verified purchase</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather, like at all. I saw a rating that said it lathered great. Lies! Lies I tell you! I used it once and now I have a useless bottle of shampoo that cost $11. Waste. of. money.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer.</li>
            <li> Formula 500 is a great product for hair regeneration and scalp healing. It is great cause it actually works after the 2nd use. I noticed the difference in my hairs texture and strength, It is a great product, with a lovely refreshing scent. Buying about 4 bottles for the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now.  My wife says she noticed some thicker parts where my scalp has been thinner, but she&#x27;s not completely sure it&#x27;s not her imagination.  I really don&#x27;t see much difference so far.</li>
            <li> I do notice a difference great product would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have used it now for several weeks. A couple of things I noticed immediately is that my hair seems thicker and as too soon I don&#x27;t know if the regeneration properties are working but I don&#x27;t seem to be loosing hair. It does make my scalp feel good. After several months I would expect to recognize results. It does make my hair look better and feel thicker. I chose this more for the natural ingredients and the reviews, an added benefit no dandruff so no harsh treatment by those other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. Good product and good price point.</li>
            <li> If you have hair loss this is the product for you. You will have your hair growing back in no time and you will be back to being your old self.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, thank you. I highly rocommend it.</li>
            <li> Did not see results at all. Did not like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo primarily for my father who was recently very ill and developed a condition called Alopecia that leaves bald patches in your hair. &amp;#34;Sometimes it will grow back and sometimes it won&#x27;t,&amp;#34; is what the doctor told him. I also shed hair in ridiculous amounts, at first it was irritating but has become almost embarrassing as it gets everywhere and even my friends complain that they find my hair all over everything for days after I&#x27;ve come to visit and hang out. I found a test and review promotion for this shampoo and signed up quickly to be able to try it at the promotional price.&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed the scent. It reminds me of peppermint oil and tea tree oil though I don&#x27;t see Tea Tree listed in the ingredients. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just very natural. I personally like it.  You can definitely feel a tingle when you massage it into your scalp so you know it&#x27;s doing Something. After using this shampoo for about a month I could see small thin hairs growing back in some of the spots on my father&#x27;s head. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the shampoo or if he is one of the lucky ones that his hair is growing back on its own but I use essential oils regularly and know that peppermint oil and saw palmetto are both very good for stimulating growth and stopping hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;As for my hair issues I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo about every other day or so and I deep condition my hair with Argan oil 2x a week. I do seem to be shedding less, my hair is softer and less brittle and looks much better nourished. I like it enough to continue use and to continue to purchase this for my father&#x27;s alopecia. Hopefully you will have the same results because I&#x27;m very happy with what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> Had no effect on my hair at all.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the money or effort.  Made no difference in my shedding hair</li>
            <li> works to smooth my hair down without leaving a greasy feel. The scent is perfect!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because my hair has been thinning for years.I been using it for a few weeks now and wow what a difference.My hair feels thicker and more manageable.I got this product because I read some good reviews on it.Item arrived quickly and packed well.Thank you.</li>
            <li> May have to wait a little while to see results. The smell of the shampoo could definitely be better as it does not smell the greatest.</li>
            <li> I used this once sice I gotton it.I usually get dandruff the next day after I wash my hair but I haven&#x27;t seen any..can really say anything about hair grow because I&#x27;ve only used oce but I will continue to use,glad I was able to get this promotion for my review</li>
            <li> The product contains a lot of Salt! It makes your hair and scalp really dry and makes hair fall out! I used this product 3 times and each time I&#x27;ve experienced tremendous hair fall! The bottle has a sticker that says \\&quot;get a free bottle by calling this number\\&quot; which redirects you to leaving fake positive feedback for a free bottle of junk. This shampoo is junk I want my money back!</li>
            <li> Expensive.better work.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo.work for me great . This help also my scalp to become healthy and helps to regrow my hair. I think everyone should get this shampoo if they want to stop balding.igot this under promotional item with my Honest review and own opinion</li>
            <li> Great product brings more life to your hair.  I also notice the my scalp hasn&#x27;t been bothering me either. Big Plus</li>
            <li> Great shampoo as it feels clean but not dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I have noticed that my hair and scalp does look more filled in if that makes sense. And I do notice that my hair loss after a shower has seemed to slow down, see fewer shed hairs on the floor and sink.  I plan to continue using it as it is better than my previous brand, Head &amp; Shoulders.  I&#x27;d have to say that so far it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Saw results after using my first bottle.my hairdresser noticed as well,I didn&#x27;t even say anything to him. Bought 2 more bottles. I really love this shampoo</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a month and it makes my hair feel fuller and cleaner.  It lathers easily and smells well and I believe it&#x27;s helping to restore the vitamins and minerals in my hair. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a month into using Formula 500 shampoo and my hair loss seems to have stopped - which makes this product worth it for me! I also have a sense that my hair is a bit thicker, stronger or healthier; I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it.  I haven&#x27;t see any new hair growth yet, although at age 58 I would be pretty surprised if I did this quickly - for example Rogaine (complete failure for me) suggested that one might see changes after around 4 months of use.  I am going to get another bottle and stick with the program and see what happens!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has really helped with my dry scalp problems . Also it has stimulated  my hair growth process will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of Formula 500 about two months ago and have been using it ever since.  So far, I&#x27;ve liked it.  It has helped to stop my hair from falling off more.  It also keeps the thickness of my hair intact even though it took some time for the hair to get used to the new shampoo.  I&#x27;m still waiting to see whether it&#x27;ll help &amp;#34;regenerate&amp;#34; or regrow my hair.  Perhaps, it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  For now, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to keep whatever hair I still have.  Would definitely like to continue using Formula 500 to see what other results I can get.</li>
            <li> I find this to be one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my hair extremely manageable and looks so full. I have a small spot where I&#x27;ve lost some hair and I can see where Formula 500 is starting to fill this spot in with new hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been growing so much hair that I turned into a werewolf. Hairy like the werewolfs chest from Twilight.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet obviously. But it seems to be a great shampoo. I&#x27;m hoping in a month I can update my review with really good news about hair growth. My hair is ultra thin from numerous medications I have been on so seeing this product I definitely wanted to try it out. If it seems to work I will be buying a few more bottles. I will update my review later on.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo for a few days now so I cannot attest to the long term results, but I have noticed that I am not losing as much hair. I am looking forward to seeing more results and hopefully some regrowth as I continue to use the shampoo. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Love it! Started working almost instantly to thicken hair!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that lives up to its claims. My hair appears fuller and is more manageable after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I have had for a few weeks and can see a better appearance and hold.  Just ordered another bottle. Can&#x27;t take a chance of running out. Had my hair cut and styled at the beauty shop yesterday. Using their products, my hair was limp&lt;br /&gt;and felt fine, the style fell out before I got back home despite the load of spray.Had to rewash with Formula 500&lt;br /&gt;to get the body back.  Expecting a long relationship with Formula 500.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say how well this works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference. Perhaps it could be because of my body or how often I&#x27;m actually using this in the shower. For now, I&#x27;m giving it a 3-star. If I see any difference after applying it more often instead of my usual once or twice every 2 days.</li>
            <li> I just have a little hair loss at both of my temples. I really haven&#x27;t used this shampoo enough for results in that area but I do like the way my head &amp; hair feel after using.  My hair feels clean &amp; some body is added even on these humid days. I will continue to use &amp; report back on more results. I did receive this shampoo by Genetic Solutions for a reduced price for a an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I was used this shampoo this morning when I take a bath, every day I take shower when I brush my hair we have a lot strand of hair loss my hair, I observe this morning with they same aww in surprised not much to loss my hair recommend this item to purchase those who suffering loss hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes good amount of lather. The shampoo will last you for almost a month. My hair do feel cleaner and softer after using this. The only problem is that when I got it it had leaked in the mail and lost almost half the shampoo because the cap flipped open. So, I would suggest a better packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> i have been using this shampoo for 2 MONTHS IS REALLY NICE IM HAPPY IM PLANING TO KEEP USING IT &amp;#62;&amp;#62;I RECOMEND TO YOU &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I have tried this for the last three to four weeks and the product seems to be working for a while because when I use this product than the hair that were falling has reduced. However, I don&#x27;t see any new hair till now let&#x27;s see in the future and then I will update when I receive one more bottle from Formula 500.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free but that does not mean that my review is biased. My husband has started using it and he has noticed some hair growing back!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about buying another kind of hair product but read the other reviews. So I figured why not try it. Thank goodness I did because after all the other stuff I have tried this actually showed me some results my hair is thicker and fuller and that tiny(not really) bald spot started to grow some hair back I do wish the bottle was bigger but will be calming back for more. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Wont buy again. Product didnt do anything for my hair. hair felt dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent, better than expected</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells great and washes my hair nicely, im overall impressed with it. time will tell if i see hair growth. i received free for testing and review.</li>
            <li> i brought it twice it actually leaves my scalp dry after use, nothing compares to MillCreek - Biotin Shampoo for the feel. its ok I bet it works i use it then use mill creek right after because it makes my scalp feel rejuvenated</li>
            <li> This product for hair growth is the best I have ever tried. My hair looks healthier and thicker and is actually growing in areas of my scalp where I was receding. Smells great as well.</li>
            <li> Stopped hair fallout after a few uses. Leaves hair manageable.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and a nice fresh scent unlike a lot of others, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of use I am seeing fewer hairs left behind in the sink, and palms of my hands after styling. The shampoo also has a pleasant smell to it which is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Product seems to do what it says. Definitely noticing a reduction in hair loss. Planning to continue use!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I noticed that my hair was thinning and was getting receding hairline and I would like to stop or slow this down.  After only a few uses my hair feels thicker and seems to style very well.  I have not seen any hair regrowth yet in a few days but that stuff doesnt happen overnight.  I am also supplementing this with hair regrowth pills as well.  I will report back when I have more news, hopefully good!  Update 1: I have been using this for a few weeks now and I can tell you that my hair is feeling fuller.  I am noticing hair growth is areas where I was lacking some.  Will update again in a few weeks.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this product at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Made my skin itchy. Sending back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Good product, really works!&lt;br /&gt;Use it daily ,  noticeably less hair loss after just a week. Totally satisfied for the hair loss control.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is great , quick response to fix an incorrect order.</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for about a month  now and can see a noticeable difference in my hair. It feels and looks much fuller. I don&#x27;t know whether my hair is regrowing or not but it has the appearance that something is happening.</li>
            <li> Prompt service.  Seems good.  Have only used it twice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month. My hair is definitely fuller. I can&#x27;t tell if any hair has been regenerated but I will continue to use it in the future. Definitely one of the better shampoos I have tried. I also use it with the conditioner.</li>

This is a hair loss/regeneration shampoo that works on multiple levels. To start, it uses a group of nutrients and essential oils that have been shown to be effective for restoring hair growth and for promoting scalp health.

            <li> This really works. My fianc√© and I actually took the chance on this product together. She has alopecia, and me, well my grandfather blessed me with a hair loss issue which began when I was young. I keep may hair clipped &amp;#34;high and tight&amp;#34; so noting progress is a challenge, however, my hair grew faster and its a bit more thick. My fianc√© had wonderful results! She has shown thickening in areas of her hair that were really affected by alopecia. And in other areas with no hair, hair is growing. I am very impressed with this product and will continue to try it.</li>
            <li> you would have to use everyday for results. i do not wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I believe this shampoo helps with having a fuller look and leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It works very nice as it mentioned on advertisement.</li>
            <li> I like how this shampoo left my hair I am sure that it will regenerate my very damaged hair. I gave it 3 stars because didn&#x27;t really like the odor, it is kind of strong but if you don&#x27;t mind it this product is good for you, I received a good discount to review this. It really helped my husband with dandruff</li>
            <li> my hair does feel fuller. still need more time to give this item a full review. so far so good. it does have a weird smell though.</li>
            <li> The package came opened, and the shampoo bottle came broken. What I can do about? May I have a free bottle to replacement the last one. I have a sticker in the shampoo bottle like I can get a new free bottle. Please answer me thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month since I&#x27;ve started using this and I feel a little more volume, but the jury is still out as to whether it is permanent.  Looking forward to continuing giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I bought this formula because of my hair is damaged from dyes and such. It created stress on my head where it falls out a lot. After using about 2 days. I noticed that my hair is falling out less. I don&#x27;t like the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t lather that well. I have to pump out a lot of the shampoo in order to lather my hair up. :/</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this shampoo: my hair is falling at a rapid rate for some odd reason. This shampoo has stopped that a bit since I started using it for the past 5 days. Yes it&#x27;s great to see my hair falling less and less everyday now. I&#x27;m also taking some biotin to help my hair grow faster. Gonna keep using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for two days so I can&#x27;t verify that I have more hair growth, but even so, it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far. I have problems with the hair on top of my head looking flat, oily, and lifeless. After one shampoo with this, my hair looked fuller, incredibly healthy, and voluminous. I&#x27;ve never been able to find a shampoo that made my hair look healthy and voluminous at the same time. It would just end up looking greasy and flat, or frizzy and dry. I&#x27;ve tried everything, but never had luck. This shampoo made my hair healthy and bouncy. I will definitely buy again. The benefits are worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was so thick like putting honey in my hair and didn&#x27;t lather well at all. I had to use a lot to get a little soapy. I was hoping to continue to use it to stimulate hair growth but I don&#x27;t think I can bring myself to continue to use it. My hair feels so dried out and frizzy after using it even with the formula 500 conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and I recently re-ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sensitive on shampoo since I have sensitive scalp. However, this is one of the few shampoos that fits on me.</li>
            <li> Like it seems to be helping</li>
            <li> Not much success with this.  Maybe I&#x27;m just a hard core balder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and it is absolutely amazing! My hair is growing, is full of volume and strong. I have noticed a lot less shedding since I started using this. I love that it makes your hair feel soft and natural. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for hair. A product that helps regrow hair.</li>
            <li> Great Product works very well,I love my hair and this just makes it alot thicker i definatley recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> At my old age (45) I never though I&#x27;d have a full head of hair again until I tried this product. Skeptical at first than I read some of the reviews and decided to give it a go. After a few weeks of applying I was astounded. Amazing how simple it was. All for an affordable price too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not special at all.  I&#x27;m a male with short hair and I have to use probably a handful just to get any form going.  Compared to other hair regeneration or loss shampoos, there is too much waste.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it is even helping.</li>
            <li> The one bottle I bought I have been using for a couple months because I have short hair and the one bottle seems to last awhile.  I also take biotin (not sure how much that helps) to help and use monoxidil most nights.  I have tried a few different hair loss shampoos, and from what I can tell, this has been working well.  Since I use the other items, it&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much to attribute to this shampoo, but also results for these types of products tend to take a while so i&#x27;ll stick with it because its a good price for the amount. To help with some people who said it doesnt lather well-i use a small amount at first, and let it sit for a bit, then wash it out and repeat-it lathers very well and doesnt take much.</li>
            <li> This is a mild formula that can be used everyday. I have noticed my hair is smoother and softer. It also looks fuller. If you&#x27;ve never tried something like this before its worth a try.</li>
            <li> *****SCAM**** FAKE REVIEWS! ****I want to warn others, as I am very disappointed with this scam! I researched reviews on here for HOURS, and finally settled on this shampoo because of all the great reviews! My hair is thinning, and I am desperate to find a solution. When I received this shampoo, a sticker was attached. It said &amp;#34;To receive a free bottle call 1-888-633-xXxX&amp;#34;. This made me suspicious, so I called. Sure enough, a lady told me she would ship out my free bottle as soon as I left a good review!!! I&#x27;m SO pissed to have wasted my money! As for the shampoo....it smells OK, however it does not lather at ALL. I haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of difference in my hair, and it does not add volume. Also, it has sulfates in it, which are not good for thinning hair! (Or any hair) It&#x27;s amazing what people will do to get free crap...like make a fake , lying review! I don&#x27;t want another bottle of this crap, free or not. I&#x27;d rather warn people, who are also desperately looking for help. Don&#x27;t waste your money! I&#x27;ve been using Castor Oil treatments now, to thicken my hair, and it only costs a few bucks. Research natural ways online and don&#x27;t waste time with this. Can&#x27;t believe people aren&#x27;t warning others about this....what a shame! üòû</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and have noticed that my hair is thicker, Im going to keep using it</li>
            <li> My hair is not thinning, but it does seem shinier and thicker after using this for a few months.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either, and I have received a few compliments when people are up close &amp; personal.</li>
            <li> this product did not do what it should. in fact my hair was left feeling dry and stripped. i would not recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered this coz I really miss my long hair and I had dandruff coz I&#x27;m always changing my shampoo..but when  I tried this shampoo, it really works great! I am now dandruff free,my hair is very shiny and soft now.I&#x27;ll stick to this shampoo now.I already recommend this shampoo to my sister in law who has problem with her hair.Thank u for the good product and quick shipping !</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few days now and I love the way it makes my scalp feel! It has a cooling effect and makes my scalp feel clean and invigorated!  I like the fact that it has mango and peppermint oil in it as well as other vitamins, to make my scalp healthier, my hair thicker and stronger and hopefully help prevent future hair loss .I have noticed that my hair does look and feel fuller after using this special hair regeneration formula. I hope that they will continue to develop more products in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was given a discount on this item to give honest and unbiased feedback *</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used! A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money.  Really smells, USE TWICE as much, SUPER runny, like its all water, also NO Lather at all.  Bottle WONT Last long, hair still tangles and same amount og Hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hubby likes this product. Seems like his hair are becoming fuller and thicker. It is very important so he won&#x27;t be confused of his hair loss anymore.</li>
            <li> Did not purchuse but does help growth hakr a family memeber bought and i have notice the diffrence</li>
            <li> My hair appears fuller and is more manageable after 2-3 months of using the product, I understand it takes time but big deal is I do not see my hair falling when I take a shower and wash my hair. My hair is thicker. Thanks to Formula 500. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product and so far it&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for close to 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in my hair loss and shedding, especially after brushing my hair. My hair looks and feels thicker, and have more body. Wish the bottle was bigger, a little pricey for such a tiny bottle. If you have short hair, it&#x27;ll last you longer but if you have long hair (mine is medium length right below my shoulders), it will last you about a month or less depending how often you wash your hair. So not sure if I can keep buying all the time. But yes it does work!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo got rid of my dandruff in no time and my hair feels thicker everyday! I will continue to use formula500.</li>
            <li> Great for scalp relief, hair restoration.  Refreshing feeling each and every time you use this product. This product will keep you coming back for more !!!</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair which falls out all the time because of stress and damage from chemicals. I have a hard time with shampoos because either my hair will looks greasy or they will strip my hair. This shampoo is awesome. It is very thick and lathers up so nice. A small amount goes a long way. My hair is so soft and I have notices that I am not losing as much hair in the shower and in my brush. I received this bottle  as a discount to review and I am the biggest skeptic you will meet. This bottle is heaven sent. I suggest this to anyone that is having hair issues!! And it does not smell nasty like others out there.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  My hair seems fuller and I do see new growth.  The instructions say to work into a lather, but it doesn&#x27;t lather for me at all.  My suggestion is to add something that will create a thick lather.</li>
            <li> I started to have a receding hairline at age of 28. So I saw your product on Amamzon.  I purchased and have been using it for several months now. I was surprised to see little baby hairs growing back in the area of receding. They have grown into regular size hairs and even more baby hairs are growing in now as I continue to use the shampoo. Thank You for your product,</li>
            <li> I started using it about a week ago with no results as of yet.</li>
            <li> Formula 500 is very good! I was looking for a shampoo for my dandruff and hair restoration and this product suits me well. I&#x27;ve used some well known products for dandruff and hair restoration but nothing comes out of it.  But the Formula 500 after using it for just one time, I noticed that my dandruff was gone and I can see that my hair appears fuller. I&#x27;m very happy with Formula 500. I will write another review after a month and  post a photo for other customers to see the difference. Thank you Formula 500.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement but will complete the use of it and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Works great.Wet your hair first and rub your scalp,then apply shampoo and rub it in all over hair.needs alot of water to suds up good,so add water in palm of hand onto your head and keep soaping up to get rich lather.Leave on hair for 3 to 5 minutes and then rinse out.This method is what I do and my hair is growing quicker and is thicker.</li>
            <li> Male hair-loss is mostly about genetics, hormones, and what goes in to your body.  However, for a topical product-- this shampoo really impresses me.  The seller ships rapidly (arrived next day).  The shampoo builds to a nice lather with a good menthol tingle.  It absolutely reduces scalp flakes caused by using minoxidil, which I appreciate.  As other reviewers have stated, your hair emerges from the shower looking and feeling a little more voluminous and I am noticing fewer hairs falling out.  Is it a cure-all? Of course not.  But this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using formula 500 for the past 3weeks. I have seen a big difference in my hair. Its thicker and I don&#x27;t have so much fall out. I&#x27;m looking forward to getting some more. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have not use yet but already know it works because I was told by a friend.Thanks. Thelma</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while now and it has no clear results. My hair is no thicker or thinner than it was before I started using it. I suppose you could say that it&#x27;s working because I&#x27;m not losing what little hair I have on top, but it&#x27;s not coming back or thickening either.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and packed well. I was surprise to see a hair loss somewhere at the back part of my head, so I have been searching for  something natural to help with the problem. I got this product because I have heard a some good reviews about it. I just started using and so far I have not seen any hair gain, but I understand that it will not happen  overnight, although I notice that after I used it, then when I  comb my hair, I notice that aren&#x27;t  falling much  than it used to be. So I am looking forward for the full result of using this product. My hair smells good and easy to comb as well :)</li>
            <li> Started using this product about two months ago, so far I don&#x27;t really have any complain about it. My hair looks fuller and the breakage has  reduced.</li>
            <li> When I turned 30 I started to notice a few gray hairs.  What worried me most was my growing widow&#x27;s peak and receding hairline.  This stuff is GREAT! Since I started using this formula500 I&#x27;ve managed to keep my hair right where it is....For the time being!</li>
            <li> I was experiencing postpartum hair loss and been searching for right product to help myself out, after reading the reviews I bought this one, now I had used it for a few weeks, I did see my hair on the temples a little bit thicker. I donot really know whether it is just a nature recovery or it came from the shampoo. However, the shampoo is nice smelled and felt freshed after use. I think I am gonna to give it some more try.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good. I like using something that won&#x27;t harm my hair and instead nourish it. The reason for the 4 star is because I did notice this shampoo completely stop my hair from falling out, BUT it does not really help a receding hair line regrow lost hair from my experience. I even leave it in the hair for 10 to 15 minutes sometimes until I wash it out. This is why I am giving the second bottle of Formula500 (free bottle soon to be shipped to me thanks to the Formula500 folks) a second chance. Let&#x27;s see if it helps me out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> This product sees to clean my hair just fine, also it does have a nice perfume smell to it but it&#x27;s not too strong smelling.</li>
            <li> The formula 500 seems to work pretty good.  It is expensive though for such small bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year and absolutely love it.  Wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else.  It makes my hair feel thicker and very manageable.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I have noticed that my hair seems thicker, more manageable, and back to the way it was before I had my son. I will definitely be purchasing again. Seller is also very nice and great to deal with.</li>
