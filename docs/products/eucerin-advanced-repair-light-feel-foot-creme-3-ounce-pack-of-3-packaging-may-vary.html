            <li>This stuff is inexpensive and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>and I am hoping to have nice presentable feet by summer.  </li>
            <li>It is effective.  </li>
            <li>(i have my own gym in my basement) to increase my ankle strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>soon.very nice</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best foot cream I have ever used--and</li>
            <li>It is an excellent remedy, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>this product is your new best friend.</li>
            <li>I have used every lotion and creme you can name and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Wonderful thus far.</li>
            <li>So far, the best foot cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be the best cream we&#x27;ve found so far  </li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li>after the first tube, my feet felt and looked great.</li>
            <li>Great product, does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>but it is not too runny and has a very light scent plus it is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>My feet have never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have tried many foot creams.  </li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, i am sooo glad that i didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>Better than anything I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I put on socks after applying, which seems to help it work better.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t truly satisfied.</li>
            <li>love it use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I love to go barefoot</li>
            <li>I just love it after every pedicure.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients you will find Urea toward the top of the list.  </li>
            <li>In frustration, I turned to Amazon and found I could order a 3-pack at a better price than any of the stores, and no waiting for them to get a supply in.</li>
            <li>This is more of a creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>If you chose to use any of the abrasive foot products or pumish stones be sure to use them before applying this product.</li>
            <li>as many of the stores that claim they carry the product carry Eucerin products but often not this specifc product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li>However, it is not a miracle cream and you have to be diligent about putting it on regularly if you want to see the best results.</li>
            <li>This Creme works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used presriptions and many many creams and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have problems with cracking heels and have tried many products.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have bought this brand and in my opinion it is the best one I have tried.</li>
            <li>I particularlly love the Eucerin foot creme.  </li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li>I love this foot lotion</li>
            <li>This is the best and the only foot cream I use -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams.  </li>
            <li>This one softens immediately and more over time because of the exfoliation ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t skip a day, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I will never be able to do without this cream for the rest of my life</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I have try every thing that is out there this foot cream will start healing in days and the more you use it the better it gets, your feet that is .</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you use it every day for even a week you will definitely see great results!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and am really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Useful,my mom love it</li>
            <li>Looks like I will continue the search for something better.</li>
            <li>It is really more of a lotion than a cream</li>
            <li>The cream is very easy to apply and easily rubs in.</li>
            <li>The one good thing about it is it soaks in mostly right away, so you don&#x27;t have to do the cover up with socks and let it soak all night thing.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!!</li>
            <li>pretty good cream for the feet.</li>
            <li>and this is the best winter my feet have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>But still, it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme, Plus Intensive Repair is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Absorbed right into tissue and makes skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, smooth and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for dry feet!</li>
            <li>I put some on either at night or during the day under footies and in 7-10 days, my heels were completely soft as if I had just had a great pedicure.  </li>
            <li>so I easily get cracked feet.  </li>
            <li>Best foot cream I&#x27;ve tried so far at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my feet, but loved it so much I use it as a hand cream, too.</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST foot creme.</li>
            <li>This stuff would be fine if all you do is sit around.</li>
            <li>and I have way fewer fine lines than my like age friends.</li>
            <li>My feet feel better after the first day of using it!</li>
            <li>Lo and behold - it&#x27;s available on Amazon. com</li>
            <li>That skin feels noticeably softer to the touch and every bit as importantly, the skin on my feet stops \\&quot;shedding!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you put it on at night, then sleep in socks, when you awaken, your feet will feel smooth and moistened.</li>
            <li>as a side benefit, applying it with my hands means my hands get silky smooth too.</li>
            <li>I had obtained a free sample with a bottle of Eucerin Plus, but then I couldn&#x27;t ever find the foot creme in the store.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days his &amp;#34;man feet&amp;#34; are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>Really helps would do better if I used it more often.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable when compared to other AHA foot products found on Amazon and elsewhere but best of all it works for me, even better than the AVON stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for offering this product!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels clean.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference at all between using normal body lotion vs. this stuff on my feet.</li>
            <li>Healed my wife&#x27;s heels significantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This really works excellent for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, the feet will feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different foot repair products but this by far is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizing for dry diabetic skin.</li>
            <li>This works great on my dry, scaly feet.  </li>
            <li>Does as advertised but nothing special for me.</li>
            <li>I discovered this cream by accident and cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had the amazing success of soft, healed, feet that don&#x27;t scratch and catch on all of my clothes and socks that I put on!</li>
            <li>best results, rub this in carefully; take about one or even two minutes to apply it, rubbing it in so that it will get completely into your skin.</li>
            <li>Use it every day and you should see improvement relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>This cream fit the bill of being light and absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li>it is super moisturizing and not greasy.</li>
            <li>This creme absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie who tried many, may high end brands.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of moisturizing dry skin.</li>
            <li>Good price and takes care of dry skin.</li>
            <li>but if you want soft feet, please buy this :)</li>
            <li>This will exfoliate and soften your feet in 1-2 days worth of usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other heel creams, but this one is better than most.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in and does not leave a greasy or oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right before bed.</li>
            <li>I like to use this at night or right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of more weeks of treatment or if I used it more often during day I&#x27;m sure it would be almost completely clear of dried skin.</li>
            <li>I also live near the beach in warm climate</li>
            <li>The bottoms of my feet feel great - no more cracks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but it cause skin turn dark</li>
            <li>If you have run of the mill kind of dry feet, maybe this cream will work for you.  </li>
            <li>like it.it is very very well.i</li>
            <li>So maybe if you want a little moisture, but then want to put on a pair of sandals, this is a good lotion.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand to anyone!!</li>
            <li>I apply the creme when I get into bed at night and now have soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I was very impressed and will use Eucerin from now on.</li>
            <li>I find it to be helpful for the entire day; and it works well overnight to keep my skin in better shape then, too.</li>
            <li>No foul odor and really works!</li>
            <li>Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I could finally find it.</li>
            <li>After my Diabetes Therapist gave me a tiny sample tube of this, I searched most of the stores in my area.</li>
            <li>Have tried everything for years and this is the first time something has worked.</li>
            <li>But I also tried vasoline and that actually work better than this so try whatever is cheaper.</li>
            <li>After the first tube was gone I ordered a three-pack.</li>
            <li>Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
            <li>my experience, you need to make sure you use enough of this when you apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the only thing that seems to have worked in many years of trying...</li>
            <li>I used the first 3 tubes, ran out,</li>
            <li>Works much better than just using regular moisture lotion.  </li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Calluses on our heels are heels and feet are now soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Used this consistently but have not noticed results after three weeks.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I have only been able to find online and Amazon is cheaper than the others.</li>
            <li>Best lotion for dry skin that gets little bumps, I use it allover.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s a good looking older guy - who is not married...</li>
            <li>Also great for my big toes that tend to want to have ingrown toenails - keeps the nails soft enough</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a long time and am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good that a small quantity is sufficient for one application.</li>
            <li>I have tried many potions and lotions and creams, many far more expensive, but why fool around reinventing the wheel...</li>
            <li>but sometimes need to put on more than once in a day as dry skin reappears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with severe dry skin and cracking/peeling feet for many years.  </li>
            <li>It makes my feet super soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet very soft and cannot find it any more in local stores.</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and it seems to be working fine for me &amp; my two feet and 10 toes.</li>
            <li>My feet turn smooth and sandal ready instantly.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizes your feet and you&#x27;ll have smooth feet from now on...especially with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>My feet were very cracked.</li>
            <li>It was very watery, compared to what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker and feels like you can really rub it in well.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working very well.  </li>
            <li>Amlactin also has a foot cream that looks promising - but again, pricey.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these for a whole year</li>
            <li>an fabulous the next day  </li>
            <li>in spite of the creme is too liquid, it really works.</li>
            <li>Ordering at Amazon is much easier than trying to find a drugstore that carries it.</li>
            <li>During the summer I have problems with my heels getting dry/cracked (to much going barefoot).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, it absorbs fast, and it has no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good.i</li>
            <li>The Eucerin cream started bringing relief immediately, with regular use keeps my feet smooth and crack-free.  </li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>i order 3 of the 3 packs its much cheaper .</li>
            <li>I reluctantly share with my sister, who loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I am on my second order from Amazon of the Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme and I am so very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I apply this to my feet and are clearing up right away and so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products</li>
            <li>Even though this creme is a lot thinner than others, it has given me better results than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>works well on dry and cracked feet..absorbs easily and will use this for a remedy for sore, cracked feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme goes into my skin so easily without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>After the first night of putting on Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme, my feet were soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Live this stuff!</li>
            <li>Seriously this is the best lotion on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>Ive looked everywhere for a good lotion for my extreme dry feet.</li>
            <li>If you religiously use it every night, it will definitely get better.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that since I like to use a lot at a time overnight (I probably use too much), the tube goes pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Truly amazed by this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like my moisturizers a little more creamier where they do not leave residue on your hands.  </li>
            <li>My cream arrived a business day early!!</li>
            <li>Not thick and greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I have all the normal \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll stick with normal body lotion.</li>
            <li>So I decided to buy a few more for my mom.</li>
            <li>I discovered this lotion at Wal-Mart a few years ago and they don&#x27;t have it any more.</li>
            <li>In addition, the manufacturer claims this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;greasy;\\&quot; and essentially they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>this creme works very well on dry foot skin, it&#x27;s not greasy in seconds after applied, keeps skin smooth for several days.</li>
            <li>, well i use for years on Dogs a cream called &amp;#34;veterinaria la Tia&amp;#34; (Veterinary de la Tia&amp;#34;) to cure dogs from sarna and Hot spots and this oitment always been very efective with results and a little of 2 days,  </li>
            <li>I could not believe that I have actually found something that really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first cream that actually heals cracks and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>Actually softens my cracked heels more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried over the years, including coconut oil and emu oil.</li>
            <li>(Walmart used to carry it, but not any longer) and I&#x27;ve tried several other foot creams, but most are greasy or feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This goes on a little greasy, but quickly dries and I feel like it does a much better job of keeping my feet soft than any of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>WHile my case may not be typical I had to have a product that is Paraben Free.</li>
            <li>I realize that it is through routine, applying any natural ingredient cream morning and night to dry feet, that keeps dry skin in much better shape.</li>
            <li>Expected to see results quickly.</li>
            <li>After a week or two of use all over my feet, I was able to drop down to just using on my heels and using regular moisturizer on my feet.</li>
            <li>After a few nights of using this my heels show huge improvement in dryness and cracking.</li>
            <li>My podiatrist recommended that I use this cream to keep the skin surrounding the nail soft.  </li>
            <li>When I apply this quite thoroughly, maybe even twice at a time, and then I put on a pair of soft socks as another reviewer mentions,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young 68 years old.</li>
            <li>and my feet are so soft.  </li>
            <li>I will be using natural creams from now on.</li>
            <li>This creme changes scaly old feet into soft and sleek baby feet.</li>
            <li>Not only does it immediately soften any rough spots, your feet will instantly feel better, refreshed.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet feel so soft and moisturized, without them feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>Completely healed cracked heels (though my heels were not yet at the &amp;#34;critically cracked&amp;#34; stage).</li>
            <li>I will keep this product in stock and swear by it completely.</li>
            <li>I use the Eucerin foot creme after my shower every day, and my heels stay reasonably soft.  </li>
            <li>in the morning my feet are so soft and any cracking is gone.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it in the stores in my hometown for several weeks; so I order it from Amazon now and have it in just a few days after I place my order.</li>
            <li>urea is supposedly what you really want to moisturize thick calloused feet) that I wouldlike to try next, instead of using two different things, but it seems kind of pricey, compared to using the two items.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products in the past!  </li>
            <li>I will not buy again as not really any better than other creams, smells &amp; feels synthetic.</li>
            <li>My heels are like two little baby butt cheeks - just so soft and sweet.  </li>
            <li>Not thick enough if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Really creamy, soothing to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>after years of sores and cracked dry feet this really works .</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is much cheaper than at a traditional big box pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>That may be common sense to most people but after being an R.N. for 40+ years I have learned that explain in details so nothing is left to misinterpretation.</li>
            <li>It is good, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can&#x27;t see why people would give it the same review as the Fountain of Youth.</li>
            <li>I have rough, cracked and calloused feet that need a LOT more than what this lotion provides; I might as well have used plain water.</li>
            <li>is made of natural ingredientes and is very efective and cheaper than any other cream</li>
            <li>Light, hardly any scent.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly the  dry, rough skin soften up after using it only a week.</li>
            <li>The first pump takes a long long time to come out.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps keep the bottom of my &amp;#34;hooves&amp;#34; soft and helps heal my cracked heels.</li>
            <li>so I frequently wear flip-flops or open shoes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li>unguento veterinaria la tia cure the sarna and hot spots on dogs in less than a week.</li>
            <li>I tries several other products before this one, because they were significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I live in Northern California where it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>Went skiing after 4 days use and got a massive blister on both heels because the skin just delaminated it was so softened (no change in boots, socks, or anything else in 5 yrs).&lt;br /&gt;One side ulcerated and is still being professionally treated 3 months later.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few solutions with mixed success.</li>
            <li>The skin is smooth - no more dry peeling skin.</li>
            <li>I have also found that I only need to use a little bit of this cream as it absorbs very well and a little bit covers a greater area than previous creams that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I used to not bother creaming my feet after showering as the numerous previous creams that I tried took a lot more effort to apply and only lasted a few hours, but this cream keeps my feet feeling soft all day and all night long.</li>
            <li>My wife purchased this for her feet, and I decided to give it a try for the first time a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I decided to break down and order some - and really stock up, so I ordered the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li>Once I put the cream on my feet the cracked skin immediately looked healed and it was no longer dry, but moist and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This however one application and my dry skin was completely gone.</li>
            <li>this lotion really gets deep into that dry, rough skin and finally moisturizes it!  </li>
            <li>I was much happier with the Eucerine Plus Intensive Repair body cream in the little four-ounce tub than I was with this.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is an excellent remedy, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this product is your new best friend.</li>
            <li> I have used every lotion and creme you can name and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Wonderful thus far.</li>
            <li> So far, the best foot cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be the best cream we&#x27;ve found so far  </li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly!</li>
            <li> after the first tube, my feet felt and looked great.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> but it is not too runny and has a very light scent plus it is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> My feet have never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried many foot creams.  </li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, i am sooo glad that i didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I put on socks after applying, which seems to help it work better.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t truly satisfied.</li>
            <li> love it use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love to go barefoot</li>
            <li> I just love it after every pedicure.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients you will find Urea toward the top of the list.  </li>
            <li> In frustration, I turned to Amazon and found I could order a 3-pack at a better price than any of the stores, and no waiting for them to get a supply in.</li>
            <li> This is more of a creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> If you chose to use any of the abrasive foot products or pumish stones be sure to use them before applying this product.</li>
            <li> as many of the stores that claim they carry the product carry Eucerin products but often not this specifc product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li> However, it is not a miracle cream and you have to be diligent about putting it on regularly if you want to see the best results.</li>
            <li> This Creme works fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used presriptions and many many creams and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with cracking heels and have tried many products.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this brand and in my opinion it is the best one I have tried.</li>
            <li> I particularlly love the Eucerin foot creme.  </li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li> I love this foot lotion</li>
            <li> This is the best and the only foot cream I use -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams.  </li>
            <li> This one softens immediately and more over time because of the exfoliation ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skip a day, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I will never be able to do without this cream for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have try every thing that is out there this foot cream will start healing in days and the more you use it the better it gets, your feet that is .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you use it every day for even a week you will definitely see great results!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and am really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Useful,my mom love it</li>
            <li> Looks like I will continue the search for something better.</li>
            <li> It is really more of a lotion than a cream</li>
            <li> The cream is very easy to apply and easily rubs in.</li>
            <li> The one good thing about it is it soaks in mostly right away, so you don&#x27;t have to do the cover up with socks and let it soak all night thing.  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!!</li>
            <li> pretty good cream for the feet.</li>
            <li> and this is the best winter my feet have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> But still, it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme, Plus Intensive Repair is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> Absorbed right into tissue and makes skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, smooth and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for dry feet!</li>
            <li> I put some on either at night or during the day under footies and in 7-10 days, my heels were completely soft as if I had just had a great pedicure.  </li>
            <li> so I easily get cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> Best foot cream I&#x27;ve tried so far at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my feet, but loved it so much I use it as a hand cream, too.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST foot creme.</li>
            <li> This stuff would be fine if all you do is sit around.</li>
            <li> and I have way fewer fine lines than my like age friends.</li>
            <li> My feet feel better after the first day of using it!</li>
            <li> Lo and behold - it&#x27;s available on Amazon. com</li>
            <li> That skin feels noticeably softer to the touch and every bit as importantly, the skin on my feet stops \\&quot;shedding!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you put it on at night, then sleep in socks, when you awaken, your feet will feel smooth and moistened.</li>
            <li> as a side benefit, applying it with my hands means my hands get silky smooth too.</li>
            <li> I had obtained a free sample with a bottle of Eucerin Plus, but then I couldn&#x27;t ever find the foot creme in the store.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days his &amp;#34;man feet&amp;#34; are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> Really helps would do better if I used it more often.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable when compared to other AHA foot products found on Amazon and elsewhere but best of all it works for me, even better than the AVON stuff.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for offering this product!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and feels clean.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference at all between using normal body lotion vs. this stuff on my feet.</li>
            <li> Healed my wife&#x27;s heels significantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This really works excellent for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, the feet will feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different foot repair products but this by far is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizing for dry diabetic skin.</li>
            <li> This works great on my dry, scaly feet.  </li>
            <li> Does as advertised but nothing special for me.</li>
            <li> I discovered this cream by accident and cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had the amazing success of soft, healed, feet that don&#x27;t scratch and catch on all of my clothes and socks that I put on!</li>
            <li> best results, rub this in carefully; take about one or even two minutes to apply it, rubbing it in so that it will get completely into your skin.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and you should see improvement relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> This cream fit the bill of being light and absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li> it is super moisturizing and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This creme absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, better than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie who tried many, may high end brands.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of moisturizing dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good price and takes care of dry skin.</li>
            <li> but if you want soft feet, please buy this :)</li>
            <li> This will exfoliate and soften your feet in 1-2 days worth of usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other heel creams, but this one is better than most.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in and does not leave a greasy or oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I put it on right before bed.</li>
            <li> I like to use this at night or right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of more weeks of treatment or if I used it more often during day I&#x27;m sure it would be almost completely clear of dried skin.</li>
            <li> I also live near the beach in warm climate</li>
            <li> The bottoms of my feet feel great - no more cracks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but it cause skin turn dark</li>
            <li> If you have run of the mill kind of dry feet, maybe this cream will work for you.  </li>
            <li> like it.it is very very well.i</li>
            <li> So maybe if you want a little moisture, but then want to put on a pair of sandals, this is a good lotion.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I apply the creme when I get into bed at night and now have soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was very impressed and will use Eucerin from now on.</li>
            <li> I find it to be helpful for the entire day; and it works well overnight to keep my skin in better shape then, too.</li>
            <li> No foul odor and really works!</li>
            <li> Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I could finally find it.</li>
            <li> After my Diabetes Therapist gave me a tiny sample tube of this, I searched most of the stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Have tried everything for years and this is the first time something has worked.</li>
            <li> But I also tried vasoline and that actually work better than this so try whatever is cheaper.</li>
            <li> After the first tube was gone I ordered a three-pack.</li>
            <li> Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
            <li> my experience, you need to make sure you use enough of this when you apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the only thing that seems to have worked in many years of trying...</li>
            <li> I used the first 3 tubes, ran out,</li>
            <li> Works much better than just using regular moisture lotion.  </li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> Calluses on our heels are heels and feet are now soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Used this consistently but have not noticed results after three weeks.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I have only been able to find online and Amazon is cheaper than the others.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for dry skin that gets little bumps, I use it allover.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s a good looking older guy - who is not married...</li>
            <li> Also great for my big toes that tend to want to have ingrown toenails - keeps the nails soft enough</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good that a small quantity is sufficient for one application.</li>
            <li> I have tried many potions and lotions and creams, many far more expensive, but why fool around reinventing the wheel...</li>
            <li> but sometimes need to put on more than once in a day as dry skin reappears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with severe dry skin and cracking/peeling feet for many years.  </li>
            <li> It makes my feet super soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet very soft and cannot find it any more in local stores.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and it seems to be working fine for me &amp; my two feet and 10 toes.</li>
            <li> My feet turn smooth and sandal ready instantly.  </li>
            <li> It really moisturizes your feet and you&#x27;ll have smooth feet from now on...especially with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> My feet were very cracked.</li>
            <li> It was very watery, compared to what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker and feels like you can really rub it in well.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working very well.  </li>
            <li> Amlactin also has a foot cream that looks promising - but again, pricey.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these for a whole year</li>
            <li> an fabulous the next day  </li>
            <li> in spite of the creme is too liquid, it really works.</li>
            <li> Ordering at Amazon is much easier than trying to find a drugstore that carries it.</li>
            <li> During the summer I have problems with my heels getting dry/cracked (to much going barefoot).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, it absorbs fast, and it has no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good.i</li>
            <li> The Eucerin cream started bringing relief immediately, with regular use keeps my feet smooth and crack-free.  </li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> i order 3 of the 3 packs its much cheaper .</li>
            <li> I reluctantly share with my sister, who loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I am on my second order from Amazon of the Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme and I am so very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my feet and are clearing up right away and so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products</li>
            <li> Even though this creme is a lot thinner than others, it has given me better results than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> works well on dry and cracked feet..absorbs easily and will use this for a remedy for sore, cracked feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme goes into my skin so easily without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li> After the first night of putting on Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme, my feet were soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Live this stuff!</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best lotion on the market hands down.</li>
            <li> Ive looked everywhere for a good lotion for my extreme dry feet.</li>
            <li> If you religiously use it every night, it will definitely get better.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that since I like to use a lot at a time overnight (I probably use too much), the tube goes pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Truly amazed by this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like my moisturizers a little more creamier where they do not leave residue on your hands.  </li>
            <li> My cream arrived a business day early!!</li>
            <li> Not thick and greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have all the normal \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll stick with normal body lotion.</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy a few more for my mom.</li>
            <li> I discovered this lotion at Wal-Mart a few years ago and they don&#x27;t have it any more.</li>
            <li> In addition, the manufacturer claims this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;greasy;\\&quot; and essentially they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> this creme works very well on dry foot skin, it&#x27;s not greasy in seconds after applied, keeps skin smooth for several days.</li>
            <li> , well i use for years on Dogs a cream called &amp;#34;veterinaria la Tia&amp;#34; (Veterinary de la Tia&amp;#34;) to cure dogs from sarna and Hot spots and this oitment always been very efective with results and a little of 2 days,  </li>
            <li> I could not believe that I have actually found something that really works!</li>
            <li> This is the first cream that actually heals cracks and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> Actually softens my cracked heels more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried over the years, including coconut oil and emu oil.</li>
            <li> (Walmart used to carry it, but not any longer) and I&#x27;ve tried several other foot creams, but most are greasy or feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This goes on a little greasy, but quickly dries and I feel like it does a much better job of keeping my feet soft than any of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> WHile my case may not be typical I had to have a product that is Paraben Free.</li>
            <li> I realize that it is through routine, applying any natural ingredient cream morning and night to dry feet, that keeps dry skin in much better shape.</li>
            <li> Expected to see results quickly.</li>
            <li> After a week or two of use all over my feet, I was able to drop down to just using on my heels and using regular moisturizer on my feet.</li>
            <li> After a few nights of using this my heels show huge improvement in dryness and cracking.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended that I use this cream to keep the skin surrounding the nail soft.  </li>
            <li> When I apply this quite thoroughly, maybe even twice at a time, and then I put on a pair of soft socks as another reviewer mentions,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 68 years old.</li>
            <li> and my feet are so soft.  </li>
            <li> I will be using natural creams from now on.</li>
            <li> This creme changes scaly old feet into soft and sleek baby feet.</li>
            <li> Not only does it immediately soften any rough spots, your feet will instantly feel better, refreshed.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet feel so soft and moisturized, without them feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Completely healed cracked heels (though my heels were not yet at the &amp;#34;critically cracked&amp;#34; stage).</li>
            <li> I will keep this product in stock and swear by it completely.</li>
            <li> I use the Eucerin foot creme after my shower every day, and my heels stay reasonably soft.  </li>
            <li> in the morning my feet are so soft and any cracking is gone.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find it in the stores in my hometown for several weeks; so I order it from Amazon now and have it in just a few days after I place my order.</li>
            <li> urea is supposedly what you really want to moisturize thick calloused feet) that I wouldlike to try next, instead of using two different things, but it seems kind of pricey, compared to using the two items.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past!  </li>
            <li> I will not buy again as not really any better than other creams, smells &amp; feels synthetic.</li>
            <li> My heels are like two little baby butt cheeks - just so soft and sweet.  </li>
            <li> Not thick enough if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Really creamy, soothing to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> after years of sores and cracked dry feet this really works .</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is much cheaper than at a traditional big box pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> That may be common sense to most people but after being an R.N. for 40+ years I have learned that explain in details so nothing is left to misinterpretation.</li>
            <li> It is good, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can&#x27;t see why people would give it the same review as the Fountain of Youth.</li>
            <li> I have rough, cracked and calloused feet that need a LOT more than what this lotion provides; I might as well have used plain water.</li>
            <li> is made of natural ingredientes and is very efective and cheaper than any other cream</li>
            <li> Light, hardly any scent.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quickly the  dry, rough skin soften up after using it only a week.</li>
            <li> The first pump takes a long long time to come out.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps keep the bottom of my &amp;#34;hooves&amp;#34; soft and helps heal my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> so I frequently wear flip-flops or open shoes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> unguento veterinaria la tia cure the sarna and hot spots on dogs in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I tries several other products before this one, because they were significantly cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I live in Northern California where it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Went skiing after 4 days use and got a massive blister on both heels because the skin just delaminated it was so softened (no change in boots, socks, or anything else in 5 yrs).&lt;br /&gt;One side ulcerated and is still being professionally treated 3 months later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few solutions with mixed success.</li>
            <li> The skin is smooth - no more dry peeling skin.</li>
            <li> I have also found that I only need to use a little bit of this cream as it absorbs very well and a little bit covers a greater area than previous creams that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used to not bother creaming my feet after showering as the numerous previous creams that I tried took a lot more effort to apply and only lasted a few hours, but this cream keeps my feet feeling soft all day and all night long.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for her feet, and I decided to give it a try for the first time a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I decided to break down and order some - and really stock up, so I ordered the 3 pack.  </li>
            <li> Once I put the cream on my feet the cracked skin immediately looked healed and it was no longer dry, but moist and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This however one application and my dry skin was completely gone.</li>
            <li> this lotion really gets deep into that dry, rough skin and finally moisturizes it!  </li>
            <li> I was much happier with the Eucerine Plus Intensive Repair body cream in the little four-ounce tub than I was with this.  </li>
            <li> After years of putting up with ugly dry cracked heals- after 3 weeks of consistent nightly use - my heals are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where summers are very dry and during sandal weather, my feet become dry and often cracked even with regular pedicures.</li>
            <li> I am 74 yrs old and find that my feet develop dry rough skin.  </li>
            <li> My feet were so dry and starting to get deep cracks in them.</li>
            <li> Eucerin has at least half a dozen other moisturizers, both in a creamy formula and in an ointment formula (under their Aquaphor label) that work much better on calloused, cracked feet than this one does.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I could not find it anywhere; so, we tried several others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this particular formula that makes it especially meant for feet.</li>
            <li> If you have extra dry skin</li>
            <li> using on dry cracked heels and is improving daily.  </li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of formulas to fight dry skin all my life, the dry skin would just come back the next day.</li>
            <li> I have had patches of dry skin on my back as well as my legs that even prescription prescribed medication could not cure they would just reoccur after I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> but then back to yucky dry feet after a night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> Now after 2 weeks the heavy callouses are nearly gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and always come back to Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I get the biggest cracks in my heels and understand that it is some kind of &amp;#34;bacteria&amp;#34; or something but the uriac acid in the product puts a stop to the crack and ugly, and unsightly feet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of thick, heavy lotions, especially when it is already hot and humid out.</li>
            <li> When I found this type of Eucerin&#x27;s \\&quot;Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme Plus Intensive Repair\\&quot; lotion for moisturizing the skin on my feet, I tried it</li>
            <li> I bought this foot creme because of the dry, cracking skin, yada, yada.</li>
            <li> Being a diabetic my skin is horribly dry, but God sent an angel in the form of eucerine to heal my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is this substance that makes all the difference in the repair of dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> As I hit my mid-30&#x27;s, I noticed it was my feet that were rather dry, with callouses forming and even cracking.  </li>
            <li> extremely* dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li> but it is helpful with dry skin.</li>
            <li> noticeable difference overnight, but took about 2 weeks to fully repair my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry feet</li>
            <li> I am a senior, suffer from dry skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> This is THE foot cream you need for your dry heels.</li>
            <li> I had dry peeling soles, but after one week of using this foot creme twice a day (once in the morning and another before bed), my feet were noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> I have really dry cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect any miracles for feet that were dry as a desert and had severe cuts at 2-3 places but</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked heels</li>
            <li> i suffer of dry feet and bad odors for many years and Eucerin give me barely to no results.</li>
            <li> these are samples could have gotten for 2 dollars not normal size as described</li>
            <li> I recommend it to whoever has a dry heel problem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used half a tube.</li>
            <li> (If I don&#x27;t use this, my heels get dry and rough.)  </li>
            <li> When I started using this product my feet were very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on the bottom of my foot.  </li>
            <li> The bottoms of my feet were very dry, cracked, and embarrassingly unsightly.</li>
            <li> My feet were very dry and my doctor suggested scheduling a visit with podiatrist.</li>
            <li> dry, brittle and hard, especially on the heel and big toe.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Cream was listed in the top three recommendations, and the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very dry, rough man feet.  </li>
            <li> That is why I buy three tubes at a time, but nonetheless, three tubes will last you several months at least.</li>
            <li> My heels were deeply cracked and heavily calloused.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used alone, that is, you have to exfoliate the rough parts of your skin, but once you&#x27;ve done that, use this cream and then bank all the money you will save on not going for an unsanitary pedicure.</li>
            <li> Keeps them from getting cracked and rough.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works to prevent dried out heels in Arizona.</li>
            <li> I have been told by dermatologists that this tends to make the feet drier and causes rough skin.</li>
            <li> If your feet are rough this creme will soften them.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone that has rough feet.</li>
            <li> stop buying all this crappys expensive creams with long or no results, i will recomend everybody to use La tia oitment (La tia pomada&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li> If your feet are still wet from a shower, you will have a bit of a time rubbing the cream in due to the glycerin, but eventually you will.</li>
            <li> If you have cracked ugly heels, look no further, order right away!</li>
            <li> It has no scent, and is thick and creamy, almost petroleum-like (similar to vaseline) but not nearly as greasy, its the glycerin that has that affect.</li>
            <li> oh and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before purchasing because I&#x27;ve tried other products without any results.</li>
            <li> Would not use any other foot creme.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his heels and he&#x27;s not fond of it because it is extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> I only apply it once a day after my shower and usually put on socks afterwards.</li>
            <li> IR and diabetes are kind of related - I know the IR/PCOS came from my dad&#x27;s side of the family - and I think the nasty feet did, too.      </li>
            <li> It probably doesn&#x27;t help that I try to walk 5 miles a day and stay active</li>
            <li> I put this on in the evening (or whenever I have a few hours without wearing shoes) and put on a pair of socks, and it has helped my heels to not be so dry.</li>
            <li> The description claims that it is an AHA product, but there aren&#x27;t any ingredients in it that are listed as the active AHAs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter that is having trouble with dry heels.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff I have to say was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> No more dry skin on my feet at all.</li>
            <li> Thick consistency means it goes further, use less per application, costs less per use. --</li>
            <li> was very anxious to recieve the next tubes.  </li>
            <li> And I slipped with my routine and usually end up only applying once a day - usually at night.</li>
            <li> Yes, you might have to rub off a slight residue from your hands after you&#x27;ve applied the lotion; but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and I feel a slight difference.</li>
            <li> This product is slightly sticky, as well.</li>
            <li> No issues with application nor odd smell that others have stated.  </li>
            <li> , you can buy it on ebay or amazon or at any hispanic store for less than online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first winter in a long time, I have not had the painful cracks on my heels.</li>
            <li> Even those are less severe this year.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for anyone who suffers from dry skin on their feet.</li>
            <li> Little too runny.  </li>
            <li> I find it leaves skin a little tacky though.</li>
            <li> Please use it at night because your foot will be fatty</li>
            <li> my husband uses this everyday before putting on his socks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my feet that were heavily parched (even cut) from prolonged negligence.</li>
            <li> Melts into skin and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too runny, you can&#x27;t really rub it in to thick, tough skin like you can a serious pasty sort of lotion.  </li>
            <li> If you have particularily bad feet, use it consistently over a longer period of time and you will see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would actually work.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, usually after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally usually Miss Oops and was looking for a cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li> I prefer small tubes to have at home, for gymnastique, travels...</li>
            <li> Not sure if its helping with calluses</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s coincidence or not</li>
            <li> I have never been crazy about feet in general, and mine specifically.  </li>
            <li> I have a very bad case of dry skin on my feet especially around my heels; I tried a couple other moisturizing creams</li>
            <li> As others have said it is hard to find in the store, so thank you Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> This cream is the must for the foot cracked and hard skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything you could imagine - razors, rasps, all sorts of salves and lotions - wearing icky socks overnight.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get your husband to get a pedi or see a podiatrist about his feet that feel like course sandpaper on you when they touch your legs in bed then at least try this.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times per week.  </li>
            <li> Even my toenails are no longer thick or cracked.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not as thick as you would think for a creme</li>
            <li> but it has a thick lotion consistency.</li>
            <li> Someone else mentioned it is THICK.  </li>
            <li> He has thick callouses and sometimes they crack.  </li>
            <li> Working 12 hour shifts as a nurse leads my poor feet to be sad, sore, and they tend to be dry.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is impossible to find it is in any store.</li>
            <li> Hope it will help her in cold and dry winter</li>
            <li> I exercise at least 6X a week and am very hard on my feet.</li>
            <li> Yoga class was getting a little awkward but no more.</li>
            <li> Few days of usage took care of the feet and expensive treatment that a podiatrist would have provided.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll hardly ever need to file them again!</li>
            <li> Well, mine are pretty nasty.  </li>
            <li> But I find it tough to do it.</li>
            <li> I go tired of the running around checking so ordered in online.</li>
            <li> After a month, the difference is dramatic.</li>
            <li> My heels crack so badly and have formed thick calluses.</li>
            <li> Slather it on, be generous, its not that expensive.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon, for providing items that are difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by the results.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I am doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> But if your feet are hard core nasty and you are hard core about fixing them - this isn&#x27;t what you want.      </li>
            <li> They are dry, cracked, calloused - ugly feet!!  </li>
            <li> Thus, my feet can get a bit dry and nasty looking after awhile.</li>
            <li> I have a serious chapped heel and cracked toes problem that gets very painful.</li>
            <li> I have thick, nasty callouses on my feet.  </li>
            <li> This often results in painful cracks on my heels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, the bottom of my feet were BAD!</li>
            <li> The sort of cream you need for your feet is going to depend in part on how nasty your feet are.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my feet turning nasty around the age of 8, which is also when puberty started to creep up on me, which is also probably when PCOS began to rear its head.  </li>
            <li> Diabetics supposedly tend towards nasty feet.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible problems with cracked feet in the summer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My feet have never looked or felt better.  The skin is smooth - no more dry peeling skin. Even my toenails are no longer thick or cracked.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but could be thicker.  Does a good job of moisturizing dry skin. I use it all over, not just for feet.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried many foot creams.  None of them worked.  I had consulted my pediatrist concerning what foot cream to use.  He suggested this.  It works wonderfully.  For a long time, I could not find it anywhere; so, we tried several others.  We have not been able to find anything that works as good as this.</li>
            <li> Beyond a doubt this is the best foot cream I have ever purchased. Gone is the crusty skin and in record time. I have lymphodema and this has my feet and ankles looking amazing. I also use the Eucerin cream in the jar and it is also the best I have ever used on my legs. I highly recommend this brand to anyone!!</li>
            <li> works well on dry and cracked feet..absorbs easily and will use this for a remedy for sore, cracked feet.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth for about a month on what foot cream to buy. I decided to buy this one but I read that it was watery. So I had made up in my mind that I would refuse the package and return it. So I missed the mail carrier and decided to open it. Oh my goodness, i am sooo glad that i didn&#x27;t return it. I love it! My feet feel better after the first day of using it! No, it&#x27;s not as thick as you would think for a creme but it has a thick lotion consistency. I really love it! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere but if you want soft feet, please buy this :)</li>
            <li> Better than anything I have ever found.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended that I use this cream to keep the skin surrounding the nail soft.  I have been using this cream faithfully and I have not suffered another ingrown toenail since!  The only problem is that it is impossible to find it is in any store.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where summers are very dry and during sandal weather, my feet become dry and often cracked even with regular pedicures. I found this product in August and within two days, there was a noticeable difference. I apply the creme when I get into bed at night and now have soft, smooth skin. It&#x27;s inexpensive and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine but could not locate in any store.  Lo and behold - it&#x27;s available on Amazon. com and it works wonders!  I put some on either at night or during the day under footies and in 7-10 days, my heels were completely soft as if I had just had a great pedicure.  I&#x27;ve already told friends about this product.  I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I am 74 yrs old and find that my feet develop dry rough skin.  Regular use of the Foot Creme helps the condition.  It&#x27;s also good that a small quantity is sufficient for one application.</li>
            <li> buy for my mom. Hope it will help her in cold and dry winter</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great manufacturer.  This is the real deal.  If you have dry/cracked feet, this will help.  I put on socks after applying, which seems to help it work better.  Dont worry about it being just for &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34;.  You can use your hands to apply the lotion without risk of hurting your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN OR ELSE IT GET THE CRACKED FEETS AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a while and it is the best ever.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for dry skin that gets little bumps, I use it allover. Nothing has ever worked as well.</li>
            <li> I have used gold bond foot cream, but IT DID NOT WORK! So, I found this on Amazon and got it. It was delivered very quickly! I have used for 3 weeks and my feet feel wonderful! No more dry skin on my feet at all. I could not believe that I have actually found something that really works! Will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> It works. Yoga class was getting a little awkward but no more.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would actually work. I&#x27;ve used everything you could imagine - razors, rasps, all sorts of salves and lotions - wearing icky socks overnight. My heels were deeply cracked and heavily calloused. I used this and in two days the deep cracks in my heels were gone. I was amazed. I never wore socks with it - applied twice a day only. Now after 2 weeks the heavy callouses are nearly gone! And I slipped with my routine and usually end up only applying once a day - usually at night. Needless to say I was very impressed and will use Eucerin from now on. I still have two tubes to go too!</li>
            <li> I have a very bad case of dry skin on my feet especially around my heels; I tried a couple other moisturizing creams but I wasn&#x27;t truly satisfied. When I found this type of Eucerin&#x27;s \\&quot;Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme Plus Intensive Repair\\&quot; lotion for moisturizing the skin on my feet, I tried it and I was very pleased. When I apply this quite thoroughly, maybe even twice at a time, and then I put on a pair of soft socks as another reviewer mentions, this lotion really gets deep into that dry, rough skin and finally moisturizes it!  That skin feels noticeably softer to the touch and every bit as importantly, the skin on my feet stops \\&quot;shedding!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, rub this in carefully; take about one or even two minutes to apply it, rubbing it in so that it will get completely into your skin. I find it to be helpful for the entire day; and it works well overnight to keep my skin in better shape then, too. In addition, the manufacturer claims this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;greasy;\\&quot; and essentially they&#x27;re right. Yes, you might have to rub off a slight residue from your hands after you&#x27;ve applied the lotion; but that&#x27;s it. It shouldn&#x27;t get greasy on your feet, especially if you rub it in deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone who suffers from dry skin on their feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 68 years old. I have all the normal \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; anyone my age has. I bought this foot creme because of the dry, cracking skin, yada, yada. It&#x27;s great stuff. After one application my skin has done a 180. I use it twice a week, usually after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve very happy with it and recommend it to anyone needing this type help!</li>
            <li> love it use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream!  I have not been able to find it in the stores in my hometown for several weeks; so I order it from Amazon now and have it in just a few days after I place my order.</li>
            <li> This stuff is inexpensive and amazingly effective. I live in Northern California where it is extremely dry. My feet were very cracked. After the first night of putting on Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme, my feet were soft and smooth. I just use it once a week now and they have stayed that way.</li>
            <li> I discovered this cream by accident and cannot say enough good things about it.  I love to go barefoot so I easily get cracked feet.  This is the first cream that actually heals cracks and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  It goes on smooth and feels clean. If I apply it daily my feet don&#x27;t even crack...but if I forget, this cream will heal a crack in one to two days.  Nothing else has ever worked this well.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this cream are pretty glowing, but I have to say I was not at all impressed.      It was very watery, compared to what I was expecting.  The sort of cream you need for your feet is going to depend in part on how nasty your feet are.  Well, mine are pretty nasty.  I have thick, nasty callouses on my feet.  I think it&#x27;s genetic, as my dad&#x27;s feet are the same way, and it&#x27;s not like we got them that way from a life time of barefoot farm work.  I noticed my feet turning nasty around the age of 8, which is also when puberty started to creep up on me, which is also probably when PCOS began to rear its head.  Diabetics supposedly tend towards nasty feet.  PCOS is supposedly related to insulin resistance.  IR and diabetes are kind of related - I know the IR/PCOS came from my dad&#x27;s side of the family - and I think the nasty feet did, too.      If you have run of the mill kind of dry feet, maybe this cream will work for you.  The one good thing about it is it soaks in mostly right away, so you don&#x27;t have to do the cover up with socks and let it soak all night thing.  So maybe if you want a little moisture, but then want to put on a pair of sandals, this is a good lotion.  But if your feet are hard core nasty and you are hard core about fixing them - this isn&#x27;t what you want.      Maybe it has changed since these reviews were written?  Someone else mentioned it is THICK.  It is not!    I was much happier with the Eucerine Plus Intensive Repair body cream in the little four-ounce tub than I was with this.  It is thicker and feels like you can really rub it in well.  I have been alternating that with flexitol (or store brand flexitol), and scrubbing with a tweezerman Pedro file...  and it&#x27;s been working very well.  Lots of cream + socks at night and I am hoping to have nice presentable feet by summer.  There is another cream made by Kersasal that combines urea and an exfoliant (urea is supposedly what you really want to moisturize thick calloused feet) that I wouldlike to try next, instead of using two different things, but it seems kind of pricey, compared to using the two items.  Amlactin also has a foot cream that looks promising - but again, pricey.  I don&#x27;t know which of those I will go with.  But this stuff I have to say was not worth it.  It&#x27;s just too runny, you can&#x27;t really rub it in to thick, tough skin like you can a serious pasty sort of lotion.  Try the Eucerin Plus in the tub, or something else all together.</li>
            <li> This was recommended  in a magazine I like and it definitely works.</li>
            <li> These is a miracle cream. I have one in my purse, my car, and my gym bag. I have been using these for a whole year and my feet are so soft.  I just love it after every pedicure.</li>
            <li> Eucerin actually sent me some of this a while back, and I&#x27;d almost run out.  I was hoarding it!!  I decided to break down and order some - and really stock up, so I ordered the 3 pack.  I have never been crazy about feet in general, and mine specifically.  They are dry, cracked, calloused - ugly feet!!  Since I started using Eucerin Foot Creme I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my feet!  My heels are like two little baby butt cheeks - just so soft and sweet.  If I ever see anyone who works for Eucerin I may have to kiss them!  Hope it&#x27;s a good looking older guy - who is not married...LOL.</li>
            <li> I will not buy again as not really any better than other creams, smells &amp; feels synthetic. I realize that it is through routine, applying any natural ingredient cream morning and night to dry feet, that keeps dry skin in much better shape. I will be using natural creams from now on.</li>
            <li> Because it works&lt;br /&gt;similar products don&#x27;t work as well&lt;br /&gt;you ask too many questions!  IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Mom to put on her feet. It is the only one that works for her and she loves it.</li>
            <li> pretty good cream for the feet. It works in a few days and really softened the calluses</li>
            <li> I have used every lotion and creme you can name and this is by far the best. I use it on my hands because it is the only product that keeps my dermatitis under control.  I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> Ive looked everywhere for a good lotion for my extreme dry feet. Being a diabetic my skin is horribly dry, but God sent an angel in the form of eucerine to heal my dry skin. Seriously this is the best lotion on the market hands down.</li>
            <li> This creme changes scaly old feet into soft and sleek baby feet. Amazing. It can be used anytime as it&#x27;s not necessary to apply it under socks and sweat all night. Just rub it in, sit a moment, then put on your shoes and go - you won&#x27;t slide out of your flip-flops.</li>
            <li> Only a month into using this product and I feel a slight difference. I&#x27;ve only used half a tube. Wonderful thus far. So far, the best foot cream I&#x27;ve used. To get rid of the roughness and cracked appearance.</li>
            <li> Actually softens my cracked heels more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried over the years, including coconut oil and emu oil.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream there is. No foul odor and really works!</li>
            <li> Believe all the reviews posted, this stuff works. It has no scent, and is thick and creamy, almost petroleum-like (similar to vaseline) but not nearly as greasy, its the glycerin that has that affect. Slather it on, be generous, its not that expensive. Not only does it immediately soften any rough spots, your feet will instantly feel better, refreshed. If you put it on at night, then sleep in socks, when you awaken, your feet will feel smooth and moistened. But you don&#x27;t even have to put on socks, it will still seem to sink in and soften the outer layers of your skin.  If your feet are still wet from a shower, you will have a bit of a time rubbing the cream in due to the glycerin, but eventually you will. Amazingly, the feet will feel soft and smooth an fabulous the next day  for the entire day. I sometimes even use it on my elbows. The only downside is that since I like to use a lot at a time overnight (I probably use too much), the tube goes pretty fast. That is why I buy three tubes at a time, but nonetheless, three tubes will last you several months at least. I have tried many potions and lotions and creams, many far more expensive, but why fool around reinventing the wheel... this... stuff... works! End of story.</li>
            <li> Does a great job with callous feet and/or elbows.  It soothes as well as helps heal.  The Amazon price is much cheaper than at a traditional big box pharmacy.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other heel creams, but this one is better than most.  It is effective.  It can&#x27;t be used alone, that is, you have to exfoliate the rough parts of your skin, but once you&#x27;ve done that, use this cream and then bank all the money you will save on not going for an unsanitary pedicure.</li>
            <li> I have a serious chapped heel and cracked toes problem that gets very painful. This cream does an excellent job of healing the skin and eliminating the pain in my feet.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for her feet, and I decided to give it a try for the first time a few months ago. I have to say that I absolutely love this cream. It makes my feet feel so soft and moisturized, without them feeling oily or greasy. The cream is very easy to apply and easily rubs in. I have also found that I only need to use a little bit of this cream as it absorbs very well and a little bit covers a greater area than previous creams that I have tried. I used to not bother creaming my feet after showering as the numerous previous creams that I tried took a lot more effort to apply and only lasted a few hours, but this cream keeps my feet feeling soft all day and all night long. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and it seems to be working fine for me &amp; my two feet and 10 toes.</li>
            <li> in spite of the creme is too liquid, it really works. Please use it at night because your foot will be fatty</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different foot repair products but this by far is the best I have found.  I can definitely tell if I haven&#x27;t used it for a couple days but if you use on a regular basis and exfoiliate your feet you will have softer smoother feet!  I swear by it!  Thanks Amazon for offering this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have scaly skin on my feet no matter what and Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme goes into my skin so easily without leaving any residue.  My feet turn smooth and sandal ready instantly.  Ordering at Amazon is much easier than trying to find a drugstore that carries it.</li>
            <li> I normally usually Miss Oops and was looking for a cheaper alternative.  It works okay but sometimes need to put on more than once in a day as dry skin reappears.</li>
            <li> I have used various creams over the years for my feet.  This is by far the very best.  If you look at the ingredients you will find Urea toward the top of the list.  It is this substance that makes all the difference in the repair of dry, cracked feet.  Do not give up on it.  If you have particularily bad feet, use it consistently over a longer period of time and you will see a difference.  I will only buy this foot cream from now on.  As others have said it is hard to find in the store, so thank you Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
            <li> Takes the roughness and dryness off of the feet.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product my feet were very dry and cracked. Once I put the cream on my feet the cracked skin immediately looked healed and it was no longer dry, but moist and soft to the touch. I love this foot cream and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I love this! It works great on my skin and I&#x27;m so glad I could finally find it.</li>
            <li> After my Diabetes Therapist gave me a tiny sample tube of this, I searched most of the stores in my area. In frustration, I turned to Amazon and found I could order a 3-pack at a better price than any of the stores, and no waiting for them to get a supply in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but it cause skin turn dark</li>
            <li> I get the biggest cracks in my heels and understand that it is some kind of &amp;#34;bacteria&amp;#34; or something but the uriac acid in the product puts a stop to the crack and ugly, and unsightly feet.  Can&#x27;t live without this product.  Have tried everything for years and this is the first time something has worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products for my feet, and this is the only product I will use!  Keeps them from getting cracked and rough.</li>
            <li> This cream is the must for the foot cracked and hard skin. And 3 tubes for ~ $14 is a good choice. I prefer small tubes to have at home, for gymnastique, travels...</li>
            <li> Not thick enough if you ask me. This is more of a creamy consistency. I prefer a thicker, richer foot cream. I do use this for my hands and it&#x27;s very nice for that.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my severely cracked feet and it does work especially after you soak your feet or when you get out of the shower.  But I also tried vasoline and that actually work better than this so try whatever is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I&#x27;ve tried so far at a reasonable price. Completely healed cracked heels (though my heels were not yet at the &amp;#34;critically cracked&amp;#34; stage). Light, hardly any scent. After the first tube was gone I ordered a three-pack.</li>
            <li> Somewhere in a book on aging, they must discuss why it is that suddenly you notice your skin drying out.  As I hit my mid-30&#x27;s, I noticed it was my feet that were rather dry, with callouses forming and even cracking.  It probably doesn&#x27;t help that I try to walk 5 miles a day and stay active when telecommuting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searched out Amazon for a solution and voila... landed on this foot creme...  Now I have happy feet and can check that off my health and wellness checklist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it best to apply at night and slip socks on to prevent any transfer to sheets...  I also will use it after showering and drying off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a side benefit, applying it with my hands means my hands get silky smooth too. :)  It&#x27;s a two-fer!</li>
            <li> WHile my case may not be typical I had to have a product that is Paraben Free. (Nuclear Severe Allergy) This product is and only using at bedtime it improved my feet dramtically. After a couple of more weeks of treatment or if I used it more often during day I&#x27;m sure it would be almost completely clear of dried skin. If you chose to use any of the abrasive foot products or pumish stones be sure to use them before applying this product. That may be common sense to most people but after being an R.N. for 40+ years I have learned that explain in details so nothing is left to misinterpretation. Everyone has different background they draw from thus different exposures to temper their directions. I will keep this product in stock and swear by it completely. I did have to order online as many of the stores that claim they carry the product carry Eucerin products but often not this specifc product. I go tired of the running around checking so ordered in online.</li>
            <li> I have *extremely* dry skin on my feet and this has worked wonders!  It soaks right in and does not leave a greasy or oily residue.  I have tried so many lotions but this is the best!  I definitely recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous! After years of putting up with ugly dry cracked heals- after 3 weeks of consistent nightly use - my heals are smooth and soft. I read reviews before purchasing because I&#x27;ve tried other products without any results. Get this it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a weeks now and I find this to be a good feet moisturizer.  Not sure if its helping with calluses but it is helpful with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
            <li> I also finally gave in and bought an electric callous remover, after using a pumice stone for years. Using the callous remover, followed by this foot cream, my feet are smoother than they&#x27;ve been since childhood!</li>
            <li> Went skiing after 4 days use and got a massive blister on both heels because the skin just delaminated it was so softened (no change in boots, socks, or anything else in 5 yrs).&lt;br /&gt;One side ulcerated and is still being professionally treated 3 months later.  This stuff would be fine if all you do is sit around.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing for dry diabetic skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works to prevent dried out heels in Arizona.</li>
            <li> I used this nightly. applied creme then put socks on and went to bed. noticeable difference overnight, but took about 2 weeks to fully repair my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The best stuff. If you can&#x27;t get your husband to get a pedi or see a podiatrist about his feet that feel like course sandpaper on you when they touch your legs in bed then at least try this. Noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> these are samples could have gotten for 2 dollars not normal size as described this is a rip off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 6&#x27;1\\&quot;, 240lb male.  My feet take a lot of abuse from all the exercise I do daily.  I sometimes train barefoot (i have my own gym in my basement) to increase my ankle strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the bottom of my feet were BAD! dry, brittle and hard, especially on the heel and big toe.  I tries several other products before this one, because they were significantly cheaper.  nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then I finally bought a tube of this.  with a week, there was a big difference.  after the first tube, my feet felt and looked great. i now use this daily and am subscribed to amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save service to have this sent to me every 3 months at an even bigger discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from my experience, you need to make sure you use enough of this when you apply.  dabbing a bit here and there doesn&#x27;t work for me.  i had to generously apply this when using it.  this means that a tube only lasts for about 2-3 weeks with 1 application a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip: try putting this on after you get out of the shower, then put on socks for about an hour, i swear this makes your feet absorb this stuff ten fold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> During the summer I have problems with my heels getting dry/cracked (to much going barefoot).  This foot cr√®me is lightweight, but still provides good hydration.  I get the 3 pack on auto delivery and I am very happy with it. It soaks in well, without being greasy.  I put this on in the evening (or whenever I have a few hours without wearing shoes) and put on a pair of socks, and it has helped my heels to not be so dry. It also doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!  It really works!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does not provide &#x27;intensive&#x27; care unless I try to rub in several applications, whereas another manufacturer&#x27;s product smooths my heels instantly with only one application.  This product is slightly sticky, as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps keep the bottom of my &amp;#34;hooves&amp;#34; soft and helps heal my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference at all between using normal body lotion vs. this stuff on my feet. So, I&#x27;ll stick with normal body lotion.</li>
            <li> This Eucerin lotion is great at fending off bumpy skin on the backs of the arms and legs. It&#x27;s not sticky, it absorbs fast, and it has no noticeable smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> Really creamy, soothing to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with severe dry skin and cracking/peeling feet for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few solutions with mixed success. This is the best yet.  It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, it doesn&#x27;t cure the problem.  But I&#x27;ve been applying it daily for several months and this is the best winter my feet have had in a long time.  If you have extra dry skin I recommend you give it a try.  Use it every day and you should see improvement relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve alwa had issues with cracked heels. This foot cream has eliminated that issue. It&#x27;s the best thing on the market</li>
            <li> I exercise at least 6X a week and am very hard on my feet. I also live near the beach in warm climate so I frequently wear flip-flops or open shoes. I have been told by dermatologists that this tends to make the feet drier and causes rough skin. My heels crack so badly and have formed thick calluses. Nothing has helped me except this Eucerin Intensive Foot Creme. I put it on whenever but for best results after soaking in a tub just before bedtime and then wear socks through-out the night.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s feet dries out in the winter. I bought this for her and she said it works well. I recommend it to whoever has a dry heel problem!</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this creme but I couldn&#x27;t find in any store and she couldn&#x27;t get it in her area either.  I ordered enough for both of us and we&#x27;re very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on the bottom of my foot.  Eucerin keeps it moist and prevents skin peeling.  Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I started using Eucerin about a month ago and I am very happy with the results. The bottoms of my feet were very dry, cracked, and embarrassingly unsightly. After a month, the difference is dramatic. The bottoms of my feet feel great - no more cracks AND they look and feel delightful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job. Thick consistency means it goes further, use less per application, costs less per use. --</li>
            <li> I only wear shoes when I have to in the warmer months. Thus, my feet can get a bit dry and nasty looking after awhile. I don&#x27;t like the feel of thick, heavy lotions, especially when it is already hot and humid out. This cream fit the bill of being light and absorbing quickly. I put it on right before bed. It does make my feet feel softer and smoother. However, it is not a miracle cream and you have to be diligent about putting it on regularly if you want to see the best results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good.i like it.it is very very well.i will be come back soon.very nice,i like it.so good.very very good.</li>
            <li> Best on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Creme works fantastic!  I have dry feet and since I&#x27;m a diabetic, I have to make&lt;br /&gt;sure I take good care of my feet!  I&#x27;ve used presriptions and many many creams and&lt;br /&gt;this is the only thing that seems to have worked in many years of trying...</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I have found! They stopped selling it in stores so I was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot creme I&#x27;ve ever used.  My cracked  feet healed over night.  Not thick and greasy at all. I turn all my friends on to it  including the one that owns the local nail spa.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST foot creme. Can&#x27;t find it in stores so had to purchase here.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this everyday before putting on his socks. He has thick callouses and sometimes they crack.  This seems to be the best cream we&#x27;ve found so far  I buy several tubes at a time.</li>
            <li> It works! my feet are beautiful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this particular formula that makes it especially meant for feet. I have rough, cracked and calloused feet that need a LOT more than what this lotion provides; I might as well have used plain water. The description claims that it is an AHA product, but there aren&#x27;t any ingredients in it that are listed as the active AHAs. OTOH, it&#x27;s a very good, fragrance-free hand/body lotion and I&#x27;ve used it that way through several tubes. Eucerin has at least half a dozen other moisturizers, both in a creamy formula and in an ointment formula (under their Aquaphor label) that work much better on calloused, cracked feet than this one does.</li>
            <li> Would not use any other foot creme. This really works excellent for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Little too runny.  My husband uses this on his heels and he&#x27;s not fond of it because it is extremely greasy.  I like my moisturizers a little more creamier where they do not leave residue on your hands.  Just our opinion - just don&#x27;t like the texture of it.</li>
            <li> I am a senior, suffer from dry skin on my feet.  This often results in painful cracks on my heels.  The Eucerin cream started bringing relief immediately, with regular use keeps my feet smooth and crack-free.  I used the first 3 tubes, ran out, was very anxious to recieve the next tubes.  I would highly recommend it to anyone for treating dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> Use it all over.  Makes a good hand creme or foot creme.  Absorbed right into tissue and makes skin feel great.</li>
            <li> The best foot lotion!</li>
            <li> great cream does the job.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps my feet very soft and cannot find it any more in local stores.</li>
            <li> This lotion is odorless, absorbs well, and works well.  I find it leaves skin a little tacky though.</li>
            <li> using on dry cracked heels and is improving daily.  Great relief and great product.</li>
            <li> I have problems with cracking heels and have tried many products. This is the second time I have bought this brand and in my opinion it is the best one I have tried. Not sure if it&#x27;s coincidence or not but I sometimes get athletes foot and when I apply this to my feet I rub it in between my toes and I haven&#x27;t had any athletes foot!</li>
            <li> I particularlly love the Eucerin foot creme.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my feet. I could notice the difference on my feet after just one use. With regular use, I have moisturized and well-groomed feet. Buy it!</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff is amazing! My feet were so dry and starting to get deep cracks in them. I apply this to my feet and are clearing up right away and so soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for years and I have way fewer fine lines than my like age friends.</li>
            <li> This works great on my dry, scaly feet.  I had obtained a free sample with a bottle of Eucerin Plus, but then I couldn&#x27;t ever find the foot creme in the store.  Glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li> A great deal buying it in a pack rather than one at a time. I love this foot lotion it is super moisturizing and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, better than others I&#x27;ve used. Relatively non-greasy.  Put it on in the evening &amp; wear socks.  Softens the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past!  This is the best and the only foot cream I use - it works well!</li>
            <li> Working 12 hour shifts as a nurse leads my poor feet to be sad, sore, and they tend to be dry. Buff with a good file and then use this nightly and you&#x27;ll hardly ever need to file them again! Also great for my big toes that tend to want to have ingrown toenails - keeps the nails soft enough I can keep them from growing in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams.  This one softens immediately and more over time because of the exfoliation ingredient.  You will not be sorry.  After a week or two of use all over my feet, I was able to drop down to just using on my heels and using regular moisturizer on my feet.</li>
            <li> My feet were very dry and my doctor suggested scheduling a visit with podiatrist. Few days of usage took care of the feet and expensive treatment that a podiatrist would have provided.</li>
            <li> I use the Eucerin foot creme after my shower every day, and my heels stay reasonably soft.  (If I don&#x27;t use this, my heels get dry and rough.)  Don&#x27;t skip a day, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.  This creme absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I will never be able to do without this cream for the rest of my life so I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it. If you have cracked ugly heels, look no further, order right away!</li>
            <li> Best foot lotion I have ever used!  Skin is softer and even has made my cracked heels disappear.  No issues with application nor odd smell that others have stated.  Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever found.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for keeping my skin (on my feet) flexible and supple.  I use it at least 3 times per week.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised but nothing special for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of formulas to fight dry skin all my life, the dry skin would just come back the next day. This however one application and my dry skin was completely gone. I have had patches of dry skin on my back as well as my legs that even prescription prescribed medication could not cure they would just reoccur after I stopped using the product. Just one or two applications of this they never came back again. This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream to reduce dryness of the feet</li>
            <li> This is moisturizer cream. It is good, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can&#x27;t see why people would give it the same review as the Fountain of Youth.</li>
            <li> after years of sores and cracked dry feet this really works . I have try every thing that is out there this foot cream will start healing in days and the more you use it the better it gets, your feet that is . I order 2 at $6.00 each I like it so much i order 3 of the 3 packs its much cheaper . I&#x27;ve search differant stores and they carry this brand of lotion but not the foot cream. Best foot cream ever !!!</li>
            <li> If your feet are rough this creme will soften them.  Good for cracked feet and even callous problems.  I like to use this at night or right after a shower.  Works much better than just using regular moisture lotion.  The Eucerin brand is a reliable and trusted procut line, this creme is no exception.  I will definitely buy again... oh and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store a year ago. It was great. Healed my wife&#x27;s heels significantly. So I decided to buy a few more for my mom. This is THE foot cream you need for your dry heels.</li>
            <li> I had dry peeling soles, but after one week of using this foot creme twice a day (once in the morning and another before bed), my feet were noticeably softer. And the cracking and peeling were gone. Thank you, Eucerin. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> this creme works very well on dry foot skin, it&#x27;s not greasy in seconds after applied, keeps skin smooth for several days.</li>
            <li> i suffer of dry feet and bad odors for many years and Eucerin give me barely to no results., well i use for years on Dogs a cream called &amp;#34;veterinaria la Tia&amp;#34; (Veterinary de la Tia&amp;#34;) to cure dogs from sarna and Hot spots and this oitment always been very efective with results and a little of 2 days,  so i start using this  La Tia oitment on my feet with inmediatly results,  stop buying all this crappys expensive creams with long or no results, i will recomend everybody to use La tia oitment (La tia pomada&amp;#34;)  is made of natural ingredientes and is very efective and cheaper than any other cream, you can buy it on ebay or amazon or at any hispanic store for less than online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oitment called also pomada o unguento veterinaria la tia cure the sarna and hot spots on dogs in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I went on-line and asked for the best foot cream available.  Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Cream was listed in the top three recommendations, and the least expensive.  I searched the drugstores for this product and could not find it.  My second search was of course, Amazon.  Thank you Amazon, for providing items that are difficult to find in the stores.  I bought this for my daughter that is having trouble with dry heels.  It is an excellent remedy, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product on the market!!!  I reluctantly share with my sister, who loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I have really dry cracked feet.  Not too attractive when you&#x27;re wearing slippers or sandals.  This product is so great!  It really moisturizes your feet and you&#x27;ll have smooth feet from now on...especially with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this on Subscribe and Save.  It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Works great - healing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products but I&#x27;ve never had the amazing success of soft, healed, feet that don&#x27;t scratch and catch on all of my clothes and socks that I put on! Haha! It&#x27;s the best product for healing your heals!! Just remember to wash your hands before you touch your eyes! But still, it&#x27;s worth it!! Use this product, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
            <li> Great repair cream as it smoothen the skin in 1 night. If you religiously use it every night, it will definitely get better. But I find it tough to do it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore (Walmart used to carry it, but not any longer) and I&#x27;ve tried several other foot creams, but most are greasy or feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  This goes on a little greasy, but quickly dries and I feel like it does a much better job of keeping my feet soft than any of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my feet that were heavily parched (even cut) from prolonged negligence. I did not expect any miracles for feet that were dry as a desert and had severe cuts at 2-3 places but gosh! I was so wrong. This cream (lotion rather) worked wonders within 2 days. My feet gave the look as if they had been pedicured recently. The shine and softness that came with it was amazing. This IS the best product if you love your feet.</li>
            <li> I have horrible problems with cracked feet in the summer. Even though this creme is a lot thinner than others, it has given me better results than any other I&#x27;ve tried. If you use it every day for even a week you will definitely see great results!</li>
            <li> Not impressed by the results.  Expected to see results quickly.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme, Plus Intensive Repair is an excellent product.  I have been using it for a long time and am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is amazing.  My husband has very dry, rough man feet.  I put this on him once, waited 2 hours and did a mini pedicure.  Applied again the next morning, night and the following day.  After 3 days his &amp;#34;man feet&amp;#34; are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  Truly amazed by this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really helps would do better if I used it more often.</li>
            <li> My cream arrived a business day early!! (yipee) I&#x27;ve applied it twice, and can already feel my skin getting softer. I recommend it for anyone that has rough feet.</li>
            <li> And I think, is very perfect</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my wife and I. Used it in conjunction with the emoji mini pedi and have seen terrific results. Calluses on our heels are heels and feet are now soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great products for Eucerin. I was surprised how quickly the  dry, rough skin soften up after using it only a week.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis that cause flaky scales on my hands and feet.  This Eucerin product softens the scales and prevents the cracks that sometimes bleed and allow an entryway for bacteria. I have used this product for years and am really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best foot cream I have ever used--and I am a product junkie who tried many, may high end brands. This will exfoliate and soften your feet in 1-2 days worth of usage. If you have dry, cracked heels this product is your new best friend.</li>
            <li> Useful,my mom love it</li>
            <li> After a few nights of using this my heels show huge improvement in dryness and cracking. It is the only heel repair cream I have found that works.</li>
            <li> Best lotion that I&#x27;ve ever ordered! I bought 2 more huge bottles after using this bottle in a week, lol! I use this as a treatment by putting it in latex gloves when I&#x27;m doing the dishes. Live this stuff! Melts into skin and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry feet!</li>
            <li> Very light weight, smooth and moisturizing.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  Lasts all day with out having to apply again.</li>
            <li> Not all it is cracked up to be , no pun intended</li>
            <li> This cream is so good. I will continue buying this product !</li>
            <li> It does moisturize but to me it did not have a lasting effect.  Used this consistently but have not noticed results after three weeks.  Perhaps I am doing something wrong.  The effect seems to last a while but then back to yucky dry feet after a night&#x27;s sleep.  Looks like I will continue the search for something better.</li>
            <li> the best foot cream! lather up both feet in the evening and put on ankle socks and go to sleep. in the morning my feet are so soft and any cracking is gone.</li>
            <li> Good price and takes care of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for feet.  It&#x27;s not greasy and keeps your feet looking good.  I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and always come back to Eucerin.</li>
            <li> Wife says this stuff works Great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to use a foot cream from AVON than contained AHA but they quit selling it years ago and so I went on a search for a replacement product. I am on my second order from Amazon of the Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Foot Creme and I am so very pleased with this product. It is really more of a lotion than a cream but it is not too runny and has a very light scent plus it is not greasy at all.  The price is reasonable when compared to other AHA foot products found on Amazon and elsewhere but best of all it works for me, even better than the AVON stuff. For the first winter in a long time, I have not had the painful cracks on my heels. I only apply it once a day after my shower and usually put on socks afterwards. I sometimes even use it on my hands since I tend to get cracks on the bends of my thumbs in the winter. Even those are less severe this year.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my feet, but loved it so much I use it as a hand cream, too.</li>
            <li> The first pump takes a long long time to come out. But it works great.</li>
            <li> I discovered this lotion at Wal-Mart a few years ago and they don&#x27;t have it any more. As a matter of fact, I have only been able to find online and Amazon is cheaper than the others. It makes my feet super soft.</li>
