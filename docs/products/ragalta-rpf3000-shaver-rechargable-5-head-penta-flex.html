            <li>However, I was impressed by how well this shaver gives me a &amp;#34;close-enough&amp;#34; shave when using shaving cream or just soap and water.</li>

            <li>Would recommend as great buy.</li>
            <li>for an electric, it does give a very nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good points:&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Will be good for vacations</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did perform fairly well for giving myself a buzz cut.</li>
            <li>it runs but will not gave a good shave.</li>
            <li>plus what good is a plug made for electrical outlets in China sent to you in USA..</li>
            <li>This shaver just isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>A vary good razor.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of shaving.</li>
            <li>A good shver for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Still gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>This one has good shapes.</li>
            <li>We wondered if this was gonna be good qualty because we were unfamiliar with the name &amp;#34;Regalta&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Good razor, like the shave I get</li>
            <li>I had good hopes for this shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am VERY pleased with this shaver&#x27;s look, feel, and performance.  </li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Battery holds a good charge for many shaves and the recharge stand is handy with the suction cups to hold it in place</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s best to hold in your fingers rather than in the palm of the hand, moving the razor in a circular manner, rather than a straight line.</li>
            <li>I also liked the nose and ear attachment.  </li>
            <li>Also luv the stand, easy to clean too.!!!</li>
            <li>NEW SHAVER to all and to all a GREAT SHAVE!</li>
            <li>have to say, this is the best shaver I have ever owned so far, the shave is good and easy on the face.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>VERY FAST SERVICE AND VERY NICE MERCHANDISE</li>
            <li>Okay, how many times have I told myself not to buy another thing made in China?  </li>
            <li>and it looked interesting with 5 pivoting heads.  </li>
            <li>much quieter and closer than my $80 Remington, and the added attachments work great.  </li>
            <li>It works well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is mostly stubble.</li>
            <li>So glad I tested this on a weekend, there is no way in hell this shave would pass inspection.  </li>
            <li>Unwrapped and charged,then took it out for a spin!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Santa five heads are BETTER than Three.</li>
            <li>The shave was ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying more when I had a chance to.  </li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>I prefer the head to be more angled, holding the body more vertical.</li>
            <li>This one requires a more horizontal grip.</li>
            <li>will update with much more use.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many many things thru amazon and never have i had a problem</li>
            <li>I thought the head design would offer a better result.</li>
            <li>how many times I go over the area.</li>
            <li>After receiving the item and unpacking it, I was impressed with the seeming quality and visual appeal.  </li>
            <li>fantastic razor, I shave my head so a more roundish razor like this is on the money.</li>
            <li>The razors do not work well and more importantly</li>
            <li>Most have been cheap throw-aways.</li>
            <li>The head on this thing flexes and conforms to the face well, and each razor compartment can be opened for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The head comes off easily to be replaced by the nosehair trimmer and shaver head (with a removable length adjuster), and for when you want to use the built-in sideburn/beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something easily lost.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Of cause easy to use.</li>
            <li>product works fine, but every day I have to charge the battery before used.</li>
            <li>The shave is really close, so I love it too!</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and clean.</li>
            <li>so this is great for daily shaves.  </li>
            <li>The razor is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, yes, but you might as well throw your money out the window as buy this shaver.</li>
            <li>Smooth results.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This product is ok for me because I really don&#x27;t need to shave more than 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li>Is a great deal for the price for sure after looking at other razors of this type.</li>
            <li>It gives a close, clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>There are many more better shaver around the same price.</li>
            <li>Gives him a clean face.</li>
            <li>and it shaves waaaaaaay better and closer and the heads are just as good as the first day I used it, the battery is said to last 8 or 9 years so BEWARE of the Ragalta</li>
            <li>Shave right in the shower, no problem!  </li>
            <li>I set up the charge stand and connected the shaver for a full charge.  </li>
            <li>Well the 5000 came quickly, but was DOA and Amazon was out of stock.</li>
            <li>All the features it has are very convenient and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought him this one and can say he gets my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>I wound up using my old remington for a better job.</li>
            <li>Clean up is nice until you have to remove the center rotor.</li>
            <li>He really loved the other option</li>
            <li>The razor shaves very close with a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I just break out the straight razor to clean up the stuff it missed.  </li>
            <li>The circular heads pop out and back like opening an Artichoke, making it easy to run under hot water to clean and sits in the holder to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>while wet, I get a much closer shave and works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good daily shaver that takes less time to use than most.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for $25, but whatever I was expecting, it wasn&#x27;t a full-featured shaver and trim kit with solid build quality.  </li>
            <li>My husband absolutely LOVES ths!</li>
            <li>The cuts are so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>this is very helpful!</li>
            <li>Just be aware it may not work for you.  </li>
            <li>This razor strinks, doesn&#x27;t adhear to your face as it claims nor does it cut very well, would not recommend!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really needed a new electric shaver, I wanted to buy one that was fairly cheap and wouldn&#x27;t burst my wallet.</li>
            <li>The wet dry feature is really great.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works really well.</li>
            <li>Can not miss a day or it will take much longer to shave.</li>
            <li>only downside is that it takes a bit longer to get a close shave than the Braun I lost and replaced with the Ragalta; however, the way the head flexes to fit my face, it doesn&#x27;t bother me to take the couple minutes it takes to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>but he overuses his shavers which causes them to wear out much faster.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re hair is really sort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift for my husband and he likes it so much.</li>
            <li>The battery also wears out fairly fast.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much hair to deal with.</li>
            <li>I have other, better tools for that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>but really, all I wanted was an inexpensive shaver that does a decent job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it wet and dry and just can&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and gentle on my face, especially when starting with damp skin.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be sorry as it is a great razor.</li>
            <li>It doubles or even triples my normal shave time.</li>
            <li>first when I saw it, I was all \\&quot;that&#x27;s one BIG face %^$%er-upper\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price, but plan on using it wet.</li>
            <li>It is bogus for the Company to make claims that it has 4 hours of running time when your lucky to get an hour out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the 5th head in the middle does not open up for cleaning; it is bogus of the Company to say it has 5 heads!!</li>
            <li>The next morning I decided to try a quick shave on my neck stubble and immediately wanted to pull back out my seven year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Also, the thing even comes with a bottle of machine oil, so clearly it&#x27;s meant to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can order the whole replacement head for only $12.  </li>
            <li>points:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; is nearly useless/clunky to use when the shaver head is on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will be replacing my old one</li>
            <li>I would not waste my time or money on this one.</li>
            <li>with the OLD in with the NEW!&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY</li>
            <li>I kept quite a while (my trusty old Norelco).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with cuts or irritation.  </li>
            <li>The shaver was loud and did not give a close shave.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is that you pay alittle more and buy a swivel with 3 heads since 1 head on the Phillips 1150X is as big as 2 heads on the Regalta; the heads on the Regalta in reality are only 4 moving blades and they are half the size of a regular blade on a Norelco</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this was to try a new brand since I had used the old Norelco for so long</li>
            <li>All in all, this razor far surpasses any other I have bought, costing five times as much.</li>
            <li>I have to go back over my face with my old 3 head razor.</li>
            <li>The battery barely lasts.</li>
            <li>However, I kept my old shaver (with low battery life) to handle the neck area.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it works just like them.</li>
            <li>i opened the box only to be surprised that the box didnt contain the razor i ordered but a brush blow dryer with the Ragalta name..</li>
            <li>only minor issue would be the shorter than expected battery life, but it lasts for 12-15 shaves, so not bad.</li>
            <li>my old man really likes this razor he has heavy growth , it is convenient for him uses when ever needed</li>
            <li>I left it uncharged (after charged full) and used for unbelievable number of times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver works great with a wet or dry face and removes all the stubble without cutting your face.</li>

            <li> Shave right in the shower, no problem!  </li>
            <li> I set up the charge stand and connected the shaver for a full charge.  </li>
            <li> Well the 5000 came quickly, but was DOA and Amazon was out of stock.</li>
            <li> All the features it has are very convenient and it&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought him this one and can say he gets my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I wound up using my old remington for a better job.</li>
            <li> Clean up is nice until you have to remove the center rotor.</li>
            <li> He really loved the other option</li>
            <li> The razor shaves very close with a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I just break out the straight razor to clean up the stuff it missed.  </li>
            <li> The circular heads pop out and back like opening an Artichoke, making it easy to run under hot water to clean and sits in the holder to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while wet, I get a much closer shave and works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good daily shaver that takes less time to use than most.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for $25, but whatever I was expecting, it wasn&#x27;t a full-featured shaver and trim kit with solid build quality.  </li>
            <li> My husband absolutely LOVES ths!</li>
            <li> The cuts are so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> this is very helpful!</li>
            <li> Just be aware it may not work for you.  </li>
            <li> This razor strinks, doesn&#x27;t adhear to your face as it claims nor does it cut very well, would not recommend!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really needed a new electric shaver, I wanted to buy one that was fairly cheap and wouldn&#x27;t burst my wallet.</li>
            <li> The wet dry feature is really great.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works really well.</li>
            <li> Can not miss a day or it will take much longer to shave.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it takes a bit longer to get a close shave than the Braun I lost and replaced with the Ragalta; however, the way the head flexes to fit my face, it doesn&#x27;t bother me to take the couple minutes it takes to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> but he overuses his shavers which causes them to wear out much faster.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re hair is really sort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my husband and he likes it so much.</li>
            <li> The battery also wears out fairly fast.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much hair to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have other, better tools for that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> but really, all I wanted was an inexpensive shaver that does a decent job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it wet and dry and just can&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and gentle on my face, especially when starting with damp skin.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry as it is a great razor.</li>
            <li> It doubles or even triples my normal shave time.</li>
            <li> first when I saw it, I was all \\&quot;that&#x27;s one BIG face %^$%er-upper\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price, but plan on using it wet.</li>
            <li> It is bogus for the Company to make claims that it has 4 hours of running time when your lucky to get an hour out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the 5th head in the middle does not open up for cleaning; it is bogus of the Company to say it has 5 heads!!</li>
            <li> The next morning I decided to try a quick shave on my neck stubble and immediately wanted to pull back out my seven year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Also, the thing even comes with a bottle of machine oil, so clearly it&#x27;s meant to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can order the whole replacement head for only $12.  </li>
            <li> points:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; is nearly useless/clunky to use when the shaver head is on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will be replacing my old one</li>
            <li> I would not waste my time or money on this one.</li>
            <li> with the OLD in with the NEW!&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY</li>
            <li> I kept quite a while (my trusty old Norelco).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with cuts or irritation.  </li>
            <li> The shaver was loud and did not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is that you pay alittle more and buy a swivel with 3 heads since 1 head on the Phillips 1150X is as big as 2 heads on the Regalta; the heads on the Regalta in reality are only 4 moving blades and they are half the size of a regular blade on a Norelco</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this was to try a new brand since I had used the old Norelco for so long</li>
            <li> All in all, this razor far surpasses any other I have bought, costing five times as much.</li>
            <li> I have to go back over my face with my old 3 head razor.</li>
            <li> The battery barely lasts.</li>
            <li> However, I kept my old shaver (with low battery life) to handle the neck area.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it works just like them.</li>
            <li> i opened the box only to be surprised that the box didnt contain the razor i ordered but a brush blow dryer with the Ragalta name..</li>
            <li> only minor issue would be the shorter than expected battery life, but it lasts for 12-15 shaves, so not bad.</li>
            <li> my old man really likes this razor he has heavy growth , it is convenient for him uses when ever needed</li>
            <li> I left it uncharged (after charged full) and used for unbelievable number of times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver works great with a wet or dry face and removes all the stubble without cutting your face.</li>
            <li> Have shaved one side of face with Regalta and the other side with my Norelco (which is 2 years old) and my Norelco gives me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The only downside about the product is that it takes a long time for it to become fully charged.</li>
            <li> Vary hard to shave certain areas on neck and head.</li>
            <li> and he ended up using his old crappy shaver after a few days of using thisone</li>
            <li> You definitely get a smoother shave experience with a wet face than dry.  </li>
            <li> and they are much less harsh on my skin than straight razors.</li>
            <li> there are only 4, I used it to shave my head only and heads lasted 3-5 weeks usually 3 and cost $15-$20 when you can find them, it only seemed to shave well for a week</li>
            <li> It does not work well for a dry shave at all, it doesn&#x27;t get close and misses a lot of hairs.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it go down to 0% and then expect to shave one hour later, it won&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A wet, almost dripping, face is a must.</li>
            <li> So be careful and twist only a few degrees of rotation.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> to tell the other Three head guys,to find another&lt;br /&gt;SUCKER!&lt;br /&gt;OUT</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the other version.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews before buying, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> When I first used the shaver it was mediocre, but then I tried washing my face and used  it while It was still a little wet.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth your time.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and then it was down hill.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i also plead under oath to never buy another shaver that take 4 hours to charge and get in reality 15 minutes or less in shaving time without it going dead.</li>
            <li> That little clipper on the side did nothing, literally nothing, to my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> In reality, it only has 4, the center one is a fake blade.</li>
            <li> A few I kept for a year or 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled so</li>
            <li> It barely cut any hair on my neck after five minutes of \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; and also snagged me a couple times - 20 mins later my neck now feels slight discomfort from snagged hair - it was a bad shave.  </li>
            <li> Preferably before showering so the hair is still stiff.</li>
            <li> It just got worse and worse until the motor in the little contraption would only give me 5 minutes or less shaving time</li>
            <li> He has no complaints AND has no idea that I paid so little for it, he thinks it&#x27;s one of those hundred dollar ones!</li>
            <li> Electric razors usually give a &amp;#34;stubbly&amp;#34; shave...</li>
            <li> so I like to use electric shavers because they usually save time</li>
            <li> Not a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Also, under the chin/neck area it is not very good at all.  </li>
            <li> Priced razor blades lately?</li>
            <li> He uses it almost every day and it lasts at least one to two weeks of shaving every two days without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> but it is not good for me</li>
            <li> A really weak shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaving experience is mediocre and will not buy this shaver again</li>
            <li> This electric &#x27;shaver&#x27; does a very mediocre job at shaving.</li>
            <li> and if you think this is bad, try using any number of the  replica models just like this one from China; it quit working after 1 week</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the product or my experience with Amazon...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does not give me a close enough shave.  Prefer my Norelco!  Have shaved one side of face with Regalta and the other side with my Norelco (which is 2 years old) and my Norelco gives me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them and I gave one shaver as gift and I use one.I can&#x27;t  compare this shaver  with well known brands like Norelco or Philips and incidentally which I used before. Shaving experience is mediocre and will not buy this shaver again</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well. Easy to hold and clean.</li>
            <li> very low quality shaver</li>
            <li> Okay, how many times have I told myself not to buy another thing made in China?  But I did, and I purchased the RPF5000 because I needed a shaver and it looked interesting with 5 pivoting heads.  Well the 5000 came quickly, but was DOA and Amazon was out of stock. I called the Distributor in Florida and they sent me a replacement but it was this one, the RPF3000.  I give up....but really, all I wanted was an inexpensive shaver that does a decent job so I resigned myself to giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, this is the best shaver I have ever owned so far, the shave is good and easy on the face. I am 64, retired, and try and only razor shave once a week so this is great for daily shaves.  The circular heads pop out and back like opening an Artichoke, making it easy to run under hot water to clean and sits in the holder to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can order the whole replacement head for only $12.  Priced razor blades lately?</li>
            <li> It froze up 1 week after buying it</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Remington Foil shaver.  much quieter and closer than my $80 Remington, and the added attachments work great.  only minor issue would be the shorter than expected battery life, but it lasts for 12-15 shaves, so not bad.</li>
            <li> Good points:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and understand.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have to be wet.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable feel in hands.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like it&#x27;s been molded to cut mustache and under the lip hairs with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Neat carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;Came with oil to lubricate it (which means this product was also intended to last quite a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad points:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; is nearly useless/clunky to use when the shaver head is on.&lt;br /&gt;16 hours initial charge time.&lt;br /&gt;Some hairs required a 2nd pass.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for stubble, but the hairs have to be short already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when I saw it, I was all \\&quot;that&#x27;s one BIG face %^$%er-upper\\&quot;. Then I decided to buy and try it and I will say that I am impressed. It works well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is mostly stubble. It&#x27;s a good daily shaver that takes less time to use than most. It will be replacing my old one and I don&#x27;t think I will be looking back.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as I had hoped. Can not miss a day or it will take much longer to shave. Will be good for vacations but I will get another brand for my day to day use.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver! The 5 blades provide a really close shave and keep the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow a few hours away. It holds a charge for 40 minutes and recharges fully in 4 hours. Great attachments.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Ragalta RPF 3000 Shaver  for my husband.  He thinks it is great. He said he would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> A nightmarish compilation of everything you could ever fear a shaver to be.  Not five minutes after shaving, I am bleeding, razor bumps and burn are forming, and stubble is visible.  So glad I tested this on a weekend, there is no way in hell this shave would pass inspection.  That little clipper on the side did nothing, literally nothing, to my sideburns.  Same goes for the vibrissa trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did perform fairly well for giving myself a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> I would not waste my time or money on this one. it runs but will not gave a good shave. I have to go back over my face with my old 3 head razor.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for $25, but whatever I was expecting, it wasn&#x27;t a full-featured shaver and trim kit with solid build quality.  The head on this thing flexes and conforms to the face well, and each razor compartment can be opened for easy cleaning.  The head comes off easily to be replaced by the nosehair trimmer and shaver head (with a removable length adjuster), and for when you want to use the built-in sideburn/beard trimmer.  It came with a charger and a stand, which the charger plugs into, so it can charge in the stand.  The stand, like the shaver, is of surprisingly solid build quality.  It also came with a comb and a faux-velvet bag to keep it all in.  Also, the thing even comes with a bottle of machine oil, so clearly it&#x27;s meant to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it takes a bit longer to get a close shave than the Braun I lost and replaced with the Ragalta; however, the way the head flexes to fit my face, it doesn&#x27;t bother me to take the couple minutes it takes to get a close shave.  Note: You definitely get a smoother shave experience with a wet face than dry.  It holds a charge quite well; I&#x27;ve used it six or seven times and haven&#x27;t needed to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am VERY pleased with this shaver&#x27;s look, feel, and performance.  For $25, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Unwrapped and charged,then took it out for a spin!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Santa five heads are BETTER than Three.I guess&lt;br /&gt;need to tell the other Three head guys,to find another&lt;br /&gt;SUCKER!&lt;br /&gt;OUT with the OLD in with the NEW!&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY NEW SHAVER to all and to all a GREAT SHAVE!</li>
            <li> fantastic razor, I shave my head so a more roundish razor like this is on the money. Also luv the stand, easy to clean too.!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It gives a close, clean and comfortable shave.  The wet dry feature is really great.  Shave right in the shower, no problem!  Battery holds a good charge for many shaves and the recharge stand is handy with the suction cups to hold it in place (a feature not revealed in the ad for the razor).  All in all, this razor far surpasses any other I have bought, costing five times as much.</li>
            <li> This shaver finally became toast after 10 months of usage. The shave was ok but I never will buy anything again from China and if you think this is bad, try using any number of the  replica models just like this one from China; it quit working after 1 week plus what good is a plug made for electrical outlets in China sent to you in USA..&lt;br /&gt;i also plead under oath to never buy another shaver that take 4 hours to charge and get in reality 15 minutes or less in shaving time without it going dead. It just got worse and worse until the motor in the little contraption would only give me 5 minutes or less shaving time and that&#x27;s with 8 hours charging!! It is bogus for the Company to make claims that it has 4 hours of running time when your lucky to get an hour out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the 5th head in the middle does not open up for cleaning; it is bogus of the Company to say it has 5 heads!! In reality, it only has 4, the center one is a fake blade. My suggestion is that you pay alittle more and buy a swivel with 3 heads since 1 head on the Phillips 1150X is as big as 2 heads on the Regalta; the heads on the Regalta in reality are only 4 moving blades and they are half the size of a regular blade on a Norelco</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it wet and dry and just can&#x27;t get a good shave. It misses alot of hairs causing me to have to go over and over the same area of my face. It doubles or even triples my normal shave time. I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandfather after the Ragalta USA RTPF-5000 4 in 1 Turbo Penta Flex Wet/Dry 5 Headed Flex Shaver became unavailable.  He really loved the other option but he overuses his shavers which causes them to wear out much faster.  I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying more when I had a chance to.  This shaver just isn&#x27;t as good.  He says it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the other version.</li>
            <li> A vary good razor.  Easy to use.  It is convenient.  The razor shaves very close with a clean shave.  The razor is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overrated, I have used it twice and it remains in my drawer.  It works OK but it is not good for me</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re hair is really sort. The trimmer on the side doesn&#x27;t work vary well and doesn&#x27;t stay it the open position well either. Vary hard to shave certain areas on neck and head.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST SERVICE AND VERY NICE MERCHANDISE AND THE PRICE WAS VERY GOOD ALSO  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ALL MY ALL MY FRIENDS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Advertised as 5 head?? there are only 4, I used it to shave my head only and heads lasted 3-5 weeks usually 3 and cost $15-$20 when you can find them, it only seemed to shave well for a week and then it was down hill. I bought a Norelco cordless with self sharpening heads for around $45 del. and have had it for over 3 months and it shaves waaaaaaay better and closer and the heads are just as good as the first day I used it, the battery is said to last 8 or 9 years so BEWARE of the Ragalta</li>
            <li> Does a good job of shaving. No complaints. Is a great deal for the price for sure after looking at other razors of this type.</li>
            <li> product works fine, but every day I have to charge the battery before used. Cheap but you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite the picky consumer when it comes to shaving products. However, I was impressed by how well this shaver gives me a &amp;#34;close-enough&amp;#34; shave when using shaving cream or just soap and water.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from this company. The razors do not work well and more importantly the battery and cannot be replaced making your razor a disposable one in 1 year.</li>
            <li> Let me be up front. I&#x27;m a blade man. There is NO electric razor made that gives as close a shave as a blade. But . . .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say I am impressed with this razor. It does give a very good shave. I&#x27;ve always kept an electric around for times when I didn&#x27;t have the time for a blade shave. Most have been cheap throw-aways. A few I kept for a year or 2. One I kept quite a while (my trusty old Norelco). But there was always the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. This razor requires a change in technique. I prefer the head to be more angled, holding the body more vertical. This one requires a more horizontal grip. And it&#x27;s best to hold in your fingers rather than in the palm of the hand, moving the razor in a circular manner, rather than a straight line. A wet, almost dripping, face is a must. Preferably before showering so the hair is still stiff. The water provides the skin lubrication. Clean up is nice until you have to remove the center rotor. That&#x27;s something easily lost. So be careful and twist only a few degrees of rotation.&lt;br /&gt;Also I don&#x27;t intend to ever use the trimmers. I have other, better tools for that.&lt;br /&gt;But for an electric, it does give a very nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;I will update with much more use.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth your time. It does not shave. It does not work. The battery barely lasts. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a piece of crap. It only shaves when your facial hair is really short already. It&#x27;s cheap, yes, but you might as well throw your money out the window as buy this shaver.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my stepdad  and he ended up using his old crappy shaver after a few days of using thisone</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Smooth results.  Comfortable and gentle on my face, especially when starting with damp skin.  I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> A good shver for a good price.  Been using it for eight months now.  Still gives a good shave.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price.  Meets all of my grooming needs and then some.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my husband and he likes it so much.This one has good shapes.Of cause easy to use.Gives him a clean face.</li>
            <li> Not a very good shaver. The head doesnt cut well and it sounds like a grinde next to your head. The battery also wears out fairly fast.</li>
            <li> When I first used the shaver it was mediocre, but then I tried washing my face and used  it while It was still a little wet. Now my shaves rival that of a razor. Closest shave ever with an electric.</li>
            <li> my old man really likes this razor he has heavy growth , it is convenient for him uses when ever needed</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really needed a new electric shaver, I wanted to buy one that was fairly cheap and wouldn&#x27;t burst my wallet. I bought him this one and can say he gets my money&#x27;s worth out of it. He uses it almost every day and it lasts at least one to two weeks of shaving every two days without having to recharge. The only downside about the product is that it takes a long time for it to become fully charged. Don&#x27;t let it go down to 0% and then expect to shave one hour later, it won&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver works great with a wet or dry face and removes all the stubble without cutting your face.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews before buying, I gave it a try.  It does not work well for a dry shave at all, it doesn&#x27;t get close and misses a lot of hairs.  Also, under the chin/neck area it is not very good at all.  Shaving while wet, I get a much closer shave and works pretty good.  However, I kept my old shaver (with low battery life) to handle the neck area.  I also liked the nose and ear attachment.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with cuts or irritation.  Not a bad price, but plan on using it wet.</li>
            <li> We wondered if this was gonna be good qualty because we were unfamiliar with the name &amp;#34;Regalta&amp;#34;. My husband absolutely LOVES ths! We are very satisfied with it. All the features it has are very convenient and it&#x27;s really easy to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs something like this!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the end of March and have used it for about 6 months now.  I got to say this is probably one of my best buy at Amazon.  It works perfectly for every morning use.  I left it uncharged (after charged full) and used for unbelievable number of times.  When battery got low, I expect it might clip my skin.  It didn&#x27;t.  It just stopped when it detects low.  The cuts are so smooth and soft.  Love it!  Never understan why are those high-priced shaver for?  Highly recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> He has no complaints AND has no idea that I paid so little for it, he thinks it&#x27;s one of those hundred dollar ones! Apparently it works just like them. The shave is really close, so I love it too!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor over a year ago, use all of the attachments and it works great never had a problem with it! Thought for the price it was going to be a short term item but to my surprise it was not. And I would buy it again if and when it breaks!</li>
            <li> I have ordered many many things thru amazon and never have i had a problem..I did research on this razor and decided to order it for my husband for Christmas.. It came in the mail and instead of opening it I just pushed it under my bed.. when I had the chance to  wrap it (2 days before christmas) i opened the box only to be surprised that the box didnt contain the razor i ordered but a brush blow dryer with the Ragalta name.. I was baffled, because like I said, I NEVER had a problem with any orders thru Amazon.. I contacted customer service and the lady I talked to was WONDERFUL .. I explained to her i was not upset, If we couldnt get the razor before Christmas i would just give it to my husband for his birthday that was Jan. 1st.. She wouldnt hear of it.. She walked me thru steps to re order the razor, instructed me on returning the blow dryer, and over nighted the Razor to arrive on Christmas eve.. HATS off to Amazon.. My husband LOVES the razor.. he said it is the best electric razor he has ever owned.. I didnt know it but along with the razor it has a hair trimmer, and also a nose and ear trimmer.. I have nothing bad to say about the product or my experience with Amazon...</li>
            <li> My son gave it to me as a gift. I&#x27;m disabled so this is very helpful! Prompt delivery! Very well constructed. Electric razors usually give a &amp;#34;stubbly&amp;#34; shave...this is no different. Although this is the BEST electric razor I have used. Closer shave then the others.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Comfortable shave.Charges quickly.Would recommend as great buy. You won&#x27;t be sorry as it is a great razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver was loud and did not give a close shave. I thought the head design would offer a better result. I wound up using my old remington for a better job.</li>
            <li> A really weak shaver. Its not worth the money. There are many more better shaver around the same price. Awful.</li>
            <li> Good razor, like the shave I get</li>
            <li> This electric &#x27;shaver&#x27; does a very mediocre job at shaving. I don&#x27;t have much facial hair so I like to use electric shavers because they usually save time and they are much less harsh on my skin than straight razors. I have used this Ragalta 3 times now and there are always stray hairs that it just won&#x27;t cut no matter how many times I go over the area. Eventually I just break out the straight razor to clean up the stuff it missed.  I do not reccomend this product to anyone that needs to shave daily or has a lot of hair to deal with. This product is ok for me because I really don&#x27;t need to shave more than 2-3 times a week and I don&#x27;t have much hair to deal with.</li>
            <li> I had good hopes for this shaver.  After receiving the item and unpacking it, I was impressed with the seeming quality and visual appeal.  I set up the charge stand and connected the shaver for a full charge.  The next morning I decided to try a quick shave on my neck stubble and immediately wanted to pull back out my seven year old Norelco.  It barely cut any hair on my neck after five minutes of \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; and also snagged me a couple times - 20 mins later my neck now feels slight discomfort from snagged hair - it was a bad shave.  Maybe my hair is just different than others, but I would not recommend this item.  I would have given this item 0 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do what its made to do, for me, but I gave it two stars instead because of its accessories and manufacturing effort.  Just be aware it may not work for you.  The reason I purchased this was to try a new brand since I had used the old Norelco for so long but I am returning the Regalta.</li>
            <li> This razor strinks, doesn&#x27;t adhear to your face as it claims nor does it cut very well, would not recommend!</li>
