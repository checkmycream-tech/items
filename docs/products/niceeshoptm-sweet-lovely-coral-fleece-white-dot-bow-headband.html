            <li>But for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have a huge head</li>

            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Maybe for a child/preteen not an adult head IMO, super cute and seems well made.</li>
            <li>this one started tearing at the seam after the first wash, I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to wear it.</li>
            <li>looks pretty though&lt;</li>
            <li>I does fit my 2 yr old granddaughter</li>
            <li>It fits nice and tight.</li>
            <li>Only kids can fit in.</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>This plush pink headband is so cute.</li>
            <li>the sewing is pretty good, and the fit was a little tight at first, but it fitted better after a few wears.</li>
            <li>Super cute, fluffy n soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have high expectation.</li>
            <li>It fits a little tight but still cute :3</li>
            <li>little larger then i thought it would be but very cute ty</li>
            <li>this was really soft which i really liked, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit me.</li>
            <li>Most baseball caps do not fit me but this does.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and stretchy.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of it way too small.</li>
            <li>I bought both the light pink and hot pink ones...</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I expected it to be wider on the band to hold back most of my hair.</li>
            <li>The fabric is also not as soft as the one I got.</li>
            <li>it was a little more snug than i expected</li>
            <li>Ehen your hair completely covered next to your face, you can mask, do oul cleansing etc without messing your hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but little bit tight.</li>
            <li>A little tight but that is the purpose. :)</li>
            <li>It was quite small and tight fitting around the head even for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>pretty tight, so if you have a big head, it&#x27;s might not be for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tight so if you have a large head you might want to find something else.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit!!! :(</li>

            <li> I bought a similar one in marshall&#x27;s and it held up well with a few washes. it has a wider band too. this one started tearing at the seam after the first wash, I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to wear it. pretty tight, so if you have a big head, it&#x27;s might not be for you. looks pretty though&lt;br /&gt;PS i figured out how to wear these! They r not supposed to go in the middle of your head but toward the front, covering your hair line, framing your face. Keep em in the front, dont pull to the middle. Ehen your hair completely covered next to your face, you can mask, do oul cleansing etc without messing your hair</li>
            <li> So, this is super cute and it got here super fast. This is where the good comments stop. I don&#x27;t think I have a huge head, I&#x27;ve never had a problem buying hats or headbands, but this is really small. It squeezed my head. I don&#x27;t think I will be using it.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my daughter and one for me to wear and keep hair out of the way while applying makeup.  It was quite small and tight fitting around the head even for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but little bit tight.</li>
            <li> I bought both the light pink and hot pink ones... they&#x27;re both a little tight on my head, so if you wear them too long you might get a minor headache? But for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it works just fine. I really enjoy them and they&#x27;re super cute!</li>
            <li> This one is a great idea but doesn&#x27;t fit my head. I does fit my 2 yr old granddaughter so I gave it to her.</li>
            <li> It fits a little tight but still cute :3</li>
            <li> It fits nice and tight. Shipping was quicker than the estimated time. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I expected it to be wider on the band to hold back most of my hair.</li>
            <li> The size is too small. Only kids can fit in.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them, one for a friend and one for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very cute and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s amazing for its price and recommend it as well.</li>
            <li> Nice material. Soft to the touch, nice color.</li>
            <li> this was really soft which i really liked, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit me. it is really small so keep that in mind before you buy it.</li>
            <li> it was a little more snug than i expected but i love it! it keeps my hair out of the sik water during my beauty routine my hair out of my face when im applying m ake up plus its super cute &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Super cute, fluffy n soft. Great Buy!!</li>
            <li> It is way too small. Too small for adult. Very disappointed.  Feel cheated by seller and review. my head is average size.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> This fits me and I have an unusually larger head. Most baseball caps do not fit me but this does. I don&#x27;t know why some people are saying this is made for a child. This is made for the Asian market. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is tight either. I would say it is snug. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it all day. I just wear it to wash my face and it works great plus it&#x27;s super cute!</li>
            <li> Love it! Good quality!</li>
            <li> It is so cute! It is slightly too tight but doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> great and cute! it holds my fringe and baby hairs back perfectly. i havent had anything bad happen yet. the sewing is pretty good, and the fit was a little tight at first, but it fitted better after a few wears.</li>
            <li> super soft and super cute!</li>
            <li> this is so cute but either it&#x27;s made really small or my head is jumbo big, LOL I could not wear this longer than 10 seconds. It was squeezing my head so tightly I had to snatch it off. I love the idea of it way too small. Maybe for a child/preteen not an adult head IMO, super cute and seems well made.</li>
            <li> Too small!!! It doesn&#x27;t fit!!! :(</li>
            <li> This plush pink headband is so cute. It is very soft and stretchy. It&#x27;s a bit tight so if you have a large head you might want to find something else. The color is spot on. A very nice pink color. It holds my hair back extremely well. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Product - so small that is worst than the other one I got from another store. The fabric is also not as soft as the one I got. I guess you get what you pay. Don&#x27;t have high expectation. And the shipping experience is the worst I ever had.</li>
            <li> A little tight but that is the purpose. :)</li>
            <li> little larger then i thought it would be but very cute ty</li>
