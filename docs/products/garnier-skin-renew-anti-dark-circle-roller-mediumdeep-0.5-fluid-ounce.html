            <li>Nice, ai like it.</li>
            <li>thanks for the great deal!</li>
            <li>but it does a good job of hiding them and its so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Very light coverage.</li>
            <li>Very light - need to blend well with powder/foundation over the top.</li>
            <li>Keeping on hand, and getting more rest to avoid repeating.</li>
            <li>I had the Light/Medium shade and this one works much better for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Calling it Medium would be a better description rather than</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>and I love that about it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a concealer than I&#x27;d realized.</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing on eyes.</li>
            <li>not so...it is better than most things on the market though.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave creases/lines under my eyes like most concealers&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It also blended into my skin perfectly and looks so smooth and natural with or without foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this because it&#x27;s a moisturizer and concealer all in one.  </li>
            <li>This seems to cover better than most cover ups.</li>
            <li>product arrived safely..</li>
            <li>I personally enjoyed the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I had not been able to find an undereye concealer that didn&#x27;t deposit itself into my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Good color, easy to apply, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The roller ball applicator is always cool and refreshing -</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have light tan</li>
            <li>Light coverage and the packaging came beat up with tape on over the box.</li>
            <li>Just roll on and pat to smooth.</li>
            <li>It was too light, I thought this was suppose to be medium/deep ,uhhh</li>
            <li>but they change the price to make it look cheap</li>
            <li>so shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>This product along with right shade of foundation gives a flawless look and my dark circles are almost invisible.</li>
            <li>but it still end up being the original amount of money</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that any of them give me excellent coverage that looks natural, but this is pretty good, although a little high-priced for my budget.</li>
            <li>My eyes are much lighter and much more toned than when I started.</li>
            <li>So many comments made me believe it would really help..</li>
            <li>so i quickly noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>the other 2 were fine as I say product good but shipping and packing not checking items are sealed</li>
            <li>so not sure what happened kinda happy with item but not supplier otherwise an easy 5 star .</li>
            <li>This stuff fix not thick and cake and is a bit thinner than i prefer but it works well:)</li>
            <li>Great concealer.. wanted a dark circle Lightner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and covers exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It is like watercolor paint - very liquid and incredibly easy to blend.</li>
            <li>If you have medium tone skin then this will match your skin and hide those circles under the eyes first thing in the morning without putting on all your makeup!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the medium/dark shade because I read online that it had more pinky, salmon tones to cover up dark circles (whereas the light shade is more useful for highlighting).  </li>
            <li>Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>Too much makeup comes out so you can&#x27;t really roll it under your eyes more than one time.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly but I could not get the product to come out at first.</li>
            <li>is the right consistency for spreading under the eye for maximum coverage.</li>
            <li>It maybe good to use when put make up and cover the dark circle under the eyes.</li>
            <li>and if I apply it slowly and patiently it blends in with my skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It has caffeine and other ingredients like their first ones that help \\&quot;tighten and brighten\\&quot;, plus the concealer, which is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It covers nicely without leaving my skin dry,  and it doesn&#x27;t cake or look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I would recommend letting sit on your skin about 10 seconds, then very gently pat/blend it in.  </li>
            <li>I loved how the roller ball felt under my eye, and it didn&#x27;t apply too much product like other people have said before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and love the coverage it provides.</li>
            <li>The product is great, delivery was a day late.</li>
            <li>I watched a first impression and demo video for this product on YouTube and learned, do not rub it in, instead, use a finger and tap or pat it in.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>&quot; but more like a forward slash and a back slash.  </li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every eye-bag puff-reducer formulation out there.</li>
            <li>The concealer is nice, blends in and covers up dark circles.</li>
            <li>but it certainly helps.</li>
            <li>About 3 weeks later they got more in with new packaging and price</li>
            <li>Hahaha.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea, but I don&#x27;t really see any difference.  </li>
            <li>Medium/Deep.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty long lasting on its own but over eye primer</li>
            <li>Its so smooth and sheer</li>
            <li>This concealer hides my under circles very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liquidy</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin there lies recessed and shadowed, but also the skin is thinner and the underlying bluish blood makes the whole area even darker.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to blend and easy on my delicate under eye</li>
            <li>(most other products do not deliver both.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it periodically (e.g. every few days) for the past 9 months and have seen impressive results.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels when I put it on my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Garnier&#x27;s anti Dark Circle Roller even though it does not perform a miracle</li>
            <li>I first used the plain one that was supposed to tighten and brighten while reducing the appearance of under-eye dark circles then used concealer over that-not great.  </li>
            <li>Light and refreshing, soothing to tired eye area.  </li>
            <li>It is now $13.99 and was on sale for $11.99-still too high</li>
            <li>Product good but one of mine arrived having leaked all over the box couldn&#x27;t tell the seal was broken</li>
            <li>Having said that, I had horrendous dark, baggy eyes which showcased a hard life of good times!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why someone without a significant problem would seek out this product and pay this amount if they didn&#x27;t have a real issue with dark circles anyway, so you might as well go with the one that actually helps some right?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why someone without a significant problem would seek out this product and pay this amount if they didn&#x27;t have a real issue with dark circles anyway, so you might as well go with the one that actually helps some right?</li>
            <li>Used in combination with Garnier&#x27;s other skin renew anti dark circle treatments, this gives good results.</li>
            <li>-- Looks very natural like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Combine that with heredity-my sister and my father and my paternal grandmother (who I strongly resemble) also have very dark circles under their eyes.  </li>
            <li>Then they came out with a sheer tint-a little better, but still used additional concealer.  </li>
            <li>The product does a decent job neutralizing the dark circles, but because the product doesn&#x27;t match my skin and dries quite cakey, it still doesn&#x27;t look quite right on my medium-complected skin.</li>
            <li>For a moment i thought i was using my old roller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fifty years old and am not without wrinkles</li>
            <li>I will look so young........</li>
            <li>My eyes were sensitive to this product.</li>
            <li>In order to improve my professional appearance, I ordered this product as a \\&quot;trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have given thought to the contamination of the tip since it is applied directly to the skin...just throwing that out.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but not thrilled.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look so old.  </li>
            <li>It requires a lot of patting and blending with my finger after application, but ends up looking natural on my NC42 skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried many other expensive products before but this gave me better coverage.</li>
            <li>a little more.(What else is new right?)</li>
            <li>:  -- Doesn&#x27;t cover dark circles as well as other concealers because it&#x27;s more sheer/thin (but that&#x27;s also why it doesn&#x27;t cause lines, I think).  </li>
            <li>This product doesnt do anything at all except for covering your eye bags or dark circles like makeup... not worth the money  :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit well on my skin and exaggerates the fine lines underneath my eyes (I&#x27;m in my late twenties and don&#x27;t have THAT many lines, but this seems to make them look worse).  </li>
            <li>it really helps minimize the appearance of my dark circles</li>
            <li>No long term results.</li>
            <li>I apparently had selective vision when buying this item, totally my fault.</li>
            <li>Dislike the one for puffiness, this one has color which not good for using after clean the face</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is now $13.99 and was on sale for $11.99-still too high</li>
            <li> Product good but one of mine arrived having leaked all over the box couldn&#x27;t tell the seal was broken</li>
            <li> Having said that, I had horrendous dark, baggy eyes which showcased a hard life of good times!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why someone without a significant problem would seek out this product and pay this amount if they didn&#x27;t have a real issue with dark circles anyway, so you might as well go with the one that actually helps some right?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why someone without a significant problem would seek out this product and pay this amount if they didn&#x27;t have a real issue with dark circles anyway, so you might as well go with the one that actually helps some right?</li>
            <li> Used in combination with Garnier&#x27;s other skin renew anti dark circle treatments, this gives good results.</li>
            <li> -- Looks very natural like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Combine that with heredity-my sister and my father and my paternal grandmother (who I strongly resemble) also have very dark circles under their eyes.  </li>
            <li> Then they came out with a sheer tint-a little better, but still used additional concealer.  </li>
            <li> The product does a decent job neutralizing the dark circles, but because the product doesn&#x27;t match my skin and dries quite cakey, it still doesn&#x27;t look quite right on my medium-complected skin.</li>
            <li> For a moment i thought i was using my old roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fifty years old and am not without wrinkles</li>
            <li> I will look so young........</li>
            <li> My eyes were sensitive to this product.</li>
            <li> In order to improve my professional appearance, I ordered this product as a \\&quot;trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have given thought to the contamination of the tip since it is applied directly to the skin...just throwing that out.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look so old.  </li>
            <li> It requires a lot of patting and blending with my finger after application, but ends up looking natural on my NC42 skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried many other expensive products before but this gave me better coverage.</li>
            <li> a little more.(What else is new right?)</li>
            <li> :  -- Doesn&#x27;t cover dark circles as well as other concealers because it&#x27;s more sheer/thin (but that&#x27;s also why it doesn&#x27;t cause lines, I think).  </li>
            <li> This product doesnt do anything at all except for covering your eye bags or dark circles like makeup... not worth the money  :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit well on my skin and exaggerates the fine lines underneath my eyes (I&#x27;m in my late twenties and don&#x27;t have THAT many lines, but this seems to make them look worse).  </li>
            <li> it really helps minimize the appearance of my dark circles</li>
            <li> No long term results.</li>
            <li> I apparently had selective vision when buying this item, totally my fault.</li>
            <li> Dislike the one for puffiness, this one has color which not good for using after clean the face</li>
            <li> The cold roller feels good and when I roll it on, I just pat it in gently and slowly.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really covers up those black eyes I tend to get!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does anything long term as far as \\&quot;fixing\\&quot; dark circles go, but as an inexpensive, easy-to-apply concealer, I like it.</li>
            <li> It works to cover dark circles in the moment, but I don&#x27;t think it improves them in general without make up like it claims to.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for people like me, but I am not sure how much coverage it will give you if your have big dark circles.</li>
            <li> I actually opened it in the store to look at the actual color, and it didn&#x27;t look too dark, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Unless you don&#x27;t have much of a dark circle problem-skip the regular or sheer tint and go for this.</li>
            <li> Unless you don&#x27;t have much of a dark circle problem-skip the regular or sheer tint and go for this.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Also I noticed my eyes water all day long when I wear this.</li>
            <li> My three star review is based on what the product actually is not what I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as I did previously and often get comments about how much younger I look than my actual age.</li>
            <li> I used only five times before dark circles were faded.  </li>
            <li> Totally haven&#x27;t seen any difference with my dark circles..</li>
            <li> This is another product that I was having a hard time finding in the town where I live.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have very big dark circles, so this worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> I am italian, and have seriously dark circles!</li>
            <li> : Apply only a little bit and use finger to pat on concealer.</li>
            <li> but as i began to apply it, not much of the product was coming out.</li>
            <li> not much is needed of this product.</li>
            <li> was looking for something that would offer long term relief for dark circles and this is not it.</li>
            <li> It did not remove my dark circles or provide long term dark circle relief.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the container is almost empty!</li>
            <li> I bought other things</li>
            <li> they added concealer to cover the dark circles and it just looked cakie.  </li>
            <li> Too dark for my pasty skin</li>
            <li> It covers the dark circle and makes them almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking to cover dark circles or baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to put a darker than my skin looking product on dark under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t help cure dark circles  basically like makeup</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any bags or puffiness there, just the dark valleys.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are still there and visible, but I would say they appear 50 - 60% lighter.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a dark circle corrector that wasn&#x27;t colored, but just the medicine.</li>
            <li> It just covers the dark circles.</li>
            <li> On Black woman, also, without blotchy weirdness.  </li>
            <li> Not for black people at all.</li>
            <li> I also put a  whitish eye shadow in the corner of the skin between your eye and nose, blend, and this helps that dark little area brighten up a bit.</li>
            <li> Throughout my pregnancy I had horrible dark circles under my eyes and this works amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that its doing anything other than that...</li>
            <li> it comes out a little orange....</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I am beauty products cynical, but this really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to open a box with the seal broken and make up all inside the box and around the item .1</li>
            <li> Not sure how it helps correct dark circles</li>
            <li> * money wasted</li>
            <li> As you can see by the time I&#x27;m writing this-I&#x27;m a night owl and have trouble sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant because I&#x27;m pale</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I tried on a &amp;#34;Bobbi Brown&amp;#34; concealer a few days ago at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, and when I complained that it caused creases/lines under my eyes, the saleswoman said, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s your choice, undereye bags or lines, all the brands of concealers cause those lines.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> small and compact.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of concealer to cover them up (never 100% covered because of the bone structure), and I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup</li>
            <li> I have had hereditary dark circles all my life and they seem to be getting worse with age.  </li>
            <li> Hardly noticeable if at all.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I find it hard to even imagine that I&#x27;ve ordered this product.</li>
            <li> it was so late.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull the delicate skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all thick</li>
            <li> I was not sure what I was buying, so when I got it home &amp; used it-wow!</li>
            <li> so I look weird with heavy concealer on my face.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work well for me, not good coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by using it.</li>
            <li> Customer service is poor never responded to my messages.</li>
            <li> Sorry if that is confusing, but do you get what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is like a thin, watery concealer.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles/bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> I look tired all the time even when I&#x27;m not!  </li>
            <li> i have horrible looking dark under eye circles, but you can&#x27;t even tell after using this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look as \\&quot;desperately tired\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use concealers and have tried all but the very expensive ones that celebrities say they use.  </li>
            <li> Even if I had not overlooked that this was colored I would have been disappointed with the results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am beauty products cynical, but this really works. On Black woman, also, without blotchy weirdness.  I used only five times before dark circles were faded.  Keeping on hand, and getting more rest to avoid repeating.</li>
            <li> i love this product! this is my 3rd time purchasing it. i have horrible looking dark under eye circles, but you can&#x27;t even tell after using this! it also lasts forever. i use it every day and it lasts me 4-5 months. great buy :)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it they added concealer to cover the dark circles and it just looked cakie.  Was not impressed at all thank god I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on it</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will be using it every day because it works so good</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it mateches perfectly to my skin shade. I tried many other expensive products before but this gave me better coverage. This product along with right shade of foundation gives a flawless look and my dark circles are almost invisible.</li>
            <li> Light and refreshing, soothing to tired eye area.  Very light coverage.</li>
            <li> Good color, easy to apply, very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I like using roller balls under my eyes to depuff in morning.  But you can only use this for the concealer, if you roll it around you will have concealer everywhere.  The concealer is nice, blends in and covers up dark circles. No long term results.</li>
            <li> I am italian, and have seriously dark circles! This concealer is a must, so I use every day!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels when I put it on my dark circles. It covers nicely without leaving my skin dry,  and it doesn&#x27;t cake or look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Very light - need to blend well with powder/foundation over the top.</li>
            <li> It works to cover dark circles in the moment, but I don&#x27;t think it improves them in general without make up like it claims to. Still love tho! Came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Hahaha.  I&#x27;m one!  I like the idea, but I don&#x27;t really see any difference.  Hardly noticeable if at all.  Also I noticed my eyes water all day long when I wear this.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the container is almost empty! For a moment i thought i was using my old roller. The  delivery was on time but as i began to apply it, not much of the product was coming out. Ive purchased this product at rite aid so i quickly noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused by using it. Dislike the one for puffiness, this one has color which not good for using after clean the face ( I guess). It maybe good to use when put make up and cover the dark circle under the eyes. I hope the company has the nourish one that similar with the one for puffiness.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for thank you☺</li>
            <li> I had the Light/Medium shade and this one works much better for me.  I have light tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;Calling it Medium would be a better description rather than Medium/Deep.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty long lasting on its own but over eye primer it&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles/bags under my eyes.  I&#x27;m fifty years old and am not without wrinkles so I had not been able to find an undereye concealer that didn&#x27;t deposit itself into my fine lines.  I absolutely love Garnier&#x27;s anti Dark Circle Roller even though it does not perform a miracle but it certainly helps. The cold roller feels good and when I roll it on, I just pat it in gently and slowly.  Its so smooth and sheer and if I apply it slowly and patiently it blends in with my skin beautifully.  It&#x27;s not at all thick and I love that about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. It&#x27;s more of a concealer than I&#x27;d realized. I&#x27;m not sure that its doing anything other than that... I do like the roller application.</li>
            <li> I will look so young........no really it is very soothing and soft</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing on eyes. Cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: well it took over a month for me to recieve this it was so late. Customer service is poor never responded to my messages. Light coverage and the packaging came beat up with tape on over the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and love the coverage it provides.</li>
            <li> This concealer hides my under circles very well. It&#x27;s very liquidy so it&#x27;s easy to blend and easy on my delicate under eye skin.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Apply only a little bit and use finger to pat on concealer. If you use a lot, it can crease.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer that I have ever used and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Works great as an under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> this is a tricky concealer because it seems that you would have no bags but not so...it is better than most things on the market though.  Think about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff fix not thick and cake and is a bit thinner than i prefer but it works well:)</li>
            <li> cant complain you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Item as described. Works great with continued use. A+</li>
            <li> Pros: -- Looks very natural like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup&lt;br /&gt;-- Doesn&#x27;t leave creases/lines under my eyes like most concealers&lt;br /&gt;(I tried on a &amp;#34;Bobbi Brown&amp;#34; concealer a few days ago at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, and when I complained that it caused creases/lines under my eyes, the saleswoman said, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s your choice, undereye bags or lines, all the brands of concealers cause those lines.&amp;#34;  So I continue to use this product)&lt;br /&gt;-- No need to put on moisturizer on underneath in order for it to go on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  -- Doesn&#x27;t cover dark circles as well as other concealers because it&#x27;s more sheer/thin (but that&#x27;s also why it doesn&#x27;t cause lines, I think).  Caveat: I haven&#x27;t tried dabbing rather than rubbing it in yet (per others&#x27; reviews).&lt;br /&gt;-- Watch the price.  I paid almost 9 dollars (no S &amp; H fee) a couple months ago.  Now I see that it&#x27;s almost 6 (including S &amp; H).</li>
            <li> Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
            <li> The product is great, delivery was a day late.</li>
            <li> Great concealer.. wanted a dark circle Lightner</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every eye-bag puff-reducer formulation out there. This one does the trick. I think the caffeine in it reduces the puffs and the liquid formula is the right consistency for spreading under the eye for maximum coverage. It actually looks different after I apply it and unless I am dreaming I think my eye bags are reduced in size (most other products do not deliver both.) Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> Too much makeup comes out so you can&#x27;t really roll it under your eyes more than one time.  The makeup definitely covers any darkness under eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Product good but one of mine arrived having leaked all over the box couldn&#x27;t tell the seal was broken so not sure what happened kinda happy with item but not supplier otherwise an easy 5 star . I don&#x27;t like to open a box with the seal broken and make up all inside the box and around the item .1 was put in the trash the other 2 were fine as I say product good but shipping and packing not checking items are sealed</li>
            <li> Too dark for my pasty skin</li>
            <li> it really helps minimize the appearance of my dark circles</li>
            <li> Love this, going to order again! It really works.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple minutes ago; and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I loved how the roller ball felt under my eye, and it didn&#x27;t apply too much product like other people have said before. I watched a first impression and demo video for this product on YouTube and learned, do not rub it in, instead, use a finger and tap or pat it in. Sorry if that is confusing, but do you get what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have very big dark circles, so this worked extremely well. It also blended into my skin perfectly and looks so smooth and natural with or without foundation. I recommend this product for people like me, but I am not sure how much coverage it will give you if your have big dark circles.</li>
            <li> My eyes were sensitive to this product.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I find it hard to even imagine that I&#x27;ve ordered this product. Having said that, I had horrendous dark, baggy eyes which showcased a hard life of good times! In order to improve my professional appearance, I ordered this product as a \\&quot;trial\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been using it periodically (e.g. every few days) for the past 9 months and have seen impressive results. My eyes are much lighter and much more toned than when I started. I don&#x27;t look as \\&quot;desperately tired\\&quot; as I did previously and often get comments about how much younger I look than my actual age.</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s a moisturizer and concealer all in one.  The roller ball applicator is always cool and refreshing - it doesn&#x27;t pull the delicate skin around my eyes.  Just roll on and pat to smooth.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it helps correct dark circles but it does a good job of hiding them and its so easy to apply.  I have given thought to the contamination of the tip since it is applied directly to the skin...just throwing that out. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It Didn&#x27;t work for me. It was too light, I thought this was suppose to be medium/deep ,uhhh no . This may work for others , just not for me.. sigh* money wasted</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s cheap and covers exactly what it says. Throughout my pregnancy I had horrible dark circles under my eyes and this works amazing. It covers the dark circle and makes them almost unnoticeable. I love it! I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking to cover dark circles or baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium/dark shade because I read online that it had more pinky, salmon tones to cover up dark circles (whereas the light shade is more useful for highlighting).  It doesn&#x27;t sit well on my skin and exaggerates the fine lines underneath my eyes (I&#x27;m in my late twenties and don&#x27;t have THAT many lines, but this seems to make them look worse).  The product does a decent job neutralizing the dark circles, but because the product doesn&#x27;t match my skin and dries quite cakey, it still doesn&#x27;t look quite right on my medium-complected skin.</li>
            <li> Good product..  just need to practice on how to apply</li>
            <li> I want to buy this but they change the price to make it look cheap but it still end up being the original amount of money</li>
            <li> This product doesnt do anything at all except for covering your eye bags or dark circles like makeup... not worth the money  :)</li>
            <li> does not do what it says</li>
            <li> Nice, ai like it. Good collor and texture.</li>
            <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
            <li> Not for black people at all.</li>
            <li> If you have medium tone skin then this will match your skin and hide those circles under the eyes first thing in the morning without putting on all your makeup!  Just a boost before you go out to have morning coffee so no one screams!</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles.  As you can see by the time I&#x27;m writing this-I&#x27;m a night owl and have trouble sleeping.  Combine that with heredity-my sister and my father and my paternal grandmother (who I strongly resemble) also have very dark circles under their eyes.  I&#x27;ve always use concealers and have tried all but the very expensive ones that celebrities say they use.  I can&#x27;t say that any of them give me excellent coverage that looks natural, but this is pretty good, although a little high-priced for my budget. I first used the plain one that was supposed to tighten and brighten while reducing the appearance of under-eye dark circles then used concealer over that-not great.  Then they came out with a sheer tint-a little better, but still used additional concealer.  It was ok, but not thrilled.  Now they have this one withe a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; concealer.  I was hesitant because I&#x27;m pale and I didn&#x27;t want to put a darker than my skin looking product on dark under-eye circles.  I actually opened it in the store to look at the actual color, and it didn&#x27;t look too dark, so I bought it.  I think this is the best so far.  It has caffeine and other ingredients like their first ones that help \\&quot;tighten and brighten\\&quot;, plus the concealer, which is pretty good.  I would recommend letting sit on your skin about 10 seconds, then very gently pat/blend it in.  I also put a  whitish eye shadow in the corner of the skin between your eye and nose, blend, and this helps that dark little area brighten up a bit. I got the last one on the shelf.  About 3 weeks later they got more in with new packaging and price had gone up a little more.(What else is new right?) It is now $13.99 and was on sale for $11.99-still too high I think, so I bought it here on Amazon for about $4-5 cheaper I think it was. I bought other things so shipping was free.  I would recommend this product, but keep your eye on the prices. Either shop around for sales and combine with coupons if you can find them, or use my preference-Amazon, where you&#x27;ll usually do better! Unless you don&#x27;t have much of a dark circle problem-skip the regular or sheer tint and go for this. I don&#x27;t know why someone without a significant problem would seek out this product and pay this amount if they didn&#x27;t have a real issue with dark circles anyway, so you might as well go with the one that actually helps some right? Good luck!nce-Amazon, where you&#x27;ll usually do better! Unless you don&#x27;t have much of a dark circle problem-skip the regular or sheer tint and go for this.

            <li> Not what I wanted covers well but it doesn&#x27;t help cure dark circles  basically like makeup</li>
            <li> This is another product that I was having a hard time finding in the town where I live. The product works for my needs. Of course I located it on Amazon and purchased two so that it will last me for awhile.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and I need a cover up that covers them up so I don&#x27;t look so old.  This seems to cover better than most cover ups.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what I was buying, so when I got it home &amp; used it-wow! This stuff really covers up those black eyes I tend to get!  So moisturizing too for under the eyes. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Feels good applied to under eye area.  Does help with puffiness.</li>
            <li> product arrived safely..beware though...it comes out a little orange.... not much is needed of this product. small and compact.</li>
            <li> thanks for the great deal!</li>
            <li> I have had hereditary dark circles all my life and they seem to be getting worse with age.  My bone structure creates these two valleys beneath my eyes--they&#x27;re not \\&quot;circles\\&quot; but more like a forward slash and a back slash.  My skin there lies recessed and shadowed, but also the skin is thinner and the underlying bluish blood makes the whole area even darker.  I look tired all the time even when I&#x27;m not!  I don&#x27;t have any bags or puffiness there, just the dark valleys.  It takes a lot of concealer to cover them up (never 100% covered because of the bone structure), and I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup so I look weird with heavy concealer on my face.  This product is like a thin, watery concealer.  It requires a lot of patting and blending with my finger after application, but ends up looking natural on my NC42 skin.  My dark circles are still there and visible, but I would say they appear 50 - 60% lighter.  I don&#x27;t know if it does anything long term as far as \\&quot;fixing\\&quot; dark circles go, but as an inexpensive, easy-to-apply concealer, I like it.</li>
            <li> two of them was broke the security seal and they look used</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work well for me, not good coverage.</li>
            <li> Totally haven&#x27;t seen any difference with my dark circles.. So many comments made me believe it would really help.. But it didn&#x27;t. Totally bummed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product doesn&#x27;t win the Allure &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; every year. It is hands down the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I saw it on a makeup tutorial and bought it immediately. (Hence the Amazon purchase) It is like watercolor paint - very liquid and incredibly easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Used in combination with Garnier&#x27;s other skin renew anti dark circle treatments, this gives good results. I use this with the BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dark circle corrector that wasn&#x27;t colored, but just the medicine. I apparently had selective vision when buying this item, totally my fault. My three star review is based on what the product actually is not what I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This basically only worked for me as a concealer. I used it under foundation and powder. It did not remove my dark circles or provide long term dark circle relief. It just covers the dark circles. It does work at reducing puffiness and has a bit of a... sting like sensation that definitely perks up your face. It doesn&#x27;t burn or cause redness it&#x27;s just a mentholated type sensation. I personally enjoyed the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that would offer long term relief for dark circles and this is not it. Even if I had not overlooked that this was colored I would have been disappointed with the results. This is a short term fix only.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly but I could not get the product to come out at first. It works now and I use it occasionally.</li>
