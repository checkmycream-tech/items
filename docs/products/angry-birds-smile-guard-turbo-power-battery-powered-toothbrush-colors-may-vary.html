            <li>My son will not be too happy about that.  </li>
            <li>Great brush</li>
            <li>Looks good, but was way overpriced.</li>
            <li>Amazon is great and gave a full refund.</li>
            <li>The battery is ok but the toothbrush doesn´t work anyway.</li>
            <li>I assure he will love this.</li>
            <li>Works great and my daughter wants to brush her teeth more often.</li>
            <li>This is a great electric toothbrush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more of these toothbrushes they are great for kids.</li>
            <li>Shopping made easy for a grandma.</li>
            <li>perfect item, my little one loves it</li>
            <li>Having a toothbrush vibrate and spin is huge for oral stimulation as well and makes it more fun for her to brush, as well as stimulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and leaves teeth and gums feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It was the right gift..very good.arrived in time</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not worth the hassle of returning.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it might have been a good product.</li>
            <li>so i like this very much also my kid like this</li>
            <li>got excited to try their new tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>My grandson wants all &amp;#34;angry bird stuff&amp;#34; for his birthday into weeks.</li>
            <li>Very tiny and soft brush is easy to brush my kid</li>
            <li>Instead it only vibrates, but not even enough to move the bristles once it is touching the teeth.</li>
            <li>When turned on, the top of the toothbrush vibrates a little, but does nothing that affects brushing.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter because she&#x27;s been wanting an electric toothbrush like mommy &amp; daddy, so I thought this would be a great buy because she also loves Angry Birds.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves Angry Bird stuff so this would have been great, except it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li>I tried new batteries and it still  would not turn on.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought, different brand, because the last one had HOLES in the back, and was a design-your-own style that while cool, was crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My son loves Angry Birds and is in love with his new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Might as well get a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush for your angry bird fan!</li>
            <li>the only good thing was my son loved the angry birds decal, which seemed to be shrink-wrapped on. :(</li>

            <li> the only good thing was my son loved the angry birds decal, which seemed to be shrink-wrapped on. :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an easy push button to power it on, but instead has switch on the BOTTOM that is VERY difficult to move, even as an adult!</li>
            <li> so I expected to receive the red bird.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Kids</li>
            <li> Alas, in another month, I guess I will forking over 30-40 for a more expensive kit for her, just to get something decent that works as ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment</li>
            <li> I ordered the red bird and received the green pig.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, she loves her Angry Birds Piggie toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have the heart to take it away from her right now, since she just got it...</li>
            <li> She has a SMALL mouth and cannot open her mouth wide due to differing abilities.</li>
            <li> I tried taking it apart, trying 3 different brands of batteries, putting each in both ways (in case it was mislabeled), tightening each one totally with the teeny tiny pain in my ass screw that falls on my floor if you hit it wrong and is like hunting for a needle in a haystack in the shag carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Weak brushing action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost to return it.</li>
            <li> The battery was rolling around the box and the bottom half of the toothbrush was hanging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also only vibrates, really not good if you are looking for a kids electric toothbrush....</li>
            <li> and my nephew is definitely an angry bird kind of kid and loves every angry bird product !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this angry birds toothbrush at a local store for $5.</li>
            <li> ; how hard would it have been to have it work as advertised?</li>
            <li> I am getting tired of buying crappy kids&#x27; electric toothbrushes from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> My daughter can&#x27;t even switch it on by herself, which is ridiculous that I now have to assist her to do something she&#x27;s been doing by herself for 2 years already!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried switching it on &amp; off a bunch of times in a row to try to loosen the switch up a little, but to no avail, as it is still very difficult to switch \\&quot;on\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> give it TWO stars because my kid can still brush with it and she likes angry birds.</li>
            <li> Just an expensive, noisy manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I just feel it was a poor design for a CHILDREN&#x27;s toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> My daughter was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, one arrived and it was broken!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The instructions state that you simply pull the bottom off to insert the battery. We tried that every which way. There is a screw on the back, but even our strongest properly-sized screwdrivers do not budge it--plus the instructions on the back mention NOTHING about having to take the screw out. Huge disappointment; how hard would it have been to have it work as advertised?</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves teeth and gums feeling clean. I will definitely be getting more of these toothbrushes they are great for kids.</li>
            <li> I am getting tired of buying crappy kids&#x27; electric toothbrushes from the drugstore. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought, different brand, because the last one had HOLES in the back, and was a design-your-own style that while cool, was crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I BUY TOOTHBRUSHES FOR MY DAUGHTER BASED ON SIZE.  She has a SMALL mouth and cannot open her mouth wide due to differing abilities. Having a toothbrush vibrate and spin is huge for oral stimulation as well and makes it more fun for her to brush, as well as stimulating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS toothbrush, even after switching the battery, does not work at ALL. I tried taking it apart, trying 3 different brands of batteries, putting each in both ways (in case it was mislabeled), tightening each one totally with the teeny tiny pain in my ass screw that falls on my floor if you hit it wrong and is like hunting for a needle in a haystack in the shag carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it TWO stars because my kid can still brush with it and she likes angry birds. Alas, in another month, I guess I will forking over 30-40 for a more expensive kit for her, just to get something decent that works as ADVERTISED. k&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this unless you don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t spin or vibrate.</li>
            <li> I ordered the red bird and received the green pig.  My son will not be too happy about that.  I realize it says &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34; but it said that I ordered the red bird so I expected to receive the red bird.  It&#x27;s not worth the cost to return it.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Kids got excited to try their new tooth brush.  It wasn&#x27;t working swapped the battery, still did not work.</li>
            <li> Very tiny and soft brush is easy to brush my kid so i like this very much also my kid like this</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did not come with batteries, as similar toothbrushes do. Also, is not a spin brush. When turned on, the top of the toothbrush vibrates a little, but does nothing that affects brushing. I don&#x27;t understand the point of this item being battery operated. Looks good, but was way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I received it, put the battery and nothing happened. The battery is ok but the toothbrush doesn´t work anyway. I don´t live in USA, so it is dificulty to change it..</li>
            <li> Ours did not work even with changing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth the hassle of returning.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it might have been a good product.</li>
            <li> It was the right gift..very good.arrived in time</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for your angry bird fan!</li>
            <li> My son loves his toothbrush though it can be tricky to turn off</li>
            <li> Use it like a regular toothbrush. The battery only makes the handle vibrate and does nothing to improve cleaning. Might as well get a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries.</li>
            <li> My grandson wants all &amp;#34;angry bird stuff&amp;#34; for his birthday into weeks. I assure he will love this. Shopping made easy for a grandma.</li>
            <li> This was delivered already opened.  The battery was rolling around the box and the bottom half of the toothbrush was hanging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way is it getting used by my kids.</li>
            <li> Works great and my daughter wants to brush her teeth more often. It&#x27;s not overwhelming for her.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush vibrates a bit--that is all. I should have read the reviews first. The oral-B ones spin, which is what I was expecting with this one. Instead it only vibrates, but not even enough to move the bristles once it is touching the teeth. Just an expensive, noisy manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I thought for that price I was getting all three.  Well, one arrived and it was broken!!! It also only vibrates, really not good if you are looking for a kids electric toothbrush....however, I did get a speedy refund!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush for a reasonable price. My son loves Angry Birds and is in love with his new toothbrush! Thank you!</li>
            <li> perfect item, my little one loves it</li>
            <li> Boys will be boys and my nephew is definitely an angry bird kind of kid and loves every angry bird product !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product... I bought it for my daughter because she&#x27;s been wanting an electric toothbrush like mommy &amp; daddy, so I thought this would be a great buy because she also loves Angry Birds. Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;1) It only vibrates, not spins... But that doesn&#x27;t matter to her, so I&#x27;ve made my peace with that issue...&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t have an easy push button to power it on, but instead has switch on the BOTTOM that is VERY difficult to move, even as an adult! My daughter can&#x27;t even switch it on by herself, which is ridiculous that I now have to assist her to do something she&#x27;s been doing by herself for 2 years already! I&#x27;ve even tried switching it on &amp; off a bunch of times in a row to try to loosen the switch up a little, but to no avail, as it is still very difficult to switch \\&quot;on\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, she loves her Angry Birds Piggie toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have the heart to take it away from her right now, since she just got it... I just feel it was a poor design for a CHILDREN&#x27;s toothbrush!! The engineers definitely over-thought this design...</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting - didn&#x27;t see that there wasn&#x27;t a color choice.</li>
            <li> Great brush but I ordered 2 of these brushes...I only wish that they werent the same bird.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to exchange for a different bird.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Angry Bird stuff so this would have been great, except it doesn&#x27;t work. I tried new batteries and it still  would not turn on. My daughter was really disappointed. Why do they sell junk that doesn&#x27;t even work. Very poor quality. Amazon is great and gave a full refund. Only the shipping companies made any money on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this angry birds toothbrush at a local store for $5. Poor quality. Weak brushing action. the only good thing was my son loved the angry birds decal, which seemed to be shrink-wrapped on. :(</li>
