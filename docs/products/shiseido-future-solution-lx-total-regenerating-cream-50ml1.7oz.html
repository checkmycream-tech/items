            <li>Awesome cream!</li>
            <li>Perfect skin all day!!</li>
            <li>This cream sells for $260 in the stores, so this is a wonderful deal - the cheapest I have ever seen it.  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>I am so happy you be here!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shisedo products since I was a teenager and have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>After 4 months of use, both my mom and I agreed that this cream is a good moisturizer at best.</li>
            <li>and I get compliments on how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>Happy..</li>
            <li>Nice job!</li>
            <li>good moisturizer, too pricey, will try the bio performance line</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, no need to say how good this product is.  </li>
            <li>It could not be better!</li>
            <li>I kind of figure that if my esthetician is noticing my skin considering the spa she works for sells their own skin care line, no need to change.</li>
            <li>The night cream is very fine.  </li>
            <li>the hectic schedule I love.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I tried the product because I&#x27;m closer to understanding the key to good skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this seller can sell the item this cheap!</li>
            <li>just arrived at my house today, looks authentic to me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Future Solution FX is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love it as night cream</li>
            <li>Have always used bioperformance with good results but the future solutions is unbelievably great</li>
            <li>I love the texture &amp; light fragrance of this cream.  </li>
            <li>I only would say Shiseido is good for all of ladies!</li>
            <li>The fragrance was too strong as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a week and am looking forward to the result I&#x27;m looking for, namely taking away some fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>At end of the day, my sin doesn&#x27;t respond the the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it because it works so well :-)</li>
            <li>I wish you enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li>wake up every morning with super smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly so you can use it very sparingly - mine lasts about 1 year.</li>
            <li>Must have and such a good deal from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s what I ordered, new and original!</li>
            <li>It is worth it until I find a miracle cheapie.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I do like how it gets absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>The money is  absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>Right on time</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that I love my mom, I bought the product for her because I wanted to get a second opinion (I would be inclined to convince myself, \\&quot;After</li>
            <li>Getting consistently healthy skin involves a balanced diet, exercise, simple skincare routine, and self-love.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s simply no short-cut or magic potion.</li>
            <li>Try it first, if it works on your skin, it is no brainer.</li>
            <li>The cream had a nice texture but it was not very hydrating for me even in the summer.</li>
            <li>Works greatly.i am 35 years old and using this for 3 weeks each night , already made my wrinkle ( smile line ) disappeared!</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and have never been brand loyal until Shiseido.</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference in the mirror the next morning just after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate nearly as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li>Seller is very efficient.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>The reason I chose a 4 star is because it doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as some of the other clients claimed or perhaps I need to buy more products from the same line.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to all ladies.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant reduction in the lines in my face and my skin is totally hydrated - never dry or flaky.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel nourished and it was probably borderline irritated, I have skin that is sensitive chemicals.</li>
            <li>Prior to using the night moisturizer both morning and evening, I had been developing fine lines and had such dry skin that I had been having problems with my top layer of skin lifting off during waxings, which was downright scary.</li>
            <li>In other words, I would bank in more antioxidants by eating berries and drinking a cup of green tea.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I use, my skin is dry the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from the most expensive stuff to drugstore trying to cure my dry skin now that we live part time in Utah.</li>
            <li>winter dry sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Just the expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive though</li>

            <li> This is youth serum in a bottle! Must have and such a good deal from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for 6 months now and plan to never live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is finally well hydrated, radiant. All on 5 hours of sleep keeping&lt;br /&gt;exactly the hectic schedule I love. Not having to pay with wrinkles is a bonus</li>
            <li> good moisturizer, too pricey, will try the bio performance line</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my mom (late 50s) and another one for myself (late 20s). Besides the fact that I love my mom, I bought the product for her because I wanted to get a second opinion (I would be inclined to convince myself, \\&quot;After all, it&#x27;s expensive and is made by a reputable brand. This has got to work!!\\&quot;). After 4 months of use, both my mom and I agreed that this cream is a good moisturizer at best. Its ingredient list include components of moisturizer and emollient. The product&#x27;s antioxidant stuff, such as camellia sinensis and tocopherol, go in the very last part of the ingredient list, meaning that there&#x27;s very little of them relative to other components in the product (I actually took a class on how to read ingredient labels). In other words, I would bank in more antioxidants by eating berries and drinking a cup of green tea.  I am happy that I tried the product because I&#x27;m closer to understanding the key to good skin. Getting consistently healthy skin involves a balanced diet, exercise, simple skincare routine, and self-love. There&#x27;s simply no short-cut or magic potion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and I appreciate the prompt arrival to my door. I will order again when needed. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! My skin feels and looks great. Would highly recommend this amazing product. If you are considering it, definitely give it a try. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this seller can sell the item this cheap! just arrived at my house today, looks authentic to me.&lt;br /&gt;This Future Solution FX is amazing!!! wake up every morning with super smooth skin. I pair it with Shiseido Ultimune and Shiseido Benefiance serum. Perfect skin all day!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Shiseido Future Solution products exclusively for almost three years. I am 44 years old and have never been brand loyal until Shiseido. Prior to using the night moisturizer both morning and evening, I had been developing fine lines and had such dry skin that I had been having problems with my top layer of skin lifting off during waxings, which was downright scary. After using multiple products on my face to ward off dry skin, I discovered Shiseido. Since then, I have not had a problem with dryness and I get compliments on how beautiful my skin is. I had never had that happen prior to using Shiseido products. I kind of figure that if my esthetician is noticing my skin considering the spa she works for sells their own skin care line, no need to change. I also use Shiseido&#x27;s Future Solution Cleansing Cream and the Future Solution Eye and Lip Contour Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from the most expensive stuff to drugstore trying to cure my dry skin now that we live part time in Utah. Nothing works better than Chanel&#x27;s Sublimage, but it is so freaking expensive it&#x27;s prohibitive. The Shiseido does decent job compared to Chanel for slightly less. At end of the day, my sin doesn&#x27;t respond the the cheap stuff. Just the expensive. Oh well. It is worth it until I find a miracle cheapie.</li>
            <li> I have used  it  03 years I only would say Shiseido is good for all of ladies!</li>
            <li> My skin is extra dry in the winter and I&#x27;ve tried a number of moisurizers including Shiseido Bio-Performance Revitalizing Cream. No matter how much I use, my skin is dry the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream, when used together with the Total Regeneration Serum, keeps my skin moisturized overnight,  and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy at all. I can see a huge difference in the mirror the next morning just after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it because it works so well :-)</li>
            <li> I am 65 and have been using this cream for 3 years (approx).  I love the texture &amp; light fragrance of this cream.  I have noticed significant reduction in the lines in my face and my skin is totally hydrated - never dry or flaky.  I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate nearly as much as I used to.  This cream sells for $260 in the stores, so this is a wonderful deal - the cheapest I have ever seen it.  This product is well worth the money. It goes on very smoothly so you can use it very sparingly - mine lasts about 1 year.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Just like all cream, I cant tell if the cream is making me any younger looking. I do like how it gets absorbed into my skin. hmm, the price? Its a cream you wouldn&#x27;t want to buy if you care about the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s what I ordered, new and original! Right on time and I would let others know about it. Nice job!</li>
            <li> Does the work better then others&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive in comparison with others&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you can afford such a luxury</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, no need to say how good this product is.  Seller is very efficient.  Product came in sealed box as expected. Highly recommend it to all ladies.</li>
            <li> Great!Great! Great! I am so happy you be here! It could not be better! I wish you enjoy this. Happy..</li>
            <li> Love it as night cream</li>
            <li> I like it because it works on my skin type.  I don&#x27;t like it because it is too expensive.  Try it first, if it works on your skin, it is no brainer.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the skin. Expensive though</li>
            <li> Have always used bioperformance with good results but the future solutions is unbelievably great&lt;br /&gt;For winter dry sensitive skin. Worth the extra money</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple of months and decided to stop. The cream had a nice texture but it was not very hydrating for me even in the summer. My skin didn&#x27;t feel nourished and it was probably borderline irritated, I have skin that is sensitive chemicals. The fragrance was too strong as well. I later discovered the Korean brand Sulwhasoo which turned out to be much than anything Shiseido has, at least for my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> Works greatly.i am 35 years old and using this for 3 weeks each night , already made my wrinkle ( smile line ) disappeared! And each morning I do not wake up with a dry face anymore. The money is  absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shisedo products since I was a teenager and have been very happy with them.  The reason I chose a 4 star is because it doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as some of the other clients claimed or perhaps I need to buy more products from the same line.  The night cream is very fine.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week and am looking forward to the result I&#x27;m looking for, namely taking away some fine lines on my face.</li>
