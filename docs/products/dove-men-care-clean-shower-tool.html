    <ol>

            <li>I am a woman, but this is the best shower puff I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>I thought since it was made for men that it was the perfect thing to go with the body wash.</li>
            <li>This is the best shower puff that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>It lathers well (though some people think otherwise), but in my opinion it is great.</li>
            <li>so I would say it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Perfect size, lathers up well and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you try this if you want a good shower experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved these types of told.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a scrubber too.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact</li>
            <li>This thing is really handy.  </li>
            <li>and it does the job just fine!</li>
            <li>Your better off using your hand.</li>
            <li>fits better in the hand also.</li>
            <li>Not so for body gels which hold better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>They great for exfoliating the skin and help keep up a lather very well.</li>
            <li>The axe one is better.</li>
            <li>Just be creative.</li>
            <li>Loofa part is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The loofah is just the right side in my opinions and the scrub is a nice added features.</li>
            <li>I like the fact I just hang on the shower head and is easy to get.</li>
            <li>and you end up using way more than intended just to get clean.</li>
            <li>I works fine to a point.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get enough of these, they work great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit your hand.</li>
            <li>Fantastic loofah and scrubber combination.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very well, which kind of defeats the purpose for me.  </li>
            <li>Not like those cheap shower puffs that fall apart after 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not just talking about those cheap ones but the fancy ones too.  </li>
            <li>It holds my soap and makes me clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another review said it can&#x27;t reach everywhere, which is true.  </li>
            <li>By design it is a great idea but both sides are so stiff that your shower gel doesn&#x27;t lather well</li>
            <li>The lather section is not bad and it most definitely hold up well with shower gel/body wash products.</li>
            <li>am getting a new one, only because after months of great use it has developed a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much that I&#x27;m writing a review on amazon about a freaking shower puff!  </li>
            <li>I am a male who has been using body wash with poufs for many years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with poufs which have never failed me.</li>
            <li>It does recommending replacing every few months, but I have been using it for almost four months and it is still in good condition.</li>
            <li>The scrub side will really knock off any rough areas in a hurry and the mesh side is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty decent for using body wash</li>
            <li>I have fairly small hands, but it is very easy to hold and the scrubber on the back of the puff is great (not too rough for any part of my body, but I like having the rougher scrubbing for my feet).  </li>
            <li>but, I really like this thing.  </li>
            <li>Mine lathers very well, is sturdy and really handles the abuse.  </li>
            <li>much lighter in its entirety.</li>
            <li>Also, Dove recommends replacing these every 4 to 6 weeks which seems very wasteful to me.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that a pouf can fit into cracks and such.</li>
            <li>He likes it and says it&#x27;s very versatile--great on both sides.</li>
            <li>The rough pad on the back of this one just doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as the competitors.</li>
            <li>I only have to use a little soap to get a good lather using the mesh side, and the scrub side is perfect for getting rid of dead skin cells that your body produces everyday.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it would soften by frequent use</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s way to big to be useful in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>Made a decent shower cleaner after I realized I could not use it for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s normal pink \\&quot;poof\\&quot; is far better.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone, man or woman.  </li>
            <li>[Though knowing most companies, it would probably cost the same as a new entire thing, that&#x27;s how they are, but I digress].  </li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail a few days ago and I am rather pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The scrubber on the back is a nice touch if you want to scrub extra rough</li>
            <li>so much in fact that after a shower tonight (and figuring out that the pad side is good for rough feet) I decided to at least put another one of these on my &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; once the one I&#x27;m using now decides to give up the fight.  </li>
            <li>good shower tool i really enjoy washin up with this fun little thing its a little hard</li>
            <li>Companies need to make a tool less coarse and then maybe it would work better.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a little unwieldy, but works fine for large areas.</li>
            <li>because my girlfriend always tells me how soft my skin is, dare</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s why my girlfriend always tells me that my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Had mine since early December</li>
            <li>The scrub side on this one is to soft.</li>
            <li>Amazon is such a responsible seller.</li>
            <li>Another plus about this thing is there is no hidden pointy rope knot to scratch the hell out of you by surprise</li>
            <li>Harder to reach certain areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nothing but a regular nylon mesh bath/shower \\&quot;puff\\&quot; with a small patch of cushioned textured nylon washcloth on the other side, with a collar of rubberized plastic that&#x27;s supposed to be easy to grip.</li>
            <li>I generally use about a teaspoon of liquid soap and this is plenty for a shower</li>
            <li>It is not a rough, but scrubs well.</li>
            <li>And as far as quality and longevity, this definitely lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>Got kind of expensive over time buying one every month.</li>
            <li>it certainly gets in the way and makes it impossible to clean between the toes or in other areas where a more flexible and smaller product is needed.</li>
            <li>I bought mine a few months ago at a military exchange in Germany and it&#x27;s still going strong,  </li>
            <li>It is not TOO harsh on the skin and it feels just right.</li>
            <li>It takes a few extra seconds to rinse out, but it is well worth it.  </li>

            <li> It takes a few extra seconds to rinse out, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Complaints may come from hard soap users about its inability to lather and they may be right.</li>
            <li> poor quality, dumb design, too lightweight and way flimsy to get a real good scrub, and it&#x27;s really small.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend complained endlessly about my cheap puffs which fell apart all of the time.  </li>
            <li> When One wants to work it up and down, back and forth, on the back; the lack of a second rope on the bottom is a minus.  </li>
            <li> Its too small and doesn&#x27;t lather up very well.</li>
            <li> Takes the dirt off with the rough side that no regular shower tool can.</li>
            <li> Very rough and pulls at body hair as you scrub, especially on the legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well and seems a waste to barely use it</li>
            <li> Not one iota of it is getting loose.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t loose at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought a second one to have on hand, but to tell you the truth I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever need a second one.</li>
            <li> The most inconvenient device ever and the less functional, I threw them all.</li>
            <li> The plastic grip for the soft mesh is slippery when wet, making it hard to hold on to and to scrub skin with.</li>
            <li> but the soap barely came through the wash cloth side which was rough and annoyingly small.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about having a pink or purple shower puff; I just wanted one that wouldn&#x27;t fall apart after 5 or 6 uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a spa in your hand and takes rough treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost for one item; costs much less at the local discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t work well plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t use any other one anymore.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about the plastic frame-</li>
            <li> I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the lack of lather.</li>
            <li> Also, it would help if there was a replaceable pad; as rinsing it out will do for so long and merely buying a new one about every ?</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of my husband&#x27;s birthday gift as they have been hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy the bigger &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; and in no more than a few weeks they would come unravelled.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the only shower puff I will ever use again!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same one for at least a few months now and it shows no signs of wear at all.</li>
            <li> The loofah part has slightly come out though.</li>
            <li> seems like a waste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless for building lather, even with our soft water.</li>
            <li> I have read a few comments on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> And did I mention that it&#x27;s really, really SMALL?</li>
            <li> Both sides are too small.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this when my axe scrubber needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; side is made with material that is too soft to be considered hard, making exfoliating very difficult combined with the slippery grip.</li>
            <li> but every shower puff I&#x27;ve used before this one gets all loose and useless after 3-5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> But with it&#x27;s hard casing, this shower tool cannot be scrunched up to get a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the bad reviews here, I like this shower puff</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll try to be as delicate as I can here--</li>
            <li> but it is a little difficult to get the suds to come through the scrubbing side</li>
            <li> Not really great for those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong and will never by this tool or Axe shower tool again because it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint since then!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was confused with some of the reviews on this, however.  </li>
            <li> ; wrong.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy a tool as useless as this, it would be returned to the parts store ASAP.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> This scrubber fails in all accounts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: completely useless product.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of these, they work great.</li>
            <li> I have one of these; which I bought at my local store.  I works fine to a point. When One wants to work it up and down, back and forth, on the back; the lack of a second rope on the bottom is a minus.  Also, it would help if there was a replaceable pad; as rinsing it out will do for so long and merely buying a new one about every ? who knows? seems like a waste.  [Though knowing most companies, it would probably cost the same as a new entire thing, that&#x27;s how they are, but I digress].  Just some thoughts.  Same problem with Axe&#x27;s version and others.</li>
            <li> good shower tool i really enjoy washin up with this fun little thing its a little hard but still i like using it</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shower tool.</li>
            <li> Mistake #1  From the photo, I assumed I was getting TWO items at the price; wrong. Didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough. Not worth the cost for one item; costs much less at the local discount store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake #2  I didn&#x27;t preview this product at a store before purchasing online; poor quality, dumb design, too lightweight and way flimsy to get a real good scrub, and it&#x27;s really small. It&#x27;s really nothing but a regular nylon mesh bath/shower \\&quot;puff\\&quot; with a small patch of cushioned textured nylon washcloth on the other side, with a collar of rubberized plastic that&#x27;s supposed to be easy to grip. And did I mention that it&#x27;s really, really SMALL? And FLIMSY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money, either on Amazon or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This thing was obviously designed by a woman. Perfect proof is that the one 5-star review for it is by a woman.    It doesn&#x27;t fit your hand. When you&#x27;re slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto. It&#x27;s useless for building lather, even with our soft water. Both sides are too small. Because of the shell, you can&#x27;t run it between your toes, nor use it even on ground-in dirt between your fingers.    And I&#x27;ll try to be as delicate as I can here-- For washing male \\&quot;private parts,\\&quot; it&#x27;s impossible. Both front and back.    My wife&#x27;s normal pink \\&quot;poof\\&quot; is far better.    Put it in packaging you might see in an auto parts store, and label it a \\&quot;tool.\\&quot; (Obvious male-directed marketing.) It&#x27;s still trash. If I were to buy a tool as useless as this, it would be returned to the parts store ASAP.</li>
            <li> I am a woman, but this is the best shower puff I&#x27;ve ever used!  I don&#x27;t care about having a pink or purple shower puff; I just wanted one that wouldn&#x27;t fall apart after 5 or 6 uses.  I have fairly small hands, but it is very easy to hold and the scrubber on the back of the puff is great (not too rough for any part of my body, but I like having the rougher scrubbing for my feet).  It takes a few extra seconds to rinse out, but it is well worth it.  This is seriously the only shower puff I will ever use again!  Highly recommended for anyone, man or woman.  I have been using the same one for at least a few months now and it shows no signs of wear at all.</li>
            <li> I thought since it was made for men that it was the perfect thing to go with the body wash. Its too small and doesn&#x27;t lather up very well. Your better off using your hand. The plastic that separates the two sides doesn&#x27;t help at all. It feels like your gonna rip it apart. Really it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m not a shower pro but, I really like this thing.  I bought mine a few months ago at a military exchange in Germany and it&#x27;s still going strong,  so much in fact that after a shower tonight (and figuring out that the pad side is good for rough feet) I decided to at least put another one of these on my &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34; once the one I&#x27;m using now decides to give up the fight.  I was confused with some of the reviews on this, however.  Mine lathers very well, is sturdy and really handles the abuse.  I can&#x27;t see using anything else.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace the AXE scrubber version. It is not a rough, but scrubs well. much lighter in its entirety. fits better in the hand also.</li>
            <li> Fantastic loofah and scrubber combination. It is the legit product as pictured and often see as stores. The loofah is just the right side in my opinions and the scrub is a nice added features. If you use any body soap, this Dove shower tool definitely help with decreasing how much body soap you would waste. It does recommending replacing every few months, but I have been using it for almost four months and it is still in good condition. The loofah part has slightly come out though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a pot scrubber attached to a rubber hand grip.  It doesn&#x27;t lather very well, which kind of defeats the purpose for me.  It&#x27;s a great concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty decent for using body wash but it is a little difficult to get the suds to come through the scrubbing side</li>
            <li> It holds my soap and makes me clean.</li>
            <li> The plastic grip for the soft mesh is slippery when wet, making it hard to hold on to and to scrub skin with. Also, the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; side is made with material that is too soft to be considered hard, making exfoliating very difficult combined with the slippery grip.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I just hang on the shower head and is easy to get. Nice to have a scrubber too.</li>
            <li> I prefer Axe&#x27;s version over this one. The rough pad on the back of this one just doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as the competitors.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend complained endlessly about my cheap puffs which fell apart all of the time.  So, I got him this for Christmas and I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint since then!  If he&#x27;s not complaining, he must like it.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves this thing! He works on cars so he uses the scrubby side to remove all the residue and the loofa side to get all soapy. Works great</li>
            <li> I usually buy this when my axe scrubber needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This is the best shower puff that I&#x27;ve used. And I don&#x27;t use any other one anymore. It lathers well (though some people think otherwise), but in my opinion it is great. Another reason why it gets five stars...because my girlfriend always tells me how soft my skin is, dare I say it&#x27;s softer than hers? I only have to use a little soap to get a good lather using the mesh side, and the scrub side is perfect for getting rid of dead skin cells that your body produces everyday. Guess that&#x27;s why my girlfriend always tells me that my skin is so soft.  And as far as quality and longevity, this definitely lasts quite a while. It took almost 5 months for my last one to fall apart. Not like those cheap shower puffs that fall apart after 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend that never uses loofahs. Thought he&#x27;d never crossover from wash clothes but he tried it and said he likes it so I would say it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have read a few comments on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting a new one, only because after months of great use it has developed a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great if you use body cleansing gel on the web side as a spreading application, then use the scrubber side to deep clense. It&#x27;s like a spa in your hand and takes rough treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaints may come from hard soap users about its inability to lather and they may be right. Not so for body gels which hold better.</li>
            <li> The most inconvenient device ever and the less functional, I threw them all. This is a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Takes the dirt off with the rough side that no regular shower tool can. I recommend you try this if you want a good shower experience.</li>
            <li> Loofa part is pretty good. The strap broke after a month or so.</li>
            <li> Not really great for those hard to reach spots. The plastic shell is just to make it look manly, because I cant find another use for it</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail a few days ago and I am rather pleased with it. The lather section is not bad and it most definitely hold up well with shower gel/body wash products. The scrubber side is what did it for me. It is not TOO harsh on the skin and it feels just right. It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with this product. Nice and compact and it does the job just fine!</li>
            <li> It is very hard on the skin.  My husband likes it but I tried it once and it felt like steel wool on my skin.  I guess it is made for men not woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these types of told. They great for exfoliating the skin and help keep up a lather very well.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the bigger &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; and in no more than a few weeks they would come unravelled. Got kind of expensive over time buying one every month. I stumbled on this one at Target and it is the end-all to these things. Had mine since early December and it&#x27;s a champ. Not one iota of it is getting loose. I bought a second one to have on hand, but to tell you the truth I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever need a second one.</li>
            <li> The axe one is better. The scrub side on this one is to soft. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting as cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the bad reviews here, I like this shower puff so much that I&#x27;m writing a review on amazon about a freaking shower puff!  I don&#x27;t know why but every shower puff I&#x27;ve used before this one gets all loose and useless after 3-5 weeks.  And I&#x27;m not just talking about those cheap ones but the fancy ones too.  This thing is sturdy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for months and it isn&#x27;t loose at all.  The scrubber on the back is a nice touch if you want to scrub extra rough, I don&#x27;t use it too often but I could see it wearing out before the puff part.  Another plus about this thing is there is no hidden pointy rope knot to scratch the hell out of you by surprise, you know what I&#x27;m talking about...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review said it can&#x27;t reach everywhere, which is true.  Just be creative.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Holding up well.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Wal-mart for about 3 dollars.  The package was different but the product looks the same.  Needless to say, I hated using it.  It lathered up well but the soap barely came through the wash cloth side which was rough and annoyingly small.  The plastic around it was annoying as well.  Over all I felt 10x cleaner just using a regular shower scrubber.  It&#x27;s made well and seems a waste to barely use it but it just didn&#x27;t work well plain and simple.  Stick with the cheaper versions or even just a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This thing is really handy.  I found myself constantly using my wife&#x27;s exfoliating shower scrub so I needed to get the men&#x27;s version and I could not be happier.  Perfect size, lathers up well and rinses easily.  The scrub side will really knock off any rough areas in a hurry and the mesh side is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers about the plastic frame- it certainly gets in the way and makes it impossible to clean between the toes or in other areas where a more flexible and smaller product is needed. I also find that the rope gets in the way since I don&#x27;t wrap it around my wrist, but this isn&#x27;t a big problem. I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the lack of lather. I generally use about a teaspoon of liquid soap and this is plenty for a shower and I still have to squeeze some out at the end. Overall, it&#x27;s a little unwieldy, but works fine for large areas. I&#x27;ll probably try exfoliating gloves next instead of purchasing another one of these. Also, Dove recommends replacing these every 4 to 6 weeks which seems very wasteful to me.</li>
            <li> This scrubber fails in all accounts.  Once you put the liquid soap in as instructed, it never seems to come out again.  No lather, no scrubbing.  Plus it&#x27;s way to big to be useful in certain areas.  Sent it back.  Thank goodness Amazon is such a responsible seller.</li>
            <li> I am a male who has been using body wash with poufs for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shower tool as a gift. After using it, my conclusion was that this was the absolutely worst \\&quot;shower tool\\&quot; you could use with body was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not build a lather at all. Felt and looked like I was washing with only water.&lt;br /&gt;- Painful. Very rough and pulls at body hair as you scrub, especially on the legs. My legs felt burned after using it.&lt;br /&gt;- Harder to reach certain areas. Let&#x27;s just say that a pouf can fit into cracks and such. But with it&#x27;s hard casing, this shower tool cannot be scrunched up to get a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Made a decent shower cleaner after I realized I could not use it for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: completely useless product. I&#x27;m sticking with poufs which have never failed me.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of my husband&#x27;s birthday gift as they have been hard to find in local stores.  He likes it and says it&#x27;s very versatile--great on both sides.</li>
            <li> By design it is a great idea but both sides are so stiff that your shower gel doesn&#x27;t lather well and you end up using way more than intended just to get clean. At first I thought it would soften by frequent use but I was wrong and will never by this tool or Axe shower tool again because it is a waste of money. Companies need to make a tool less coarse and then maybe it would work better.</li>
