    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product!</li>
            <li>The best thing she could&#x27;ve told me!!</li>
            <li>My brothers gf told me this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>Good coverage. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li>All three items have been great.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s kind of like those prescription drug commercials you see... &amp;#34;Get beautiful nails!</li>
            <li>I got this set for its good reviews.</li>
            <li>I have squared my nails off and with the ridge filler your nails look just perfect and smooth which mine were not.</li>
            <li>Loved this.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li>Lastly, I&#x27;m super happy with the price here on Amazon - it&#x27;s about 1/3 of what you would cost for all three at a salon.</li>
            <li>Foundation II did a good job filling ridges of my nails and made my nail beds look even and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now my nails have filled in and look good when I take the polish</li>
            <li>I came to amazon and came upon the great deal for the both of them for a littler over $8 with free shipping and let me tell you, it has truly turned my nails into STRONG and beautiful nails that look pretty even without a manicure.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong and healthy!</li>
            <li>My nails look amazing and the polish lasts a full week!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use the most.</li>
            <li>After more than 10+ years for  acrylic nails</li>
            <li>And my nails are not any better than they were.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried many products on the market to no</li>
            <li>and then the hardening top coat from this kit.</li>
            <li>and add the top coat once a day.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product so many times already, and will continue to.</li>
            <li>They not only have grime but look great also!</li>
            <li>Within four weeks natural nails look strong, healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li>They are so strong and so clean now that I cannot believe the turn around!</li>
            <li>At times, I place the Nail Tek 2 on the nail, then place a strip of fiberglass mesh over the nail end, then cover that with Nail Tek 2 making a strong nail repair.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it works since most of my time is removing and reapplying but hoping for the best</li>
            <li>The Renew keeps the quick healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using these 3 products for about a week, I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time for this product and a great gift.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable using a product that warns me that it is carcinogenic.</li>
            <li>Buying them together is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>This has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>The product dries quickly which is a plus.</li>
            <li>You can also wear these on the bare nail and they produce a nice finished look for those that don&#x27;t like to wear colored</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to make this set more effective, making nails less prone to chipping, peeling, and breaks.</li>
            <li>I re-do it twice a week to keep the polish looking fresh.</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to take them off for more natural look.</li>
            <li>BUT I was using it alone as my top coat, and I didn&#x27;t really see much results.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is because I wash my hands a lot but this stuff peels off causing me to have to reapply more frequent.</li>
            <li>Will know better next time.</li>
            <li>What my nails were after years of acrylic, and what they are today, is something that cant really be put in to words!</li>
            <li>However, just recently I was told by a great manicurist by my job that it was best when used together with the foundation II (which is a base coat).</li>
            <li>I used every bottle in your an amazingly my nails have been restored back to a natural beauty.</li>
            <li>Even when I don&#x27;t have it on my nails, they look better than they&#x27;ve looked in a very long time.</li>
            <li>An application the next day with the 2 over the repair keeps it strong.</li>
            <li>This is a really great set of nail basecoat and topcoat for those who have weak nails.</li>
            <li>It would be probably fine if I use it occasionally, but for 6 to 8 weeks, probably not....   </li>
            <li>I did some research and learned that formaldehyde is a very effective chemical that helps harden and  strengthen weak nails.</li>
            <li>I still keep my nails semi-short or they will start to tear, but overall this has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>This product not only filled the ridges and stopped the peeling</li>
            <li>This set really works.</li>
            <li>Now 6 weeks later I have beautiful nail&#x27;s which have grown past my finger tips and are much thicker.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute WONDER.  </li>
            <li>The Nail Tek 2 in the package reinforces nail tips, so they don&#x27;t split or create hangnails, better than any other product.</li>
            <li>I apply these, I like to push my cuticles back and apply to the whole nail, taking a moment to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; the tips of the nail by running the brush (with only a tiny bit of polish on it) around the free edges on the top and sides of my nail.</li>
            <li>This product dries quickly and stays no matter if your hands are in lots of water, cleaning and daily chores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I wear it every single time I polish, and the Foundation is particular is a lifesaver for nails that aren&#x27;t naturally perfectly smooth -- it makes polish adhere to the nail better and presents a smooth base for metallic or frosty shades that would normally highlight every lump and ridge.</li>
            <li>By day three, the polish is completely peeling off and has to be removed and started again.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve had long nails!</li>
            <li>The base coat is excellent, its almost like a ridge filler as well as a base which was great in the very beginning.</li>
            <li>However, the polish drys much faster than your standard clear coat, so I can paint them and almost immediately go back to typing on my keyboard, or drinking coffee in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I am also using a clear nail bandage to add extra protection.</li>
            <li>Initially, I thought it would be cumbersome to have to add the clear coat every day.  </li>
            <li>I apply the clear a few times a week and have only had to completely remove about three times.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have been using for two months as a rip in my thumb nail is slowly growing out thanks to this kit.</li>
            <li> All my life I have lived with my dry, brittle, flaky nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks to recover from constant acrylic, and it seems to me that it very obviously DOES WORK, but the bottle also warns you about the fact that it contains a carcinogen.</li>
            <li> my nails were weak,  thin and broke very easily.</li>
            <li> The white in the Nail Tek 2 doesn&#x27;t stain to turn black when working.</li>
            <li> Since it would take 6 to 8 weeks or so for my nails to grow back to their normal status, I found this set not ideal for me.</li>
            <li> It is kind of annoying</li>
            <li> The last time, I could not see the tear, unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It seems to work with any polish although I typically use Orly or OPI.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Side effects may include leukemia.&amp;#34; Can&#x27;t really 5 star a product that&#x27;s using a chemical that&#x27;s been classified as dangerous, but if they could make this stuff work as well without that drawback, I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> However, if you wear it for a few days it starts to chip off.</li>
            <li> You are instructed to apply one coat of the solution everyday for seven days then remove and begin again.</li>
            <li> I recently removed my acrylic nails and was searching for products that can protect my thin and brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I have used another product in the past, but saw this one and decided to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Have had it for three weeks and have yet to get past day three with it still on my nails.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but am now totally convinced that this product has saved my nails.</li>
            <li> Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Let me add that I am prohibited from having color-painted or artificial nails due to my work in the food product development industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They always looked awful, and I had just about given up on ever having pretty nails.  </li>
            <li> (For those who had acrylic nails before, you know what I mean!)</li>
            <li> Poor value for what I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> My nails were paper thin and hurt after taking them all off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having the strength of false nails.</li>
            <li> Both Foubdation II and Therapy II contain &amp;#34;formaldehyde&amp;#34;, which unfortunately, is known for being a carcinogen.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, peeling nails and had added to the problem by using gel.</li>
            <li> I got it because since being &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; my nails are very thin.</li>
            <li> Will not use it and would not recommend it as it is dangerous for health.</li>
            <li> After wearing artificial nails for years and removing them...</li>
            <li> However, what really disappointed or maybe scared me is the ingredients of the products.</li>

            <li> I recently stopped doing acrylic nails and gel nails. My nails were trashed! I used every bottle in your an amazingly my nails have been restored back to a natural beauty. They are so strong and so clean now that I cannot believe the turn around!</li>
            <li> Have been using for two months as a rip in my thumb nail is slowly growing out thanks to this kit. I apply the clear a few times a week and have only had to completely remove about three times. The last time, I could not see the tear, unbelievable. I am also using a clear nail bandage to add extra protection. I have tried everything and am amazed at how well these treatments work. My nails have ridges and often rip along one of them.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a mess.  Box was smashed.  Not at all what I was expecting.  Poor value for what I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it does strengthen your nails. However, if you wear it for a few days it starts to chip off. I am thinking it is made so you have to keep re-applying. It is kind of annoying but it def will help strengthen your nails and help with nails that peel.</li>
            <li> This is a really great set of nail basecoat and topcoat for those who have weak nails. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months and my nails are noticeably longer and stronger. I wear it every single time I polish, and the Foundation is particular is a lifesaver for nails that aren&#x27;t naturally perfectly smooth -- it makes polish adhere to the nail better and presents a smooth base for metallic or frosty shades that would normally highlight every lump and ridge. You can also wear these on the bare nail and they produce a nice finished look for those that don&#x27;t like to wear colored polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply these, I like to push my cuticles back and apply to the whole nail, taking a moment to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; the tips of the nail by running the brush (with only a tiny bit of polish on it) around the free edges on the top and sides of my nail. I&#x27;ve found this to make this set more effective, making nails less prone to chipping, peeling, and breaks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Had acrylics then shellac for 20 years. My nails were paper thin and hurt after taking them all off. This has worked very well for me. I still keep my nails semi-short or they will start to tear, but overall this has made a huge difference. The base coat is excellent, its almost like a ridge filler as well as a base which was great in the very beginning. I re-do it twice a week to keep the polish looking fresh. It seems to work with any polish although I typically use Orly or OPI. Def recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product line for about 5 years now and will never change.  It&#x27;s like having the strength of false nails.</li>
            <li> The Nail Tek 2 in the package reinforces nail tips, so they don&#x27;t split or create hangnails, better than any other product. The white in the Nail Tek 2 doesn&#x27;t stain to turn black when working. The Renew keeps the quick healthy. I&#x27;ll probably order just the Nail Tek 2 as that&#x27;s the bottle I use the most. At times, I place the Nail Tek 2 on the nail, then place a strip of fiberglass mesh over the nail end, then cover that with Nail Tek 2 making a strong nail repair. An application the next day with the 2 over the repair keeps it strong.</li>
            <li> I did not know it contained formaldahyde!  Will not use it and would not recommend it as it is dangerous for health.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  After more than 10+ years for  acrylic nails I decided I wanted to take them off for more natural look. Used this product and I am amazed at the results. Within four weeks natural nails look strong, healthy and beautiful. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried everything and this work. My nails look amazing and the polish lasts a full week! If your nails are splitting this is a must have!</li>
            <li> I need help with my nails. This has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have used another product in the past, but saw this one and decided to give it a chance. Not a good choice. You are instructed to apply one coat of the solution everyday for seven days then remove and begin again. By day three, the polish is completely peeling off and has to be removed and started again. Have had it for three weeks and have yet to get past day three with it still on my nails. And my nails are not any better than they were. Should have stuck with the product I know works. Will know better next time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but am now totally convinced that this product has saved my nails. I have very thin, peeling nails and had added to the problem by using gel. This product not only filled the ridges and stopped the peeling but it also made my nails stronger. Even when I don&#x27;t have it on my nails, they look better than they&#x27;ve looked in a very long time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t repair my nails how I thought it was going to, they ended up breaking.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is the second time for this product and a great gift.</li>
            <li> I feel hesitant writing this review since I am not giving it 4 or 5 stars. Here are the reasons:  For the effects of the product, I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars. This set really works. I recently removed my acrylic nails and was searching for products that can protect my thin and brittle nails. (For those who had acrylic nails before, you know what I mean!) I got this set for its good reviews. Foundation II did a good job filling ridges of my nails and made my nail beds look even and smooth. Therapy II hardened and strengthened my nails. I followed the instructions, and it did the work I needed.    However, what really disappointed or maybe scared me is the ingredients of the products. I wish Amazon and the manufacturer could lists all of the ingredients. Both Foubdation II and Therapy II contain &amp;#34;formaldehyde&amp;#34;, which unfortunately, is known for being a carcinogen. I did some research and learned that formaldehyde is a very effective chemical that helps harden and  strengthen weak nails. However, the downfall of this ingredient is that it is harmful if being used on a regular basis. Since it would take 6 to 8 weeks or so for my nails to grow back to their normal status, I found this set not ideal for me. I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable using a product that warns me that it is carcinogenic. It would be probably fine if I use it occasionally, but for 6 to 8 weeks, probably not....   If you are searching for 3-free or 4-free nail products, this set is not for you.</li>
            <li> Love these! My nails are strong and healthy!</li>
            <li> Great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> After wearing artificial nails for years and removing them... my nails were weak,  thin and broke very easily. I tried many products on the market to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to find Nail Tek and thought I will give one last product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First step is the ridge filler(I use 2 coats) then you can use reg. nail polish or NOT and then the hardening top coat from this kit. This product dries quickly and stays no matter if your hands are in lots of water, cleaning and daily chores. You are to change the ridge filler once a wk. and add the top coat once a day. In one week I noticed the difference. Now 6 weeks later I have beautiful nail&#x27;s which have grown past my finger tips and are much thicker. I have squared my nails off and with the ridge filler your nails look just perfect and smooth which mine were not. Now my nails have filled in and look good when I take the polish off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!</li>
            <li> What my nails were after years of acrylic, and what they are today, is something that cant really be put in to words! Here&#x27;s the thing tho, I have been using Nail Tek&#x27;s Intensive Therapy II for yearsss. BUT I was using it alone as my top coat, and I didn&#x27;t really see much results. However, just recently I was told by a great manicurist by my job that it was best when used together with the foundation II (which is a base coat). The best thing she could&#x27;ve told me!! I came to amazon and came upon the great deal for the both of them for a littler over $8 with free shipping and let me tell you, it has truly turned my nails into STRONG and beautiful nails that look pretty even without a manicure. I will never ever look back to acrylic. I have ordered this product so many times already, and will continue to. I couldnt imagine using anything else. I vouch for this product 100 PERCENT!</li>
            <li> My brothers gf told me this stuff is the best. I got it because since being &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; my nails are very thin. Perhaps it is because I wash my hands a lot but this stuff peels off causing me to have to reapply more frequent. Not sure how it works since most of my time is removing and reapplying but hoping for the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for years and often give this set as gifts. Buying them together is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> Product works as stated. The product dries quickly which is a plus. Good coverage. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Loved this. It does work. First time I&#x27;ve had long nails! They not only have grime but look great also!</li>
            <li> All three items have been great.  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks to recover from constant acrylic, and it seems to me that it very obviously DOES WORK, but the bottle also warns you about the fact that it contains a carcinogen. So, it&#x27;s kind of like those prescription drug commercials you see... &amp;#34;Get beautiful nails! Side effects may include leukemia.&amp;#34; Can&#x27;t really 5 star a product that&#x27;s using a chemical that&#x27;s been classified as dangerous, but if they could make this stuff work as well without that drawback, I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> helped my nails after rooming gel</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, yes!  This product is an absolute WONDER.  All my life I have lived with my dry, brittle, flaky nails.  They always looked awful, and I had just about given up on ever having pretty nails.  Let me add that I am prohibited from having color-painted or artificial nails due to my work in the food product development industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these 3 products for about a week, I saw a huge difference.  Initially, I thought it would be cumbersome to have to add the clear coat every day.  However, the polish drys much faster than your standard clear coat, so I can paint them and almost immediately go back to typing on my keyboard, or drinking coffee in the morning.  Just make a routine of it, and it&#x27;s no fuss at all. Lastly, I&#x27;m super happy with the price here on Amazon - it&#x27;s about 1/3 of what you would cost for all three at a salon.</li>
