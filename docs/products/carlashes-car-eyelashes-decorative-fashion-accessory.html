            <li>eye catching...</li>
            <li>I had a nice chat with the wife of the inventor.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading,     Alison Parker &lt;3</li>
            <li>She of course said that it was nice while they lasted.</li>
            <li>buy at your own risk</li>
            <li>Loved the eyelashes, thought they were cute as all get out.  </li>
            <li>they worked great and look cute on my car, also easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>It is a good price for such a great accessory !</li>
            <li>they were great right out of the package, so she put them on the headlights and then curled them with a pair of scissors</li>
            <li>I put them on right away and curled them all up cute!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Eyelashes and light weight is a new idea and everyone is impressed by them</li>
            <li>it works just fine, but nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be cute</li>
            <li>These carlashes are so cute, I really love them.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay though because you can still make them look cute on your (or a friend&#x27;s) car.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>the eyelashes scratched the top of my hood from hitting them and they all chipped off.</li>
            <li>I think my shipping cost more than the lashes themselves</li>
            <li>I purchased a set for my vehicle and it dmaged my paint and after a week noticed that many of the lashes were already torn off.</li>
            <li>everyone noticed them and commented on how cute they were...</li>
            <li>and they looked cute and everything</li>
            <li>I love them and everyone that sees them as well</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Carlashes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>I bought this item thinking it would be cute since I&#x27;m a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I have yet to put them on as it&#x27;s winter here, but they look adorable</li>
            <li>Overall effect with the car very happy.</li>
            <li>Looked cute.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT SURE WOULD HAVE LOOKED CUTE.</li>
            <li>Glad it was a cheap product !</li>
            <li>they were cute but the lashes lost their curl.  </li>
            <li>They were cute while they lasted though</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love them.  </li>
            <li>I watched a video on YouTube to make sure I applied them correctly.  </li>
            <li>I thought they was cute</li>
            <li>After many trips in the car, they bent upward by the wind and eventually broke off.</li>
            <li>I will wait till this heat is over and try again, because they are cute.</li>
            <li>and I really love them.</li>
            <li>Love the eyelashes and will well with my car.</li>
            <li>Lashes are too cute for words.</li>
            <li>I THINK SHE WILL LOVE THIS BECAUSE SHE IS IN COSMETOLOGY ...</li>
            <li>We put these adorable car lashes on our truck for Halloween an everyone lived them.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>i always get complemented and they look so cute.</li>
            <li>if I could find some that are more durable</li>
            <li>They looked really cute.  </li>
            <li>If you apply them make sure that when puched backwards that they will not hit a painted surface.</li>
            <li>I love it and it looks cute on my car.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it...</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments, smiles, etc from EVERYONE-and all walks of life.  </li>
            <li>(and really, isn&#x27;t it better that if we are driving around town, we don&#x27;t want the lashes falling off.  </li>
            <li>The lashes were okay.  </li>
            <li>Despite all that there super cute and I love them!</li>
            <li>they are fine for awhile but not permanent great product by the way and worth every penny that is whats important</li>
            <li>I loved how it looked the first two days.</li>
            <li>I loved how they looked on my car, at first i thought they wouldn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li>This product was good at first.  </li>
            <li>The lashes were great fun at first</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly what the lashes did to the top of my hood &amp; not to mention, the wind plucked some of my lashes out lmao..</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, a cute cheap way to make your car stand out.</li>
            <li>They stick on easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They were easy to install</li>
            <li>Easy to curl...</li>
            <li>Easy to curl, they won&#x27;t bend under the weather.</li>
            <li>So easy to put on.</li>
            <li>It applied easily &amp; I got the laughs I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>The lashes were alot stiffer and not as easy to apply to the car as  thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife&#x27;s car, she loves them, they help her find her car in the parking lots and start a lot of conversations, they installed easily and came as described.</li>
            <li>They were easy to install.  </li>
            <li>I put these on my car and it was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t put them on yet, but they have easy instructions.</li>
            <li>I had to use a Magic Eraser from Mr. Clean to get it off.</li>
            <li>The lashes stayed on just fine, but they damaged my cars paint.</li>
            <li>The price was fine, but I wish there would have been a warning about the temperature durability.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so i guess its fine.</li>
            <li>These carlashes look super cute on your car but they lashes sort of fall off one at a time after a while.</li>
            <li>Beware counterfeit Carlashes(tm) available on Ebay and Amazon.</li>
            <li>They suck and so does their cheap product.</li>
            <li>But eyelashes didnt fit on my car.</li>
            <li>i was driving on the interstate &amp; seen 2 fly back over my car.</li>
            <li>The ones I kept getting online are cheap, flimsy, floppy, and look nothing like the photo.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my car (&#x27;06 Chevy Cobalt) and they fit</li>
            <li>They looked great when my car wasn&#x27;t in motion, then the ones that were left began to \\&quot;wilt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li>After I placed them on the cheap tape that was supposed to hold them on did not do its job at all.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>They look super cute, make people smile, and attract a lot of attention.  </li>
            <li>so i used double sided tape and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li>They were a lot of fun while they lasted!</li>
            <li>Cute as a buttom when we first put them on the vehicle</li>
            <li>I bought these to make my car unique.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get these</li>
            <li>My friend ordered Original Carlashes..</li>
            <li>I was excited about this</li>
            <li>I was excited to get them and my husband</li>
            <li>These lashes are much more sturdy and withstand higher speeds without moving</li>
            <li>At first I was really excited about them... easy to put on, easy to curl...</li>
            <li>While the carlashes look very cute and are easy to apply, they scuff the surface of the hood which sits above the carlashes.  </li>
            <li>I was SUPER excited the night I received my car lashes in the mail.  </li>
            <li>P.s to the ladies now we have something cool for our cars, the men have hangin&#x27; nuts</li>
            <li>This lady in the office is a sweet lady</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on them.</li>
            <li>Worked out good with all I did people just couldn&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
            <li>They were really cute, I curled them myself as they were straight when I received them.  </li>
            <li>But it was still pretty easy to figure out how to curl the lashes.</li>
            <li>they are they only ones that are best quality and the only ones authorized to use the name because it is trade-marked.  </li>
            <li>Buyer shipped them quickly.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how many people didn&#x27;t know these are available.</li>
            <li>I only seemed to be able to find great carlashes from a local vendor.</li>
            <li>I love my new eyelashes</li>
            <li>This was just a funny gift I bought a friend!</li>
            <li>Scrached my car and fell off after the first ride!</li>
            <li>Installed, looked great, firmly attached, sat overnight on the car.</li>
            <li>hope you enjoy them as much as she does</li>
            <li>People point and smile when she goes by.</li>
            <li>only thing that I would had liked to receive with the package is instructions how to put them on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to see everyone&#x27;s reaction to a car with eyelashes.</li>
            <li>and it was fun.</li>
            <li>you want to make people smile, put some lashes on your car.</li>
            <li>Loved them they looked fantastic on but in the New Zealand summer they dried out, became brittle &amp; snapped off easily.</li>
            <li>eyelashes didn&#x27;t  work right and won&#x27;t stay on ...</li>
            <li>They barely stay in place and when u accelerate ur car, they fly back and scratch your hood.</li>
            <li>I am impressed by the quality and the specific instruction that were included down to the alcohol wipe.</li>
            <li>Oh well its worth it ;-)</li>
            <li>They started to break off on the first day, and my husband removed them right after because they were damaging the paint.</li>
            <li>They add such great personally to your car.  </li>
            <li>I did them exactly as according to directions.</li>
            <li>It was so funny to see peoples reactions.</li>
            <li>And whats even better is Im the only one in my city with them (for now anyway).</li>
            <li>These lashes lasted exactly one trip on the road.  </li>
            <li>These eyelashes were so pretty</li>
            <li>The first time we hit the highway, they started to peel away, but didn&#x27;t fall off.  </li>
            <li>that is if they last more than a week on your car.</li>
            <li>Before this happened I ordered two more sets for out of state X-mas gifts and by the time I had them send back to me</li>
            <li>I would save your money or splurg for the higher quality on this one.</li>
            <li>My wife should have read the reviews first before buying.</li>
            <li>First ride, at 45 mph they flew off.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t put two and two together and then out of no</li>
            <li>gave to a friend for Christmas, and on her first time on the highway they chipped off.</li>
            <li>I received this product pretty timely considering it was coming from hong kong.  </li>
            <li>you attempt to use these they will likely be so beat up (before you even drive with them) that you won&#x27;t be able to return them.</li>
            <li>they broke the first day on my way to work</li>
            <li>First off they do not have any instructions with them.  </li>
            <li>They were cute when I applied them but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>During hot days they lost the curl I gave them.</li>
            <li>After a week of hot nd rain they became brittle plastic</li>
            <li>THIS IS FOR MY DAUGHTERS FIRST CAR ..</li>
            <li>They are pretty.</li>
            <li>But they were ridiculously cheap, which is the only reason I am not mad.</li>
            <li>they stayed on nicely during rain and highway driving speeds, but they can&#x27;t stand up to kids with no values of other peoples property.</li>
            <li>They are infinitely better, not flat, and very durable.</li>
            <li>These were plastic, easy to apply, and several lashes broke off within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re only cute when your car is parked or at a red light.</li>
            <li>THIS IS PRETTY MUCH</li>
            <li>and you have to curl them a little yourself, but once they are on your car, the wind will make sure your car lashes are perky!</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk of black marks.</li>
            <li>After tho i just got some double sided strong tape and reused them again.</li>
            <li>Every single lash on BOTH sets of lashes were chipped at the top.</li>
            <li>they are flimsy and once you are in the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; with this certain speed they flap up against your hood</li>
            <li>They would be great for a car show where the car is not moving as long as it&#x27;s not hot &amp; sunny.  </li>
            <li>This manufacturer uses the exact same photo as the original car lashes, which is what I thought I was buying.  </li>
            <li>would probably not work very well at high speeds or in the hot sun, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to.</li>
            <li>When they fly back while driving, they wear down the lacquer on the hood of your car and leave spots that you CANNOT remove!</li>
            <li>When you are driving the lashes click against the hood of the car and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>but they did&#x27;t hold on very well.</li>
            <li>I get just as much attention as the cars that have rims.</li>
            <li>followed the instruction and didnt drive fast for a WHOLE DAY.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>very noticeable...</li>
            <li>Also take a look at CNN.com for a piece on the real creators of the product.</li>
            <li>I bought these by mistake and found out about the real ones after some researching.</li>
            <li>Please support this company as it is a fantastic idea and just starting up.</li>
            <li>The lashes were totally straight and pointed straight ahead.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a pair of these cheap knock-offs..they were made out of inner tubes...flimsy and lasted 2-3 days and marred the paint when I removed them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy these, like another reviewer said, there is a website for the real thing and these are not it.</li>
            <li>very upset -</li>
            <li>I would really like to know if something can be done.</li>
            <li>However, I travel on the freeway about three times a week and the wind really took a toll on them.</li>
            <li>However, if you have any intent on driving a high speeds AVOID!</li>
            <li>A 40cent novelty is now going to be costing a WHOLE lot</li>
            <li>I recently purchased carlashes for my 74 buick, I really enjoy them and so does everyone else.</li>
            <li>Much flimsier than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than alternatives sold at gift stores</li>
            <li>If you wiggle them too much when drying your car, they will pop off.</li>
            <li>I used these to make bottom lases to really give it the look of real eyes.</li>
            <li>(this is unusual for California)  </li>
            <li>These things are made for headlights that are straight with no curve at all.</li>
            <li>cuter then any of the others when it goes out for deliveries, and really, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li>The only reason i bought another pair is because they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>Never seen kids laughing so much at a vehical, lived it.</li>
            <li>they broke off very soon and would not stay up like they need to be.  </li>
            <li>They were meant to create a smile and all I have so far is stress and anxiety waiting on them.  </li>
            <li>After waitin all that time, waiting for the lashes, When I got them they will not stick... Was very disapointed..</li>
            <li>Added just the right amount of spizaz to my cute little car.</li>
            <li>They are very cute but did not last very long.  </li>
            <li>super cute but some juvenile ripped them off my car when i was in a store.</li>
            <li>But, they can scratch and damage your car if driving too fast in high winds.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that the wind blows them against the top of my hood and is leaving black rubber marks on it.  </li>
            <li>I waited a really long time to receive these and was so excited to put them on my car.</li>
            <li>Highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to every to everyone.</li>
            <li>it took me a little more than an hr to curl one lash and when i tried to stick it on the headlight, the dang thing refused to stick even thought i cleaned it off an everything.</li>
            <li>Absolutely NO seller on Amazon is selling genuine Carlashes.     </li>
            <li>and they were cool for the first day, then the next day some of the eyelashes didn&#x27;t spring back up</li>
            <li>Looked more like missing teeth, so I took them off.</li>
            <li>Yeah they look cute but beware they will destroy your paint</li>
            <li>Not sure she ever used it, but well worth the smile factor when she opened it up!</li>
            <li>Wanted to try something on my new car.</li>
            <li>I live in Los Angeles therefor I drive freeways a lot.</li>
            <li>I live in California and my car is in the sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying them for my new car as well.</li>
            <li>they were cute but they snapped like raw noodles in the wind</li>
            <li>these this is not the real car lashes, because the real ones are made from different material that do not scratch the hood of your car!</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t last if you drive at higher speeds</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re all the same exact size.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;ve survived the winter season so far!</li>
            <li>The instructions were in Japanese and the lashes blew off the car the first time we drove it.  </li>
            <li>I seen the first 1 &amp; said what the hell &amp; when I seen the 2nd one</li>
            <li>Even after following the instructions exact to curl the lashes they didnt look like the ones pictured.</li>
            <li>they completely scratched the paint on my NEW car damaging the finish on the hood.</li>
            <li>It was easy curling them and applying them to my car but after a few days I noticed the paint on my car near them looked scratched.</li>
            <li>They fall off easily and it was a complete waste.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t plan on driving over 40mph go for it, but if you want to avoid damage to your cars paint job I recommend steering clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to buff it out and maybe put a clear removable contact strip where they hit.  </li>
            <li>This product is cheap and will destroy your paint job on your car...</li>
            <li>I will have to get it repaired by a professional and it will cost lots of $$$.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t last for much time at all.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t quite melt, but I had to re-curl them frequently.</li>
            <li>First I cleaned the headlights and let them dry.  </li>
            <li>Also, do not mess with the crystals if you put those on too.  </li>
            <li>Had to do so much modification to place on my wife&#x27;s car after the month long wait to get to our house.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the lashes as far as washing my car or general maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recomend these to anyone wishing for a special little touch to a small car sporty or an old van  just for fun.</li>
            <li>Then when I got to my father&#x27;s house I noticed that the eyelashes had been beating against the car and not only had scratch the car but had taken off the clear coat!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was due to the hear here in Phenix during the summer</li>
            <li>I had a nearly brand new car, drove with these for a day, and then got home and noticed that they blew back and made thousands of tiny scratches.</li>
            <li>Product was good, but it arrived too late to be of any use to me!!!  </li>
            <li>Wish they had worked out, but just not worth the trouble to buy more.</li>
            <li>I should have spent the $26 and got the real thing.</li>
            <li>(it was barely on anyway) and threw it away.  </li>
            <li>The process for taking these suckers off isn&#x27;t as easy as the removal instructions say, especially when they&#x27;ve been baked onto the car for a year.  </li>
            <li>The next day, it was so hot, they just drooped down onto the headlights.  </li>
            <li>With the first trip to town they left black marks all over the hood where the eyelashes hit the hood.</li>
            <li>First time I drove the car with the eyelashes applied, they left black marks all over the paint.  </li>
            <li>everyone and I mean everyone had to say something about them, which was cool.</li>
            <li>I have a white toyota corolla and these left huge black smudges and tiny little scratches all over my hood...</li>
            <li>how, I see you have to clean the headlight ,dry thoroughly &amp; leave the lashes for at least 24 hours.</li>

            <li> I thought it would be cute</li>
            <li> These carlashes are so cute, I really love them.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay though because you can still make them look cute on your (or a friend&#x27;s) car.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> the eyelashes scratched the top of my hood from hitting them and they all chipped off.</li>
            <li> I think my shipping cost more than the lashes themselves</li>

            <li> They were cute while they lasted though</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love them.  </li>
            <li> I watched a video on YouTube to make sure I applied them correctly.  </li>
            <li> I thought they was cute</li>
            <li> After many trips in the car, they bent upward by the wind and eventually broke off.</li>
            <li> I will wait till this heat is over and try again, because they are cute.</li>
            <li> and I really love them.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes and will well with my car.</li>
            <li> Lashes are too cute for words.</li>
            <li> I THINK SHE WILL LOVE THIS BECAUSE SHE IS IN COSMETOLOGY ...</li>

            <li> if I could find some that are more durable</li>
            <li> They looked really cute.  </li>
            <li> If you apply them make sure that when puched backwards that they will not hit a painted surface.</li>
            <li> I love it and it looks cute on my car.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I love it...</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments, smiles, etc from EVERYONE-and all walks of life.  </li>
            <li> (and really, isn&#x27;t it better that if we are driving around town, we don&#x27;t want the lashes falling off.  </li>
            <li> The lashes were okay.  </li>
            <li> Despite all that there super cute and I love them!</li>
            <li> they are fine for awhile but not permanent great product by the way and worth every penny that is whats important</li>
            <li> I loved how it looked the first two days.</li>
            <li> I loved how they looked on my car, at first i thought they wouldn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> This product was good at first.  </li>
            <li> The lashes were great fun at first</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly what the lashes did to the top of my hood &amp; not to mention, the wind plucked some of my lashes out lmao..</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, a cute cheap way to make your car stand out.</li>
            <li> They stick on easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They were easy to install</li>
            <li> Easy to curl...</li>
            <li> Easy to curl, they won&#x27;t bend under the weather.</li>
            <li> So easy to put on.</li>
            <li> It applied easily &amp; I got the laughs I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> The lashes were alot stiffer and not as easy to apply to the car as  thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s car, she loves them, they help her find her car in the parking lots and start a lot of conversations, they installed easily and came as described.</li>
            <li> They were easy to install.  </li>
            <li> I put these on my car and it was so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put them on yet, but they have easy instructions.</li>
            <li> I had to use a Magic Eraser from Mr. Clean to get it off.</li>
            <li> The lashes stayed on just fine, but they damaged my cars paint.</li>
            <li> The price was fine, but I wish there would have been a warning about the temperature durability.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so i guess its fine.</li>
            <li> These carlashes look super cute on your car but they lashes sort of fall off one at a time after a while.</li>
            <li> Beware counterfeit Carlashes(tm) available on Ebay and Amazon.</li>
            <li> They suck and so does their cheap product.</li>
            <li> But eyelashes didnt fit on my car.</li>
            <li> i was driving on the interstate &amp; seen 2 fly back over my car.</li>
            <li> The ones I kept getting online are cheap, flimsy, floppy, and look nothing like the photo.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my car (&#x27;06 Chevy Cobalt) and they fit</li>
            <li> They looked great when my car wasn&#x27;t in motion, then the ones that were left began to \\&quot;wilt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li> After I placed them on the cheap tape that was supposed to hold them on did not do its job at all.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> They look super cute, make people smile, and attract a lot of attention.  </li>
            <li> so i used double sided tape and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li> They were a lot of fun while they lasted!</li>
            <li> Cute as a buttom when we first put them on the vehicle</li>
            <li> I bought these to make my car unique.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get these</li>
            <li> My friend ordered Original Carlashes..</li>
            <li> I was excited about this</li>
            <li> I was excited to get them and my husband</li>
            <li> These lashes are much more sturdy and withstand higher speeds without moving</li>
            <li> At first I was really excited about them... easy to put on, easy to curl...</li>
            <li> While the carlashes look very cute and are easy to apply, they scuff the surface of the hood which sits above the carlashes.  </li>
            <li> I was SUPER excited the night I received my car lashes in the mail.  </li>
            <li> P.s to the ladies now we have something cool for our cars, the men have hangin&#x27; nuts</li>
            <li> This lady in the office is a sweet lady</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on them.</li>
            <li> Worked out good with all I did people just couldn&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
            <li> They were really cute, I curled them myself as they were straight when I received them.  </li>
            <li> But it was still pretty easy to figure out how to curl the lashes.</li>
            <li> they are they only ones that are best quality and the only ones authorized to use the name because it is trade-marked.  </li>
            <li> Buyer shipped them quickly.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how many people didn&#x27;t know these are available.</li>
            <li> I only seemed to be able to find great carlashes from a local vendor.</li>
            <li> I love my new eyelashes</li>
            <li> This was just a funny gift I bought a friend!</li>
            <li> Scrached my car and fell off after the first ride!</li>
            <li> Installed, looked great, firmly attached, sat overnight on the car.</li>
            <li> hope you enjoy them as much as she does</li>
            <li> People point and smile when she goes by.</li>
            <li> only thing that I would had liked to receive with the package is instructions how to put them on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to see everyone&#x27;s reaction to a car with eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and it was fun.</li>
            <li> you want to make people smile, put some lashes on your car.</li>
            <li> Loved them they looked fantastic on but in the New Zealand summer they dried out, became brittle &amp; snapped off easily.</li>
            <li> eyelashes didn&#x27;t  work right and won&#x27;t stay on ...</li>
            <li> They barely stay in place and when u accelerate ur car, they fly back and scratch your hood.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the quality and the specific instruction that were included down to the alcohol wipe.</li>
            <li> Oh well its worth it ;-)</li>
            <li> They started to break off on the first day, and my husband removed them right after because they were damaging the paint.</li>
            <li> They add such great personally to your car.  </li>
            <li> I did them exactly as according to directions.</li>
            <li> It was so funny to see peoples reactions.</li>
            <li> And whats even better is Im the only one in my city with them (for now anyway).</li>
            <li> These lashes lasted exactly one trip on the road.  </li>
            <li> These eyelashes were so pretty</li>
            <li> The first time we hit the highway, they started to peel away, but didn&#x27;t fall off.  </li>
            <li> that is if they last more than a week on your car.</li>
            <li> Before this happened I ordered two more sets for out of state X-mas gifts and by the time I had them send back to me</li>
            <li> I would save your money or splurg for the higher quality on this one.</li>
            <li> My wife should have read the reviews first before buying.</li>
            <li> First ride, at 45 mph they flew off.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t put two and two together and then out of no</li>
            <li> gave to a friend for Christmas, and on her first time on the highway they chipped off.</li>
            <li> I received this product pretty timely considering it was coming from hong kong.  </li>
            <li> you attempt to use these they will likely be so beat up (before you even drive with them) that you won&#x27;t be able to return them.</li>
            <li> they broke the first day on my way to work</li>
            <li> First off they do not have any instructions with them.  </li>
            <li> They were cute when I applied them but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> During hot days they lost the curl I gave them.</li>
            <li> After a week of hot nd rain they became brittle plastic</li>
            <li> THIS IS FOR MY DAUGHTERS FIRST CAR ..</li>
            <li> They are pretty.</li>
            <li> But they were ridiculously cheap, which is the only reason I am not mad.</li>
            <li> they stayed on nicely during rain and highway driving speeds, but they can&#x27;t stand up to kids with no values of other peoples property.</li>
            <li> They are infinitely better, not flat, and very durable.</li>
            <li> These were plastic, easy to apply, and several lashes broke off within the first week of use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re only cute when your car is parked or at a red light.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PRETTY MUCH</li>
            <li> and you have to curl them a little yourself, but once they are on your car, the wind will make sure your car lashes are perky!</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk of black marks.</li>
            <li> After tho i just got some double sided strong tape and reused them again.</li>
            <li> Every single lash on BOTH sets of lashes were chipped at the top.</li>
            <li> they are flimsy and once you are in the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; with this certain speed they flap up against your hood</li>
            <li> They would be great for a car show where the car is not moving as long as it&#x27;s not hot &amp; sunny.  </li>
            <li> This manufacturer uses the exact same photo as the original car lashes, which is what I thought I was buying.  </li>
            <li> would probably not work very well at high speeds or in the hot sun, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to.</li>
            <li> When they fly back while driving, they wear down the lacquer on the hood of your car and leave spots that you CANNOT remove!</li>
            <li> When you are driving the lashes click against the hood of the car and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> but they did&#x27;t hold on very well.</li>
            <li> I get just as much attention as the cars that have rims.</li>
            <li> followed the instruction and didnt drive fast for a WHOLE DAY.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> very noticeable...</li>
            <li> Also take a look at CNN.com for a piece on the real creators of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought these by mistake and found out about the real ones after some researching.</li>
            <li> Please support this company as it is a fantastic idea and just starting up.</li>
            <li> The lashes were totally straight and pointed straight ahead.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these cheap knock-offs..they were made out of inner tubes...flimsy and lasted 2-3 days and marred the paint when I removed them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these, like another reviewer said, there is a website for the real thing and these are not it.</li>
            <li> very upset -</li>
            <li> I would really like to know if something can be done.</li>
            <li> However, I travel on the freeway about three times a week and the wind really took a toll on them.</li>
            <li> However, if you have any intent on driving a high speeds AVOID!</li>
            <li> A 40cent novelty is now going to be costing a WHOLE lot</li>
            <li> I recently purchased carlashes for my 74 buick, I really enjoy them and so does everyone else.</li>
            <li> Much flimsier than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than alternatives sold at gift stores</li>
            <li> If you wiggle them too much when drying your car, they will pop off.</li>
            <li> I used these to make bottom lases to really give it the look of real eyes.</li>
            <li> (this is unusual for California)  </li>
            <li> These things are made for headlights that are straight with no curve at all.</li>
            <li> cuter then any of the others when it goes out for deliveries, and really, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> The only reason i bought another pair is because they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li> Never seen kids laughing so much at a vehical, lived it.</li>
            <li> they broke off very soon and would not stay up like they need to be.  </li>
            <li> They were meant to create a smile and all I have so far is stress and anxiety waiting on them.  </li>
            <li> After waitin all that time, waiting for the lashes, When I got them they will not stick... Was very disapointed..</li>
            <li> Added just the right amount of spizaz to my cute little car.</li>
            <li> They are very cute but did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> super cute but some juvenile ripped them off my car when i was in a store.</li>
            <li> But, they can scratch and damage your car if driving too fast in high winds.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the wind blows them against the top of my hood and is leaving black rubber marks on it.  </li>
            <li> I waited a really long time to receive these and was so excited to put them on my car.</li>
            <li> Highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to every to everyone.</li>
            <li> it took me a little more than an hr to curl one lash and when i tried to stick it on the headlight, the dang thing refused to stick even thought i cleaned it off an everything.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO seller on Amazon is selling genuine Carlashes.     </li>
            <li> and they were cool for the first day, then the next day some of the eyelashes didn&#x27;t spring back up</li>
            <li> Looked more like missing teeth, so I took them off.</li>
            <li> Yeah they look cute but beware they will destroy your paint</li>
            <li> Not sure she ever used it, but well worth the smile factor when she opened it up!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something on my new car.</li>
            <li> I live in Los Angeles therefor I drive freeways a lot.</li>
            <li> I live in California and my car is in the sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying them for my new car as well.</li>
            <li> they were cute but they snapped like raw noodles in the wind</li>
            <li> these this is not the real car lashes, because the real ones are made from different material that do not scratch the hood of your car!</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last if you drive at higher speeds</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re all the same exact size.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve survived the winter season so far!</li>
            <li> The instructions were in Japanese and the lashes blew off the car the first time we drove it.  </li>
            <li> I seen the first 1 &amp; said what the hell &amp; when I seen the 2nd one</li>
            <li> Even after following the instructions exact to curl the lashes they didnt look like the ones pictured.</li>
            <li> they completely scratched the paint on my NEW car damaging the finish on the hood.</li>
            <li> It was easy curling them and applying them to my car but after a few days I noticed the paint on my car near them looked scratched.</li>
            <li> They fall off easily and it was a complete waste.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t plan on driving over 40mph go for it, but if you want to avoid damage to your cars paint job I recommend steering clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to buff it out and maybe put a clear removable contact strip where they hit.  </li>
            <li> This product is cheap and will destroy your paint job on your car...</li>
            <li> I will have to get it repaired by a professional and it will cost lots of $$$.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t last for much time at all.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t quite melt, but I had to re-curl them frequently.</li>
            <li> First I cleaned the headlights and let them dry.  </li>
            <li> Also, do not mess with the crystals if you put those on too.  </li>
            <li> Had to do so much modification to place on my wife&#x27;s car after the month long wait to get to our house.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the lashes as far as washing my car or general maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recomend these to anyone wishing for a special little touch to a small car sporty or an old van  just for fun.</li>
            <li> Then when I got to my father&#x27;s house I noticed that the eyelashes had been beating against the car and not only had scratch the car but had taken off the clear coat!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was due to the hear here in Phenix during the summer</li>
            <li> I had a nearly brand new car, drove with these for a day, and then got home and noticed that they blew back and made thousands of tiny scratches.</li>
            <li> Product was good, but it arrived too late to be of any use to me!!!  </li>
            <li> Wish they had worked out, but just not worth the trouble to buy more.</li>
            <li> I should have spent the $26 and got the real thing.</li>
            <li> (it was barely on anyway) and threw it away.  </li>
            <li> The process for taking these suckers off isn&#x27;t as easy as the removal instructions say, especially when they&#x27;ve been baked onto the car for a year.  </li>
            <li> The next day, it was so hot, they just drooped down onto the headlights.  </li>
            <li> With the first trip to town they left black marks all over the hood where the eyelashes hit the hood.</li>
            <li> First time I drove the car with the eyelashes applied, they left black marks all over the paint.  </li>
            <li> everyone and I mean everyone had to say something about them, which was cool.</li>
            <li> I have a white toyota corolla and these left huge black smudges and tiny little scratches all over my hood...</li>
            <li> how, I see you have to clean the headlight ,dry thoroughly &amp; leave the lashes for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> They are flat and covered in Chinese characters.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that they come flat</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get my lashes for my 2001 Toyota SUV and these lashes melted onto my car and ruined it so the lashes are really costing me a paint job.</li>
            <li> only concern was it took a long time to ship</li>
            <li> where it clicked that when I drove the wind would smack them down and the lashes were sharp enough that they scratched my hood; needless to say I ripped them off right away; They were cute while they lasted :/</li>
            <li> To bad because they look so cute!</li>
            <li> As stated by other users, these \\&quot;knock offs\\&quot; are cheap, flimsy, and made with paper thin plastic which do not look at all like the picture.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d only buy this product if you are planning to stay off of the highway and rough weather.</li>
            <li> I used my car lashes as long as I could.</li>
            <li> they bent down and stuck to my headlight, and from driving the wind would push them back and they scratched up the hood of my car where they would push back.</li>
            <li> I have a white vehicle, and the car lashes broke off and left black residue on the hood of my car.</li>
            <li> While driving these eyelashes whipped back onto my hood and left permenante black marks on my 2011 car.</li>
            <li> The 3M tape that comes with the lashes have foam in the center of the double sided sticky tape and it does dry out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> so some of my lashes are actually longer than the other on both lashes...</li>
            <li> Silly but fun!</li>
            <li> I even cleaned the area I applied them with alcohol before and let it completely dry.</li>
            <li> The down fall that they have is as you travel down the road they slap against your car and start to tear up the clear coat and will eventually ruin the pain on your car.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO disappointed because I really liked the way they looked.</li>
            <li> I put these onto my cars headlights and had to remove them less than a hour later.</li>
            <li> Now my car has black marks where the eyelashes were flying back and hitting the car, and they all broke off.  </li>
            <li> They made black marks on my car- from the tip of lashes blowing back on my hood!  </li>
            <li> would still leave  black markings on my  White car!  </li>
            <li> I figured the eyelashes would look a little different</li>
            <li> one was red and the other car was black.</li>
            <li> it gave my boring minivan a happy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blaming anyone for the damage done to the paint job, I did put them on at my own risk, but I&#x27;m really disappointed that they didn&#x27;t last past one week.</li>
            <li> These are a total waste of money unless you plan to never drive your car.  </li>
            <li> A few scratches were left, being my fault from not being all that careful with the razor blade, and my car faded around the eyelashes</li>
            <li> They are also pretty hard to curl and if you curl them too hard they start to scratch your car.</li>
            <li> but left little black spots where they hit the car hood.</li>
            <li> One blew off while driving and the other damaged my paint as it flapped on the hood.  </li>
            <li> On one car te eyelashes broke and in the other car it scratch my car paint.</li>
            <li> These things are so tacky and cheap and very difficult to install.</li>
            <li> but other than that...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money on these and find a local person who might have them or look for an actual store rather than a shoddy vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> They are imitation...</li>
            <li> I just spent an hour and a half removing the 3M tape, soaking it with paint thinner and scraping it off with a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> The directions clearly say that this is a tough tape and be careful because where you stick the lash is where it will go!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dont like is that they crack your paint by the headlights and the glue is so hard to remove.</li>
            <li> From driving and the wind blowing the hard plastic lashes, they bent back, hitting off the hood.</li>
            <li> Hard to make it look curly all the same............  </li>
            <li> Left dark spots on the hood of my car!!!</li>
            <li> Poorly made, kids bought as a gag gift, don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> They also make dark marks on the hood.</li>
            <li> and when I got there both sides were missing lashes, apparently, the speed and wind forced them off.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad set, but I wasn&#x27;t driving very fast and have been peeling black plastic off my red car since I put them on.  </li>
            <li> But one day in the Arizona sun and they were droopy and hanging down.  </li>
            <li> you know, kids who aren&#x27;t down with OPP</li>
            <li> them bend down and curl lashes -they</li>
            <li> a flew off the car going down the road.</li>
            <li> All the tips down to about half the lashes were blown off.</li>
            <li> When driving on the highway, thet all broke in half...</li>
            <li> If you receive a Chinese fake its rather obvious.</li>
            <li> This product lasted less than two days before the lashes seperated from the adhesive</li>
            <li> After 40 miles, they had ruined the paint on my hood, leaving scratches and black marks.</li>
            <li> The lashes flopped against the hood at highway speed and caused a black coating on the the paint.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased lashes that did not hold up at all.</li>
            <li> After placing them on just like the instructions said, I drove around for about 5 to 10 miles half of that was on the freeway.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of black car lashes with silver eyeliner for my 2011 MINI.  </li>
            <li> The lashes ended up smacking the hood of my Jeep &amp; stained it with black.  </li>
            <li> they were not at all what i expected, they were very weak against the wind and left black marks on my car due to this.</li>
            <li> These come off with a little rubbing</li>
            <li> I figured getting the word out would help them out a little.     </li>
            <li> I recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind a little damage to your car.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that my hubby won&#x27;t drive my van anymore!  </li>
            <li> Within a few days of installing this product on my car half of the eyelashes were missing.</li>
            <li> So it was a waste.</li>
            <li> waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> .. DOES NOT FIT CADILLAC CTS</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The lashes broke and fell off in just a few days and would not stay curled.  </li>
            <li> , i dont spend money to waste it!!1</li>
            <li> This is a waste it will ruin your hood</li>
            <li> They were also a little hard to install.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the only thing that went wrong...</li>
            <li> Only lasted about 13 weeks unfortunately.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe the comments I get when I go places and its usually from men laughing and saying their wives would want them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can place them in my FJ Cruiser, but will try.  </li>
            <li> After it rained they partially fell off and we&#x27;ve been unable to get the black sticky strip off of the car.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 days one had flown off and the other was broken into bits...</li>
            <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for:(</li>
            <li> and I had them on my car for all of 24 hours when half of them we broken off.</li>
            <li> I now have a dull spot on my hood from them rubbing on it.  </li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t get read of them, so we had to go to service, and even for specialists it was hard to fix it.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time installing the product you have to bend and shape these alot.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid to put them on and have the same thing happen all over again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Never buy them again, at least not from China.</li>
            <li> but it still arrived about 2 weeks too late.  </li>
            <li> i do wish the product included a device to curl the \\&quot;lashes\\&quot; or at least tell you how.  </li>
            <li> at least 3 lashes snapped off on one trip to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be disappointed when they last less than a week smh.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy about it at all...</li>
            <li> Very expensive outcome for such an inexpensive product...</li>
            <li> I live on an Army base and it seems as if everyone has a Dodge Charger.</li>
            <li> These are a fake crude version of real Carlashes.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> This product was not good at all.  </li>
            <li> ...as i began to ride..going 55 mph or even 60 mph..is not good at all.</li>
            <li> They also left very bad black marks on our beige vehicle.</li>
            <li> I install this item on my wife&#x27;s Infinity FX35, and after 10 minutes drive we were shocked that it left horrible black stains above the lights.</li>
            <li> did not last at all...very disappointed in them..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like I paid for the damage because that&#x27;s all that was left. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed overall.</li>
            <li> Alas, towards the need of their life they made my Kia look like it</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my Secret Santa, which everyone (the ladies) was jealous of them.</li>
            <li> Having installed the product, 4 of the lashes have broken off already after 2 days of driving with them on - as I said before..cheap rubbish.</li>
            <li> and I instantly think its some ditzy blond that would confuse the word retired with retarded.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I bought off of Amazon and they were worthless.</li>
            <li> I have a new Ford Mustang Convertible GT and they scratched my paint horribly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after about 3 months she started losing lashes</li>
            <li> and I recommend it blindly</li>
            <li> When properly installed they did stay in place, but the marks were terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s just a fake one.</li>
            <li> And unfortunately, the valid time passed ,I couldn&#x27;t make a clim.</li>
            <li> The worst part &amp; the reason I&#x27;m writing this is since the lashes were bending back for the distance of my drive</li>
            <li> curling them wasn&#x27;t difficult either, took two paintbrushes and used them since there was no instructions I went off the pictures.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they are no longer on the car.</li>
            <li> If I ever have children, unlikely as it is, and they come home with this s</li>
            <li> Eventually I had to peel the sticky strips off because all the \\&quot;lashes\\&quot; had broken off!</li>
            <li> them can not ruin my car for a silly look</li>
            <li> But I was sad today to hear that the EYELASHES fell off before Christmas!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they take an immediate toll on the car&#x27;s paint!</li>
            <li> untill we had a bad storm come.</li>
            <li> So awful, I got tired of wiping the marks off</li>
            <li> But after a week or so my husband realized as they flutter when driving it also messes up the paint on the car - :-(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but when i got them i became disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>
            <li> /&gt; :(</li>
            <li> Bought these with excitement, and disappointed after I put them on my car.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of bending mine at the base, to make them curl, and they snapped off at the base.  </li>
            <li> and I hate that these EYELASHES didn&#x27;t even last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply retarded.</li>
            <li> on their vehicles, I will proceed to beat them brutally.</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed in the quality of these lashes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry!!!</li>
            <li> This product was horrible.</li>
            <li> These are terrible quality!</li>
            <li> thats pathetic</li>

            <li> I put these onto my cars headlights and had to remove them less than a hour later. The lashes stayed on just fine, but they damaged my cars paint. I have a white vehicle, and the car lashes broke off and left black residue on the hood of my car. I&#x27;ve tried scrubbing with everything I could find and it still won&#x27;t come off. When you are driving the lashes click against the hood of the car and it is very noisy. All around junk. Don&#x27;t spend your money on this. A</li>
            <li> Great for a practical joke! (which is why I purchased) What is even funnier is the instructions on the cover!</li>
            <li> They stick on easily.  But, they can scratch and damage your car if driving too fast in high winds.  I took mine off and threw them away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how curl them so I had to find a semi made up way to curl them. I put them on and they did not flatter. I thought it would be cute but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I only had them on the car one week...When driving on the highway, thet all broke in half...did not last at all...very disappointed in them..would not recommend the ones I bought from Amazon...</li>
            <li> The lashes were great fun at first but they don&#x27;t last if you drive at higher speeds (ie: freeway).  I bought some for myself and some for my mother.  I made the mistake of bending mine at the base, to make them curl, and they snapped off at the base.  I didn&#x27;t bend my mothers thinking that would help.  Her tips snapped off.  They bend back against the car hood and make smudge marks.  These come off with a little rubbing so that was not a big problem.  They were a lot of fun while they lasted!</li>
            <li> Were very cute when I put them on. I did them exactly as according to directions. As soon as I got on the highway, they blew back and scratched my car. After 2 days, the adhesive wore off and I lost a lash. I even cleaned the area I applied them with alcohol before and let it completely dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Carlashes and the Crystal Liner as gifts for my nieces Birthday, and she loves both.  Absolutely a great Company to work with....</li>
            <li> Cute as a buttom when we first put them on the vehicle but they did&#x27;t hold on very well. Only lasted a week and fell off</li>
            <li> I live on an Army base and it seems as if everyone has a Dodge Charger. I bought these to make my car unique. It was so funny to see peoples reactions. 9 out of 10 loved it. The guards at the gate would always comment and its definitely a fun accessory for your car!!!!</li>
            <li> Only lasted about a week on my Kia and the lashes started falling off one by one.  At first I thought it was due to the hear here in Phenix during the summer but I bought my sister-in-law a set and the same thing is happeing to her in Michigan.  The lashes look even cuter on her PT Cruiser.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 sets all together but I&#x27;m afraid to put them on and have the same thing happen all over again.&lt;br /&gt;I di turn heads and get nice comments while the lashes looked good.  Alas, towards the need of their life they made my Kia look like it wad squenting.&lt;br /&gt;They were easy to install but you have to curl them yourself.</li>
            <li> These carlashes are so cute, I really love them. I get just as much attention as the cars that have rims. And whats even better is Im the only one in my city with them (for now anyway). The only thing that I dont like is that they crack your paint by the headlights and the glue is so hard to remove. Some companies say that the carlashes are only for like Halloween but I keep my on till they wear off, and mines usually last for about a month.  So all in all these lashes are the cutest thing out here for the ladies. P.s to the ladies now we have something cool for our cars, the men have hangin&#x27; nuts and we have carlashes...lol.</li>
            <li> Beware counterfeit Carlashes(tm) available on Ebay and Amazon. The sellers are not authorized and are selling cheep Chinese knock-offs using images and content stolen from the Carlashes(tm) website and press materials.</li>
            <li> I figured the eyelashes would look a little different but they&#x27;re all the same exact size.  That&#x27;s okay though because you can still make them look cute on your (or a friend&#x27;s) car.</li>
            <li> I have a new Ford Mustang Convertible GT and they scratched my paint horribly. Do not buy them. I should have spent the $26 and got the real thing.</li>
            <li> These lashes lasted exactly one trip on the road.  One blew off while driving and the other damaged my paint as it flapped on the hood.  Very expensive outcome for such an inexpensive product...I guess you really do get what you pay for:(</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the price, I thought, hey these sell for up to $25 so why not try it for 38 cents? At first I was really excited about them... easy to put on, easy to curl... everyone and I mean everyone had to say something about them, which was cool. They looked really good, until I decided to drive on the highway... I drove to my dad&#x27;s house two hours away and when I got there both sides were missing lashes, apparently, the speed and wind forced them off. That&#x27;s not the only thing that went wrong... I noticed they left marks in the paint on the hood, from the wind blowing them back and forth. That did not wash off. I&#x27;m not blaming anyone for the damage done to the paint job, I did put them on at my own risk, but I&#x27;m really disappointed that they didn&#x27;t last past one week. It&#x27;s almost like I paid for the damage because that&#x27;s all that was left. :(</li>
            <li> While the carlashes look very cute and are easy to apply, they scuff the surface of the hood which sits above the carlashes.  Had I known this was going to happen I would have never bought them.  They scratched my 2012 vehicle and now I have to pay to get it re-painted. Nice product if your car is going to be parked, once you drive it the lashes will scuff the paint.</li>
            <li> These plastic lashes lasted 3 days on my car. They started to break off on the first day, and my husband removed them right after because they were damaging the paint. But for $3 what do you expect. Next time I will order them from carlashes.com.</li>
            <li> The lashes blew back when driving- but left little black spots where they hit the car hood. These were the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> They are imitation...even the words on the packaging don&#x27;t make sense..eyelashes didn&#x27;t  work right and won&#x27;t stay on ...glad I didn&#x27;t spend anymore than I did!!!</li>
            <li> Product worked according to expectations. would probably not work very well at high speeds or in the hot sun, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were so pretty, i put them on my car followed the instruction and didnt drive fast for a WHOLE DAY. the next day i go to drive my car the eyelashes scratched the top of my hood from hitting them and they all chipped off. Every single lash on BOTH sets of lashes were chipped at the top. I am VERY disappointed in the quality of these lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom&#x27;s car. She absolutely loves them. People point and smile when she goes by. I&#x27;ve seen comparable products in magazines for over $30. I think my shipping cost more than the lashes themselves and they&#x27;re holding up great.</li>
            <li> These were SO cute - everyone loved them as I was driving by.  But after a week or so my husband realized as they flutter when driving it also messes up the paint on the car - :-(</li>
            <li> The lashes were beautiful and caught the eye of everyone as we drove around.  The first time we hit the highway, they started to peel away, but didn&#x27;t fall off.  After it rained they partially fell off and we&#x27;ve been unable to get the black sticky strip off of the car.  So, I&#x27;d only buy this product if you are planning to stay off of the highway and rough weather.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and will destroy your paint job on your car...that is if they last more than a week on your car. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I purchased a set for my vehicle and it dmaged my paint and after a week noticed that many of the lashes were already torn off. Before this happened I ordered two more sets for out of state X-mas gifts and by the time I had them send back to me I was out of the 30 day policy and they refused to return them. They suck and so does their cheap product. I WOULD NOT BUY ANY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife&#x27;s car and they looked great. Unfortunately after about 3 months she started losing lashes so they came back off. If your looking for a great temporary affect these are great. everyone noticed them and commented on how cute they were...</li>
            <li> I was SUPER excited the night I received my car lashes in the mail.  I put them on right away and curled them all up cute!!  But one day in the Arizona sun and they were droopy and hanging down.  One week and they crackled and fell off.  Maybe I will try again in the winter...they were cute!</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get these and then i got them and and they looked cute and everything and they didnt even last a week. they bent down and stuck to my headlight, and from driving the wind would push them back and they scratched up the hood of my car where they would push back.</li>
            <li> This product was not good at all.  Now my car has black marks where the eyelashes were flying back and hitting the car, and they all broke off.  DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved how it looked the first two days. I bought two pairs for two cars. On one car te eyelashes broke and in the other car it scratch my car paint. Took them off after a week.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of installing this product on my car half of the eyelashes were missing. While driving these eyelashes whipped back onto my hood and left permenante black marks on my 2011 car. Highly dissapointed. I was given the option of returning them, but at this point there is only 1 eyeleash on the passenger side and 2 on the driver side, not much left of them to return. I would save your money or splurg for the higher quality on this one.</li>
            <li> Easy to do...and looks great... Easy to curl...eye catching...very noticeable... Adds great detail to your car...I love them and everyone that sees them as well</li>
            <li> Loved them they looked fantastic on but in the New Zealand summer they dried out, became brittle &amp; snapped off easily. Only lasted about 13 weeks unfortunately.</li>
            <li> product is amazing and everyone in my town loves it! the only problem i found with it is that the sticky stuff that is provided on the lashes when you receive them is not sticky enough to stand through 65 mph of driving..or even 10. so i used double sided tape and it worked amazing! they&#x27;ve survived the winter season so far! and driving on the highway!</li>
            <li> Please everyone listen to me.   Absolutely NO seller on Amazon is selling genuine Carlashes.     As stated by other users, these \\&quot;knock offs\\&quot; are cheap, flimsy, and made with paper thin plastic which do not look at all like the picture. These are a fake crude version of real Carlashes. Do not waist your time. Buy from the actual website. Search Carlashes in Google and you will see Carlashes.com. Also take a look at CNN.com for a piece on the real creators of the product. If you receive a Chinese fake its rather obvious. They are flat and covered in Chinese characters. Pictures stolen from the actual website are on the package too. I bought these by mistake and found out about the real ones after some researching. They are infinitely better, not flat, and very durable. I LOVE my Carlashes. Please support this company as it is a fantastic idea and just starting up. I had a nice chat with the wife of the inventor. I figured getting the word out would help them out a little.     Thanks for reading,     Alison Parker &lt;3</li>
            <li> Senior Class and the goods arrived well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes and light weight is a new idea and everyone is impressed by them</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift.  They came with no instructions.  There were pictures showing to peel and stick - so that&#x27;s what I did.  First I cleaned the headlights and let them dry.  The lashes were totally straight and pointed straight ahead.  The pictures showed a gizmo to use to curl the lashes, but the gizmo was not in the package.  So I used a pair of scissors just like when curling gift wrap ribbon.  It didn&#x27;t work very well.  Anyway, the lashes were on the car.  The next time I drove the car, I drove about a mile to the grocery store and back.  When I got home, I real only one lash was still on the car.  So I peeled it off (it was barely on anyway) and threw it away.  Don&#x27;t count on these staying on your car.</li>
            <li> I put these carlashes on two different cars...one was red and the other car was black. They damaged the paint on both vehicles. Do Not Buy!!!</li>
            <li> Ecxelente is a product of very good quality and I recommend it blindly, I think I do not dislike anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these cheap knock-offs..they were made out of inner tubes...flimsy and lasted 2-3 days and marred the paint when I removed them.  My friend ordered Original Carlashes..they are they only ones that are best quality and the only ones authorized to use the name because it is trade-marked.  The ones I bought were $3,99..hers were $20.00 something..Which do you think are the best?  She&#x27;s had hers on for 6 mo.s and they look great.  I have an order in for Silver ones. Don&#x27;t be fooled by any I&#x27;ve seen here.</li>
            <li> The instructions were in Japanese and the lashes blew off the car the first time we drove it.  Don&#x27;t buy these, like another reviewer said, there is a website for the real thing and these are not it.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product for my wifes car they were great right out of the package, so she put them on the headlights and then curled them with a pair of scissors and they were cool for the first day, then the next day some of the eyelashes didn&#x27;t spring back up so we were allitle dissapionted</li>
            <li> These carlashes look super cute on your car but they lashes sort of fall off one at a time after a while. They are also pretty hard to curl and if you curl them too hard they start to scratch your car. I recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind a little damage to your car.</li>
            <li> I bought these recently but I am going to wait until there is no snow and ice to put them on my car. The application instructions could have been made clearer.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my Secret Santa, which everyone (the ladies) was jealous of them. But I was sad today to hear that the EYELASHES fell off before Christmas! She of course said that it was nice while they lasted. My question is, they weren&#x27;t even on her vehicle 2 weeks and they BROKE OFF.&lt;br /&gt;Can I get replacements?  This lady in the office is a sweet lady and I hate that these EYELASHES didn&#x27;t even last.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very upset - because they were truly a HIT at the gift exchange party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CyFairGuy01@gmail.com is my e-mail. I would really like to know if something can be done.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, a cute cheap way to make your car stand out. Easy to curl, they won&#x27;t bend under the weather.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed Everything arrived in perfect conditions I had  no issues at all  I absolutely love it I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible. They barely stay in place and when u accelerate ur car, they fly back and scratch your hood. They&#x27;re only cute when your car is parked or at a red light. Don&#x27;t buy these lashes!!!</li>
            <li> super cute but some juvenile ripped them off my car when i was in a store. they stayed on nicely during rain and highway driving speeds, but they can&#x27;t stand up to kids with no values of other peoples property. you know, kids who aren&#x27;t down with OPP</li>
            <li> These things are so tacky and cheap and very difficult to install. They fall off easily and it was a complete waste. Never buy them again, at least not from China.</li>
            <li> they are fine for awhile but not permanent great product by the way and worth every penny that is whats important</li>
            <li> Having installed the product, 4 of the lashes have broken off already after 2 days of driving with them on - as I said before..cheap rubbish.</li>
            <li> These are a total waste of money unless you plan to never drive your car.  They would be great for a car show where the car is not moving as long as it&#x27;s not hot &amp; sunny.  I put them on my car.  The next day, it was so hot, they just drooped down onto the headlights.  That evening, I re-curled them.  I drove my car to work the next day &amp; the wind made them tap against my hood.  I now have a dull spot on my hood from them rubbing on it.  I took them off immediately. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on them.</li>
            <li> My wife should have read the reviews first before buying. These Eyelashes did do as some people said they did to them. With the first trip to town they left black marks all over the hood where the eyelashes hit the hood. I had to use rubbing alcohol to scrub away the marks. When properly installed they did stay in place, but the marks were terrible. Buy at your own risk of black marks.</li>
            <li> Product was good, but it arrived too late to be of any use to me!!!  I even requested express shipment but it still arrived about 2 weeks too late.  Oh well, another yard sale item!</li>
            <li> I love the lashes!  They add such great personally to your car.  But BEWARE of cheap lashes!!  They made black marks on my car- from the tip of lashes blowing back on my hood!  No matter how I would  them bend down and curl lashes -they would still leave  black markings on my  White car!  So awful, I got tired of wiping the marks off so I just tore them off.  I will purchase a much better brand and give them another try!!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something on my new car. But eyelashes didnt fit on my car. Shrug. So it was a waste.</li>
            <li> I used my car lashes as long as I could. I loved them. However, I travel on the freeway about three times a week and the wind really took a toll on them. I ended up having to remove them. All the tips down to about half the lashes were blown off.</li>
            <li> This manufacturer uses the exact same photo as the original car lashes, which is what I thought I was buying.  Instructions improperly translated from Japanese.  These were plastic, easy to apply, and several lashes broke off within the first week of use. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> These are the dumbest things I have ever seen. Poorly made, kids bought as a gag gift, don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s just a fake one.And the seller promise to issue the refund while never done it. And unfortunately, the valid time passed ,I couldn&#x27;t make a clim. Do not believe or be cheated.</li>
            <li> Got the lashes for my daughter...she loves them! So easy to put on. She gets a lot of people asking about them. So glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it would be cute since I&#x27;m a makeup artist. It applied easily &amp; I got the laughs I had hoped for. Even made a couple kids happy relating it to the movie &#x27;Cars&#x27;. However, if you have any intent on driving a high speeds AVOID! I live in Los Angeles therefor I drive freeways a lot. Because of the speed &amp; the wind flow several of the lashes bent back &amp; snapped off. The worst part &amp; the reason I&#x27;m writing this is since the lashes were bending back for the distance of my drive they completely scratched the paint on my NEW car damaging the finish on the hood. I now have to take it to see if it&#x27;s possible to buff it out or if it will have to be repainted. A 40cent novelty is now going to be costing a WHOLE lot more.&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t plan on driving over 40mph go for it, but if you want to avoid damage to your cars paint job I recommend steering clear.</li>
            <li> They only lasted a day or two. They started breaking off once I got on the freeway. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I waited a really long time to receive these and was so excited to put them on my car. Installed, looked great, firmly attached, sat overnight on the car. There were no instructions with them so I followed instructions on youtube. First ride, at 45 mph they flew off. Wish they had worked out, but just not worth the trouble to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have a red 2008 300 chrysler.. I get a lot of compliments &amp; people asking where did I buy them, instead of saying amazon I should have told Them from the beat the hell out of my paint site lol.. that&#x27;s exactly what the lashes did to the top of my hood &amp; not to mention, the wind plucked some of my lashes out lmao.. i was driving on the interstate &amp; seen 2 fly back over my car. I seen the first 1 &amp; said what the hell &amp; when I seen the 2nd one lol I knew then my lashes was being plucked out by the wind.. buy at your own risk</li>
            <li> I love my new eyelashes it gave my boring minivan a happy look. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the comments I get when I go places and its usually from men laughing and saying their wives would want them. The only negative is that my hubby won&#x27;t drive my van anymore!  Oh well its worth it ;-)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased carlashes for my 74 buick, I really enjoy them and so does everyone else.I reccommend them to all...</li>
            <li> Just received my car lashes for my car! It is a good price for such a great accessory !&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would had liked to receive with the package is instructions how to put them on. Since i had to google how, I see you have to clean the headlight ,dry thoroughly &amp; leave the lashes for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Much flimsier than I thought they would be. You have to curl them with a pencil. I am going to buy the more expensive ones from carlashes.com to compare.</li>
            <li> I loved how they looked on my car, at first i thought they wouldn&#x27;t stick but they did. The only downside is that they come flat and you have to curl them a little yourself, but once they are on your car, the wind will make sure your car lashes are perky!</li>
            <li> I loved this product as soon as I seen it, I thought it was the cutest thing ever. It was easy curling them and applying them to my car but after a few days I noticed the paint on my car near them looked scratched. At first I didn&#x27;t put two and two together and then out of no where it clicked that when I drove the wind would smack them down and the lashes were sharp enough that they scratched my hood; needless to say I ripped them off right away; They were cute while they lasted :/</li>
            <li> Everyone raved about my lashes.  Saw them at an auto store for twice the cost.  Used it as a Halloween Costume for my truck.</li>
            <li> they worked great and look cute on my car, also easy to assemble. curling them wasn&#x27;t difficult either, took two paintbrushes and used them since there was no instructions I went off the pictures.</li>
            <li> Loved the eyelashes, thought they were cute as all get out.  They curled great, easy to apply.  First time I drove the car with the eyelashes applied, they left black marks all over the paint.  Maybe I just got a bad set, but I wasn&#x27;t driving very fast and have been peeling black plastic off my red car since I put them on.  Needless to say, they are no longer on the car.</li>
            <li> I install this item on my wife&#x27;s Infinity FX35, and after 10 minutes drive we were shocked that it left horrible black stains above the lights. We couldn&#x27;t get read of them, so we had to go to service, and even for specialists it was hard to fix it.</li>
            <li> The price was fine, but I wish there would have been a warning about the temperature durability.&lt;br /&gt;I gave to a friend for Christmas, and on her first time on the highway they chipped off.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my car and they look awesome!!! I can find my car at walmart because it stands out now.</li>
            <li> This was just a funny gift I bought a friend! Not sure she ever used it, but well worth the smile factor when she opened it up! Inexpensive enough.</li>
            <li> They did not last the commutes to work and make noise when driving on the freeway. After about two weeks I took them off.</li>
            <li> I have yet to put them on as it&#x27;s winter here, but they look adorable&lt;br /&gt;My only concern was it took a long time to ship</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get my lashes for my 2001 Toyota SUV and these lashes melted onto my car and ruined it so the lashes are really costing me a paint job.</li>
            <li> I received this product pretty timely considering it was coming from hong kong.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  i haven&#x27;t put on my car yet because i haven&#x27;t figured out how to curl the lashes.  i do wish the product included a device to curl the \\&quot;lashes\\&quot; or at least tell you how.  but other than that...great novelty piece!</li>
            <li> I bought a 1961 Ford Econoline van, it had a worn off peace sign. My Husband painted couple flowers on it.But the van needed some thing to to add pazzza After the lashes were attached, I painted &amp;#34;Bbutterfly Kisses&amp;#34; around them. Thats what it needed.I recomend these to anyone wishing for a special little touch to a small car sporty or an old van  just for fun.</li>
            <li> Left dark spots on the hood of my car!!! When they fly back while driving, they wear down the lacquer on the hood of your car and leave spots that you CANNOT remove! I will have to get it repaired by a professional and it will cost lots of $$$. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Also, the tape that is used to stick them to your headlights DOES NOT COME OFF even when you remove the lashes altogether.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this but when i got them i became disappointed. it took me a little more than an hr to curl one lash and when i tried to stick it on the headlight, the dang thing refused to stick even thought i cleaned it off an everything. the tape thats stuck to these is weak....way to week. Investment in the double sided sticky tape, if you have the patience to curl them. i tossed mine in the trash. waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> There soo cute!! Added just the right amount of spizaz to my cute little car. Although they do scratch the paint off the car like another person had said. And the instructions are in chinese. But it was still pretty easy to figure out how to curl the lashes. Despite all that there super cute and I love them!</li>
            <li> The lashes were alot stiffer and not as easy to apply to the car as  thought it would be. Also had to curl the lashes. Overall effect with the car very happy.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner. I was excited to get them and my husband put&#x27;em on my dodge truck...as i began to ride..going 55 mph or even 60 mph..is not good at all. they are flimsy and once you are in the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; with this certain speed they flap up against your hood and you can actually hear it. so by it hitting against your hood the tip of the lashes break off. so some of my lashes are actually longer than the other on both lashes...because the tip of the lashes broke off in the wind. I would not recommend this product. Sorry to the seller but maybe invest in more durable product..I will not by this type of item again. thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy</li>
            <li> they were not at all what i expected, they were very weak against the wind and left black marks on my car due to this. i had to take my car to dealership to have them remove(luckly) the marks. they advised me not to put them back on.</li>
            <li> This product lasted less than two days before the lashes seperated from the adhesive a flew off the car going down the road.</li>
            <li> Looked cute.  Stayed on.  Bent back and slapping the hood of the car in the wind.  Scratched and damaged the paint.</li>
            <li> Simply retarded. I see someone driving around with these and I instantly think its some ditzy blond that would confuse the word retired with retarded. If I ever have children, unlikely as it is, and they come home with this s*** on their vehicles, I will proceed to beat them brutally. If you have respect for yourself and your vehicle do not buy this.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PRETTY MUCH ONLY MADE OF PAPER AND I THINK IT WAS MISREPRESENTED AND WONT EVEN LAST ONE DRIVE ON THE FRONT OF MY CONVERTIBLE.  BUT IT SURE WOULD HAVE LOOKED CUTE.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all!! adhesive did not stick to my car.. DOES NOT FIT CADILLAC CTS AT ALLL!!! Glad it was a cheap product !</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t last for much time at all. They also make dark marks on the hood. I was disappointed overall.</li>
            <li> My mom told me about the car lashes and I decided to try them,  they were cute but the lashes lost their curl.  They were cute while they lasted though</li>
            <li> Seriously. DON&#x27;t BUY THESE. I had a nearly brand new car, drove with these for a day, and then got home and noticed that they blew back and made thousands of tiny scratches. I have never been this upset with a product. What were they thinking??</li>
            <li> Even after following the instructions exact to curl the lashes they didnt look like the ones pictured. They were also a little hard to install. However, the idea is great.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I bought off of Amazon and they were worthless. I only seemed to be able to find great carlashes from a local vendor. The ones I kept getting online are cheap, flimsy, floppy, and look nothing like the photo. Don&#x27;t waste the money on these and find a local person who might have them or look for an actual store rather than a shoddy vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you attempt to use these they will likely be so beat up (before you even drive with them) that you won&#x27;t be able to return them. All I did was attempt to shape them like the directions said and to attach them to the car and they were falling apart before I even hit the road.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gag gift... it works just fine, but nothing amazing. much cheaper than alternatives sold at gift stores so i guess its fine. it attaches using double sided tape and requires you curl it yourself.</li>
            <li> If I could leave a 0 i would! These are terrible quality! I have a white toyota corolla and these left huge black smudges and tiny little scratches all over my hood... at least 3 lashes snapped off on one trip to the grocery store. Messed up my car, and didn&#x27;t last... I should have known with the price!!! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> From driving and the wind blowing the hard plastic lashes, they bent back, hitting off the hood. After 40 miles, they had ruined the paint on my hood, leaving scratches and black marks. I have to get the marks buffed out at a body shop now! JUNK!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my car (&#x27;06 Chevy Cobalt) and they fit okay. Everything was great until started driving. Not only did they scratch and leave marks on my paint, they broke after a couple of days! They looked great when my car wasn&#x27;t in motion, then the ones that were left began to \\&quot;wilt\\&quot;. They didn&#x27;t quite melt, but I had to re-curl them frequently. Eventually I had to peel the sticky strips off because all the \\&quot;lashes\\&quot; had broken off! I&#x27;m SO disappointed because I really liked the way they looked.</li>
            <li> they were cute but they snapped like raw noodles in the wind and I don&#x27;t even  drive over 55mph they broke the first day on my way to work</li>
            <li> put it on and once I got on the highway, they flew off. it was a waste of money. no</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my wife&#x27;s sister. she actually asked for them specifically. They look and stayed on GREAT!  hope you enjoy them as much as she does</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s car, she loves them, they help her find her car in the parking lots and start a lot of conversations, they installed easily and came as described.</li>
            <li> Hard to make it look curly all the same............  It don&#x27;t see at all like the picture on here dont buy it</li>
            <li> We got this for my sister as a gag gift for Christmas. Hilarious! Couldn&#x27;t stop laughing at it installed on their mini van</li>
            <li> They looked great on day one.  They were easy to install.  But...they didn&#x27;t hold up...The lashes broke and fell off in just a few days and would not stay curled.  Disappointed...</li>
            <li> so i had them on for one day and they fell of on the highway!! thats pathetic, i dont spend money to waste it!!1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two sets of Carlashes on my bug with crystal eyeliner and I have to say I love them.  They look super cute, make people smile, and attract a lot of attention.  I live in California and my car is in the sun 24/7.  The 3M tape that comes with the lashes have foam in the center of the double sided sticky tape and it does dry out in the sun.  This causes the tape to separate in the middle when driving on the freeway leading to dangling eyelashes.  The process for taking these suckers off isn&#x27;t as easy as the removal instructions say, especially when they&#x27;ve been baked onto the car for a year.  I just spent an hour and a half removing the 3M tape, soaking it with paint thinner and scraping it off with a razor blade.  A few scratches were left, being my fault from not being all that careful with the razor blade, and my car faded around the eyelashes so you can see where the tape was.  Also, do not mess with the crystals if you put those on too.  If you wiggle them too much when drying your car, they will pop off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely TERRIBLE performance. They did not last ONE day! They shriveled up in the sun and were torn to pieces on the freeway. They should say \\&quot;for parking displays only\\&quot; and \\&quot;not intended to for use while driving\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt; :( I was VERY disappointed they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the seller &amp; Amazon re: their refund policies.</li>
            <li> First off they do not have any instructions with them.  they just have a couple of pictures on the front of the package.  I watched a video on YouTube to make sure I applied them correctly.  Within 2 days one had flown off and the other was broken into bits... I was not very happy about it at all...</li>
            <li> These lashes turn a lot of heads. It&#x27;s fun to see everyone&#x27;s reaction to a car with eyelashes. I&#x27;m buying them for my new car as well. Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> Scrached my car and fell off after the first ride! The worst experience!!!!!!! I do not recommend to buy this product</li>
            <li> I used these to make bottom lases to really give it the look of real eyes. Worked out good with all I did people just couldn&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
            <li> I thought they was cute and so did my daughter, but she has not used them yet , maybe some day she will.</li>
            <li> My teenage niece wanted these eyelashes for her car.  She loves them.  If she rated this review, I&#x27;m sure it would get another star or two!</li>
            <li> Bought these with excitement, and disappointed after I put them on my car. They were cute when I applied them but didn&#x27;t last. During hot days they lost the curl I gave them. Had to curl the lashes with a butter knife lol. After a week of hot nd rain they became brittle plastic nd lashes broke off leaving me to remove them nd the adhesive from my car lights.</li>
            <li> I put these on my car and it was so easy to apply. They looked great...until the temperature hit 110 degrees. (this is unusual for California)  My eyelashes melted and drooped over my headlights. After many trips in the car, they bent upward by the wind and eventually broke off. Looked more like missing teeth, so I took them off. I will wait till this heat is over and try again, because they are cute. Buyer shipped them quickly. I was happy with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li> The lashes flopped against the hood at highway speed and caused a black coating on the the paint.&lt;br /&gt;Also one lash broke off.</li>
            <li> Had to do so much modification to place on my wife&#x27;s car after the month long wait to get to our house. These things are made for headlights that are straight with no curve at all. My wife&#x27;s car is a Mini so everything on the car is curved. After I placed them on the cheap tape that was supposed to hold them on did not do its job at all. Things would fall during in any drive. Avoid at all cost and get something else with your money!</li>
            <li> These lashes lasted just over two weeks untill we had a bad storm come. After tho i just got some double sided strong tape and reused them again. Thankyou.&lt;br /&gt;Also they flapped around alot driving on the highway and it was fun. I got a lot of comploments</li>
            <li> This product was good at first.  The one lash would not stay on and both of them broke lashes off after being on the car only a couple weeks. They also left very bad black marks on our beige vehicle. To bad because they look so cute!</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Highly recommended to every to everyone. Especially those with family that don&#x27;t like them.  Guaranteed to stop teenagers using your car.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the quality and the specific instruction that were included down to the alcohol wipe. I had previously purchased lashes that did not hold up at all. These lashes are much more sturdy and withstand higher speeds without moving and I really love them. I will recommend them to my friends that wish to  purchase lashes for their cars.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes and will well with my car. I haven&#x27;t put them on yet, but they have easy instructions.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my work van says now. I&#x27;ve made our company van cuter then any of the others when it goes out for deliveries, and really, that&#x27;s all that matters. Until someone doesn&#x27;t agree and takes a baseball bat to my headlights. But I&#x27;ll worry about that then. Simple to apply, simple to remove.</li>
            <li> So I bought some car lashes last month and I&#x27;m already on my second pair! The only reason i bought another pair is because they&#x27;re cheap and I get alot of attention because they&#x27;re so cute!! However, as soon as I go 50 mph they peel off one by one. so after this pair I may save up to get the chrome ones! But don&#x27;t be disappointed when they last less than a week smh.</li>
            <li> Just arrived a week ago, still trying to convince my girlfriend to let stick these on her car. She told me to wait until after she washed her car to put them on. That was 3 days ago.</li>
            <li> Lashes are too cute for words. Unfortunately, they take an immediate toll on the car&#x27;s paint! The lashes flap back and scratch the paint. They are great if you are going to stay parked!</li>
            <li> I get all kinds of compliments on these lashes on my car. I will continue to buy this product when I need them</li>
            <li> When I bought my car lashes I was excited because I got them at a very good price. After placing them on just like the instructions said, I drove around for about 5 to 10 miles half of that was on the freeway. Then when I got to my father&#x27;s house I noticed that the eyelashes had been beating against the car and not only had scratch the car but had taken off the clear coat! So if you&#x27;re reading this do not buy these this is not the real car lashes, because the real ones are made from different material that do not scratch the hood of your car!</li>
            <li> THIS IS FOR MY DAUGHTERS FIRST CAR .. I THINK SHE WILL LOVE THIS BECAUSE SHE IS IN COSMETOLOGY ...</li>
            <li> We put these adorable car lashes on our truck for Halloween an everyone lived them. Never seen kids laughing so much at a vehical, lived it.</li>
            <li> I luv this item. But they ruin yr paint on yr car.  I only had them on for 2 days and took them off to save my paint job.  Maybe they should be shorter.</li>
            <li> i love this product. i always get complemented and they look so cute. i drove from 40 mph to 80mph and they still stayed on. very satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought these for my golf cart. I think they will dress it up . I have not seen them on a golf cart yet.  I am not going to put them on till it warms up some.</li>
            <li> I like the looks of these on my Dodge Neon.  They are very cute but did not last very long.  they broke off very soon and would not stay up like they need to be.  if I could find some that are more durable I would get them but I will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> This is a waste it will ruin your hood the lashes keep scratching my car I removed them can not ruin my car for a silly look</li>
            <li> They were really cute, I curled them myself as they were straight when I received them.  Once applied to the headlights, I received alot of compliments. They looked really cute.  The down fall that they have is as you travel down the road they slap against your car and start to tear up the clear coat and will eventually ruin the pain on your car.  If you apply them make sure that when puched backwards that they will not hit a painted surface.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can place them in my FJ Cruiser, but will try.  If I cannot, I will give them away as a gift.  They are pretty.</li>
            <li> Yeah they look cute but beware they will destroy your paint and I had them on my car for all of 24 hours when half of them we broken off.</li>
            <li> I love it and it looks cute on my car.  The problem is that the wind blows them against the top of my hood and is leaving black rubber marks on it.  I&#x27;m going to try to buff it out and maybe put a clear removable contact strip where they hit.  Otherwise I love it...</li>
            <li> I bought a set of black car lashes with silver eyeliner for my 2011 MINI.  I have received so many compliments, smiles, etc from EVERYONE-and all walks of life.  Have I tried to take them off?  NO. The directions clearly say that this is a tough tape and be careful because where you stick the lash is where it will go! (and really, isn&#x27;t it better that if we are driving around town, we don&#x27;t want the lashes falling off.  Personally I am happy the tape is so strong and durable).  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the lashes as far as washing my car or general maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an all around great product with looks, durability, and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make people smile, put some lashes on your car.</li>
            <li> Silly but fun! They look great on my van. I am surprised how many people didn&#x27;t know these are available.</li>
            <li> It has been weeks and I have no idea if these are in customs in the Hong Kong harbor or if they were confiscated in Los Angeles???  I hope they show up soon as they were a token gift for a friend.  They were meant to create a smile and all I have so far is stress and anxiety waiting on them.  But they were ridiculously cheap, which is the only reason I am not mad.</li>
            <li> The lashes ended up smacking the hood of my Jeep &amp; stained it with black.  I had to use a Magic Eraser from Mr. Clean to get it off.</li>
            <li> The lashes were okay.  I had a hard time installing the product you have to bend and shape these alot.  After driving a week the lashes were tearing off of the plastic.</li>
            <li> After waitin all that time, waiting for the lashes, When I got them they will not stick... Was very disapointed.. Sorry!!!</li>
            <li> The lashes started shedding 1at a time until after a month we had to removed the &amp;#34;remains&amp;#34; of what was left</li>
