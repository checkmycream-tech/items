            <li>I have also begun using it on my arms and shoulders and it works just great.</li>
            <li>Smell great</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this, but my husband said this is a really great after shave and face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great.  </li>
            <li>It soothes after shaving and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not so great as a face lotion.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, great price.</li>
            <li>I can not handle most scents and this one absolutely is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great price on a good product.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is non-greasy and fragrance free which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this lotion is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Works well, I used to use Neutrogena, but this one seemed like a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Good:</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good in my view of the world.</li>
            <li>The price in my opinion is fair.</li>
            <li>Good Deal.</li>
            <li>It is good they have come up with a good product for men.</li>
            <li>Feels good on your face also.</li>
            <li>I trusted Lubriderm and they sold me a product that is full of Mineral Oil !!!</li>
            <li>Great smell too, not overpowering but very clean and bright what you can smell.  </li>
            <li>Gets in to the skin quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy after feel!!!</li>
            <li>LOL - but it is smooth and creamy</li>
            <li>Yes the product has a nice consistency but it shouldn&#x27;t be sold as a face cream or after shave product</li>
            <li>Also good on the hands, but I am mostly using this just for my face after showers/shaves.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a nice change.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of moisturizing the skin - not as great as the thicker creams but its a trade-off for the completely non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good, I&#x27;ll be buying this again when it runs out in about 20 years.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to buy a product without a scent.</li>
            <li>I find this lotion very useful and good for the price.</li>
            <li>Having extremely sensitive skin ans have tried many lotions this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as advertised, great product.</li>
            <li>With the Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion, it would dissolve a bit too rapidly into the skin and you would have to apply a bit more to cover your body, but Lubriderm&#x27;s formula seems to have this issue covered.    </li>
            <li>Most men will prefer the fragrance-free choice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like so many of these products.</li>
            <li>More of a lotion than a after-shave.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is free from fragrance, which is nice at times.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed it gives my skin more of a reddish tint for some reason.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Will buy more of this.  </li>
            <li>and he hasn&#x27;t been able to use any after shave until now.  </li>
            <li>Twice ( some guys take longer to figure things out :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are those who say that mineral oil applied to the skin is perfectly safe as the grade used in cosmetics and skin care products is distilled and refined.</li>
            <li>for sure would not want it on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Switched to Proraso Pre/Post Shave cream, much better for post shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product from a really well known company.</li>
            <li>, the scents were more feminine than I prefer.</li>
            <li>- okay, when I put it on.</li>
            <li>This has many things that her &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; face lotions has.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It would be much better if it were unscented.  </li>
            <li>It works a lot better as an every-day face lotion &amp; after shave.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any more issues.  </li>
            <li>It costs a lot more</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>There are so many lotions out there catering to women</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you that want a better skin treatment experience try Nivea.</li>
            <li>Make sure to distribute it evenly between your palms before applying.</li>
            <li>I sure there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and nicely like</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy, but it leaves kind of an oily feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly different than a liquid but in a very good way.  </li>
            <li>for after shave only balms/lotions, this gives you incredible value for the dollar.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing after a good shave too.</li>
            <li>If you love the stuff that&#x27;s fine we not trying to discourage you from drinking or rubbing with it if you so desire as we are a free society.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your face is clean before applying.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand strong perfumes</li>
            <li>Okay, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>This lotion is smooth and easy to apply, it feels like whipped body butter almost, and it is odorless</li>
            <li>Works fine as a body lotion, though.</li>
            <li>Shipped overseas, which was a huge plus.</li>
            <li>She never seems to like a lotion that I buy, so I decided to go with a fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li>No burning sensation for me although there is a light amount of alcohol &amp; citric acid in the lotion that may be causing this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and disappears.</li>
            <li>I like that its fragrance free and aloe enriched.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job, is not oily and does not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have to do fragrance free, 100%, or my eyes can&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li>Really like that it can be applied to the face, body and be used after shaving - sooths the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>so if you want something fragrance free, this should do the job.</li>
            <li>should note I use the Fragnance Free and have not tried the Light Fragnance.</li>
            <li>I use it afer the shower and after shaving primarily.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily at all and the fragrance free version is literally fragrance free -</li>
            <li>Im the type of guy that likes fragrence free lotion because it doesnt smell.</li>
            <li>it is fragrance free though, so that is a bonus</li>
            <li>It works well and is fragrence free.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s all that is important..</li>
            <li>This is one terrific product and a really great deal.  </li>
            <li>Ok, first I am the wife of the man who uses this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit on the lighter side, but still great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>, the lotion itself does appear to be fragrance free, is non-greasy, and dries quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I never felt I was receiving a special skin treatment.</li>
            <li>However, it is a very nice body and hand lotion, and I plan to use it in the winter when I routinely get dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Winters here get dry, and this product has been an excellent addition to my regime and has completely eliminated dryness in any post-shave or face wash routine.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and fresh after a shave.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention that it quickly absorbs into your skin moisturizing it, all without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li>It does have some sort of mild scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has no odor.  </li>
            <li>The best lotion I have personally used, no womanly after smell either.</li>
            <li>Here comes Lubriderm which is very inexpensive for a big 16 ounce pump bottle and is  a multi-purposed face and body lotion that feels great and works well.  </li>
            <li>I use it on every part of my body that has skin ( EVERY PART, hint hint), and no stinging, burning or anything else one might experience from another product that ventures \\&quot;down the happy trail\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Lubriderm for giving no-fuss guys like myself an easy way to take care of their hide.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great; it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and works really well with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised - non-greasy, light and quick absorbing.</li>
            <li>so you apply your own  cologne after without overshadowing any previous scent, i love it .</li>
            <li>This lotion has yet to sting my eyes, and I also put it on after shaving and it leaves my skin very soft and not irritated like most lotions tend to do to my face after a fresh shave.  </li>
            <li>I do not like lotions that have any smell, this one is really scent free.</li>
            <li>This product is light and goes on fast.</li>
            <li>It seems many companies out there finally understand that there is in fact a market for men, hence why these products are now readily available.    </li>
            <li>Showering &amp; shaving open up pores and allows precious water to escape, but a light moisturizer can fix everything.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions that are made specifically for sensitive skin and none of them suited me well.</li>
            <li>In my experience this is something rare.</li>
            <li>After applying this lotion to my freshly shaven face it BURNS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, I played with it for a moment, and discovered an additional fun fact:  </li>
            <li>I have used Lubriderm products in the past, always with great success</li>
            <li>not too watery unlike some other brand and absorbs easily and not greasy good for sensitive skin and post-shaving.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I can confidently say that all 50,000 of us had noticeably softer skin and, in general, a sunnier disposition</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer and decent priced for general use (re: not post shave).</li>
            <li>There are better face lotions out there, but you may need to spend a little more.</li>
            <li>It only provides medium to light moisturizing, but it is truly scent free.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly without too much oily feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I am currently in my one free trial month of Amazon Prime, so I used the free two day shipping for this item.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I am currently in my one free trial month of Amazon Prime, so I used the free two day shipping for this item.  </li>
            <li>A little early to give it a full 5 stars, but it seems to be very nice as an aftershave.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to try this product, as I have been looking for a daily use, fragrance free moisturizer targeted at men for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Simply put: I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But frankly, the price with the shipping rate is still higher than that in Walgreen.</li>
            <li>Skin care for most men is a basic bar of soap or body wash.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free was a plus for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It cools my face in this hot Arizona heat.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does, it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>who is to say that the next time around would see better packaging).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, definitely different than aftershave that burns, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my husband smell girly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this lotion is completely fragrance free.</li>
            <li>my fair skin hubby has very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>this one is pretty much up to par.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husband because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>No fragrance, and it absorbs quickly and completely, without residue..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many of these sorts of products before, and it has always been my assumption that the amount of product dispensed when the lever is fully depressed is the amount designed for a single use.</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers mention they like the light scent, but there really isn&#x27;t one just a light chemical smell that due more to the makeup of the lotion.  </li>
            <li>This really depends on how much lotion a person uses a day and how much money they would like to spend.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li>Lots of lotions say non-greasy but this one really is.  </li>
            <li>I really think this can be an all purpose lotion for anyone looking for no smells and no grease.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like hand cream, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>A fragrance free lotion that actually does not smell like anything!</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it&#x27;s versatality..lotion, after shave, sun-screen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, upon opening the envelope (which I did on my ironing board, much to my dismay), I was treated to a generous amount of lotion all over the inside of the package, all over my hands, and all over my ironing</li>
            <li>but I really like this.  </li>
            <li>This works really well use it after washing you&#x27;re face/ shaving, etc...</li>
            <li>I have used the whole bottle of this</li>
            <li>prefer using Vaseline for men fast absorbing 24-hour moisture.</li>
            <li>Within 15 seconds you &#x27;feel&#x27; your skin absorbing the lotion treatment.</li>
            <li>I didnt want the fragrence kind because i didnt want a scent to be mixed with my cologne and have 2 mixed up smells</li>
            <li>What I mean by &#x27;feeling&#x27; a special treatment is being able to feel a difference in your skin after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted it for after shaving to apply to my face as I have other lotions more suited for the body.  </li>
            <li>For your daily use, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>With this lotion you actually feel the special treatment that the bottle indicates.</li>
            <li>Keeps me soft for the ladies ;-)</li>
            <li>None greasy, absorbs quickly and last all day.</li>
            <li>It helps keep his skin soft and smooth, but this has to be used on a daily basis, no switch-ups.</li>
            <li>A full press fully moisturized my face, neck, shoulders, abdomen, legs, body, my neighbor, his family, and the entire census designated area in which I live.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A few went on ok without redness or stinging</li>
            <li>Fully to the left of this inch is off, and fully to the right is on.  </li>
            <li>When placed side by side with other lotion, particularly Vaseline Men&#x27;s, you get 1/3 more lotion with Vaseline for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li>What little odor it does have fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have dry skin pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>now start working on a clear shave gel to go with it!</li>
            <li>(The price was higher and is a smaller bottle than the vaseline for men products)</li>
            <li>This the first lotion my husband has ever used and only because it says Men&#x27;s on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s labeled for men as I imagine women would enjoy these features too!</li>
            <li>It looks and feels exactly like the regular lubriderm body and hand lotion we have used for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the go and live a busy life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be more serious, I live in upstate New York.</li>
            <li>I leave it right in the shower rack and apply the minute my face is blotted dry after shaving.  </li>
            <li>A sent free after shave that adds a little moisture to my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the deal is but so many items that say unscented or fragrance-free still contain fragrance, or at least have a scent that I can detect, this does not.</li>
            <li>Just a warning in case you have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I break out is a bit of a rash when I use scented lotion; this Lubriderm hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and</li>
            <li>I can apply it directly after shaving and I do not experience any redness or stinging.</li>
            <li>HAVING A VERY ITCHY BACK,</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft without it leaving oily.</li>
            <li>Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm...and</li>
            <li>Not oily or overly thick, this is about the consistency of most sun screen.  </li>
            <li>so I believe that Lubriderm was pretty clever to create on single product that you can use for multiple things, pretty much the only moisturizer you need, makes thing really simple and it works.</li>
            <li>With the lid tightly screwed on, there is no way to adjust the pump to face, say, the front of the bottle, without significantly loosening the cap, which I gather</li>
            <li>We love this lotion...except we are not able to find it in our local stores with no  smell.  </li>
            <li>Also, I notice that when my blade gets dull and needs changing, more facial irritation is caused and just about anything will burn at that point but this hasn&#x27;t done that yet.</li>
            <li>At first I tried some other products and they all have problems, too greasy, fragrant, whatever.  </li>
            <li>Used it right after shaving my neck slightly too close, and my neck was on fire for an hour.</li>
            <li>Yes guys need to moisten up their skin just as woman do and we don&#x27;t want to search high and long for what works and what doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my face would always turn red and sting quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, not to harsh, just right.</li>
            <li>Unlike other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products, this one really is.</li>
            <li>The pump on this product is only able to be moved approximately one inch.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am curious to see how it works in the dry Chicago winter season since this is July/August hot &amp; humid.</li>
            <li>Men with dark facial hair like me might display some leftovers if an excessive amount is used; however, if you have a goatee facial-hair style, you can just simply avoid touching it with</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling slightly sticky like the Aveeno does, but it also doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Although I am sketchy about the 24-hour claim, at least I pay less for Vaseline, it works better, and even the bottle is bigger!&lt;br</li>
            <li>me crazy, but why in the world would a liquid product with a dispenser that doesn&#x27;t need to be popped open for first use (more on this later) be shipped in a way that affords it minimal protection?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>further inspection of the package, I found the cap of the bottle to be quite loose, and the pump (which typically on lotions, soaps, etc., must be turned and popped up before first use) to be already fully active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> We are so happy to fund it online.</li>
            <li> HE LIKES NON FRAGRANCE PRODUCTS AND GREAT MOISTURE.</li>
            <li> I have also begun using it on my arms and shoulders and it works just great.</li>
            <li> Smell great</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this, but my husband said this is a really great after shave and face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great.  </li>
            <li> It soothes after shaving and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not so great as a face lotion.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great price.</li>
            <li> I can not handle most scents and this one absolutely is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Great price on a good product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is non-greasy and fragrance free which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this lotion is that it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well, I used to use Neutrogena, but this one seemed like a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Good:</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good in my view of the world.</li>
            <li> The price in my opinion is fair.</li>
            <li> Good Deal.</li>
            <li> It is good they have come up with a good product for men.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your face also.</li>
            <li> I trusted Lubriderm and they sold me a product that is full of Mineral Oil !!!</li>
            <li> Great smell too, not overpowering but very clean and bright what you can smell.  </li>
            <li> Gets in to the skin quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy after feel!!!</li>
            <li> LOL - but it is smooth and creamy</li>
            <li> Yes the product has a nice consistency but it shouldn&#x27;t be sold as a face cream or after shave product</li>
            <li> Also good on the hands, but I am mostly using this just for my face after showers/shaves.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a nice change.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of moisturizing the skin - not as great as the thicker creams but its a trade-off for the completely non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good, I&#x27;ll be buying this again when it runs out in about 20 years.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to buy a product without a scent.</li>
            <li> I find this lotion very useful and good for the price.</li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin ans have tried many lotions this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as advertised, great product.</li>
            <li> With the Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion, it would dissolve a bit too rapidly into the skin and you would have to apply a bit more to cover your body, but Lubriderm&#x27;s formula seems to have this issue covered.    </li>
            <li> Most men will prefer the fragrance-free choice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like so many of these products.</li>
            <li> More of a lotion than a after-shave.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is free from fragrance, which is nice at times.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed it gives my skin more of a reddish tint for some reason.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Will buy more of this.  </li>
            <li> and he hasn&#x27;t been able to use any after shave until now.  </li>
            <li> Twice ( some guys take longer to figure things out :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are those who say that mineral oil applied to the skin is perfectly safe as the grade used in cosmetics and skin care products is distilled and refined.</li>
            <li> for sure would not want it on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Switched to Proraso Pre/Post Shave cream, much better for post shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product from a really well known company.</li>
            <li> , the scents were more feminine than I prefer.</li>
            <li> - okay, when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This has many things that her &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; face lotions has.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It would be much better if it were unscented.  </li>
            <li> It works a lot better as an every-day face lotion &amp; after shave.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any more issues.  </li>
            <li> It costs a lot more</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> There are so many lotions out there catering to women</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you that want a better skin treatment experience try Nivea.</li>
            <li> Make sure to distribute it evenly between your palms before applying.</li>
            <li> I sure there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and nicely like</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy, but it leaves kind of an oily feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly different than a liquid but in a very good way.  </li>
            <li> for after shave only balms/lotions, this gives you incredible value for the dollar.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing after a good shave too.</li>
            <li> If you love the stuff that&#x27;s fine we not trying to discourage you from drinking or rubbing with it if you so desire as we are a free society.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your face is clean before applying.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand strong perfumes</li>
            <li> Okay, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> This lotion is smooth and easy to apply, it feels like whipped body butter almost, and it is odorless</li>
            <li> Works fine as a body lotion, though.</li>
            <li> Shipped overseas, which was a huge plus.</li>
            <li> She never seems to like a lotion that I buy, so I decided to go with a fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> No burning sensation for me although there is a light amount of alcohol &amp; citric acid in the lotion that may be causing this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and disappears.</li>
            <li> I like that its fragrance free and aloe enriched.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job, is not oily and does not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have to do fragrance free, 100%, or my eyes can&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> Really like that it can be applied to the face, body and be used after shaving - sooths the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> so if you want something fragrance free, this should do the job.</li>
            <li> should note I use the Fragnance Free and have not tried the Light Fragnance.</li>
            <li> I use it afer the shower and after shaving primarily.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily at all and the fragrance free version is literally fragrance free -</li>
            <li> Im the type of guy that likes fragrence free lotion because it doesnt smell.</li>
            <li> it is fragrance free though, so that is a bonus</li>
            <li> It works well and is fragrence free.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s all that is important..</li>
            <li> This is one terrific product and a really great deal.  </li>
            <li> Ok, first I am the wife of the man who uses this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit on the lighter side, but still great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> , the lotion itself does appear to be fragrance free, is non-greasy, and dries quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I never felt I was receiving a special skin treatment.</li>
            <li> However, it is a very nice body and hand lotion, and I plan to use it in the winter when I routinely get dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Winters here get dry, and this product has been an excellent addition to my regime and has completely eliminated dryness in any post-shave or face wash routine.</li>
            <li> It feels clean and fresh after a shave.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that it quickly absorbs into your skin moisturizing it, all without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> It does have some sort of mild scent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has no odor.  </li>
            <li> The best lotion I have personally used, no womanly after smell either.</li>
            <li> Here comes Lubriderm which is very inexpensive for a big 16 ounce pump bottle and is  a multi-purposed face and body lotion that feels great and works well.  </li>
            <li> I use it on every part of my body that has skin ( EVERY PART, hint hint), and no stinging, burning or anything else one might experience from another product that ventures \\&quot;down the happy trail\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Lubriderm for giving no-fuss guys like myself an easy way to take care of their hide.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great; it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and works really well with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised - non-greasy, light and quick absorbing.</li>
            <li> so you apply your own  cologne after without overshadowing any previous scent, i love it .</li>
            <li> This lotion has yet to sting my eyes, and I also put it on after shaving and it leaves my skin very soft and not irritated like most lotions tend to do to my face after a fresh shave.  </li>
            <li> I do not like lotions that have any smell, this one is really scent free.</li>
            <li> This product is light and goes on fast.</li>
            <li> It seems many companies out there finally understand that there is in fact a market for men, hence why these products are now readily available.    </li>
            <li> Showering &amp; shaving open up pores and allows precious water to escape, but a light moisturizer can fix everything.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions that are made specifically for sensitive skin and none of them suited me well.</li>
            <li> In my experience this is something rare.</li>
            <li> After applying this lotion to my freshly shaven face it BURNS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, I played with it for a moment, and discovered an additional fun fact:  </li>
            <li> I have used Lubriderm products in the past, always with great success</li>
            <li> not too watery unlike some other brand and absorbs easily and not greasy good for sensitive skin and post-shaving.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I can confidently say that all 50,000 of us had noticeably softer skin and, in general, a sunnier disposition</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer and decent priced for general use (re: not post shave).</li>
            <li> There are better face lotions out there, but you may need to spend a little more.</li>
            <li> It only provides medium to light moisturizing, but it is truly scent free.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly without too much oily feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I am currently in my one free trial month of Amazon Prime, so I used the free two day shipping for this item.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I am currently in my one free trial month of Amazon Prime, so I used the free two day shipping for this item.  </li>
            <li> A little early to give it a full 5 stars, but it seems to be very nice as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try this product, as I have been looking for a daily use, fragrance free moisturizer targeted at men for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Simply put: I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> But frankly, the price with the shipping rate is still higher than that in Walgreen.</li>
            <li> Skin care for most men is a basic bar of soap or body wash.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free was a plus for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It cools my face in this hot Arizona heat.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does, it moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> who is to say that the next time around would see better packaging).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, definitely different than aftershave that burns, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my husband smell girly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this lotion is completely fragrance free.</li>
            <li> my fair skin hubby has very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> this one is pretty much up to par.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> No fragrance, and it absorbs quickly and completely, without residue..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many of these sorts of products before, and it has always been my assumption that the amount of product dispensed when the lever is fully depressed is the amount designed for a single use.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers mention they like the light scent, but there really isn&#x27;t one just a light chemical smell that due more to the makeup of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> This really depends on how much lotion a person uses a day and how much money they would like to spend.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li> Lots of lotions say non-greasy but this one really is.  </li>
            <li> I really think this can be an all purpose lotion for anyone looking for no smells and no grease.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like hand cream, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> A fragrance free lotion that actually does not smell like anything!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it&#x27;s versatality..lotion, after shave, sun-screen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, upon opening the envelope (which I did on my ironing board, much to my dismay), I was treated to a generous amount of lotion all over the inside of the package, all over my hands, and all over my ironing</li>
            <li> but I really like this.  </li>
            <li> This works really well use it after washing you&#x27;re face/ shaving, etc...</li>
            <li> I have used the whole bottle of this</li>
            <li> prefer using Vaseline for men fast absorbing 24-hour moisture.</li>
            <li> Within 15 seconds you &#x27;feel&#x27; your skin absorbing the lotion treatment.</li>
            <li> I didnt want the fragrence kind because i didnt want a scent to be mixed with my cologne and have 2 mixed up smells</li>
            <li> What I mean by &#x27;feeling&#x27; a special treatment is being able to feel a difference in your skin after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted it for after shaving to apply to my face as I have other lotions more suited for the body.  </li>
            <li> For your daily use, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> With this lotion you actually feel the special treatment that the bottle indicates.</li>
            <li> Keeps me soft for the ladies ;-)</li>
            <li> None greasy, absorbs quickly and last all day.</li>
            <li> It helps keep his skin soft and smooth, but this has to be used on a daily basis, no switch-ups.</li>
            <li> A full press fully moisturized my face, neck, shoulders, abdomen, legs, body, my neighbor, his family, and the entire census designated area in which I live.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A few went on ok without redness or stinging</li>
            <li> Fully to the left of this inch is off, and fully to the right is on.  </li>
            <li> When placed side by side with other lotion, particularly Vaseline Men&#x27;s, you get 1/3 more lotion with Vaseline for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li> What little odor it does have fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have dry skin pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> now start working on a clear shave gel to go with it!</li>
            <li> (The price was higher and is a smaller bottle than the vaseline for men products)</li>
            <li> This the first lotion my husband has ever used and only because it says Men&#x27;s on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s labeled for men as I imagine women would enjoy these features too!</li>
            <li> It looks and feels exactly like the regular lubriderm body and hand lotion we have used for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the go and live a busy life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be more serious, I live in upstate New York.</li>
            <li> I leave it right in the shower rack and apply the minute my face is blotted dry after shaving.  </li>
            <li> A sent free after shave that adds a little moisture to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is but so many items that say unscented or fragrance-free still contain fragrance, or at least have a scent that I can detect, this does not.</li>
            <li> Just a warning in case you have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I break out is a bit of a rash when I use scented lotion; this Lubriderm hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and</li>
            <li> I can apply it directly after shaving and I do not experience any redness or stinging.</li>
            <li> HAVING A VERY ITCHY BACK,</li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft without it leaving oily.</li>
            <li> Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm...and</li>
            <li> Not oily or overly thick, this is about the consistency of most sun screen.  </li>
            <li> so I believe that Lubriderm was pretty clever to create on single product that you can use for multiple things, pretty much the only moisturizer you need, makes thing really simple and it works.</li>
            <li> With the lid tightly screwed on, there is no way to adjust the pump to face, say, the front of the bottle, without significantly loosening the cap, which I gather</li>
            <li> We love this lotion...except we are not able to find it in our local stores with no  smell.  </li>
            <li> Also, I notice that when my blade gets dull and needs changing, more facial irritation is caused and just about anything will burn at that point but this hasn&#x27;t done that yet.</li>
            <li> At first I tried some other products and they all have problems, too greasy, fragrant, whatever.  </li>
            <li> Used it right after shaving my neck slightly too close, and my neck was on fire for an hour.</li>
            <li> Yes guys need to moisten up their skin just as woman do and we don&#x27;t want to search high and long for what works and what doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my face would always turn red and sting quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not to harsh, just right.</li>
            <li> Unlike other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products, this one really is.</li>
            <li> The pump on this product is only able to be moved approximately one inch.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am curious to see how it works in the dry Chicago winter season since this is July/August hot &amp; humid.</li>
            <li> Men with dark facial hair like me might display some leftovers if an excessive amount is used; however, if you have a goatee facial-hair style, you can just simply avoid touching it with</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling slightly sticky like the Aveeno does, but it also doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Although I am sketchy about the 24-hour claim, at least I pay less for Vaseline, it works better, and even the bottle is bigger!&lt;br</li>
            <li> me crazy, but why in the world would a liquid product with a dispenser that doesn&#x27;t need to be popped open for first use (more on this later) be shipped in a way that affords it minimal protection?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> further inspection of the package, I found the cap of the bottle to be quite loose, and the pump (which typically on lotions, soaps, etc., must be turned and popped up before first use) to be already fully active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright - doesn&#x27;t seem to help to much with my dry face although it does go on well and helps only a little.</li>
            <li> applying this on my face and body it takes a few minutes until my hands are normal again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Lubriderm for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion, it seriously has no other competition on the market.</li>
            <li> The chemicals printed are way to long to google.</li>
            <li> Compared to other lotions that I&#x27;ve used (Lubriderm Daily Moisture, Vaseline Men&#x27;s Body and Face, Vaseline Intensive Rescue Hypoallergenic, etc.)</li>
            <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so therefore I can&#x27;t speak for other men.  </li>
            <li> only a dab needed after shaving and does not leave a greasy feeling like some other products.</li>
            <li> For a regular guy it is difficult to have more than two &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products, we tend to be lazy on that</li>
            <li> I have used several other lotions that claim they are for body and face.</li>
            <li> can use my phone shortly after without the grease that other lotions leave on my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my face would still be dry.</li>
            <li> helps out alot with dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH MEN&#x27;S LOTIONS TO LUBRICATE DRY SKIN.  </li>
            <li> a non greasy manly lotiom cause my arms get dry from work.</li>
            <li> might try the slight scent one next time.</li>
            <li> in all, Nivea feels rejuvenating, Vaseline absorbs the treatment quickly and displays it, and Lubriderm fails to create anything that separates it from the competition.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for very dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> DUE TO DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> Works well after shaving - less bumps due to the aloe present and removes the itchy sensation while being used.</li>
            <li> Its not really &amp;#34;3-in-1&amp;#34; and does not work as an after shave.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few serious competitors to Neutrogena Oil-Free Facial Lotion, but the Lubriderm comes out far ahead on cost.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a decent lotion that didn&#x27;t smell or was too heavy.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s up to other consumers</li>
            <li> I was worried about greasiness or glossiness due to the mineral oil content in this lotion, but both fears were unfounded.</li>
            <li> And like other reviewers said, the bottle lasts a longggg time.</li>
            <li> other Reviewers are saying.  </li>
            <li> Ask them to provide you with a list of the nutrients and vitamins contained in mineral oil also ask what plant, herb, tree or flower is mineral derived from (specify mineral oil content, not the product or other ingredients it may contain).</li>
            <li> Rub it in for a few seconds and within a minute or 2 is dry.</li>
            <li> This bottle is expensive in comparisson to other brands that do much</li>
            <li> It worked well, but stayed wet and a little greasy for a while after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Helps heal weekend gardening damage.&lt;br /&gt;Costs less than the other variants that have some additions to the formulation.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to be too critical at this point.  </li>
            <li> I actually put a small amount in a separate bottle and added a little scented after shave</li>
            <li> After shaving with a double edge safety razor it burned my face for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> The price makes it not worth the hassle of returning the product to Amazon for a replacement or refund (and indeed,</li>
            <li> It comes out thick, however, when you rub it in, your skin totally absorbs it</li>
            <li> This product works very well and is three to four times less expensive than Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as Vasline for Men &amp; seems slightly greasier but overall not too bad.  </li>
            <li> However, it does have an odd odor despite it being scentless.</li>
            <li> I got this @ target for a little less than what amazon is selling it for.</li>
            <li> So unless you&#x27;re half reptile, you are truly missing out if you do not get this stuff.</li>
            <li> You can use a lot or a little, and there is no residue after about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, guys (even secure ones) hate to admit they need to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed, apply it fairly heavy to face, neck and hands.  </li>
            <li> I can use it everyday</li>
            <li> It has very little smell</li>
            <li> Also, I have really bad allergies and am very cautious about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> Product resulted in a rash which felt and appeared a lot like small mosquito bites wherever the lotion was applied.  </li>
            <li> It burns a bit, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as any of the Vaseline lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> dollars for a small tube.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im not sure what else there is to say</li>
            <li> would be a bad idea, based on the mess I recently finished cleaning</li>
            <li> This fits the bill but is hard to find in store.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a little thin, but that makes it easier to spread around.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid you can use this and still be a man, we are human and have skin too.</li>
            <li> Soothes without the burn and doesn&#x27;t seem to potentiate acne, at least not with me.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps cut down on irritation after shaving without annoying aromas.  </li>
            <li> Not watery or runny in the least like some after shave lotions (Gillette!)  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed the no aroma is not actually truthful as it does have a smell which I don&#x27;t care for but in a pinch I will use it.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t feel like there was a thin film of goo on me.</li>
            <li> this point I was hesitant to even test the product, as I have no way of knowing whether it is simply poorly designed or defective or if, in fact, it has been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed, and not nearly as much in the product as I am with Amazon&#x27;s shipping job.er packaging).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed, and not nearly as much in the product as I am with Amazon&#x27;s shipping job.</li>
            <li> But these designer products are very expensive and come is small quantities.  </li>
            <li> Lotion is lightweight &amp; fast-absorbing, but unfortunately does not appear to be hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the Lubriderm product line.</li>
            <li> I detect a slightly unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> cause we both hate wasting money</li>
            <li> I hate the greasy feel of lotion which is why i didn&#x27;t use one.</li>
            <li> and yet I HATE the smell of it on my husbands face!  </li>
            <li> Some lotions say they are but leave a nasty scent or one of flowers or something.  </li>
            <li> a terrible ingredient for the body !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works fine. Helps heal weekend gardening damage.&lt;br /&gt;Costs less than the other variants that have some additions to the formulation.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t smell like I was mugged by a perfume counter, one that didn&#x27;t leave me greasy like I bathed in bacon fat, and one that didn&#x27;t leave me shiny like a waxed car. Enter: Lubriderm men&#x27;s 3-in-1 Lotion. Simply put: I love this stuff. It comes out thick, however, when you rub it in, your skin totally absorbs it, I didn&#x27;t feel like there was a thin film of goo on me. Also, I have really bad allergies and am very cautious about what I put on my face. This lotion has yet to sting my eyes, and I also put it on after shaving and it leaves my skin very soft and not irritated like most lotions tend to do to my face after a fresh shave.  Let&#x27;s face it, guys (even secure ones) hate to admit they need to moisturize. So unless you&#x27;re half reptile, you are truly missing out if you do not get this stuff. I use it on every part of my body that has skin ( EVERY PART, hint hint), and no stinging, burning or anything else one might experience from another product that ventures \\&quot;down the happy trail\\&quot;. I highly recommend this lotion, it seriously has no other competition on the market.</li>
            <li> Just received and bottle cap is busted with lotion everywhere</li>
            <li> Yes guys need to moisten up their skin just as woman do and we don&#x27;t want to search high and long for what works and what doesn&#x27;t work. It seems many companies out there finally understand that there is in fact a market for men, hence why these products are now readily available.    That being said, I have dry skin pretty much everywhere and I&#x27;m picky about what I put on my body.    Pro:  Compared to other lotions that I&#x27;ve used (Lubriderm Daily Moisture, Vaseline Men&#x27;s Body and Face, Vaseline Intensive Rescue Hypoallergenic, etc.) this one is pretty much up to par. With the Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion, it would dissolve a bit too rapidly into the skin and you would have to apply a bit more to cover your body, but Lubriderm&#x27;s formula seems to have this issue covered.    I don&#x27;t prefer to use this lotion on my face but that&#x27;s up to other consumers whether or not they want to.    Con:  When placed side by side with other lotion, particularly Vaseline Men&#x27;s, you get 1/3 more lotion with Vaseline for the same amount of money. This really depends on how much lotion a person uses a day and how much money they would like to spend. Perhaps Lubriderm believes its name justifies the price?    All in all, this is perhaps one of the best lotions that I&#x27;ve used but I have to knock off one star in regards to pricing.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  This is about the only cream I can use on my face and not get acne.  I used it post shower every day and it keeps my face looking like a baby&#x27;s butt, literally.</li>
            <li> All the men&#x27;s lotions that I ever buy are always too smelly for my girlfriends nose. She never seems to like a lotion that I buy, so I decided to go with a fragrance free lotion. This way I get the moisture that I need without the complaints that I don&#x27;t need.    I have used Lubriderm products in the past, always with great success and this product is no different. It absorbs fast and never feels greasy. I have no problem using this lotion all over my body.    Also if you get it on subscribe-and-save...it&#x27;s even cheaper.</li>
            <li> For the ripoff and scam artists out there who charge about $4 an ounce (Nivea!) for after shave only balms/lotions, this gives you incredible value for the dollar.  I mainly wanted it for after shaving to apply to my face as I have other lotions more suited for the body.  No burning sensation for me although there is a light amount of alcohol &amp; citric acid in the lotion that may be causing this.  Also, I notice that when my blade gets dull and needs changing, more facial irritation is caused and just about anything will burn at that point but this hasn&#x27;t done that yet. Not watery or runny in the least like some after shave lotions (Gillette!)  I leave it right in the shower rack and apply the minute my face is blotted dry after shaving.  Great smell too, not overpowering but very clean and bright what you can smell.  Bravo Lubriderm...now start working on a clear shave gel to go with it!</li>
            <li> It definitely helps cut down on irritation after shaving without annoying aromas.  It is also helpful as a means to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Ok, first I am the wife of the man who uses this lotion.  With that said, I can&#x27;t stand the stuff!  It&#x27;s fragrance free and yet I HATE the smell of it on my husbands face!  I know that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so therefore I can&#x27;t speak for other men.  He&#x27;s trying to use it up cause we both hate wasting money but I can tell you I can&#x27;t wait until the day it runs out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is but so many items that say unscented or fragrance-free still contain fragrance, or at least have a scent that I can detect, this does not. I ordered the fragrance-free option obviously, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all. It goes on smooth and disappears. I was worried about greasiness or glossiness due to the mineral oil content in this lotion, but both fears were unfounded. Cheap and good, I&#x27;ll be buying this again when it runs out in about 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few serious competitors to Neutrogena Oil-Free Facial Lotion, but the Lubriderm comes out far ahead on cost.  This product works very well and is three to four times less expensive than Neutrogena.  Most men will prefer the fragrance-free choice.</li>
            <li> The lotion is good,and I like it. But frankly, the price with the shipping rate is still higher than that in Walgreen.So next time if I need to buy this item again, I prefer to go to Walgreen.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for me. I&#x27;m always on the go and live a busy life. Don&#x27;t want to use 3 different products when one will do. Until now there hasn&#x27;t been an option but now the 3-in-1 lotion solves all my problems. Thanks to Lubriderm for giving no-fuss guys like myself an easy way to take care of their hide.</li>
            <li> Skin care for most men is a basic bar of soap or body wash. Showering &amp; shaving open up pores and allows precious water to escape, but a light moisturizer can fix everything. Don&#x27;t be afraid you can use this and still be a man, we are human and have skin too. It&#x27;s great to see companies make skin care products for men. (The price was higher and is a smaller bottle than the vaseline for men products) I got this @ target for a little less than what amazon is selling it for. You can use this daily on your body &amp; face (though be careful to keep it away from the skin near your eyes). I like that its fragrance free and aloe enriched. It does what its supposed to and I&#x27;m happy w/ it.</li>
            <li> This the first lotion my husband has ever used and only because it says Men&#x27;s on it.  The lotion is non-greasy and fragrance free which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Lots of lotions say non-greasy but this one really is.  I&#x27;ve been using a post shave lotion from Nivea and this one is just as non-greasy. I really think this can be an all purpose lotion for anyone looking for no smells and no grease.  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s labeled for men as I imagine women would enjoy these features too!</li>
            <li> Lotion is lightweight &amp; fast-absorbing, but unfortunately does not appear to be hypoallergenic.  Product resulted in a rash which felt and appeared a lot like small mosquito bites wherever the lotion was applied.  Just a warning in case you have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great price.</li>
            <li> It burns a bit, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as any of the Vaseline lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for very dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> For your daily use, but nothing special. The best thing about this lotion is that it&#x27;s fragrance free. Regarding post-shave, I&#x27;ll keep on using another product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much what it advertises.  Some other reviewers mention they like the light scent, but there really isn&#x27;t one just a light chemical smell that due more to the makeup of the lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as Vasline for Men &amp; seems slightly greasier but overall not too bad.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so it&#x27;s hard to be too critical at this point.  Also, I am curious to see how it works in the dry Chicago winter season since this is July/August hot &amp; humid.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband who was always complaining about not having a good cream without fragrance and when he got this one , he was happy with!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright - doesn&#x27;t seem to help to much with my dry face although it does go on well and helps only a little.</li>
            <li> Not oily or overly thick, this is about the consistency of most sun screen.  It applies easily, especially to the face after a shave and doesn&#x27;t gunk up or cause break outs.  It only provides medium to light moisturizing, but it is truly scent free.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion on my face after I shave. It does a fantastic job, is not oily and does not have a fragrance. I will definitely keep purchasing this lotion.</li>
            <li> I do not like lotions that have any smell, this one is really scent free. Works great no greasy or oily feeling. 5 stars all day.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like hand cream, I don&#x27;t know why but I just dislike like the way it feels. This stuff is great; it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and works really well with my dry skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> have used for about a month with no complaints.  only a dab needed after shaving and does not leave a greasy feeling like some other products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like so many of these products. Just does the job.</li>
            <li> my fair skin hubby has very dry sensitive skin.  This product has no &amp;#34;flower scent&amp;#34; and moisturizes his skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fifty-something manly man, and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year.  It rocks. I have to do fragrance free, 100%, or my eyes can&#x27;t take it. Unlike other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; products, this one really is. At first I tried some other products and they all have problems, too greasy, fragrant, whatever.  This is all I need. Period. I use it before bed, apply it fairly heavy to face, neck and hands.  My face drinks this stuff up. Just make sure your face is clean before applying.  And like other reviewers said, the bottle lasts a longggg time.</li>
            <li> Got this lotion with the intent of using it as a post shave balm. It stings like the dickens, but seems to be keeping my face smoother than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for hands. I break out is a bit of a rash when I use scented lotion; this Lubriderm hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far.</li>
            <li> Okay, nothing special.  More of a lotion than a after-shave.  Nice to be able to buy a product without a scent.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. It works as advertised - non-greasy, light and quick absorbing. Does a great job of moisturizing the skin - not as great as the thicker creams but its a trade-off for the completely non-greasy feel. Really like that it can be applied to the face, body and be used after shaving - sooths the skin nicely. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it but I will only keep buying it when I see it on sale.  It has very little smell so if you want something fragrance free, this should do the job.</li>
            <li> Works well after shaving - less bumps due to the aloe present and removes the itchy sensation while being used.</li>
            <li> Used it right after shaving my neck slightly too close, and my neck was on fire for an hour. However, it is a very nice body and hand lotion, and I plan to use it in the winter when I routinely get dry skin. It looks and feels exactly like the regular lubriderm body and hand lotion we have used for years.</li>
            <li> This lotion is free from fragrance, which is nice at times.  Some lotions say they are but leave a nasty scent or one of flowers or something.  This lotion is a little thin, but that makes it easier to spread around.  Dries quickly without too much oily feel.  Good stuff, would buy again.</li>
            <li> No scent and only thing I&#x27;ve found I can use on my face without bothering my eyes.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as advertised, great product. Fragrance free was a plus for my sensitive skin. Shipped overseas, which was a huge plus. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the Lubriderm product line.</li>
            <li> Works well, I used to use Neutrogena, but this one seemed like a good deal.  Overall I&#x27;m happy, but it leaves kind of an oily feel.  Just use sparingly.  It&#x27;s odorless, and soothes my skin so for the price I&#x27;m going to keep using.  Signed up for the subscribe and save although it seems like this one is going to last me a year...</li>
            <li> I want to be upfront before I continue my review. I haven&#x27;t used many of these sorts of products before, and it has always been my assumption that the amount of product dispensed when the lever is fully depressed is the amount designed for a single use. Buyer beware, it isn&#x27;t. A full press fully moisturized my face, neck, shoulders, abdomen, legs, body, my neighbor, his family, and the entire census designated area in which I live. HOWEVER, I can confidently say that all 50,000 of us had noticeably softer skin and, in general, a sunnier disposition the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be more serious, I live in upstate New York. Winters here get dry, and this product has been an excellent addition to my regime and has completely eliminated dryness in any post-shave or face wash routine. As I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and family, I&#x27;d recommend it to the public.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed the no aroma is not actually truthful as it does have a smell which I don&#x27;t care for but in a pinch I will use it.</li>
            <li> I bought both this and Aveeno at the same time and figured I would try each. This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling slightly sticky like the Aveeno does, but it also doesn&#x27;t work very well. It makes my face look greasy although it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. I have also noticed it gives my skin more of a reddish tint for some reason. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good: Absorbs quickly and nicely like other Reviewers are saying.  Not heavy and just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try the slight scent one next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not picky w/respect to lotions. However, fragrance is something I notice and have an opinion about.  This has none.  That&#x27;s good in my view of the world.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this product. I can use it everyday and I don&#x27;t get the oilliness that would come some products. It does not over shadow my Cologne. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with applying face lotion after shaving. I have sensitive skin and my face would always turn red and sting quite a bit. I have tried many lotions that are made specifically for sensitive skin and none of them suited me well. A few went on ok without redness or stinging but my face would still be dry. A friend reccomended this product to me and I cannot be happier. I can apply it directly after shaving and I do not experience any redness or stinging. It also moisturizes very well. I have tried maybe 2 dozen lotions over the years and I have now found one that works for me. I would highly reccomend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I should note I use the Fragnance Free and have not tried the Light Fragnance.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and great for post shave.</li>
            <li> helps out alot with dry skin on my face. Will buy more of this.  The price in my opinion is fair. Good Deal.</li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin ans have tried many lotions this one is the best. None greasy, absorbs quickly and last all day. Would definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a decent lotion that didn&#x27;t smell or was too heavy. This fits the bill but is hard to find in store. Very good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband because I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells and he hasn&#x27;t been able to use any after shave until now.  It soothes his irritated face after shaving and no smell  to bother me.  He&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for me. Not sticky</li>
            <li> We love this lotion...except we are not able to find it in our local stores with no  smell.  We are so happy to fund it online. I</li>
            <li> I trusted Lubriderm and they sold me a product that is full of Mineral Oil !!! a terrible ingredient for the body ! Yes the product has a nice consistency but it shouldn&#x27;t be sold as a face cream or after shave product it&#x27;s totally screwed my face up ! Twice ( some guys take longer to figure things out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are those who say that mineral oil applied to the skin is perfectly safe as the grade used in cosmetics and skin care products is distilled and refined. Well, I say gasoline is distilled and refined too but I would not want to apply it to my skin and for sure would not want it on my baby&#x27;s skin. Ask them to provide you with a list of the nutrients and vitamins contained in mineral oil also ask what plant, herb, tree or flower is mineral derived from (specify mineral oil content, not the product or other ingredients it may contain). If you love the stuff that&#x27;s fine we not trying to discourage you from drinking or rubbing with it if you so desire as we are a free society. Did all the warnings about skin cancer 20 - 30 years ago stop people from sun bathing, I think not?</li>
            <li> For a regular guy it is difficult to have more than two &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products, we tend to be lazy on that so I believe that Lubriderm was pretty clever to create on single product that you can use for multiple things, pretty much the only moisturizer you need, makes thing really simple and it works.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, and it absorbs quickly and completely, without residue..</li>
            <li> Burns my face after a shave. This is unacceptable in something marketed for face lotion, but your mileage may vary. Nice moisturizer and decent priced for general use (re: not post shave). Switched to Proraso Pre/Post Shave cream, much better for post shave.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS PRODUCT. HE LIKES NON FRAGRANCE PRODUCTS AND GREAT MOISTURE. THIS PRODUCT COVERS ALL OF HIS NEEDS.</li>
            <li> I hate the greasy feel of lotion which is why i didn&#x27;t use one. My hands and face have been getting dryer in the winter time so I bought this. It&#x27;s a great product from a really well known company. No greasy feeling and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> A little early to give it a full 5 stars, but it seems to be very nice as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> A fragrance free lotion that actually does not smell like anything! In my experience this is something rare. Not to mention that it quickly absorbs into your skin moisturizing it, all without leaving an oily residue.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it afer the shower and after shaving primarily. I have also begun using it on my arms and shoulders and it works just great. The unsented lotion is my preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Lubriderm for dry skin. It worked well, but stayed wet and a little greasy for a while after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scents were more feminine than I prefer. This product is light and goes on fast. It dries in about 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  Very soothing after a good shave too. It cools my face in this hot Arizona heat.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and scentless, it just works.  I can not handle most scents and this one absolutely is perfect.  Even used on the face it does not bother my allergies.  Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH MEN&#x27;S LOTIONS TO LUBRICATE DRY SKIN.  HAVING A VERY ITCHY BACK, DUE TO DRY SKIN I COULD NOT REACH WITH MY HANDS, I  THOUGHT THIS ROLLER BACK BRUSH APPLICATOR MIGHT SOLVE MY PROBLEM,  IT DID.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not smelly or slimy.  I can&#x27;t stand strong perfumes so this is about all I can stand.  What little odor it does have fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be reviewing lotion but Im impressed. This product is a must for re-moisturizing the face after a shower or shave. It&#x27;s not oily at all and the fragrance free version is literally fragrance free - the only lotion I&#x27;ve come across that actually is what it says it is. Soothes without the burn and doesn&#x27;t seem to potentiate acne, at least not with me.</li>
            <li> I find this lotion very useful and good for the price. However, it does have an odd odor despite it being scentless.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine, he is alergic to fragrances.  Any product with a fragrance gives him a rash.  This lotion he has been using after shaving and on his body - okay, when I put it on. LOL - but it is smooth and creamy</li>
            <li> I have used several other lotions that claim they are for body and face. This one actually holds up to what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;After applying this on my face and body it takes a few minutes until my hands are normal again.&lt;br /&gt;I can use my phone shortly after without the grease that other lotions leave on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is studying skin, and ingredients. This has many things that her &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; face lotions has. I have no idea what they are but they must be good! Costing her 30+ dollars for a small tube.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Smell great but my body got a rash after i applied this lotion on. Maybe its just me. The chemicals printed are way to long to google.</li>
            <li> After shaving with a double edge safety razor it burned my face for at least an hour. It does have some sort of mild scent. I&#x27;ll use it for a body lotion just not on my face.</li>
            <li> This lotion is smooth and easy to apply, it feels like whipped body butter almost, and it is odorless so you apply your own  cologne after without overshadowing any previous scent, i love it .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust this lotion for my face, but it definitely does its job when i apply it to my body. im not sure what else there is to say but it works and it doesnt make me feel gross/greasy at any point during the day. get it!</li>
            <li> Im the type of guy that likes fragrence free lotion because it doesnt smell. I didnt want the fragrence kind because i didnt want a scent to be mixed with my cologne and have 2 mixed up smells</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this lotion.  It absorbs quickly and has no odor.  We are using it every day.</li>
            <li> bought them because it was on sale. not the best you can get. but it does the job. it is fragrance free though, so that is a bonus</li>
            <li> Was trying to find a non greasy manly lotiom cause my arms get dry from work.This stuff works great. Rub it in for a few seconds and within a minute or 2 is dry. Keeps me soft for the ladies ;-)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this, but my husband said this is a really great after shave and face moisturizer.  I actually put a small amount in a separate bottle and added a little scented after shave and it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> does its job. not too watery unlike some other brand and absorbs easily and not greasy good for sensitive skin and post-shaving. convenience of delivery with amazon.com is a ++</li>
            <li> After applying this lotion to my freshly shaven face it BURNS. The lotion turned my face red and wouldn&#x27;t stop burning. I got relief after washing the lotion off and applying Proraso post shave, to help get rid of the burning feeling.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great.  it makes my skin soft without it leaving oily. I am looking to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the lighter side, but still great for dry skin. It soothes after shaving and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does, it moisturizes.  The only issue I had with it is the way it smells.  It would be much better if it were unscented.  The only way I can describe the smell would be that it&#x27;s the combination of baby spit up and the smell of an automobile repair shop combined into one.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for th price. It works well and is fragrence free.</li>
            <li> Gets in to the skin quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have a greasy after feel!!! The best lotion I have personally used, no womanly after smell either.</li>
            <li> Does the job and keeps it simple, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about multiple products for different parts of the body.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it&#x27;s versatality..lotion, after shave, sun-screen.  It is good they have come up with a good product for men.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to try this product, as I have been looking for a daily use, fragrance free moisturizer targeted at men for quite some time.  The item arrived on time, packed in a smallish bubble wrap lined envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me crazy, but why in the world would a liquid product with a dispenser that doesn&#x27;t need to be popped open for first use (more on this later) be shipped in a way that affords it minimal protection?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, upon opening the envelope (which I did on my ironing board, much to my dismay), I was treated to a generous amount of lotion all over the inside of the package, all over my hands, and all over my ironing board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon further inspection of the package, I found the cap of the bottle to be quite loose, and the pump (which typically on lotions, soaps, etc., must be turned and popped up before first use) to be already fully active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I was hesitant to even test the product, as I have no way of knowing whether it is simply poorly designed or defective or if, in fact, it has been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I played with it for a moment, and discovered an additional fun fact:  The pump on this product is only able to be moved approximately one inch.  Fully to the left of this inch is off, and fully to the right is on.  With the lid tightly screwed on, there is no way to adjust the pump to face, say, the front of the bottle, without significantly loosening the cap, which I gather would be a bad idea, based on the mess I recently finished cleaning up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, the lotion itself does appear to be fragrance free, is non-greasy, and dries quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will not, however, be going in my bathroom (because of the issue of possible tampering), but rather my garbage can.  The price makes it not worth the hassle of returning the product to Amazon for a replacement or refund (and indeed, who is to say that the next time around would see better packaging). Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I am currently in my one free trial month of Amazon Prime, so I used the free two day shipping for this item.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be joining up once the month is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed, and not nearly as much in the product as I am with Amazon&#x27;s shipping job.er packaging). Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as a side note, I am currently in my one free trial month of Amazon Prime, so I used the free two day shipping for this item.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be joining up once the month is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed, and not nearly as much in the product as I am with Amazon&#x27;s shipping job.</li>
            <li> Not so great as a face lotion. Works fine as a body lotion, though. There are better face lotions out there, but you may need to spend a little more. I would recommend L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Comfort Max Anti-Itch After Shave. It works a lot better as an every-day face lotion &amp; after shave. It also doubles as a sunscreen with SPF-15.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because it contains alcohol but it ended up drying out my face and made it itch.  Went back to my &amp;#34;old standby&amp;#34;...Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm...and haven&#x27;t had any more issues.  It costs a lot more (I was looking for a bargain with the Lubriderm) but some things you just can&#x27;t cut corners on.</li>
            <li> I got this to use as a post-shave face lotion.  I love it.  You can use a lot or a little, and there is no residue after about 30 seconds.  It feels clean and fresh after a shave.  Also good on the hands, but I am mostly using this just for my face after showers/shaves.</li>
            <li> I have always been a splash on aftershave guy but I really like this.  It&#x27;s certainly different than a liquid but in a very good way.  I like it and to me, that&#x27;s all that is important..</li>
            <li> There are so many lotions out there catering to women I thought this was a nice change. It&#x27;s ok, definitely different than aftershave that burns, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my husband smell girly. It helps keep his skin soft and smooth, but this has to be used on a daily basis, no switch-ups.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, not to harsh, just right. This works really well use it after washing you&#x27;re face/ shaving, etc... I use it 10 minutes before I head out and I&#x27;m set for the day.</li>
            <li> It just perfectly does everything I want from a men&#x27;s lotion. I will definitely keep using it. The price is totally acceptable.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, A sent free after shave that adds a little moisture to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Great price on a good product. Perfect for after a shave. No scent so your after shave lotion will work without competing with another lotion smell. Feels good on your face also.</li>
            <li> I have used the whole bottle of this and I never felt I was receiving a special skin treatment. What I mean by &#x27;feeling&#x27; a special treatment is being able to feel a difference in your skin after a couple of minutes. This bottle is expensive in comparisson to other brands that do much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer using Vaseline for men fast absorbing 24-hour moisture. I use it after taking a shower since it absorbs rapidly and does not leave a gloomy feeling. With this lotion you actually feel the special treatment that the bottle indicates. Within 15 seconds you &#x27;feel&#x27; your skin absorbing the lotion treatment. Although I am sketchy about the 24-hour claim, at least I pay less for Vaseline, it works better, and even the bottle is bigger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that want a better skin treatment experience try Nivea. Make sure to distribute it evenly between your palms before applying. Men with dark facial hair like me might display some leftovers if an excessive amount is used; however, if you have a goatee facial-hair style, you can just simply avoid touching it with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Nivea feels rejuvenating, Vaseline absorbs the treatment quickly and displays it, and Lubriderm fails to create anything that separates it from the competition.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month. It does moisturize the skin, but the advertisement is worng. Its not really &amp;#34;3-in-1&amp;#34; and does not work as an after shave. I sure there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> This is one terrific product and a really great deal.  Over the years I have tried the high-end mens products from Bloomingdale&#x27;s and they were satisfactory in doing what they were supposed to do;  Keep your skin moisturized and protected.  But these designer products are very expensive and come is small quantities.  Here comes Lubriderm which is very inexpensive for a big 16 ounce pump bottle and is  a multi-purposed face and body lotion that feels great and works well.  I chose the unscented and it does not conflict with deodorants or colognes.&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this lotion is completely fragrance free. I detect a slightly unpleasant smell. Overall, it&#x27;s lotion; it&#x27;s not going to blow you away.</li>
    </ol>
