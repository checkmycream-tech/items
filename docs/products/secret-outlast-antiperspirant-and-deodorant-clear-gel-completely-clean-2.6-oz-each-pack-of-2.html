            <li>I received this product free from clearlybetterchallange.com.</li>

            <li>I really enjoy the protection I get from this antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I received this product free as part of a promotion by the brand.  </li>
            <li>I received  this product free as part of a promotion by BuzzAgent campaign.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free to test.</li>
            <li>but I felt confident all day that I smelled fresh and clean as I had in the morning.  </li>
            <li>i was excited to get this deodorant and find out what it smelled like.</li>
            <li>So while I didn&#x27;t love it, it had a nice fragrence that did last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>the Completely Clean scent right after it is applied.</li>
            <li>One twist and two swipes right out of the shower is right!  </li>
            <li>thanks Secret1!!</li>
            <li>It is fresh and not over powering.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean scent , it drys on clear no mess and lasts all day even in the heat</li>
            <li>Now that I have tried this product I am certain to continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I stay fresh much longer then before.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was quite pleased when I put the deodorant on and there were truly no white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>this product works exactly as claimed.</li>
            <li>okay,it&#x27;s a pretty stronger daytime antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant yet that hasn&#x27;t left marks on my clothes, but this one is a winner!</li>
            <li>I find that I need to use 4 clicks on the first armpit (from settling or something?)</li>
            <li>The gel goes on easy and dries quickly with a slight clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to, but it&#x27;s definitely up there with being the best.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and easily and quickly dried.  </li>
            <li>While I am not crazy about the wet feel when you first put it on, I felt it had a fresh clean scent and kept me dry while still smelling fresh!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the 48 hour protection with out leaving any white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>It works really well and doesnt leave any marks on your clothing or under your armpits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s description about not leaving and white mark.</li>
            <li>I never felt as if my underarms were becoming wet</li>
            <li>In Louisiana, we are still experiencing warm temperatures and this past weekend I went to the zoo and was in the sun and sweating, but the deodorant covered me.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant leaves me completely confident!  </li>
            <li>I was totally amazed at how it went on smoothly and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>I am dry all day and still smelling fresh at night!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Professional woman and would really be embarrassed if a mark was left&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>so when I used it, I was kind of thinking this is exactly why I use Secret.</li>
            <li>Secret has and continues to be good to me.</li>
            <li>I just love the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
            <li>I took 3-year-old twins to Yo Gabba Gabba Live, worked out, did an oral presentation for my grad school class, etc.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised as once it dries</li>
            <li>The scent of the Clear gel is heavenly too!</li>
            <li>It is a little strong, but I like that.  </li>
            <li>I received SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL&lt;br /&gt;For free in my Bzz Kit.</li>
            <li>Even as the boys team came from behind and tied it up in the last two seconds and won in overtime; I felt comfortable that I was dry and still smelled fresh enough to jump into the hugging and celebrate the win with other fans and my son.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have marks on my clothes, it really does last 48 hours</li>
            <li>really does keep my clothes stain-free (no white marks),</li>
            <li>I am absolutely satisfied with the Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel and have&lt;br /&gt;already</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly, that when I am in a rush it does not leave any wet or white marks!</li>

            <li> the Secret Outlast Clean and Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to wearing solid deoderants, and there&#x27;s a reason why I wear them - no dry time, no sticky feeling after applying.</li>
            <li> I received this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Antiperspirant/Deodorant to use as part of a Bzz Campaign.  </li>
            <li> Secret OutLast Completely Clean.</li>
            <li> Not only does it go on clear and my black shirts do not have any residue on them</li>
            <li> So I have been a solid deodorant girl for as long as I can remember....</li>
            <li> and I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com, but I am a regular user of Secret products, I have never used Outlast before</li>
            <li> It left me feeling dry with no sticky feeling even after 48 hours of testing this product</li>
            <li> it still left me dry with no discomfort of sweating, as well leaving no trace on my clothing whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a deodorant that has lasted quite this long.  </li>
            <li> Im a Secret Girl now!!:)</li>
            <li> I tend to notice a little bit of odor creeping later in the day if I am having a particularly stressful or busy workday - but NOT with Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a hair dryer to dry my pits using this del antipersperant.</li>
            <li> I put this on as I was getting ready to take my son to his final play-off game of the season.</li>
            <li> have to say, i was kind of disappointed when I received my BzzKit and saw that this was a GEL.  </li>
            <li> Weird, but true.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this particular version of Secret deodorant in the future.</li>
            <li> The deodorant lasts all day and leaves no white marks on my shirts (I wear a lot of black tanks).  </li>
            <li> I mean, who wants to put wet stuff on their pits?!?!  </li>
            <li> fortunately, it left no marks even after it dried!</li>
            <li> that once I put it on there are no more white marks!</li>
            <li> I will be making the switch to Secret Outlast clear gel from now on!  </li>
            <li> I will be making the switch to Secret Outlast clear gel from now on!</li>
            <li> This Secret Outlast Clear Gel controlled&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I also felt that when I was exercising it didn&#x27;t provide the comfort my previous deoderant did.</li>

            <li> I received this deodorant from BzzAgent. I was totally amazed at how it went on smoothly and dried very quickly. It&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s description about not leaving and white mark. Found not one white mark on anything. And it still smelled great at the end of the day. Will definitely purchase this from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to wearing solid deoderants, and there&#x27;s a reason why I wear them - no dry time, no sticky feeling after applying. I had to use a hair dryer to dry my pits using this del antipersperant. I also felt that when I was exercising it didn&#x27;t provide the comfort my previous deoderant did. I was left feeling itchy. So while I didn&#x27;t love it, it had a nice fragrence that did last. That&#x27;s a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network</li>
            <li> lasted all day with no worries and no white marks on my clothes. would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network I received this product free from clearlybetterchallange.com. I must say I love this product it smells great and it goes on clear. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks. I love that it has a nice fresh scent to it like its refreshing and clean. I stay fresh much longer then before.</li>
            <li> It is a great product as it stays beyond 24 hrs and keeps you fresh without staining the clothes.As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty wary of gel antiperspirants, but this one really does work! It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to, but it&#x27;s definitely up there with being the best.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the scent of this deodorant and the way it lasted through my workout.  I&#x27;ve never found a deodorant that has lasted quite this long.  I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Secret has and continues to be good to me. I don&#x27;t have marks on my clothes, it really does last 48 hours and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell. I have used Secret before and I will be using them again. I haven&#x27;t used Outlast before though, so when I used it, I was kind of thinking this is exactly why I use Secret. It&#x27;s because it works. I need something that&#x27;s going to work with me. I don&#x27;t like when marks get on my clothes because they don&#x27;t come out and you ruin your clothes. I need something that will last. If I have to run around, I don&#x27;t want to hope my deodorant will work. I need to have faith in it. I mention the weird smell because I can wear scented or unscented without any problems. What I don&#x27;t want is a smell that is so strong, I can&#x27;t breathe it in. The opposite is if it is unscented, which this is, I don&#x27;t want to smell a weird chemical smell. I want to smell nothing like it says. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the price. Get it on sale when you can! I would like to note that I am a member of One2One Network and I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com, but I am a regular user of Secret products, I have never used Outlast before and I will be buying this again, preferably when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear&lt;br /&gt;Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used Secret products before, so I was not sure what to expect.  However,&lt;br /&gt;after using the product I found this product is really good in preventing odor.&lt;br /&gt;I felt no odor for more than a day after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I sweat a lot and it makes odor. This Secret Outlast Clear Gel controlled&lt;br /&gt;my sweating a lot, and the most important thing is it prevented any odor coming&lt;br /&gt;from me.  I am amazed at how this product worked for me.  it left no marks on my dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Professional woman and would really be embarrassed if a mark was left&lt;br /&gt;on my dress.  I am absolutely satisfied with the Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel and have&lt;br /&gt;already recommended about it to all my friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret and Bzz Agent for my free sample.  The good: - Very easy to turn knob and product comes out easily. -Love the Completely Clean scent right after it is applied. It is fresh and not over powering. -Didn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes.  The bad: -Zero wetness protection. It seemed to make my sweat wetter. -Scent melded with my body odor 2 hours after applying. The BO just got worse and worse as the day went on. -Didn&#x27;t come close to lasting the advertised 48 hours of wettness and odor protection.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this product and it does not fit with what I have come to expect over the last 10 years of being a loyal user of Secret products.</li>
            <li> As a BZZ Agent I received for free in my Bzz kit  the Secret Outlast Clean and Clear Gel. I have to say I was totally excited to check out the product! I am often on the run with lots to do between my outdoor chores, fighting traffic to get to work where I am an aid for an elderly gentleman which requires lots of patience and self reliance to get things done. I have to say I was quite pleased when I put the deodorant on and there were truly no white marks on my clothing. I went on about my morning and finished my chores outside and was disappointed to find that there were indeed wet marks under my arms. While it didn&#x27;t conquer my sweat I am happy to report that it did lesson my body order. That being said I reapplied the deodorant again before I got on the road for my day job. I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this particular version of Secret deodorant in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Antiperspirant/Deodorant to use as part of a Bzz Campaign.  I have to admit I am a gel deodorant user so I was really pleased to try this.  And it did not disappoint.  It went on smoothly and easily and quickly dried.  I lead a fairly hectic life but I felt confident all day that I smelled fresh and clean as I had in the morning.  I never felt as if my underarms were becoming wet and I was delighted at the end of the day when I removed my shirt and there was no tell tale residue on it. My next experiment will be to try it for 48 hours without reapplying. I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be pleased with the result. I definitely am sold on Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the protection I get from this antiperspirant. Secret OutLast Completely Clean. I received free from Secret through BzzAgent. I enjoy the 48 hour protection with out leaving any white marks on my clothes. The scent is freash and nice. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product free as part of a promotion by the brand.  This deodorant is amazing!  I am hooked.  I tend to notice a little bit of odor creeping later in the day if I am having a particularly stressful or busy workday - but NOT with Secret Outlast.  The deodorant goes on nice and smooth...and for a gel formula, dries rather quickly.  The scent is pleasant, clean-smelling - but not overpowering.  One twist and two swipes right out of the shower is right!  I will be making the switch to Secret Outlast clear gel from now on!  #GotItFreeFromSecret</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from a company called bzzagent. They send you products and in return you provide your opinions and share them. I am very pleased with this product. It works really well and doesnt leave any marks on your clothing or under your armpits. I would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I received  this product free as part of a promotion by BuzzAgent campaign. It has a nice, clean scent , it drys on clear no mess and lasts all day even in the heat I really luv the smell and keep me smelling great all day This deodorant is amazing! I will be making the switch to Secret Outlast clear gel from now on! #GotItFreeFromSecretI am hooked. thanks Secret1!! Im a Secret Girl now!!:) this product works exactly as claimed. Would definitely buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I received SECRET OUTLAST® COMPLETELY CLEAN CLEAR GEL&lt;br /&gt;For free in my Bzz Kit. I was a little disappointed because it was a gel and I don’t usually like the feel of the gel and I feel like gel doesn’t work as well as a solid. But I gave it a try on a potentially stressful day. I put this on as I was getting ready to take my son to his final play-off game of the season. As I slipped into my black game jersey I realized the deodorant was still wet and I had rubbed the shirt through it- fortunately, it left no marks even after it dried! Even as the boys team came from behind and tied it up in the last two seconds and won in overtime; I felt comfortable that I was dry and still smelled fresh enough to jump into the hugging and celebrate the win with other fans and my son.  While I am not crazy about the wet feel when you first put it on, I felt it had a fresh clean scent and kept me dry while still smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> I tested Secret Outlast, for free through BzzAgent campaign,  this deodorant was super light after applying, was a little cold at first when applying, dried super fast. It left me feeling dry with no sticky feeling even after 48 hours of testing this product it still left me dry with no discomfort of sweating, as well leaving no trace on my clothing whatsoever.  I will indeed purchase this Deodorant in the future, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed by this product! I have recently begun using the new dry sprays that are on the market because I became somewhat dissatisfied with the same old products not working. This product has definitely changed my view! It lasts and lasts! I am dry all day and still smelling fresh at night! I am really glad to have found the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; in an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. i was excited to get this deodorant and find out what it smelled like. the wetness control okay,it&#x27;s a pretty stronger daytime antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant leaves me completely confident!  The deodorant lasts all day and leaves no white marks on my shirts (I wear a lot of black tanks).  The gel goes on easy and dries quickly with a slight clean scent.  The scent is not overpowering at all.  In Louisiana, we are still experiencing warm temperatures and this past weekend I went to the zoo and was in the sun and sweating, but the deodorant covered me.  I am very happy!  I received this product for free to test.</li>
            <li> So I have been a solid deodorant girl for as long as I can remember....actually since I started using deodorant. I was quite skeptical to use a Clear gel. The last time I tried a clear gel, my underarms felt sticky all day. But time has passed since then I I thought I would give it a try. I was very surprised as once it dries, I do not even know I am wearing anything!! I just love the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel! Not only does it go on clear and my black shirts do not have any residue on them but the protection lasts and lasts! The scent of the Clear gel is heavenly too! It is not too over-powering. It does not compete with my perfume. Now that I have tried this product I am certain to continue to use it! There have been so many of my shirts that once I put it on there are no more white marks! I just love it!!!! Thank you Secret!! I will not be keeping this a secret any longer!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and was chosen to try this for deodorant for free and I absolutely love it! It dries so quickly, that when I am in a rush it does not leave any wet or white marks! I haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant yet that hasn&#x27;t left marks on my clothes, but this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel that I got free from Secret through BzzAgent.  I have been disappointed in its inability to stop me from sweating, though.&lt;br /&gt;It really does keep my clothes stain-free (no white marks), but, like EVERY deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever tried, it falls short in not making my have sweaty armpits.&lt;br /&gt;That is not to say that I treat my deodorant nicely….I mean, I push my sweating to the limits.  I took 3-year-old twins to Yo Gabba Gabba Live, worked out, did an oral presentation for my grad school class, etc. under the care of secret.  All of those things made me super-sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, i was kind of disappointed when I received my BzzKit and saw that this was a GEL.  I mean, who wants to put wet stuff on their pits?!?!  The directions said to apply 2-3 &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; to each underarm.  I find that I need to use 4 clicks on the first armpit (from settling or something?) and only 1 on the second armpit.  Weird, but true.  The gel takes a while to dry, but, when it does, it really leaves no marks.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fresh and clean.  It is a little strong, but I like that.  I haven&#x27;t had body odor since using it, but, like I mentioned, i still do sweat….a LOT.</li>
