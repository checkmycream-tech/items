            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t amazing afterwards</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of difference.</li>
            <li>The warm sandalwood smell will reveal itself after your tanning session so be patient and judge the smell after you have tanned.     </li>
            <li>It was so nice to find this tanning lotion on here.</li>
            <li>I will not buy another kind.</li>
            <li>Nice cooling effect.</li>

            <li>This is by far the best one out there.</li>
            <li>Great stuff,  I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions out there, currently this is my favorite all around!!  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>its my favorite non tingle lotion</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>More like perfume than fruit like most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>i love this lotion .I</li>
            <li>But as i said ive used bronze camo many times and it has never stained like this.</li>
            <li>why deal with spending more on it with return shipping...</li>
            <li>I tan 3 to 5 times per week and love this product.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a wonderful lotion</li>
            <li>and this the Designer Skin Camoflage Bronzer is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure he would recommend it</li>
            <li>My mom thought I sprayed too much stinky perfume on, lol.</li>
            <li>I also love the cooling essence.  </li>
            <li>The product on top is from the salon, and how the tanning lotion should look.</li>
            <li>then the tanning salons around me :)</li>
            <li>I love the cooling this lotion has that most others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a perfume fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love love love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the next best to Veritas, which is discontinued.</li>
            <li>kind of a boy&#x27;s cologne type smell (I am a girly girl but enjoy that scent) but fresh and refreshing, a good scent for after tanning</li>
            <li>First bottle I bought worked really good.</li>
            <li>and 3) I love Bronze camo for the huge results ive always gotten.</li>
            <li>This lotion gave me NO results in comparison to really any good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and this is the best for the bronzer.</li>
            <li>isnt an easy thing</li>
            <li>I tan easily</li>
            <li>I tan really easily</li>
            <li>Decent price, good delivery time.</li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>so i wanted alotion that is buget friendly and tans me well</li>
            <li>When using this lotion I noticed a significant increase in color after about 3 sessions.</li>
            <li>, makes you feel clean</li>
            <li>have tried black and all the higher priced ones and this one gives me excellent color .</li>
            <li>The delivery was super fast and packaged safe and securely.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and you get a nice dark tan when you use this product</li>
            <li>The scent smells amazing , maybe after a few more trys I will be able to tell a differnce.</li>
            <li>I loved it instantly!  </li>
            <li>It spreads very evenly and I have never had any streaking or staining...just be sure to wipe your hands because the bronzer will color your palms.  </li>
            <li>Great color every time due to the DHA.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great to get over your tanning plateau and helps if you are fair and unable to tan as well as others.</li>
            <li>BUT when the lotion dries the excess lotion balls up in pieces on the skin and after every time I shower, EVEN though I don&#x27;t shower right after tanning, I feel like my tan goes away....</li>
            <li>really like the cool sensation it puts our also.  </li>
            <li>Please put a little bit more money into a lotion like Worship Me (my favorite) or Coco Deville.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fast, dark tan with a great smell.</li>
            <li>everyone reacts to everything differently but definitely take a chance and pounce on this stuff - its flippin amazing!</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for numerous years and have tried many products.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents of all time (BIG PLUS)</li>
            <li>The cooling effect is felt in the first use and you can also see a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>so i know exactly what to expect from this lotion.</li>
            <li>if it is altered then the seller most likely wont be that</li>
            <li>The product was shipped to my house pretty fast which</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice golden brown to help cover up the natural red-ish tan I get with other lotions.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash your hands or use wipes provided by the salon to remove the lotion from your palms because the bronzers will discolor your palms that do not normally tan like the rest of your skin.     </li>
            <li>NOT the real product here.</li>
            <li>And although it smelled spot on to the real thing I think they added colors to make it seem legit because after just 1 use my hands were stained</li>
            <li>It has way to much bronzer in it</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for a lot of years and would recommend this to anyone who wants a darker tan .</li>
            <li>it really works better than any other bronzer I have ever used</li>
            <li>Long lasting color, smells nice.</li>
            <li>I used to naturally tan very very well</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure you wash your hands after you apply the lotion or they will be slightly orange.</li>
            <li>yes I know staining can be normal with some bronzers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the normal tanning lotion smell</li>
            <li>and I used this my first time back in the bed.</li>
            <li>it truly offers a \\&quot;seamless\\&quot; tan.  </li>
            <li>Either tampered with/altered chemicals OR extremely old and expired.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely MUCH cheaper to purchase it on Amazon than to get it at your local tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I have bought 5 bottles of this, so far.</li>
            <li>I researched the smell of sandalwood and it is a very common scent in mens cologne, which makes it appealing for men and women alike.</li>
            <li>You will get dark quick and maintain that same tone only using it once or twice a week after you achieve your desired tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your looking to get a dark tan fast without the tingle</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If your looking to get a dark tan fast without the tingle</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way I am pale Irish &amp; German decent with freckles</li>
            <li> The after smell is not bad, have had worse.</li>
            <li> but as long as you blend the lotion in your skin it does not leave a line or anything...</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning for a while and kept my color for a long time afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else for indoor and outdoor tanning all year long.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I would definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get dark 2nd go around.</li>
            <li> However, this does not make you darker brown as expected, but ORANGE.</li>
            <li> after I get a good base tan going (which usually takes about 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> product is amazing - dont believe any of the bad reviews out there!</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s so dark</li>
            <li> Got it a little before expected!</li>
            <li> and this was about half price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to start tanning a few years ago and the lady that ran the tanning salon suggested this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this</li>
            <li> In terms of the smell of tanning lotions I have had many a lotion smell hated by my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> It gives me great color within 2 to 3 tanning sessions and doesn&#x27;t have that horrible fake tan look that some can give you when you have paler skin.  </li>
            <li> but I put on sunscreen when I get out of the bed anyway to prevent excessive exposure</li>
            <li> and it used to get me REALLLLY dark!!!</li>
            <li> I have a base tan after about a week which isn&#x27;t normal for me and with each use</li>
            <li> Seriously just nothing like the results ive always had with came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i mean STAINED!</li>
            <li> but after a horrible experience on the beach and 3rd degree burns</li>
            <li> I have never experienced what just happened to me after using this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my hands and skin are dyed orange!</li>
            <li> in the past I used this after I.already had a base tan</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in those, but you WILL in this.</li>
            <li> Because you will be disappointed and just have to buy another bottle or lotion.</li>
            <li> and this crap won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> Grrr!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> All that I have noticed is that my hands turn an awful orange color.</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite tanning lotions. It smells nice and you get a nice dark tan when you use this product</li>
            <li> If your looking to get a dark tan fast without the tingle this is a must have. Smells great has a unique cooling sensation and it does the job....its my favorite non tingle lotion</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for numerous years and have tried many products. This is by far the best one out there. The after smell is not bad, have had worse. I use this product as a daily moisturizer and bronzer. I have not been to a salon in years. I use this bronzer at the beach and pool and I get a great tan. I love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great. Best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever come across. More like perfume than fruit like most tanning lotions. BUT when the lotion dries the excess lotion balls up in pieces on the skin and after every time I shower, EVEN though I don&#x27;t shower right after tanning, I feel like my tan goes away....</li>
            <li> i love this lotion .I have tried black and all the higher priced ones and this one gives me excellent color . Im fair skinned and i tan for 3 days and ive got great color with this lotion. I work and have kids so tanning alot and money isnt an easy thing so i wanted alotion that is buget friendly and tans me well and this is it!!!!!!!!! beware you will need a towel cause it has a color that will stain hands and the cooling sensation is different to those who are unfamiliar. enjoy</li>
            <li> I used to naturally tan very very well but after a horrible experience on the beach and 3rd degree burns I started to burn just looking at the sun.  I decided to start tanning a few years ago and the lady that ran the tanning salon suggested this.  I loved it instantly!  Not to mention that Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents of all time (BIG PLUS) but also because this is a thicker lotion that you dont need to use a ton of.  It spreads very evenly and I have never had any streaking or staining...just be sure to wipe your hands because the bronzer will color your palms.  Im a bigger girl and was worried about the areas I couldnt fully reach but as long as you blend the lotion in your skin it does not leave a line or anything...it truly offers a \\&quot;seamless\\&quot; tan.  The cooling effect is felt in the first use and you can also see a difference after the first use.  I stopped tanning for a while and kept my color for a long time afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest tip - use it each time you tan for 5 - 6 times in a row (or longer if you want) and then use it every 3rd time you tan or so. You will get dark quick and maintain that same tone only using it once or twice a week after you achieve your desired tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing - dont believe any of the bad reviews out there! LOL - I know, I know...everyone reacts to everything differently but definitely take a chance and pounce on this stuff - its flippin amazing!</li>
            <li> Assuming the product is legitimate, the recipe must have changed recently. The bronzer in this lotion used to be tan, now the lotion resembles chocolate pudding. However, this does not make you darker brown as expected, but ORANGE. The dreaded effect of all bronzing agents. Please put a little bit more money into a lotion like Worship Me (my favorite) or Coco Deville. You will not be disappointed in those, but you WILL in this.</li>
            <li> NOT the real product here. I&#x27;ve used bronze camo off and on for years so i know exactly what to expect from this lotion. This is not legit. Either tampered with/altered chemicals OR extremely old and expired. OR both lol. You get what you pay for I guess and this was about half price.&lt;br /&gt;Anywhooo 1) the bottle was bloated which is a sign of sitting in over heated temperatures for way to long.&lt;br /&gt;and 2) the product itself is way darker than the actual lotion. This could be a sign of age or added chem/bronzers after they dilute it!!! Grrr! And although it smelled spot on to the real thing I think they added colors to make it seem legit because after just 1 use my hands were stained and i mean STAINED! yes yes yes I know staining can be normal with some bronzers. But as i said ive used bronze camo many times and it has never stained like this. and 3) I love Bronze camo for the huge results ive always gotten. This lotion gave me NO results in comparison to really any good tanning lotion. Seriously just nothing like the results ive always had with came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be saving money buying this here. Because you will be disappointed and just have to buy another bottle or lotion. why deal with spending more on it with return shipping... in all it ends up being 3/4 the cost at a salon. So I cut my losses and didn&#x27;t even bother returning. My best guess is if it is altered then the seller most likely wont be that helpful.&lt;br /&gt;((also ive bought it online once before different seller and it was perfect))</li>
            <li> I have never experienced what just happened to me after using this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; my hands and skin are dyed orange! my shirt is ruined too. I even scrubbed my hands off with a Lysol wipe and this crap won&#x27;t come off. Maybe I should sue the manufacturer. My Columbia jacked is ruined as well. I have pictures but I can&#x27;t get amazon to post them. This also smells like a grandmother. I&#x27;m returning I&#x27;m FURIOUS!</li>
            <li> Great color for my paler skin.  It gives me great color within 2 to 3 tanning sessions and doesn&#x27;t have that horrible fake tan look that some can give you when you have paler skin.  It&#x27;s definitely MUCH cheaper to purchase it on Amazon than to get it at your local tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I tan 3 to 5 times per week and love this product. The cooling effect is great and the smell is better than any cologne I own. This is the only lotion I will ever use!</li>
            <li> First bottle I bought worked really good. 2nd bottle seem to not have the same affect. Couldn&#x27;t get dark 2nd go around.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin orange and creased! I have used this product before but never had these results. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion for about 3 tans and i haven&#x27;t noticed any kind of difference. All that I have noticed is that my hands turn an awful orange color. The scent smells amazing , maybe after a few more trys I will be able to tell a differnce. The product was shipped to my house pretty fast which i was suprised about.</li>
            <li> Great stuff,  I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions out there, currently this is my favorite all around!!  The only one I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> Decent price, good delivery time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this it dyes you hands orange. And it will not come off. It has way to much bronzer in it</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for several months now and I have tried several of designer skin&#x27;s tanning lotions (bronze camouflage, queen, spellbound and hero worship). I am a very fair person and I have to tan in the highest pressure bed otherwise I burn and get a heat rash. When using this lotion I noticed a significant increase in color after about 3 sessions. This lotion is great to get over your tanning plateau and helps if you are fair and unable to tan as well as others. Just make sure you wash your hands or use wipes provided by the salon to remove the lotion from your palms because the bronzers will discolor your palms that do not normally tan like the rest of your skin.     In terms of the smell of tanning lotions I have had many a lotion smell hated by my boyfriend. This was the best smelling lotion out of all of the ones that I have tried. I researched the smell of sandalwood and it is a very common scent in mens cologne, which makes it appealing for men and women alike. The smell is on the stronger side but not offensive. I must warn you the smell of the lotion is incredibly different in the bottle than on your body after your tan. The warm sandalwood smell will reveal itself after your tanning session so be patient and judge the smell after you have tanned.     Overall this is a wonderful lotion and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fast, dark tan with a great smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I tan easily and this the Designer Skin Camoflage Bronzer is my favorite.  I don&#x27;t use anything else for indoor and outdoor tanning all year long.  really like the cool sensation it puts our also.  However don&#x27;t ever put on your face.. may burn.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for three years now and absolutely love it!  Smells great and tans wonderfully.  Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years it&#x27;s a great lotion he&#x27;s so dark and i&#x27;m sure he would recommend it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Got it a little before expected! It helped me build a great base tan...in the past I used this after I.already had a base tan and it used to get me REALLLLY dark!!! Kinda stinky though...unisex smell. Like the woods or something. My mom thought I sprayed too much stinky perfume on, lol. So if you use it, just go home afterwards! Lol</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and have found Bronze Camouflage to work best for my skin tone.  I also love the cooling essence.  The delivery was super fast and packaged safe and securely.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it.  So I found it online cheaper than buying it from a tanning salon.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE! It stains your hands after applying, and isn&#x27;t even the correct consistency. Notice the difference in color between my hand and my wrist.The product on top is from the salon, and how the tanning lotion should look. The product on the bottom is the knock-off tanning lotion that I bought from Amazon. The photos attached are NOT altered in any way.</li>
            <li> It was so nice to find this tanning lotion on here. It smells great and was cheaper then the tanning salons around me :)</li>
            <li> If you get this at the tanning salon, they&#x27;ll charge you a minimum of $50. Great color every time due to the DHA. I love the cooling this lotion has that most others don&#x27;t. Silicon based so applies evenly no streaks no orange.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Long lasting color, smells nice. You do have to make sure you wash your hands after you apply the lotion or they will be slightly orange. Other than that I would definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. I will not buy another kind. This lotion smells good and gives you a great tan. It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange like some do.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning off and on for years. I tan really easily after I get a good base tan going (which usually takes about 3 weeks). Haven&#x27;t tanned for a while (about a year) and I used this my first time back in the bed. I was a lot darker after one use. It does have a lot of bronzers in it so for those that don&#x27;t like that than find a different lotion. I have a base tan after about a week which isn&#x27;t normal for me and with each use I just keep getting noticably darker. It smells really good as well. It&#x27;s not the normal tanning lotion smell it&#x27;s more of a perfume fragrance. I love this stuff and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love love love this tanning lotion. It&#x27;s the next best to Veritas, which is discontinued. I&#x27;m very pleased with my results after using this product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> it really works better than any other bronzer I have ever used I have been tanning for a lot of years and would recommend this to anyone who wants a darker tan .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions and this is the best for the bronzer. You can&#x27;t shower for 2 hours after, but the bronze stays. Buy this on line, I paid $48 for this same bottle at my salon.</li>
            <li> I have bought 5 bottles of this, so far. It is my favorite lotion, it smells awesome, kind of a boy&#x27;s cologne type smell (I am a girly girl but enjoy that scent) but fresh and refreshing, a good scent for after tanning, makes you feel clean</li>
            <li> Best Color I have gotten from a tanning lotion. I will continue to get this lotion over all of the newer fancier ones! Nice cooling effect. Smell isn&#x27;t amazing afterwards but I put on sunscreen when I get out of the bed anyway to prevent excessive exposure and I don&#x27;t have the tanning bed smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I am pale Irish &amp; German decent with freckles and this gives me a nice golden brown to help cover up the natural red-ish tan I get with other lotions.</li>
