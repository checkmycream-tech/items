            <li>beautiful lashes disappear.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT a growth or nutrition syrum for lashes buy another product for lash growth and conditioning (or just use olive oil on your lashes at night like I do works great, but that&#x27;s another issue all together)</li>
            <li>LOL</li>

            <li>Love, love the stuff.</li>
            <li>When I returned for more, they didn&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li>Once it is set with a top coat of mascara it does not flake.</li>
            <li>You can add more layers of mascara,dreamlash,mascara until you achieve the fullness you desire.   </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>This is key to flawless application!</li>
            <li>This product does deliver what it claims, but you need to make sure you put a tissue under the eye while applying or</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does make my lashes thicker and somewhat longer.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff as my eyelashes are almost non existent with out any thing besides mascara.  </li>
            <li>If I go all out, many more layers of mascara, and then more layers again in the evening.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>stock!\\&quot;  :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of mascara and none gave the effect that this product did.</li>
            <li>sure that I was going to return it.</li>
            <li>Yes, they seemed to be \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and fabulous!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:  </li>
            <li>Sure, Dream Lash is messy but if you knew how to use it correctly, its a GREAT product!</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t flake or come off your lashes until you you easily wash it off.  </li>
            <li>They are easily wiped off your face though.</li>
            <li>imagine if some falls on the face, it is easily removed, it is not as if leaves anything permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have the time to go in every 2 weeks to get them filled.</li>
            <li>I am working on resolving that problem by lightly brushing with eyelash brush.</li>
            <li>This is very interesting and yes, it totally works and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>and I saw Dream Lash and purchase it because it was a lot cheaper than the original eyelash entender</li>
            <li>A year later, I&#x27;m still using Dream Lash and loving it!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I repeat the process for even more beautiful thick lashes.</li>
            <li>The TV site which carries it wanted more money and too much for shipping.</li>
            <li>Then reapply the fibers for more length &amp; volume making sure to seal with a final coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>I apply a coat of mascara then quickly use the lash enhancer over the mascara, and repeat.</li>
            <li>You need to move quickly from applying mascara to applying the Dream Las.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  are cheap and effective and won&#x27;t dry out your skin like soap.  </li>
            <li>&quot; It was then that they nice girl actually told me she used this Dreamlash, and brought it out to show me.</li>
            <li>If I am doing my quick application , I first separate eyelashes with an eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>You put a coat of mascara on, brush on this stuff and it fills your lashes right up to make them look longer, darker and fuller.</li>
            <li>Washes right off too.</li>
            <li>When applying, fibers will scatter on your face but you can either place a paper under your eye to prevent fibers on your face or simply brush it off when done as it comes off very easy.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product as long as you know what to expect.</li>
            <li>it is simply a compliment to your favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this actually added a lot of length to my lashes, but more volume.</li>
            <li>Directions have to be followed exactly</li>
            <li>I am willing to try it all if I have not already, regardless of the fact that they look longer as it is.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased diva derm fibers and I find dream lash to be a much better product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not enough of a deterrent for me, and I love the bulk it adds to my lashes.</li>
            <li>You need to apply mascara first, then the dream lash and seal it with another coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>then I apply one more coat of my regular mascara!  </li>
            <li>First, I apply the primer.</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;ll find that you still have many applications left.</li>
            <li>I bought this product first as a Groupon offer</li>
            <li>decided to do one eye at a time since the trick seems to apply the fibers IMMEDIATELY after the first coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>I did my first eye</li>
            <li>The fibers are very light and do fall off the brush; so you can end up with black flecks all over your face (they do brush off cleanly with a powder brush).  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and seems to last pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does make your lashes look very full and long though.</li>
            <li>none really work like this.</li>
            <li>gently dust away with powder brush</li>
            <li>You put it on your lashes on top of a wet coat of mascara and then seal with another coat.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to over apply or you will get the tarantula eye look for sure.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>It really does help for your lashes to look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You apply it AFTER you first apply your normal mascara.</li>
            <li>I did apply the second coat of mascara to secure the fibers.</li>
            <li>I REALLY REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li>Messy but effective.</li>
            <li>and  I don&#x27;t think is even safe to use on your lashes due to particles can get in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I bought my original Dream Last in Walgreens in the section they call \\&quot;As</li>
            <li>apply the product, do the other eye, then seal both with a top coat.   </li>
            <li>This product does work, like many have said, you MUST apply this by looking down into a mirror, not up and looking into a mirror</li>
            <li>I try to get the enhancer on as soon as the mascara is on as it adheres to the slightly moistend eyelashes better that way.  </li>
            <li>This product really thickens the lashes and stays on all day long if used exactly as directed!</li>
            <li>and it is kind of hard to get off your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I am not having time daily, but for a special occasion -- this does as it advertises as far as building lashes.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected as long as you use mascara first.</li>
            <li>I bought mine on Living Social &amp; really wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without Dream Lash</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and my eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li>I love it because it builds to become long full thick.</li>
            <li>This is the first lash enhancer that I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised by this product!</li>
            <li>As for it being a bit messy, yes, a bit, but the tiny fibers are lightweight and brush off easily with just a quick pass of a makeup brush, not a big deal at all.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it just made a huge mess all over my face.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that the product itself was dry, but I read the instructions carefully to make sure I was doing things right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The directions clearly state to lean forward to avoid getting into eyes.  </li>
            <li>The reviewers who rated this 1 star clearly did NOT read the product instructions before application to their lashes.   </li>
            <li>I try to gently pull the wand out of the tube and knock back some of the excess product.</li>
            <li>They look full, dark &amp; lush.</li>
            <li>You have to apply a primer or your mascara first or the fibers have nothing to adhere to (don&#x27;t let the primer or mascara dry and do not use old mascara).</li>
            <li>The results were not \\&quot;Dream\\&quot; lashes, but lashes that looked about what I&#x27;d get with a few coats of regular mascara -- without having to clean my face and bathroom after applying!</li>
            <li>I now will have a difficult time convincing others that they are in fact real!</li>
            <li>but, if I use it first and then, my regular mascara, I see a big difference.</li>
            <li>it is a black powder like product that clings to wet mascara creating more length and fullness, it has no permanent effect</li>
            <li>Read directions carefully and do exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li>the mess is worth the end product...</li>
            <li>I just purchased my first tube the other day from Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that people did not like the particles falling onto their face during the Dream Lash application, but this can be easily avoided by simply placing a small piece of tissue under each eye when you apply the product.</li>
            <li>a bunch of the product is wasted as you use it causing extra time with clean up.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s made of the same stuff as that old spray on hair they used to make.</li>
            <li>My regular foaming cleanser rubbed bit on the eyelashes and it came off with no trouble.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I have to wipe extra enhancer off my face if I&#x27;ve been using a new tube.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d luv to see this in a lighter brown, blue and even hot pink!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I ended up with a mess all over my face.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products to enhance your eyelashes without getting extensions or wearing false eyelashes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Unfortuantely the process is a bit difficult to explain in full by writing, but I am able to tell you at the least that this product works.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a good thing and less expensive.</li>
            <li>It may take a little practice to get this just the way you want, maybe do a few lashes at a time until you are comfortable doing the application.</li>

            <li> and it is kind of hard to get off your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am not having time daily, but for a special occasion -- this does as it advertises as far as building lashes.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected as long as you use mascara first.</li>
            <li> I bought mine on Living Social &amp; really wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Dream Lash</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li> I love it because it builds to become long full thick.</li>
            <li> This is the first lash enhancer that I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised by this product!</li>
            <li> As for it being a bit messy, yes, a bit, but the tiny fibers are lightweight and brush off easily with just a quick pass of a makeup brush, not a big deal at all.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it just made a huge mess all over my face.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that the product itself was dry, but I read the instructions carefully to make sure I was doing things right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The directions clearly state to lean forward to avoid getting into eyes.  </li>
            <li> The reviewers who rated this 1 star clearly did NOT read the product instructions before application to their lashes.   </li>
            <li> I try to gently pull the wand out of the tube and knock back some of the excess product.</li>
            <li> They look full, dark &amp; lush.</li>
            <li> You have to apply a primer or your mascara first or the fibers have nothing to adhere to (don&#x27;t let the primer or mascara dry and do not use old mascara).</li>
            <li> The results were not \\&quot;Dream\\&quot; lashes, but lashes that looked about what I&#x27;d get with a few coats of regular mascara -- without having to clean my face and bathroom after applying!</li>
            <li> I now will have a difficult time convincing others that they are in fact real!</li>
            <li> but, if I use it first and then, my regular mascara, I see a big difference.</li>
            <li> it is a black powder like product that clings to wet mascara creating more length and fullness, it has no permanent effect</li>
            <li> Read directions carefully and do exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li> the mess is worth the end product...</li>
            <li> I just purchased my first tube the other day from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that people did not like the particles falling onto their face during the Dream Lash application, but this can be easily avoided by simply placing a small piece of tissue under each eye when you apply the product.</li>
            <li> a bunch of the product is wasted as you use it causing extra time with clean up.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s made of the same stuff as that old spray on hair they used to make.</li>
            <li> My regular foaming cleanser rubbed bit on the eyelashes and it came off with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I have to wipe extra enhancer off my face if I&#x27;ve been using a new tube.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d luv to see this in a lighter brown, blue and even hot pink!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I ended up with a mess all over my face.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite products to enhance your eyelashes without getting extensions or wearing false eyelashes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely the process is a bit difficult to explain in full by writing, but I am able to tell you at the least that this product works.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a good thing and less expensive.</li>
            <li> It may take a little practice to get this just the way you want, maybe do a few lashes at a time until you are comfortable doing the application.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> suggestion to those who are not happy with it is to practice, perhaps it is a bit more tricky than average, but if you keep trying you will succeed</li>
            <li> a Q tip or small eyeshadow brush to gently remove the excess from lashes.</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as mascara.</li>
            <li> You get instant long lashes without any hassle!!!</li>
            <li> With or without the Dreamlash I get them looking large, this just makes it unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara (cheap and expensive) that promises length, growth...etc.</li>
            <li> You can make really long lashes with this product if you have the time and are patient.</li>
            <li> I wish it would come with some type of tray to catch the extra and place it back in the bottle, such a waste for it to fall on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I just want to sleep with long lashes, but&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are dramatically long!</li>
            <li> I thought the product was dry or something.  </li>
            <li> I apply Dream Lash; I let it dry.  </li>
            <li> It seemed a bit dry..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one single issue with fallout or even needing to use a brush to wipe fibers off of my face.</li>
            <li> Had a magnifying handheld mirror and it is obvious that you must be LOOKING DOWN as you apply the product, otherwise</li>
            <li> And this little bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> This is not because I have extra long lashes (perhaps a little on the longer side), but I just know what I am doing when I apply.</li>
            <li> For me, this product will remain in my makeup kit for a very, very long time!</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the outside of the box to indicate that this is a black powder that gets all over your face when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Not all duo mascara&#x27;s are the same; I use Black Radiance.</li>
            <li> several coats of it after I have let it dry for a little bit.</li>
            <li> Such a mess.</li>
            <li> For extremely long lashes, I  use Dream Lash  with a duo mascara that has a primer on one end and mascara on the other end.</li>
            <li> Work quickly as the product must be applied while lashes are still wet, once your mascara dries on the lash it will be useless as the fibers will not stick.</li>
            <li> The fibers looked like my husbands hair when he gets his military hair cut.  </li>
            <li> Nothing on the package indicated that it was a fiber or anything even remotely close to that.  </li>
            <li> not happy at all really just want to throw it away</li>
            <li> While the primer is still wet.  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li> The particles from Dream Lash stick to the lashes because the mascara is still wet when you apply the Dreamlash product.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My lashes look much thicker and longer when I use this product; almost a false lash look.  </li>
            <li> Like any other make-up, it&#x27;s temporary, so when I take off my makeup, my long,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> then start on the other eye.</li>
            <li> so one goes in the makeup drawer and the other in the purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You also need to be very careful when applying so the fibers do not get into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Complete and total fail.  </li>
            <li> When I pulled the wand out, I was shocked to see fine black fibers come out.  </li>
            <li> The lashes then look very thick and longer than they normally do with just plain mascara.</li>
            <li> Then I used my hand mirror and LOOKED down into the mirror.</li>
            <li> Again...follow directions, &amp; LOOK DOWN when applying.</li>
            <li> I have my eyelash process down to an art and am a masacara enthusiast.</li>
            <li> Then I look down</li>
            <li> I apply my mascara, then place a paper towel on the sink, bend my head down and apply the product.  </li>
            <li> I would have given a five star except for the flaking that falls down onto the cheeks .</li>
            <li> The down side of Dream Lash:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Tip the bottle upside down when you&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It comes in a bottle with a wand when you remove the wand you will see the tip loaded up with black powder stuff, shake off the excess and apply product to lashes after your mascara.</li>
            <li> Black flakes all over my face and IN my eye...</li>
            <li> It may seem like a lot of steps, but once you get the hang of it, it will take less than 3 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> I then applied one coat of my mascara of choice which happens to be Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Sumptuous Black Mascara.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other product that will help achieve the look of false lashes except actual false lashes, so read the instructions</li>
            <li> After it is applied it may look a little clumpy or uneven use</li>
            <li> It is truly messy to use.</li>
            <li> honestly one the worst beauty, and</li>
            <li> Yes it can be messy, yes it can get in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wasted money on this product.  </li>
            <li> .. received it in mail within a few days...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday since purchase because no lashes and product makes them pop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I have thin short lashes</li>
            <li> Co-workers kept asking me if I had been crying.  </li>
            <li> , a few specs of the fibers feel in one eye</li>
            <li> Really messy</li>
            <li> It does take a couple of times to get the hang of it, but after that, it takes no more than 15 seconds -less time than it took me when I was applying 4 and 5 coats.  </li>
            <li> Dream Lash is simply small black particles that you place onto your lashes using a mascara applicator (that comes with the product).</li>
            <li> What a mess this junk is!  </li>
            <li> or you will get those little fibers in your eye (not comfortable at all!!)</li>
            <li> As some have complained it can be a bit messy, with the fibers sprinkling onto my face.</li>
            <li> It can be very messy and</li>
            <li> I use Hard Candy&#x27;s fiber lash primer to prep before mascara (after curling my lashes).</li>
            <li> but that is just plain common sense!  </li>
            <li> I wondered when I took it out if mine was all dried up!!</li>
            <li> I had walked into a store, where I got the usual, \\&quot;Oh, my!</li>
            <li> and I hope you take back the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My opinion on this product is that is not good at all.</li>
            <li> If you use contact lenses not good at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive mascara like I used to.</li>
            <li> and I rubbed them which made it worse.  </li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look like they are false</li>
            <li> My hubby noticed immediately that my lashes were enhanced, but he couldn&#x27;t put a finger on it since they did not look like false lashes.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go, I am asked if my eyelashes are false, what mascara I use, if I have extensions, etc.</li>
            <li> takes some know how to apply but gives thick lashes with any mascara - look down as you apply this otherwise you will get fibers in your eye - very bad - what price beauty?</li>
            <li> Silly me.</li>
            <li> but they became too expensive</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be difficult to remove, but was not.</li>
            <li> but I did not find this difficult when I followed the instructions!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before at a retail store and was disappointed that they were no longer carrying it.  </li>
            <li> You certainly can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, try it out!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever.  </li>
            <li> It was disgusting and there is no way I would ever chance putting that on my eyelashes.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Messy but effective. You can make really long lashes with this product if you have the time and are patient. I am not having time daily, but for a special occasion -- this does as it advertises as far as building lashes. I got a device from Avon (a shield when applying mascara) to catch some of the fall off. It is truly messy to use. You have to apply a primer or your mascara first or the fibers have nothing to adhere to (don&#x27;t let the primer or mascara dry and do not use old mascara). Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is very interesting and yes, it totally works and easy to apply! I will definitely order it again and tell all my friends about this</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works better than expected as long as you use mascara first.</li>
            <li> I have read the reveiws on this product and it seems that there is some confusion as to what the stuff is and what it&#x27;s supposed to do. This is NOT a growth or nutrition syrum for lashes buy another product for lash growth and conditioning (or just use olive oil on your lashes at night like I do works great, but that&#x27;s another issue all together) This product is makeup. It&#x27;s called fiber lash enhancement it is a black powder like product that clings to wet mascara creating more length and fullness, it has no permanent effect it is simply a compliment to your favorite mascara. As for it being a bit messy, yes, a bit, but the tiny fibers are lightweight and brush off easily with just a quick pass of a makeup brush, not a big deal at all. This is an effective product as long as you know what to expect. It comes in a bottle with a wand when you remove the wand you will see the tip loaded up with black powder stuff, shake off the excess and apply product to lashes after your mascara. Work quickly as the product must be applied while lashes are still wet, once your mascara dries on the lash it will be useless as the fibers will not stick. After it is applied it may look a little clumpy or uneven use a Q tip or small eyeshadow brush to gently remove the excess from lashes. You will love this product once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> My opinion on this product is that is not good at all. I did return it because even that I tried it and follow the instructions flakes were all over and  I don&#x27;t think is even safe to use on your lashes due to particles can get in your eyes. If you use contact lenses not good at all. Should  be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look like they are false and that&#x27;s a good thing and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this dream lash it makes putting on mascara easier.  I put my regular mascara on then I apply dream lash and thats it I am done.</li>
            <li> Such a mess. Black flakes all over my face and IN my eye...honestly one the worst beauty, and I say that with eyes rolling, products I have ever bought. I don&#x27;t know why or how this junk is on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does everything it says, but it does have it&#x27;s drawbacks.  Yes it can be messy, yes it can get in your eyes.  The directions clearly state to lean forward to avoid getting into eyes.  I lean over my mirror to apply.  It can be very messy and a bunch of the product is wasted as you use it causing extra time with clean up.  I wish it would come with some type of tray to catch the extra and place it back in the bottle, such a waste for it to fall on the counter.  Bottom line...the mess is worth the end product...longer, thicker lashes!</li>
            <li> I wondered when I took it out if mine was all dried up!! It&#x27;s powder!! It&#x27;s like soot all over my face!! What the hell is this??</li>
            <li> I purchase a similiar product on HSN but it hurted and irritated my eyes a lot! However I continued to use it, hoping I would get use to it. After about a month, I was looking around The Seen on Tv Store and I saw Dream Lash and purchase it because it was a lot cheaper than the original eyelash entender I was using. A year later, I&#x27;m still using Dream Lash and loving it!  Sure, Dream Lash is messy but if you knew how to use it correctly, its a GREAT product! I can&#x27;t live without Dream Lash and I just ordered 2 bottles today. I told my family all I want for Christmas is Dream Lash!  You just got to get used to using Dream Lash and get the hang of it to truely enjoy the product! It makes a huge difference in your make-up routine!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wasted money on this product.  Must have been &amp;#34;sleep shopping&amp;#34;.  Complete and total fail.  Silly me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. You get instant long lashes without any hassle!!! I&#x27;ve tried every mascara (cheap and expensive) that promises length, growth...etc. Baahhhh...none really work like this. And this little bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it may sprinkle a bit onto your cheeks when you apply it...gently dust away with powder brush and you are good to go. I also wear contact lenses and it is not an issue. Love, love the stuff. Just wish it were easier to purchase...like in stores...not just online.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 yrs now.. it works best with new mascara... always thickens my lashes.. received it in mail within a few days...</li>
            <li> What a mess this junk is!  There is nothing on the outside of the box to indicate that this is a black powder that gets all over your face when you apply it.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s even on the market.  PS--The results were not \\&quot;Dream\\&quot; lashes, but lashes that looked about what I&#x27;d get with a few coats of regular mascara -- without having to clean my face and bathroom after applying!</li>
            <li> I bought my original Dream Last in Walgreens in the section they call \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot;. When I returned for more, they didn&#x27;t have any. The TV site which carries it wanted more money and too much for shipping. So I shopped around and found it at Amazaon.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product now that I have the hang of it.  You put it on your lashes on top of a wet coat of mascara and then seal with another coat. The first time I used it I ended up with a mess all over my face.  The fibers are very light and do fall off the brush; so you can end up with black flecks all over your face (they do brush off cleanly with a powder brush).  Now I hold a 3*5 card under my eye when applying to catch the fibers. I coat one eye with mascara apply the product, do the other eye, then seal both with a top coat.   My lashes look much thicker and longer when I use this product; almost a false lash look.  I don&#x27;t use it daily but do when I want an extra pronounced look to my lashes. Once it is set with a top coat of mascara it does not flake.</li>
            <li> You have to get the hang of using this product, but once you do, it&#x27;s truly amazing and way, way cheaper than eyelash extensions.  But beware if you wear contacts as it can get into your lens &amp; cause irritation.  Always get comments on my beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever.  When I pulled the wand out, I was shocked to see fine black fibers come out.  I thought the product was dry or something.  The fibers looked like my husbands hair when he gets his military hair cut.  It was disgusting and there is no way I would ever chance putting that on my eyelashes.  If that got into my eye, with my contacts, it&#x27;d be a nightmare. Nothing on the package indicated that it was a fiber or anything even remotely close to that.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My second refill! It really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff does make your eyelashes pop! its awesome! But you gotta watch out not to get it in your eyes and it is kind of hard to get off your eyelashes. It does make your lashes look very full and long though. If you don&#x27;t have enough mascara on your eyelashes will look furry.</li>
            <li> The reviewers who rated this 1 star clearly did NOT read the product instructions before application to their lashes.   It states that these are fibers and that you need to close your eyelid while applying to a layer of mascara. You can add more layers of mascara,dreamlash,mascara until you achieve the fullness you desire.   I love it because it builds to become long full thick. Seal with a coat of mascara at the end of the process and you&#x27;re done. Yes, fibers fall onto your cheekbone but brush it off. The product doesn&#x27;t flake or come off your lashes until you you easily wash it off.  There&#x27;s no other product that will help achieve the look of false lashes except actual false lashes, so read the instructions and you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, it just made a huge mess all over my face. not happy at all really just want to throw it away</li>
            <li> I received my Dream Lash last week &amp; had to try it out immediately! I use Hard Candy&#x27;s fiber lash primer to prep before mascara (after curling my lashes). It may seem like a lot of steps, but once you get the hang of it, it will take less than 3 minutes tops. I then applied one coat of my mascara of choice which happens to be Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Sumptuous Black Mascara. Then I used my hand mirror and LOOKED down into the mirror. This is key to flawless application! Roll the fibers on from mid lash to tip and immediately reapply your mascara of choice. I recommend a \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; formula. Then reapply the fibers for more length &amp; volume making sure to seal with a final coat of mascara. My hubby noticed immediately that my lashes were enhanced, but he couldn&#x27;t put a finger on it since they did not look like false lashes. I have medium length, sparse blonde lashes which have thinned out from medication. I don&#x27;t feel like this actually added a lot of length to my lashes, but more volume. They look full, dark &amp; lush. Be careful not to over apply or you will get the tarantula eye look for sure. Again...follow directions, &amp; LOOK DOWN when applying. I haven&#x27;t had one single issue with fallout or even needing to use a brush to wipe fibers off of my face. For me, this product will remain in my makeup kit for a very, very long time! Bravo Dream Lash! XO</li>
            <li> This product does deliver what it claims, but you need to make sure you put a tissue under the eye while applying or you end up with tiny pieces of fuzz all over your face. Directions have to be followed exactly or you can look like you have fur growing out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product does work, like many have said, you MUST apply this by looking down into a mirror, not up and looking into a mirror or you will get those little fibers in your eye (not comfortable at all!!) I used to get lash extensions but they became too expensive and I didn&#x27;t have the time to go in every 2 weeks to get them filled. I love this product, it does make my lashes thicker and somewhat longer. You certainly can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, try it out!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before at a retail store and was disappointed that they were no longer carrying it.  So I looked on line to purchase.  I love this stuff as my eyelashes are almost non existent with out any thing besides mascara.  I will and have told others about this item and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s kinda like flocking. You put a coat of mascara on, brush on this stuff and it fills your lashes right up to make them look longer, darker and fuller. Washes right off too. I think it&#x27;s made of the same stuff as that old spray on hair they used to make.</li>
            <li> I have my eyelash process down to an art and am a masacara enthusiast. Everywhere I go, I am asked if my eyelashes are false, what mascara I use, if I have extensions, etc. This is not because I have extra long lashes (perhaps a little on the longer side), but I just know what I am doing when I apply. Unfortuantely the process is a bit difficult to explain in full by writing, but I am able to tell you at the least that this product works. I just purchased my first tube the other day from Walgreens. I had walked into a store, where I got the usual, \\&quot;Oh, my! Your eyelashes! Are they real?!.\\&quot; It was then that they nice girl actually told me she used this Dreamlash, and brought it out to show me. I am willing to try it all if I have not already, regardless of the fact that they look longer as it is. So I went immediately to purchase mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am speechless about my eyelashes. I now will have a difficult time convincing others that they are in fact real! If I am doing my quick application , I first separate eyelashes with an eyelash comb. Then I apply two to three coats of mascara. Then I look down (...follow the directions and you won&#x27;t get it on your face?) and apply DreamLash, then I reapply mascara....several coats of it after I have let it dry for a little bit. Sometimes, I will do the two applications of this Dreamlash. If I go all out, many more layers of mascara, and then more layers again in the evening. Works like a \\&quot;Dream\\&quot;. With or without the Dreamlash I get them looking large, this just makes it unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Love it. I recently purchased diva derm fibers and I find dream lash to be a much better product. I&#x27;ve used it everyday since purchase because no lashes and product makes them pop.</li>
            <li> takes some know how to apply but gives thick lashes with any mascara - look down as you apply this otherwise you will get fibers in your eye - very bad - what price beauty?</li>
            <li> This is the first lash enhancer that I&#x27;ve tried that actually works on my lashes. It&#x27;s saved me tons of money, because I don&#x27;t have to go get eyelash extensions every four weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years now. As some have complained it can be a bit messy, with the fibers sprinkling onto my face. They are easily wiped off your face though. It&#x27;s not enough of a deterrent for me, and I love the bulk it adds to my lashes. They look full,longer and last until I wash my makeup off each night.  I apply a coat of mascara then quickly use the lash enhancer over the mascara, and repeat. I try to get the enhancer on as soon as the mascara is on as it adheres to the slightly moistend eyelashes better that way.  It may take a little practice to get this just the way you want, maybe do a few lashes at a time until you are comfortable doing the application. Occasionally I have to wipe extra enhancer off my face if I&#x27;ve been using a new tube. I try to gently pull the wand out of the tube and knock back some of the excess product.</li>
            <li> I bought mine on Living Social &amp; really wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it.  What a pleasant surprise!  This stuff is wonderful!  You must follow the directions for application,  however,  or you will have the power reside in your eyes.  Follow the instructions &amp; you will not have any problems!  I highly recommend this!  I will always have it \\&quot;in stock!\\&quot;  :)</li>
            <li> I have thin short lashes and I absolutely love this stuff!! Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive mascara like I used to. I use this with my Rimmel and tada! Lashes! And believe me I have tried it all!!!</li>
            <li> This product really thickens the lashes and stays on all day long if used exactly as directed! Read directions carefully and do exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but I don&#x27;t have time to do this in a perfect way, I used during the weekend or when I have enough time to do it, it needs some practice but I do get a great lashes!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products to enhance your eyelashes without getting extensions or wearing false eyelashes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It really does help for your lashes to look thicker and longer. You need to apply mascara first, then the dream lash and seal it with another coat of mascara. You also need to be very careful when applying so the fibers do not get into your eyes. When applying, fibers will scatter on your face but you can either place a paper under your eye to prevent fibers on your face or simply brush it off when done as it comes off very easy. I have been using this product for a few years now and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It does take a couple of times to get the hang of it, but after that, it takes no more than 15 seconds -less time than it took me when I was applying 4 and 5 coats.  I apply my mascara, then place a paper towel on the sink, bend my head down and apply the product.  No product gets on my face...then I apply one more coat of my regular mascara!  Sometimes I repeat the process for even more beautiful thick lashes. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises. It definitely gives a plush set of lashes. It is easy to apply and seems to last pretty well. I would have given a five star except for the flaking that falls down onto the cheeks . I am working on resolving that problem by lightly brushing with eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> For extremely long lashes, I  use Dream Lash  with a duo mascara that has a primer on one end and mascara on the other end. Not all duo mascara&#x27;s are the same; I use Black Radiance. First, I apply the primer. While the primer is still wet.  I apply Dream Lash; I let it dry.  I then use the Mascara.  My eyelashes are dramatically long! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:  When applying Dream Lash, use a hand held mirror.  Bend over and look into the mirror during application.  Your head must be in a downward position.  If you attempt to apply the Dream Lash with your head up - facing forward, the fibers will get in your eyes, on your face, clothes, etc. SO DO NOT keep your head up!!  Practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Dream Lash for over two years and I have received countless compliments on my eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;  The down side of Dream Lash:&lt;br /&gt;1. Like any other make-up, it&#x27;s temporary, so when I take off my makeup, my long,&lt;br /&gt;  beautiful lashes disappear.  Sometimes, I just want to sleep with long lashes, but&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t, because particles from the fibers will get in my eyes.  I use Vaseline to&lt;br /&gt;  remove the enhancer and mascara and I wash my face with facial cleanser&lt;br /&gt;  - NEVER WITH SOAP- too drying (lots of face products on the market that&lt;br /&gt;  are cheap and effective and won&#x27;t dry out your skin like soap.  Invest in one.&lt;br /&gt;2. The bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as mascara. Tip the bottle upside down when you&lt;br /&gt;  think it&#x27;s empty - you&#x27;ll find that you still have many applications left.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do quite what it promises but, if I use it first and then, my regular mascara, I see a big difference. It does a good job separating eyelashes , which helps make eyelashes look thinner. It seemed a bit dry..</li>
            <li> Love this product and makes me look like I have quintupled my lashes!</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised by this product! Dream Lash is simply small black particles that you place onto your lashes using a mascara applicator (that comes with the product). You apply it AFTER you first apply your normal mascara. The particles from Dream Lash stick to the lashes because the mascara is still wet when you apply the Dreamlash product. This part is critical.  You need to move quickly from applying mascara to applying the Dream Las. I recommend doing one eye at a time - Mascara, then dream lash on one eye...then start on the other eye. The lashes then look very thick and longer than they normally do with just plain mascara. I&#x27;ve tried many types of mascara and none gave the effect that this product did. I&#x27;ve read that people did not like the particles falling onto their face during the Dream Lash application, but this can be easily avoided by simply placing a small piece of tissue under each eye when you apply the product. Even if you don&#x27;t do this, all you need to do is take a powder brush and simply wisk them away. No big deal. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  Throughout the day the fibers kept getting inside my eyes and I rubbed them which made it worse.  Co-workers kept asking me if I had been crying.  Even tried putting some in my mascara and then it did not even show, it clumped.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product first as a Groupon offer sure that I was going to return it. I was also surprised that the product itself was dry, but I read the instructions carefully to make sure I was doing things right.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do one eye at a time since the trick seems to apply the fibers IMMEDIATELY after the first coat of mascara. Had a magnifying handheld mirror and it is obvious that you must be LOOKING DOWN as you apply the product, otherwise yes, the fibers will get all over...but that is just plain common sense!  I wear contacts and my eyes are very sensitive but I did not find this difficult when I followed the instructions!  I did apply the second coat of mascara to secure the fibers. fibers stayed on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;yes, a few specs of the fibers feel in one eye but I removed them afterwards with a q-tip dipped in contact solution. No big problem.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine if some falls on the face, it is easily removed, it is not as if leaves anything permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I did my first eye, I could not believe HOW GREAT MY EYELASHES LOOKED! Yes, they seemed to be \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and fabulous! I hope the manufacturer considers a twin-pack so one goes in the makeup drawer and the other in the purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I thought it would be difficult to remove, but was not. My regular foaming cleanser rubbed bit on the eyelashes and it came off with no trouble. I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS ONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to those who are not happy with it is to practice, perhaps it is a bit more tricky than average, but if you keep trying you will succeed and I hope you take back the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d luv to see this in a lighter brown, blue and even hot pink! What about sparkling for nightime use? LOL</li>
            <li> Did not work! Really messy</li>
