            <li>My husband is using the Bosley Revive Shampoo &amp; Conditioner For Visibly Thinning Color Treated Hair and was the one providing the great review that inspired my brother-in-law to change products.</li>

            <li>My hair is growing nicely!</li>
            <li>This is a really an awesome product, it really works, bosley makes a great product, awesome</li>
            <li>, these might not do you too much good...</li>
            <li>No complaints, i think its a good quality product.</li>
            <li>I am 32 and have good hair.</li>
            <li>I think we will try it for another year, then switch to something else if we still don&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use every day though because it takes a good chunk of time to devote to both shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, seems like good product.</li>
            <li>It must be good because had me order it again,</li>
            <li>Even better, they are great scalp treatments.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>I love my full healthy shiny hair!!!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t for others depends on your own hair needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; loving this product.  </li>
            <li>Really impressed with this product because I didn&#x27;t expect to see results this fast.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo but did not make a difference.</li>
            <li>I give it three stars because it is a nice shampoo and conditioner, but I do not see any improvement to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This is what Nioxin System 2 used to be my scalp tingles when using and feels clean after great stuff.</li>
            <li>It was the one that I liked the most.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair smooth, looking good, and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - I&#x27;ve used much better.</li>
            <li>The Bosley products smell refreshingly minty.  </li>
            <li>just seems to be more stable...</li>
            <li>So it seems more resistant to falling out now.  </li>
            <li>And I will order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>I think it may have promoted more loss</li>
            <li>I had yet to buy more and it was like I had forgotten what it was like to see my hair on the counter again.</li>
            <li>and I think I have lost more hair</li>
            <li>The pumps weren&#x27;t in the packaging with mine but it was ok for me since I prefer the bottles I received when I bought it at the salon</li>
            <li>Anyway, been using it for years, and I have yet to find anything that my hair likes better.</li>
            <li>But there are so many causes of baldness.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>my hair looks better and it quit falling out.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it looks.  </li>
            <li>most of all: it has helped in my efforts to re-grow hair.</li>
            <li>ONLINE so ordered more.</li>
            <li>See my review under Bosley Healthy Hair Follicle Nourisher.</li>
            <li>do&#x27;s pull more hair out but look better, another catch 22.</li>
            <li>The sooner the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about the hair growth, I think it&#x27;s there?</li>
            <li>The mint is refreshing on the head.</li>
            <li>Women and men alike comment on his handsome silver hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>to see if they have a better price.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s very affordable for a product providing me great results.</li>
            <li>I got this for my fiance as he become more and more self-conscious about his receding hairline.  </li>
            <li>I think my hair falls out more instead.</li>
            <li>but sure it will do the job.</li>
            <li>I hope my hair grow longer :)</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells better than Nioxin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a better hair system.</li>
            <li>have been using the Bos Revive products for a month or so now and have the perception that the product works better than the Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair fall out more.</li>
            <li>I have now used this for more than six months</li>
            <li>I am sure it would work better if i used it every day.</li>
            <li>so i am unsure if anything will happen better.</li>
            <li>and I now love my hair a lot more than I used to</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair feel hydrated and healthy</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I think the price is good, the bottles are pretty big.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good.. been using this Product for a while.</li>
            <li>but it is extremely strong and has an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner and though it is to early to see any results yet, it does a great job of cleaning the hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The aroma excites the senses, great for an early morning shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had reviewed this product upon my first application with raving reviews and many years later i am still pleased and grateful for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It does seem to hold my style better and my hair stays clean longer, no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I also love how the product smells and my hair feels extremely clean after showering.</li>
            <li>Also, though it costs around $20, it lasts me easily 6 months using 5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its refreshing and feels clean</li>
            <li>So far so good, we will see how much better with all 3 steps.</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo from my hairdresser it worked fine...</li>
            <li>It stopped his hair loss, and it appears to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine, and it does provide some tingling, making me think that it is helping revive hair folicles and remove buildup.</li>
            <li>and I got the fine hair from my mother).</li>
            <li>It has given me a scalp issue my doctor cannot diagnose and my hair is all falling out along with huge chunks of skin..</li>
            <li>Great for a month, then noticeable massive hair loss.</li>
            <li>He is a former user of Nioxin but wanted to try the Bosley after hearing great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>it is sulfate free and removes dht from the scalp.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very minty feeling after use which is nice for areas of my head where I feel irratation.</li>
            <li>Been a month, so far so good</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good and the cooling sensation is very invigorating.</li>
            <li>In fact, there was a significant increase in hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>however, there haven&#x27;t been any significant changes.  </li>
            <li>I have been using all the Bosley Revive for non color-treated hair for two months now and have seen a significant reduction in hair loss when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner since I noticed significant increase in shedding just two week into the experiment.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use this product because it&#x27;s fairly cheap in the big bottles, lathers well, smells good and it gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li>shampoo itself leaves your scalp feeling refreshed, clean and minty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps prevent hair loss but don&#x27;t expect to really have noticeable results until about 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>it smells nice and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This stuff works well, make sure you rinse it out really well</li>
            <li>For example, prior to using this product, I would see a good amount of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it has made my hair anymore full or helped with the thinning.</li>
            <li>Hair comes out feeling very clean after showering, it smells great, thicker hair, and no more visible scalp - I believe using this product is a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t a quick solution to your hair loss problem, because I think you have to use it for awhile to see a change.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>The conditioner really does thicken and leave the hair very full.</li>
            <li>Less hair in the drain was first good sign!  </li>
            <li>but in my case it wasn&#x27;t enough to stop hairloss on its own.</li>
            <li>and it makes me smile at the mirror now.</li>
            <li>My hair also feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>Have also changed my diet as well (no coffee or smoking of any kind) which I think has played a larger role in stopping hair loss but over all this product seems to help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to keep a lot of my hair when my friends who are using Suave grocery-stroe products have just gone bald or nearly so.</li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;m in my car, looking in the rear-view mirror, I could see the scalp on my right side.  </li>
            <li>For guys like me that are follicly challenged, this shampoo and conditioner combo is perfect for giving me the extra volume, which I think we all know is the key to balding guys not looking so bald or at least being able to hide it better.</li>
            <li>I been using it over 2 months and at first it did give my scalp a mint fresh feel but that eventually list its effect.</li>
            <li>Shampoo washes out well and the Conditioner is really the trick as it conditions well, but unlike regular conditioners that leave your hair feeling oily and weighed-down, which can rob you of volume, this one washes out relatively clean and allows for easier styling and better volume.</li>
            <li>This product is the only product I have been able to use since my transplant at Bosley.</li>
            <li>I noticed it helping within the first month.</li>
            <li>I first used this product as part of the hair restoration kit which also included the thickening treatment.</li>
            <li>Whether it helps to slow hair loss, it is still a great shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well in about six weeks</li>
            <li>After my first use my scalp was cleaner than ever.  </li>
            <li>definitely make me feel like I have more hair.</li>
            <li>my hairline is &#x27;mostly&#x27; grown back in</li>
            <li>I have followed the directions exactly without any luck.  </li>
            <li>After speaking with my stylist I decided to find a shampoo and conditioner that has been proven to help prevent hair loss - my biggest hope was that this program would simply prevent me from losing more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or it leaves a funny coating on your hair.  </li>
            <li>The volume and softness are surreal.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most hair products, all dyes, perms, straighteners and such</li>
            <li>This product has definitely made my hair feel like it has more hair.</li>
            <li>You have to stay consistent in this product though.</li>
            <li>~9 months ago that was charging 6x more(!)</li>
            <li>I am starting to get the impression there are better products out there.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this</li>
            <li>Product came exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>It does produce a tingling of the scalp and it seems that my hair has more volume so that is enough for me for now.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the products and will try next get my sons to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>And standing in front of my bathroom mirror, I&#x27;m not even kidding, my hair is actually black again because light is no longer able to shine through my hair follicles.</li>
            <li>other than that one, tiny, area that i notice, my hair has grown in beautifully.</li>
            <li>My hair is black and it was thin to point where in bright light and looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, my hair actually looked brown because of the bright light penetrating through the hair follicle.  </li>
            <li>She says her hair feels like it is falling out less and is more full.</li>
            <li>The combination leaves my hair soft, shining, and full of body.  </li>
            <li>It is a good shampoo and conditioner and a small amount</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the leave in spray conditioner because the rinse out one does not really leave the hair smooth and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>I bought the large size.</li>
            <li>the price for the large bottles are a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;TY RICHARD</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast and arrived as described.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have as much hair fall as I used to</li>
            <li>I now use thicker Fuller Hair, for over 6 months, drastic decrease in hair loss, and much thicker hair</li>
            <li>NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT COULD HAD BEEN BETTER</li>
            <li>I DIDNT SEE MUCH OF IT</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE TRUTH</li>
            <li>This may be the real deal folks.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really seems to be working my hair is thicker</li>
            <li>Been using for a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>But when I go to gently comb through my hair, it&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
            <li>After ~2.5 weeks using this 2x a day, my hair follicles feel much thicker when I&#x27;m lathering my hair in the shower</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really looking forward to give this Bosley product-line to her.</li>
            <li>Cant really notice a diffrence.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product which is the key to it working...</li>
            <li>But after using the product, I haven&#x27;t seen much hair.</li>
            <li>and I have been using this for 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Smells kinda medicineny, doesn&#x27;t seem to be preventing much hair loss but may be slowing it a wee bit?</li>
            <li>His hair has gotten thicker, and it&#x27;s much cheaper buying from here than in a salon</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is better than any other that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I felt my scalp so clean.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it actually helps thinning hair but still great product even if you don&#x27;t suffer from thinning hair.</li>
            <li>take the time to read the product description - it gives full details, i&#x27;m only telling you that - FOR ME - it worked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main purpose is to target a chemical that causes hair loss.</li>
            <li>Some older women have even tried to &amp;#34;pick him</li>
            <li>The value to your scalp is most likely the same as the value of a mint on your tongue as in nothing.</li>
            <li>My brother, 2 years older them me, and my dad are both bald.</li>
            <li>Simply put: I have more hair on my head than my brother who is three years younger.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li>Save your money unless you just want a high priced shampoo.</li>
            <li>Been using for a little over 2&lt;br /&gt;Months gonna keep trying for a couple more months</li>
            <li>I have also added the mouse and the hair spray and so far, all of the products work really</li>
            <li>I had a thin spot starting  close to hair line, the spot has filled in nicely.</li>
            <li>I do drink heavily but try to eat healthy and exercise.</li>
            <li>Even the conditioner, which those of us with baby fine hair usually cannot use (it weighs down the hair too much), was fantastic!</li>
            <li>The first couple days of using this product I was a little concerned that I thought I was actually losing more hair.</li>
            <li>New hairs are popping up along my hairline, hair seems thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li>AND I can see the wisps of new hair growing in.</li>
            <li>I have quite a bit of new hair since I began using it.</li>
            <li>I have used the shampoo BOS REVIVE 1 and the BOS REVIVE 3 thickening for a while now, have had some new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Not too much scent - just a cooling, slightly menthol fragrance that washes clean.</li>
            <li>and overall it hasn&#x27;t really done much to accelerate my hair growth.</li>
            <li>Nioxin Scalp Therapy does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>The results will be the exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I actually received two compliments on my hair during the first week of use, again without any additional products or styling, just air drying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 and have baby fine, Polish hair (I&#x27;m half Polish</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>At least this is the case with me, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a year and not one new hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>while I can&#x27;t point to this product as the only reason for it, I do think it&#x27;s a positive contributor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but certainly not Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, limp, thinning hair.</li>
            <li>but like I said it the beginning it only works for certain people.</li>
            <li>so im guessing i have to use the whole bottle to see any tiny results as far as hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>but I really haven&#x27;t seen any change in extra hair growth.</li>
            <li>each day goes far.  </li>
            <li>and i have really seen my hair grow back.</li>
            <li>conditioner makes it soft , with body and shiny.</li>
            <li>so I will be ordering another complete set (Step 1-3) as a birthday gift to her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and began noticing some hair loss a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>Naturally I panicked and began trying everything I could to maintain the hair I have.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t take any action besides this note.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to purchase in larger volume and online.</li>
            <li>I would be astounded if these products actually grow more hair, but if that happens, in a few months I will edit this review and add another star.</li>
            <li>Just like the Bosley vitamin supplements that are no different than any other cheap multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li>Got much bigger bottles here for a lot less money with super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this shampoo from the Nioxin brand because of the fact that the Nioxin brand was sold to another company and I believe that the product was changed and perhaps some necessary ingrediants were left out of the newer Nioxin product which is evidently now produced in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>But it may be a good addition to your arsenal to slow down hair loss.</li>
            <li>Bosley is a great product but very expensive in the salons.  </li>
            <li>Its a medicated shampoo, but I have grown to enjoy the little tingle on my scalp when the conditioner is left on for 5 mins.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m a little sad that I don&#x27;t get to use those sweet-smelling shampoos and conditioners that we all love, I&#x27;ll gladly sacrifice that for having my hair back!</li>
            <li>No other product, no tricks or dressing of the tresses and....</li>
            <li>(no other hair thickener has worked for me before).</li>
            <li>I notice a little shedding when using this product but the look and feel of my hair after using this product makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s same old bs.</li>
            <li>I have been using these two since early to mid yestermonth</li>
            <li>I let my mid-length, fine (now thin) curly hair dry naturally for 30 minutes and then lightly blow dried.</li>
            <li>My hair was also extremely thin and frail to the point where using any kind of hair products to style my hair, my hair would become very dry because of its thinness.</li>
            <li>when my hair began to thin around my hairline and at the back of the top of my head</li>
            <li>So far I am about two weeks in and planning on sticking with this for the long haul.</li>
            <li>After drying my hair a little and applying gel like usual my hair was thicker, firmer and held the gel better, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all thick near the bottom of my hair, but the area near my scalp and down about 1-2 inches is MUCH thicker than it was 6 months ago!!</li>
            <li>After only one use, I have no more itching, flaking, or weird little pimples on my scalp, so it all feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and these products in combo</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My husband is using the Bosley Revive Shampoo &amp; Conditioner For Visibly Thinning Color Treated Hair and was the one providing the great review that inspired my brother-in-law to change products.</li>

            <li> This is a really an awesome product, it really works, bosley makes a great product, awesome</li>
            <li> , these might not do you too much good...</li>
            <li> No complaints, i think its a good quality product.</li>
            <li> I am 32 and have good hair.</li>
            <li> I think we will try it for another year, then switch to something else if we still don&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use every day though because it takes a good chunk of time to devote to both shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, seems like good product.</li>
            <li> It must be good because had me order it again,</li>
            <li> Even better, they are great scalp treatments.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I love my full healthy shiny hair!!!</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t for others depends on your own hair needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; loving this product.  </li>
            <li> Really impressed with this product because I didn&#x27;t expect to see results this fast.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo but did not make a difference.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it is a nice shampoo and conditioner, but I do not see any improvement to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This is what Nioxin System 2 used to be my scalp tingles when using and feels clean after great stuff.</li>
            <li> It was the one that I liked the most.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair smooth, looking good, and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - I&#x27;ve used much better.</li>
            <li> The Bosley products smell refreshingly minty.  </li>
            <li> just seems to be more stable...</li>
            <li> So it seems more resistant to falling out now.  </li>
            <li> And I will order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I think it may have promoted more loss</li>
            <li> I had yet to buy more and it was like I had forgotten what it was like to see my hair on the counter again.</li>
            <li> and I think I have lost more hair</li>
            <li> The pumps weren&#x27;t in the packaging with mine but it was ok for me since I prefer the bottles I received when I bought it at the salon</li>
            <li> Anyway, been using it for years, and I have yet to find anything that my hair likes better.</li>
            <li> But there are so many causes of baldness.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> my hair looks better and it quit falling out.  </li>
            <li> I also love how it looks.  </li>
            <li> most of all: it has helped in my efforts to re-grow hair.</li>
            <li> ONLINE so ordered more.</li>
            <li> See my review under Bosley Healthy Hair Follicle Nourisher.</li>
            <li> do&#x27;s pull more hair out but look better, another catch 22.</li>
            <li> The sooner the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the hair growth, I think it&#x27;s there?</li>
            <li> The mint is refreshing on the head.</li>
            <li> Women and men alike comment on his handsome silver hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> to see if they have a better price.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s very affordable for a product providing me great results.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance as he become more and more self-conscious about his receding hairline.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair falls out more instead.</li>
            <li> but sure it will do the job.</li>
            <li> I hope my hair grow longer :)</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells better than Nioxin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a better hair system.</li>
            <li> have been using the Bos Revive products for a month or so now and have the perception that the product works better than the Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair fall out more.</li>
            <li> I have now used this for more than six months</li>
            <li> I am sure it would work better if i used it every day.</li>
            <li> so i am unsure if anything will happen better.</li>
            <li> and I now love my hair a lot more than I used to</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel hydrated and healthy</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I think the price is good, the bottles are pretty big.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good.. been using this Product for a while.</li>
            <li> but it is extremely strong and has an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner and though it is to early to see any results yet, it does a great job of cleaning the hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The aroma excites the senses, great for an early morning shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i had reviewed this product upon my first application with raving reviews and many years later i am still pleased and grateful for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It does seem to hold my style better and my hair stays clean longer, no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I also love how the product smells and my hair feels extremely clean after showering.</li>
            <li> Also, though it costs around $20, it lasts me easily 6 months using 5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its refreshing and feels clean</li>
            <li> So far so good, we will see how much better with all 3 steps.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo from my hairdresser it worked fine...</li>
            <li> It stopped his hair loss, and it appears to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fine, and it does provide some tingling, making me think that it is helping revive hair folicles and remove buildup.</li>
            <li> and I got the fine hair from my mother).</li>
            <li> It has given me a scalp issue my doctor cannot diagnose and my hair is all falling out along with huge chunks of skin..</li>
            <li> Great for a month, then noticeable massive hair loss.</li>
            <li> He is a former user of Nioxin but wanted to try the Bosley after hearing great reviews about it.</li>
            <li> it is sulfate free and removes dht from the scalp.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very minty feeling after use which is nice for areas of my head where I feel irratation.</li>
            <li> Been a month, so far so good</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good and the cooling sensation is very invigorating.</li>
            <li> In fact, there was a significant increase in hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> however, there haven&#x27;t been any significant changes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using all the Bosley Revive for non color-treated hair for two months now and have seen a significant reduction in hair loss when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner since I noticed significant increase in shedding just two week into the experiment.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product because it&#x27;s fairly cheap in the big bottles, lathers well, smells good and it gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li> shampoo itself leaves your scalp feeling refreshed, clean and minty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps prevent hair loss but don&#x27;t expect to really have noticeable results until about 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> it smells nice and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, make sure you rinse it out really well</li>
            <li> For example, prior to using this product, I would see a good amount of hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it has made my hair anymore full or helped with the thinning.</li>
            <li> Hair comes out feeling very clean after showering, it smells great, thicker hair, and no more visible scalp - I believe using this product is a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super expedited shipping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a quick solution to your hair loss problem, because I think you have to use it for awhile to see a change.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly.</li>
            <li> The conditioner really does thicken and leave the hair very full.</li>
            <li> Less hair in the drain was first good sign!  </li>
            <li> but in my case it wasn&#x27;t enough to stop hairloss on its own.</li>
            <li> and it makes me smile at the mirror now.</li>
            <li> My hair also feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Have also changed my diet as well (no coffee or smoking of any kind) which I think has played a larger role in stopping hair loss but over all this product seems to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to keep a lot of my hair when my friends who are using Suave grocery-stroe products have just gone bald or nearly so.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;m in my car, looking in the rear-view mirror, I could see the scalp on my right side.  </li>
            <li> For guys like me that are follicly challenged, this shampoo and conditioner combo is perfect for giving me the extra volume, which I think we all know is the key to balding guys not looking so bald or at least being able to hide it better.</li>
            <li> I been using it over 2 months and at first it did give my scalp a mint fresh feel but that eventually list its effect.</li>
            <li> Shampoo washes out well and the Conditioner is really the trick as it conditions well, but unlike regular conditioners that leave your hair feeling oily and weighed-down, which can rob you of volume, this one washes out relatively clean and allows for easier styling and better volume.</li>
            <li> This product is the only product I have been able to use since my transplant at Bosley.</li>
            <li> I noticed it helping within the first month.</li>
            <li> I first used this product as part of the hair restoration kit which also included the thickening treatment.</li>
            <li> Whether it helps to slow hair loss, it is still a great shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well in about six weeks</li>
            <li> After my first use my scalp was cleaner than ever.  </li>
            <li> definitely make me feel like I have more hair.</li>
            <li> my hairline is &#x27;mostly&#x27; grown back in</li>
            <li> I have followed the directions exactly without any luck.  </li>
            <li> After speaking with my stylist I decided to find a shampoo and conditioner that has been proven to help prevent hair loss - my biggest hope was that this program would simply prevent me from losing more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or it leaves a funny coating on your hair.  </li>
            <li> The volume and softness are surreal.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most hair products, all dyes, perms, straighteners and such</li>
            <li> This product has definitely made my hair feel like it has more hair.</li>
            <li> You have to stay consistent in this product though.</li>
            <li> ~9 months ago that was charging 6x more(!)</li>
            <li> I am starting to get the impression there are better products out there.  </li>
            <li> My first time using this</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as specified.</li>
            <li> It does produce a tingling of the scalp and it seems that my hair has more volume so that is enough for me for now.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the products and will try next get my sons to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> And standing in front of my bathroom mirror, I&#x27;m not even kidding, my hair is actually black again because light is no longer able to shine through my hair follicles.</li>
            <li> other than that one, tiny, area that i notice, my hair has grown in beautifully.</li>
            <li> My hair is black and it was thin to point where in bright light and looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, my hair actually looked brown because of the bright light penetrating through the hair follicle.  </li>
            <li> She says her hair feels like it is falling out less and is more full.</li>
            <li> The combination leaves my hair soft, shining, and full of body.  </li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo and conditioner and a small amount</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the leave in spray conditioner because the rinse out one does not really leave the hair smooth and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li> I bought the large size.</li>
            <li> the price for the large bottles are a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;TY RICHARD</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have as much hair fall as I used to</li>
            <li> I now use thicker Fuller Hair, for over 6 months, drastic decrease in hair loss, and much thicker hair</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT COULD HAD BEEN BETTER</li>
            <li> I DIDNT SEE MUCH OF IT</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE TRUTH</li>
            <li> This may be the real deal folks.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really seems to be working my hair is thicker</li>
            <li> Been using for a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> But when I go to gently comb through my hair, it&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
            <li> After ~2.5 weeks using this 2x a day, my hair follicles feel much thicker when I&#x27;m lathering my hair in the shower</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really looking forward to give this Bosley product-line to her.</li>
            <li> Cant really notice a diffrence.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product which is the key to it working...</li>
            <li> But after using the product, I haven&#x27;t seen much hair.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this for 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smells kinda medicineny, doesn&#x27;t seem to be preventing much hair loss but may be slowing it a wee bit?</li>
            <li> His hair has gotten thicker, and it&#x27;s much cheaper buying from here than in a salon</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is better than any other that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I felt my scalp so clean.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually helps thinning hair but still great product even if you don&#x27;t suffer from thinning hair.</li>
            <li> take the time to read the product description - it gives full details, i&#x27;m only telling you that - FOR ME - it worked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main purpose is to target a chemical that causes hair loss.</li>
            <li> Some older women have even tried to &amp;#34;pick him</li>
            <li> The value to your scalp is most likely the same as the value of a mint on your tongue as in nothing.</li>
            <li> My brother, 2 years older them me, and my dad are both bald.</li>
            <li> Simply put: I have more hair on my head than my brother who is three years younger.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> Save your money unless you just want a high priced shampoo.</li>
            <li> Been using for a little over 2&lt;br /&gt;Months gonna keep trying for a couple more months</li>
            <li> I have also added the mouse and the hair spray and so far, all of the products work really</li>
            <li> I had a thin spot starting  close to hair line, the spot has filled in nicely.</li>
            <li> I do drink heavily but try to eat healthy and exercise.</li>
            <li> Even the conditioner, which those of us with baby fine hair usually cannot use (it weighs down the hair too much), was fantastic!</li>
            <li> The first couple days of using this product I was a little concerned that I thought I was actually losing more hair.</li>
            <li> New hairs are popping up along my hairline, hair seems thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> AND I can see the wisps of new hair growing in.</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of new hair since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo BOS REVIVE 1 and the BOS REVIVE 3 thickening for a while now, have had some new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Not too much scent - just a cooling, slightly menthol fragrance that washes clean.</li>
            <li> and overall it hasn&#x27;t really done much to accelerate my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Scalp Therapy does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> The results will be the exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I actually received two compliments on my hair during the first week of use, again without any additional products or styling, just air drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have baby fine, Polish hair (I&#x27;m half Polish</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> At least this is the case with me, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a year and not one new hair on my head.  </li>
            <li> while I can&#x27;t point to this product as the only reason for it, I do think it&#x27;s a positive contributor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but certainly not Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, limp, thinning hair.</li>
            <li> but like I said it the beginning it only works for certain people.</li>
            <li> so im guessing i have to use the whole bottle to see any tiny results as far as hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> but I really haven&#x27;t seen any change in extra hair growth.</li>
            <li> each day goes far.  </li>
            <li> and i have really seen my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> conditioner makes it soft , with body and shiny.</li>
            <li> so I will be ordering another complete set (Step 1-3) as a birthday gift to her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and began noticing some hair loss a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li> Naturally I panicked and began trying everything I could to maintain the hair I have.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t take any action besides this note.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to purchase in larger volume and online.</li>
            <li> I would be astounded if these products actually grow more hair, but if that happens, in a few months I will edit this review and add another star.</li>
            <li> Just like the Bosley vitamin supplements that are no different than any other cheap multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li> Got much bigger bottles here for a lot less money with super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo from the Nioxin brand because of the fact that the Nioxin brand was sold to another company and I believe that the product was changed and perhaps some necessary ingrediants were left out of the newer Nioxin product which is evidently now produced in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> But it may be a good addition to your arsenal to slow down hair loss.</li>
            <li> Bosley is a great product but very expensive in the salons.  </li>
            <li> Its a medicated shampoo, but I have grown to enjoy the little tingle on my scalp when the conditioner is left on for 5 mins.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m a little sad that I don&#x27;t get to use those sweet-smelling shampoos and conditioners that we all love, I&#x27;ll gladly sacrifice that for having my hair back!</li>
            <li> No other product, no tricks or dressing of the tresses and....</li>
            <li> (no other hair thickener has worked for me before).</li>
            <li> I notice a little shedding when using this product but the look and feel of my hair after using this product makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s same old bs.</li>
            <li> I have been using these two since early to mid yestermonth</li>
            <li> I let my mid-length, fine (now thin) curly hair dry naturally for 30 minutes and then lightly blow dried.</li>
            <li> My hair was also extremely thin and frail to the point where using any kind of hair products to style my hair, my hair would become very dry because of its thinness.</li>
            <li> when my hair began to thin around my hairline and at the back of the top of my head</li>
            <li> So far I am about two weeks in and planning on sticking with this for the long haul.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair a little and applying gel like usual my hair was thicker, firmer and held the gel better, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all thick near the bottom of my hair, but the area near my scalp and down about 1-2 inches is MUCH thicker than it was 6 months ago!!</li>
            <li> After only one use, I have no more itching, flaking, or weird little pimples on my scalp, so it all feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and these products in combo</li>
            <li> Only subtracted one star because it (like any other hair product of this kind) has a faint medicinal odor.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much shampoo and conditioner I put on, it leaves my hair so stiff</li>
            <li> I spent hours looking in the mirror within the next few days and wondering what I had done to make so much hair fall out!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works (about a month now).  </li>
            <li> After the first couple of months we saw some little baby hairs growing, and the system does seem to thicken hair slightly...</li>
            <li> I went back to my old shampoo and now my hair is growing back and no more itch.  </li>
            <li> I stated above this will not grow new hair, but will definitely help slow hair loss.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and my hair had been getting a little thinner every year.</li>
            <li> I will continue for as long as they make these products.</li>
            <li> It might be worth it to help slow down hair loss</li>
            <li> Other reviewers of the Nioxin products have made similar comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit to get a big lather.  </li>
            <li> I did find out that you have to thoroughly dry your hair after using the shampoo</li>
            <li> I use to notice lots of loose hairs coming out when I showered but that has stopped since I began using this product.  </li>
            <li> He warned me it wouldn&#x27;t help new hair grow but would slow hair loss and make my hair thicker and</li>
            <li> At least in the first few weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed my hair improve and fall less</li>
            <li> Today, I feel the density of my hair is back to 95% of previous levels...</li>
            <li> My only problem with both the shampoo but especially with the conditioner is the thickness, which makes getting it out of the opened lid a chore; I have to squeeze really, really hard to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> And it looks like the proct should last a few months.</li>
            <li> i went on the hunt for a topical treatment without any harsh chemicals, or side effects</li>
            <li> 5 years later, my hair has grown back into place, the part is no longer wide and revealing, i no longer have to concentrate on covering up the thin spot at the back of my head.</li>
            <li> But conditioner, you have to use and let it sit for 5 minutes...thereby making your shower a slightly longer one than a brief 5 minutes or less shower.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what chemicals are omitted from this formulation that are in other shampoos/conditioners but other products clog pores in my scalp and I have developed little pimples.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nexus shampoo and conditioner but didn&#x27;t like the way it weighed down my hair and it seemed to really make my hair look thin.</li>
            <li> No complaints other than if you&#x27;re already a hairy beast</li>
            <li> It made my head extremely itchy and I noticed my hair started thinning.</li>
            <li> However I also started using caffeine shampoo in combination with this as well as minoxidil to help get extra growth going for the past month.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day for 12 years.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers were disappointed that the magic didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Did not grow any hair with this product or any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews I&#x27;ll give this disclaimer:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years due to a hair loss problem I was having.  </li>
            <li> Other people are even making comments.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work just like all other hair products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the hair is growing back, but I can see that it stopped falling off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and before Christmas my cousin made a comment about how thin my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for about two years and have slowly continued to have thinner and thinner hair with periodic scalp/crown itching.</li>
            <li> I only have a receding hairline with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Slowed down hair loss</li>
            <li> These products make my hair shiny, fluffy, bouncy, and fuller-looking, without the use of any other additional hair products.</li>
            <li> , u can see little hairs growing on my scalp and the shedding has decreased considerably.</li>
            <li> so I am concerned by a slight tightening I feel in the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> and I truly believe I see less hair falling out.</li>
            <li> now I see less hair loss</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this shampoo mainly because of price</li>
            <li> The little tingle from the conditioner is probably just menthol to make you think it is doing something beneficial.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with little hope.</li>
            <li> I am having trouble with thinning hair/balding.  </li>
            <li> I order this product for my sister every few months.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a few years now and i will never use another shampoo/conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I will follow up after a few months with a progress report</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been noticing a few regrowths.</li>
            <li> but my hair has gotten visibly thin over the last 2 years - it runs in my family.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I am not sold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my hair appears fuller and it&#x27;s thicker.</li>
            <li> Bought these 2 with some minoxidil from Kirkland and they stopped my hair loss after a few days.</li>
            <li> It worked well and did not leave my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Hard to say, not super noticeable.</li>
            <li> I must use very little.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> No more am I seeing hair in my hands when I lather my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really no better or worse than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> ; the one small thin spot left, i merely sprinkle in a hair filiment and problem</li>
            <li> Makes my hair hard and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Just one thing you have to be patient and give at least 3 months to start noticing the improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has not promoted the return of lost hair, but does appear to slow or stop the loss of hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner added to the thick feeling</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of products some very expensive products but yours is the only one that works.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive than a B&amp;M store</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband whose hair began to thin and scalp was visable through his hair.  </li>
            <li> mom has extremely thin hair and her scalp is visible.</li>
            <li> recommend you try this if you have thin or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> (serious!).</li>
            <li> This particular type, however, is horrible.</li>
            <li> it feels natural and at worst its not contributing the damaging the hair.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for it to not work.  </li>
            <li> I will use it just because I&#x27;m afraid not to.  </li>
            <li> , conditioner aand the thickening treatment in order for it not to feel greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> People with hand pain or stiffness might find it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a senior citizen, it&#x27;s very difficult.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is just a bad bottle, but regardless, it is going in the garbage</li>
            <li> I at one point had really bad alopecia aretia which was causing me bald spots even on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still shocked it works</li>
            <li> Horrible product</li>
            <li> and I started loosing hair terribly about 6 months ago.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change yet but I&#x27;ll be patient</li>
            <li> So far so good! My hair is growing nicely! And I like the tingling feeling on my scalp!</li>
            <li> Been using these productions for the last year.  No complaints other than if you&#x27;re already a hairy beast, these might not do you too much good...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - I&#x27;ve used much better.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast and arrived as described. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner and though it is to early to see any results yet, it does a great job of cleaning the hair thoroughly. The conditioner really does thicken and leave the hair very full. And it looks like the proct should last a few months.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t having any hair loss issues until I started using this. I stopped using this product. It made my head extremely itchy and I noticed my hair started thinning. I would not recommend this product. I went back to my old shampoo and now my hair is growing back and no more itch.  Horrible product</li>
            <li> It’s the product as described!</li>
            <li> The Bosley products smell refreshingly minty.  It does make your hair appear to be thicker but it doesn&#x27;t actually make your hair grow in thicker.  I will use it just because I&#x27;m afraid not to.  It does seem to hold my style better and my hair stays clean longer, no greasy feel.  I did find out that you have to thoroughly dry your hair after using the shampoo, conditioner aand the thickening treatment in order for it not to feel greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> Been using this about 6 months now and I don&#x27;t have as much hair fall as I used to but I really haven&#x27;t seen any change in extra hair growth. It might be worth it to help slow down hair loss but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it solely to regrow hair. But it may be a good addition to your arsenal to slow down hair loss. I&#x27;ve also been using biotin &amp; silica supplements... but 6 months later and I don&#x27;t see any increased hair loss... just seems to be more stable... when I pull my fingers through my hair only one hair falls out, it used to be about 10 or so at a time! So it seems more resistant to falling out now.  Update... After 1 year my hair looks blacker, thicker and fuller. However I also started using caffeine shampoo in combination with this as well as minoxidil to help get extra growth going for the past month. But overall I think Bosley has helped to prevent further hair fall. And I will order more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Have been using this hair product for over a month and nothing as a matter of fact I think it may have promoted more loss</li>
            <li> Great for a month, then noticeable massive hair loss. As with another salon brand, manufacturing moved and quality suffered. I now use thicker Fuller Hair, for over 6 months, drastic decrease in hair loss, and much thicker hair</li>
            <li> Has helped a great deal with the sensitivity I have experienced since my pregnancy on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This product is the only product I have been able to use since my transplant at Bosley. I have been using it every other day for 12 years. I am not sure what chemicals are omitted from this formulation that are in other shampoos/conditioners but other products clog pores in my scalp and I have developed little pimples. Never with this product</li>
            <li> Nice product. Seems to work but wish that it came with scalp treatment like the starter kits.</li>
            <li> This product did not help with hair regrowth in any way. In fact, there was a significant increase in hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Hair seems thicker after use!</li>
            <li> Works for some. Doesn&#x27;t for others depends on your own hair needs. My hair stylist friend told me about this shampoo and then on my next visit actually handed me the 3 piece starter kit. I noticed it helping within the first month. After about 3months my starter kit was gone. I had yet to buy more and it was like I had forgotten what it was like to see my hair on the counter again. I was like wait wha?! As soon as I stopping using my hair went back to it&#x27;s same old bs. Hopefully my order will arrive shortly and I can start taking care of my hair. Great product but like I said it the beginning it only works for certain people. It&#x27;s main purpose is to target a chemical that causes hair loss. If that chemical isn&#x27;t the reason you are losing your hair then this won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Two weeks into it and I think I have lost more hair</li>
            <li> Great Product with over night shipping</li>
            <li> I first used this product as part of the hair restoration kit which also included the thickening treatment. Although it may be my imagination, I feel like the products work. The shampoo and conditioner have a minty smell and feel so even if it doesn&#x27;t restore hair it feels natural and at worst its not contributing the damaging the hair. Overall I like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a great lather and cleanses the hair well.  The aroma excites the senses, great for an early morning shower.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a must have.  I feel it penetrate my scalp, and leaves a soothing sensation.  Like the shampoo, it has a great aroma.  The combination leaves my hair soft, shining, and full of body.  There is no soapy residue, rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;It has not promoted the return of lost hair, but does appear to slow or stop the loss of hair.  Whether it helps to slow hair loss, it is still a great shampoo and conditioner.  Price on Amazon was a bargain compared to in-store prices.</li>
            <li> Hubby only uses Bosley since the hair dressers told him the benefits. He loves this brand and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> i have been used this product it&#x27;s great.highly recommend to every one that want there fully hairs back.thx</li>
            <li> I am having trouble with thinning hair/balding.  My hairstylist recomended these two products along with the hair mousse.  He warned me it wouldn&#x27;t help new hair grow but would slow hair loss and make my hair thicker and it does both these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal compared to what the salon charges.  The pumps weren&#x27;t in the packaging with mine but it was ok for me since I prefer the bottles I received when I bought it at the salon and I just refil those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be used with the mousse for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I stated above this will not grow new hair, but will definitely help slow hair loss.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well in about six weeks</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law is raving about this product after asking me to order it for him when he couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. He is a former user of Nioxin but wanted to try the Bosley after hearing great reviews about it. My husband is using the Bosley Revive Shampoo &amp; Conditioner For Visibly Thinning Color Treated Hair and was the one providing the great review that inspired my brother-in-law to change products.</li>
            <li> After my first use my scalp was cleaner than ever.  All of the oils and product residue was cleaned off.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I felt my scalp so clean.  After drying my hair a little and applying gel like usual my hair was thicker, firmer and held the gel better, if that makes sense.  I am not counting on this product to regrow any hair but I have seen a big reduction in hair loss by checking my palms after I style.  So far I am about two weeks in and planning on sticking with this for the long haul.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner regularly, for the last year or so. No complaints, i think its a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Great vegan products with none of the junk that makes our hair fall.  Very effective however this is a way of life/commitment.  I&#x27;ve been using for about five years now.  Less hair in the drain was first good sign!  I love my full healthy shiny hair!!!</li>
            <li> I order this product for my sister every few months.  It is less expensive than a B&amp;M store and she is happy with the package when she gets it. She says her hair feels like it is falling out less and is more full. She gets both the shampoo and conditioner.  We have been ordering the 32 ounce containers but I am thinking about looking into the gallons for her next time.</li>
            <li> For guys like me that are follicly challenged, this shampoo and conditioner combo is perfect for giving me the extra volume, which I think we all know is the key to balding guys not looking so bald or at least being able to hide it better. Not too much scent - just a cooling, slightly menthol fragrance that washes clean. Shampoo washes out well and the Conditioner is really the trick as it conditions well, but unlike regular conditioners that leave your hair feeling oily and weighed-down, which can rob you of volume, this one washes out relatively clean and allows for easier styling and better volume. At least this is the case with me, and I have very fine hair. Anyway, been using it for years, and I have yet to find anything that my hair likes better.</li>
            <li> Decelerated hair loss !</li>
            <li> I bought these after about 9 months of using the products (in the introductory size). I like the product a lot. I have thin fine hair and these products in combo definitely make me feel like I have more hair. Maybe I do-- I don&#x27;t know. I can&#x27;t comment on it producing hair growth. Some reviewers were disappointed that the magic didn&#x27;t happen. But there are so many causes of baldness. One product is not going to cure every person&#x27;s problem. Please do note that the instructions say to leave each product on the head for specific periods of time. The bottles are, as I mentioned, rather immense. I saved the two dainty bottles from the intro package, and refill them from these elephantine bottles (probably for use in a salon. The product is so concentrated that it seems to last forever. I&#x27;ll get back to you in about 3 years (serious!).</li>
            <li> I was losing my hair when my daughter told me about this product by Bosley.  I love it my hair looks better and it quit falling out.  I also love how it looks.  I tried a lot of products some very expensive products but yours is the only one that works.  I thank my daughter Susan and I thank you Bosley for this great hair product.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent hair loss but don&#x27;t expect to really have noticeable results until about 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT COULD HAD BEEN BETTER IT DOES HAVE A GREAT SENT OF SMELL BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY WORKING I DIDNT SEE MUCH OF IT</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a few years now and i will never use another shampoo/conditioner again. when my hair began to thin around my hairline and at the back of the top of my head i went on the hunt for a topical treatment without any harsh chemicals, or side effects - THIS is it. it is sulfate free and removes dht from the scalp. it smells nice and leaves my hair soft and shiny. most of all: it has helped in my efforts to re-grow hair. 5 years later, my hair has grown back into place, the part is no longer wide and revealing, i no longer have to concentrate on covering up the thin spot at the back of my head. my hairline is &#x27;mostly&#x27; grown back in; the one small thin spot left, i merely sprinkle in a hair filiment and problem all gone. other than that one, tiny, area that i notice, my hair has grown in beautifully. i had reviewed this product upon my first application with raving reviews and many years later i am still pleased and grateful for this wonderful product. take the time to read the product description - it gives full details, i&#x27;m only telling you that - FOR ME - it worked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly a year and not one new hair on my head.  I have followed the directions exactly without any luck.  It is a good shampoo and conditioner and a small amount each day goes far.  But its a hoax if you think it will aid in hair growth.</li>
            <li> After buying the travel size...I am so happy with how my hair looks and feels. ..I bought the large size.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo from my hairdresser it worked fine...was cheaper ONLINE so ordered more.It has given me a scalp issue my doctor cannot diagnose and my hair is all falling out along with huge chunks of skin..the shampoo is not even the same color...what is in my bottle!!! ???? HELP!! ABSOLUTE TRUTH</li>
            <li> Exactlybas described with on time shippijg.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually helps thinning hair but still great product even if you don&#x27;t suffer from thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and before Christmas my cousin made a comment about how thin my hair looked. I spent hours looking in the mirror within the next few days and wondering what I had done to make so much hair fall out! After speaking with my stylist I decided to find a shampoo and conditioner that has been proven to help prevent hair loss - my biggest hope was that this program would simply prevent me from losing more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it did was give me my hair back!! I can FEEL the thickness back in my hair after only 6 months!! Now I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all thick near the bottom of my hair, but the area near my scalp and down about 1-2 inches is MUCH thicker than it was 6 months ago!! And everyone has noticed! While I&#x27;m a little sad that I don&#x27;t get to use those sweet-smelling shampoos and conditioners that we all love, I&#x27;ll gladly sacrifice that for having my hair back!</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, make sure you rinse it out really well or it leaves a funny coating on your hair.  But I noticed a big difference in the volume of my hair.  The problem is I&#x27;m allergic to something in it and can&#x27;t use it.  See my review under Bosley Healthy Hair Follicle Nourisher.</li>
            <li> I have been losing my locks for 3 years and it&#x27;s come to the point I can&#x27;t stand looking in the mirror. Up do&#x27;s pull more hair out but look better, another catch 22. After yet another sob story today my Mama gave me her Bosley trial kit and without trying it I read your reviews and ordered a lot of product because I miss my hair. So now I&#x27;ve washed, conditioned and applied the foam thickening treatment. I let my mid-length, fine (now thin) curly hair dry naturally for 30 minutes and then lightly blow dried. No other product, no tricks or dressing of the tresses and....it is FABULOUS!!!!! I have my hair back and I&#x27;m not kidding. The volume and softness are surreal. I am allergic to most hair products, all dyes, perms, straighteners and such so I am concerned by a slight tightening I feel in the scalp. But no telltale itching, redness or burning. This may be the real deal folks. I will follow up after a few months with a progress report but tonight I feel and look like I did at 34 not my current 44. If you are thinning, TRY THIS PRODUCT!!!! The sooner the better. See ya soon with an update!</li>
            <li> This product has definitely made my hair feel like it has more hair. I&#x27;m not so sure about the hair growth, I think it&#x27;s there? we&#x27;ll have to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I think is that it has created some scalp acne? At least in the first few weeks of usage. It&#x27;s still there and I&#x27;m not sure. The mint is refreshing on the head.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 months and i have really seen my hair grow back. It works very well.</li>
            <li> This is what Nioxin System 2 used to be my scalp tingles when using and feels clean after great stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband whose hair began to thin and scalp was visable through his hair.  It stopped his hair loss, and it appears to be working just fine.  (Three years and counting...)  Women and men alike comment on his handsome silver hair.  Some older women have even tried to &amp;#34;pick him up&amp;#34; so to speak... (he&#x27;s 53) ... &amp; the men always say &amp;#34;Wish I had hair like that, come to think of it, wish I had hair...  He does also use a generic of rogain on his scalp...  hope this helps</li>
            <li> with big time marketing to people hoping to find some help with hair loss. Really no better or worse than any other shampoo. Just like the Bosley vitamin supplements that are no different than any other cheap multi-vitamin. The little tingle from the conditioner is probably just menthol to make you think it is doing something beneficial. The value to your scalp is most likely the same as the value of a mint on your tongue as in nothing. Nioxin Scalp Therapy does exactly the same thing. Nothing. I have used this product daily for about two years and have slowly continued to have thinner and thinner hair with periodic scalp/crown itching. I have continued to use this product because it&#x27;s fairly cheap in the big bottles, lathers well, smells good and it gets my hair clean. If you don&#x27;t expect it to do anything but that, you may like it, or just buy big jugs of Suave Shampoo and Conditioner at Wal-Mart for a couple of bucks. The results will be the exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I think the price is good, the bottles are pretty big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself leaves your scalp feeling refreshed, clean and minty.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner makes it soft , with body and shiny.I definitely noticed my hair improve and fall less but in my case it wasn&#x27;t enough to stop hairloss on its own.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is better than any other that I have tried. I have baby fine, limp, thinning hair. These products make my hair shiny, fluffy, bouncy, and fuller-looking, without the use of any other additional hair products. Even better, they are great scalp treatments. After only one use, I have no more itching, flaking, or weird little pimples on my scalp, so it all feels better and looks better. I actually received two compliments on my hair during the first week of use, again without any additional products or styling, just air drying.  My only problem with both the shampoo but especially with the conditioner is the thickness, which makes getting it out of the opened lid a chore; I have to squeeze really, really hard to get it out of the bottle. People with hand pain or stiffness might find it very difficult to use. It helps to shake up the bottle before use (like catchup!), and to add some water as soon as some of the products are used and there is space, then shake it up to mix.  I would be astounded if these products actually grow more hair, but if that happens, in a few months I will edit this review and add another star.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Always use this stuff and Amazon is the cheapest place to buy it.</li>
            <li> Feels great - no clue if it reduces thinning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really seems to be working my hair is thicker and I&#x27;ve been noticing a few regrowths. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Thicker hair after 3 months and I already used up the starter kit I ordered so his is my reorder.  I&#x27; loving this product.  See my review of the Revive Thickening Treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half now. And I have noticed a stop in my thinning hair and volume coming back. You have to stay consistent in this product though. Muse step 1 and 2 every time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to friends...</li>
            <li> I have used Bosley shampoo and conditioner before for color treated hair (even though mine is not colored). It worked well and did not leave my hair sticky or stiff. This particular type, however, is horrible. No matter how much shampoo and conditioner I put on, it leaves my hair so stiff I think it&#x27;s going to pull out. The smell is fine, and it does provide some tingling, making me think that it is helping revive hair folicles and remove buildup. But when I go to gently comb through my hair, it&#x27;s a nightmare. Maybe this is just a bad bottle, but regardless, it is going in the garbage and I&#x27;m going back to the Bosley for color treated I got from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product. I initially learned of this product&#x27;s existence from another online retailer ~9 months ago that was charging 6x more(!) in terms of $ per ounce and for 9 months, could never get myself to click their &amp;#34;submit order&amp;#34; button. It never occurred for me until 3 weeks ago to check with Amazon (who would&#x27;ve thought Amazon would carry shampoo?) to see if they have a better price. After seeing Amazon&#x27;s price, I purchased it in an instant without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~2.5 weeks later after using this product and all I have to say is &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34;. I have to disclose however, that I do shower 2x a day and also use Step# 3 (also from same seller on Amazon) that was purchased separately so perhaps that&#x27;s why I saw results faster? I&#x27;m only 29 but my hair has gotten visibly thin over the last 2 years - it runs in my family. Every time I&#x27;m in my car, looking in the rear-view mirror, I could see the scalp on my right side.  My hair was also extremely thin and frail to the point where using any kind of hair products to style my hair, my hair would become very dry because of its thinness. My hair is black and it was thin to point where in bright light and looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, my hair actually looked brown because of the bright light penetrating through the hair follicle.  After ~2.5 weeks using this 2x a day, my hair follicles feel much thicker when I&#x27;m lathering my hair in the shower (I&#x27;d say it is probably 50% thicker).  No more am I seeing hair in my hands when I lather my hair in the shower. And standing in front of my bathroom mirror, I&#x27;m not even kidding, my hair is actually black again because light is no longer able to shine through my hair follicles. Looking on the sides, I can also no longer see my scalp. Really impressed with this product because I didn&#x27;t expect to see results this fast. My hair line has also receded so hopefully, after using this for a longer period of time, that will improve as well. Looking at myself in the mirror now, I feel ~3 years younger and it makes me smile at the mirror now. I also love how the product smells and my hair feels extremely clean after showering. At this price for two 33-oz bottles of shampoo &amp; conditioner that will last me atleast 6-9 months, I think it&#x27;s very affordable for a product providing me great results. Hair comes out feeling very clean after showering, it smells great, thicker hair, and no more visible scalp - I believe using this product is a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has extremely thin hair and her scalp is visible. Her birthday is coming up so I will be ordering another complete set (Step 1-3) as a birthday gift to her. To-date, she told me she hasn&#x27;t found a product that worked for her so I&#x27;m really looking forward to give this Bosley product-line to her.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps my hair to grow and thicken up</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now. New hairs are popping up along my hairline, hair seems thicker and fuller. My hair isn&#x27;t falling out in the shower anymore as well!</li>
            <li> Pretty good.. been using this Product for a while.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, but plenty of shampoo to use...</li>
            <li> Did not grow any hair with this product or any other product I have tried. It is a nice shampoo but did not make a difference. I have also tried these products.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C5URYY&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Nioxin-System-Cleanser-Scalp-Therapy/dp/B000TMM2PU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1419374838&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;Nioxin+Cleanser%2C+System+2&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZHLI/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;I am going to get the Bosley product again. It was the one that I liked the most. I feel they did keep my hair from falling out but did I did not noticed any hair growth. I did a lot of research. I only have a receding hairline with thick hair. I am 32 and have good hair. My brother, 2 years older them me, and my dad are both bald. I am terrified. lol.</li>
            <li> These last forever (almost a year it feels).  I did start to see thicker hair after a couple of months.  There was a lull where it seemed to stop...but then it started to pick up again around the 6 month mark.  Today, I feel the density of my hair is back to 95% of previous levels...I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Cant really notice a diffrence.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this shampoo mainly because of price and if it would work or not.  Reading other reviews I&#x27;ll give this disclaimer:  There&#x27;s a chance this will not work for you.  I&#x27;m 30 years old and began noticing some hair loss a couple years ago.  Naturally I panicked and began trying everything I could to maintain the hair I have.  The shampoo and conditioner has given me mixed results.  I&#x27;ve definitely not grown any hair back, but I have noticed it has slowed or stopped any hair loss.  I use to notice lots of loose hairs coming out when I showered but that has stopped since I began using this product.  Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t contain any sodium lauryl sulfate, a chemical thought to cause cancer and irritation.  Also, though it costs around $20, it lasts me easily 6 months using 5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you try this if you have thin or thinning hair.  You have nothing to lose and there&#x27;s a very good chance it could work for you.</li>
            <li> Its refreshing and feels clean but i have only used maybe one third of the bottle so im guessing i have to use the whole bottle to see any tiny results as far as hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> No pumps were shipped with the package as advertised. I won&#x27;t take any action besides this note. hopefully for next time.</li>
            <li> I been using it over 2 months and at first it did give my scalp a mint fresh feel but that eventually list its effect.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance as he become more and more self-conscious about his receding hairline.  He has been on the Bosley system for a year.  After the first couple of months we saw some little baby hairs growing, and the system does seem to thicken hair slightly... however, there haven&#x27;t been any significant changes.  I think we will try it for another year, then switch to something else if we still don&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look thicker &amp; healthier</li>
            <li> I have been using all the Bosley Revive for non color-treated hair for two months now and have seen a significant reduction in hair loss when I shampoo my hair. I will continue for as long as they make these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I am not sold.  I am starting to get the impression there are better products out there.  I give it three stars because it is a nice shampoo and conditioner, but I do not see any improvement to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again!!!!!! This is a really an awesome product, it really works, bosley makes a great product, awesome</li>
            <li> Bosley is a great product but very expensive in the salons.  Got much bigger bottles here for a lot less money with super fast shipping.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Product had not help with any hair loss. Been using for a little over 2&lt;br /&gt;Months gonna keep trying for a couple more months</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me!  Way too expensive for it to not work.  I did not  care for the fragrance of it.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 8 months now and it helps maintain the hair I have, but it has to be used in conjunction with the folical energizer.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for a excellent product at a great price and delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and nothing has happened. I haven&#x27;t seen any change. I think my hair falls out more instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using theses products for about 6 months.I had a thin spot starting  close to hair line, the spot has filled in nicely.My hair also feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping stop hair loss but it is extremely strong and has an overwhelming smell. It gave me a hearache. I must use very little.</li>
            <li> Works like advertised. Great price on amazon compared to salon prices!!</li>
            <li> like the way it makes my hair feel. only 2 weeks in but sure it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Slowed down hair loss</li>
            <li> Makes my hair hard and unmanageable.  Haven&#x27;t noticed improvement in hair.</li>
            <li> My first time using this and it burn n feels great. I hope my hair grow longer :)</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product which is the key to it working... Please know it does not work as or at all for some of its users. WHY I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product works well and I continue to use it... the price for the large bottles are a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;TY RICHARD</li>
            <li> I like the way the product feels on the scalp and hair!  My husband no longer experience a flaky scalp!</li>
            <li> I order NON TREATED COLOR HAIR shampoo and conditioner, they shipped me TREATED COLOR HAIR products. I could not return because there is some restriction for shampoo or chemical products so I have to eat it. I would not order anything again from that shipper.</li>
            <li> Super expedited shipping.  Product came exactly as specified. Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> I waited to write the review. I have been using the product for 3 weeks now. I have been testing the drain and hair brush to see if I am seeing any results and I am happy to say I am! You can definitely feel the tingling on your scalp and see a difference in the time frame stated. Purchasing through Amazon saves! Also cheaper than Nexium sold at salons and in much larger quantity!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bosley Revive Shampoo and Conditioner set for awhile and I truly believe I see less hair falling out. For example, prior to using this product, I would see a good amount of hair in the shower. But after using the product, I haven&#x27;t seen much hair. I also feel that my hair is also thicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a quick solution to your hair loss problem, because I think you have to use it for awhile to see a change. The downside is you should follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use the shampoo and let it sit for 1 minute. But conditioner, you have to use and let it sit for 5 minutes...thereby making your shower a slightly longer one than a brief 5 minutes or less shower.</li>
            <li> Simply put: I have more hair on my head than my brother who is three years younger.  Use it daily!</li>
            <li> Works well. I like the way it smells better than Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I am 27 and I started loosing hair terribly about 6 months ago. I at one point had really bad alopecia aretia which was causing me bald spots even on the sides of my head. I do drink heavily but try to eat healthy and exercise. These are definitely variables in my treatment. I have been also using Minoxidil for about 6 months, get cortisone shots about every 6 weeks, and also occasionally will use a topical coritsone cream. I started using this about 2 weeks ago and overall it hasn&#x27;t really done much to accelerate my hair growth. I used to use Nexus shampoo and conditioner but didn&#x27;t like the way it weighed down my hair and it seemed to really make my hair look thin. This product is different. It leaves a very minty feeling after use which is nice for areas of my head where I feel irratation. I notice a little shedding when using this product but the look and feel of my hair after using this product makes it worth it. I would probably buy again because I like the product but I don&#x27;t think it has made my hair anymore full or helped with the thinning. At this point in my life it is all just maintainence.</li>
            <li> I am 30 but was losing my hair as a side effect of a medication. It wasn&#x27;t coming back even after I stopped the medication. I was losing handfuls of hair a day. The first couple days of using this product I was a little concerned that I thought I was actually losing more hair. BUT now that I have been using it for about a month and I can see a difference. I am not losing hair AND I can see the wisps of new hair growing in.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and I have been using this for 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed much. Maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works (about a month now).  I will tell you that the bottles weigh too much.&lt;br /&gt;Being a senior citizen, it&#x27;s very difficult.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a better hair system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 8 months. I have quite a bit of new hair since I began using it. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting shampoo for regular hair and instead I received the shampoo for treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months and I have to say that I&#x27;m very pleased, u can see little hairs growing on my scalp and the shedding has decreased considerably. I will post some pics later to show the difference. Just one thing you have to be patient and give at least 3 months to start noticing the improvement.</li>
            <li> I think after about a month now I see less hair loss and it seems thicker... LIKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using it and update as time goes on...</li>
            <li> Made hair fall out.  Maybe because it overly dries the hair?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years due to a hair loss problem I was having.  Hair loss is no longer an issue for me and this shampoo and conditioner are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was an issue, however.  The shampoo had leaked during shipment.</li>
            <li> Last&#x27;s Forever,great bargain...</li>
            <li> I switched to this shampoo from the Nioxin brand because of the fact that the Nioxin brand was sold to another company and I believe that the product was changed and perhaps some necessary ingrediants were left out of the newer Nioxin product which is evidently now produced in Mexico.  Adding to this belief is the fact that the packaging of the Nioxin product is cheaper, the bottles used to be printed but now have labels (stickers). Other reviewers of the Nioxin products have made similar comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Bos Revive products for a month or so now and have the perception that the product works better than the Nioxin products.  There is no way to confirm that the product works or not, just that it feels like it works and I like the look of my hair when I use it.  It does produce a tingling of the scalp and it seems that my hair has more volume so that is enough for me for now.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo &amp; conditioner just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Give it the 2-3 months it asks for.  The product works!  I&#x27;m still shocked it works (no other hair thickener has worked for me before).</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me.  Made my hair fall out more.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have now used this for more than six months and I am very pleased!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner since I noticed significant increase in shedding just two week into the experiment.</li>
            <li> My wife said it seems to be working!!... I have used the shampoo BOS REVIVE 1 and the BOS REVIVE 3 thickening for a while now, have had some new hair growth. thought I would try the BOS REVIVE 2 conditioner along with steps 1 &amp; 3. Much cheaper to purchase in larger volume and online. I am sure it would work better if i used it every day. So far so good, we will see how much better with all 3 steps.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for 8 weeks now, and i have noticed a big difference in hairloss. Its a medicated shampoo, but I have grown to enjoy the little tingle on my scalp when the conditioner is left on for 5 mins. At first, it did not lather well, but I realized that is due to the buildup from the other shampoo.  After a few washings, it lathers really well.  I only need a little bit to get a big lather.  I highly recommend the leave in spray conditioner because the rinse out one does not really leave the hair smooth and easy to comb through.  I have also added the mouse and the hair spray and so far, all of the products work really well together. I am pleased with the products and will try next get my sons to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I am still awaiting results for the shampoo and conditione. I have been using these two since early to mid yestermonth so i am unsure if anything will happen better. So,i anyone who used these products,please sent me or reply to my review please. I need info and steps on how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and my hair appears fuller and it&#x27;s thicker.</li>
            <li> bought for my mother who has hair loss she loves it because it works doesn&#x27;t totally stop hair loss but works well</li>
            <li> Great Product at a Great price! Detected a visible difference after 1 month of use. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Happy with shampoo....recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li> The quantity is good, the cleanliness from the shampoo is excellent, the volume the conditioner adds is very nice.  Been using for months now and it keeps my hair smooth, looking good, and feeling healthy.  I&#x27;m using it with a minoxidil treatment and I can definitely see a difference in volume and strength, and while I can&#x27;t point to this product as the only reason for it, I do think it&#x27;s a positive contributor.  Only subtracted one star because it (like any other hair product of this kind) has a faint medicinal odor.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but certainly not Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> It appears to work.  Of course the only way to find out would be to quit using it and I&#x27;m not doing that...</li>
            <li> I think this has slowed hair loss but not stopped it. I don&#x27;t use every day though because it takes a good chunk of time to devote to both shampoo and condition. Shampoo suggests 1 minute and conditioner says 5 minutes so takes a while.</li>
            <li> I use it and it seems to work.  Have also changed my diet as well (no coffee or smoking of any kind) which I think has played a larger role in stopping hair loss but over all this product seems to help.</li>
            <li> I been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a couple of months, I can see a big difference in my hair, it&#x27;s a lot thicker and fuller, I will continue to use Bosley revive shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Awesome! I am 42 years old and my hair had been getting a little thinner every year. I bought this product with little hope. After a month, I thought my hair was growing. After two months, I know it is. Other people are even making comments. This stuff works! If you are reading this. You need to buy it. What is 40 bucks if it gets you some hair and confidence back?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have baby fine, Polish hair (I&#x27;m half Polish and I got the fine hair from my mother). For years I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin products exclusively and because I do that and also use Minoxidil religiously I&#x27;ve been able to keep a lot of my hair when my friends who are using Suave grocery-stroe products have just gone bald or nearly so. Anyway I was looking for liter size Nioxin #2 and Scalp Therapy #2 conditioner when I came across these Bosley products. WOW! what a difference, the Bosley products actually do make your hair feel thicker!! Even the conditioner, which those of us with baby fine hair usually cannot use (it weighs down the hair too much), was fantastic! The conditioner added to the thick feeling and I now love my hair a lot more than I used to, that&#x27;s for sure. Is it going to give you nthick hair like Elvis had? No, no way, but it will enhance whatever you&#x27;ve got left! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, seems like good product. Very good price!</li>
            <li> Smells kinda medicineny, doesn&#x27;t seem to be preventing much hair loss but may be slowing it a wee bit? Hard to say, not super noticeable.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything to me. I feel my hair is the same.</li>
            <li> Been a month, so far so good</li>
            <li> Have nt noticed any results after only a month. But I will say I do like it. Smells pretty good and the cooling sensation is very invigorating.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo.  The conditioner was for my sister in law.  It must be good because had me order it again,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work just like all other hair products.  Save your money unless you just want a high priced shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bought these 2 with some minoxidil from Kirkland and they stopped my hair loss after a few days. Not sure if the hair is growing back, but I can see that it stopped falling off.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and I can tell it does work!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Got here quickly. The only combo I&#x27;ve been using for years and it makes my hair feel hydrated and healthy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, as he has thinning hair.  It actually does make a difference.  His hair has gotten thicker, and it&#x27;s much cheaper buying from here than in a salon</li>
            <li> The product is a very good shampoo and conditioner however I did not notice any difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
