            <li>Now in my 30’s I stay away from tanning beds and use sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and signs of aging, but I still want my beautiful summer glow.</li>

            <li>I am so happy with the nice glow and no streaks.</li>
            <li>All in all, good product.</li>
            <li>They go on good and stay on</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good product that wasn&#x27;t a spray so that I wouldn&#x27;t be inhaling the product...</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the good reviews and pictures that people shared</li>
            <li>My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Ive heard nothing but good about this</li>
            <li>You can leave these on your vanity or sink (the package is gorgeous anyway), or store them in a bathroom closet and just pop one out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fair and needed to use it twice.</li>
            <li>These showed color in my fair skin even tho i needed 3wipes for one application</li>
            <li>Good color within two or three uses.</li>
            <li>skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I think if you are struggling with the decision to order and try this product, go ahead and try it because the company really is good to work</li>
            <li>She loved them also and is going to order them.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fair and I have not been in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>They should be good to use when traveling.  </li>
            <li>These did not work out good for me.</li>
            <li>Gives good color.</li>
            <li>Good color somewhat patchy in some areas.  </li>
            <li>Good but streaky.  </li>
            <li>does not streak and lasts a good while</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame because the color is good.  </li>
            <li>These work great for giving my face and arms a nice bronze glow.</li>
            <li>no smell to the towels at all, which is good.</li>
            <li>; however you will want to use a good exfoliate or body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>how good it looks once you try them all.</li>
            <li>It gave me a good tan</li>
            <li>They seem to work good</li>
            <li>But, I will say to its credit, the short-lived color is good (not orange and not streaky).</li>
            <li>They are priced with quantity that I feel is fair.</li>
            <li>Im fair</li>
            <li>They do streak some, they all do, but the color was good.</li>
            <li>It stayed on and looked good for about 3 days before I needed to touch up</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of products and have tanned in beds and this seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>and it dries promptly with no residue and feels good afterwards.</li>
            <li>I think these are going to work good.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully and easy and make sure you read directions and do what they say!</li>

            <li>Pleasant fragrance, not sticky and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice tone but need more than one towel for even just top of body to ensure no blotchiness.</li>
            <li>Honestly this is probably the BEST self tanning wipes and method overall, I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I love the towelettes, they are very easy to apply and have no odor at all.</li>
            <li>The Glow2Go Tan Towels are convenient, easy to use, gives you a beautiful tan and leaves your skin feeling fresh and alive.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>In a way I was happy about that since this was going to be my first experience with self tanning.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>it seems too good to be true, it probably is not&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>a bit of orange does come through (I&#x27;m very light skinned</li>
            <li>Results weren&#x27;t streaky and were very light.</li>
            <li>Very light color.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>

            <li>Good price and quick results</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to use towelettes.</li>

            <li>This is a great product with no streaks, easy to apply right out of the shower all over the body</li>
            <li>Over all the product is ok.</li>
            <li>Better than spray-ons or lotions.  </li>
            <li>If you are just doing your face, you can use the same&lt;br /&gt;towelette more than once.</li>
            <li>you’re gonna love this product.</li>
            <li>It is the best out there, and I’m just so upset it was only released to the market this year!!!</li>
            <li>Thats more my fault than the product, but just a heads up</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right off the bat I fell in love with the box design.</li>
            <li>I can place over items on top of it and not have to move them be able to get one out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m completely in love with these.</li>
            <li>enjoyed</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more once I finish this box.</li>
            <li>With most tanners you have to wait up to 1 hour before it dries</li>
            <li>Like many have said, this product doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>:) and no I&#x27;m not knew at self tanning.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for being on the go or if you need something to bring on your travels as they are individually packed.</li>
            <li>Ok, this one is not for the beginners.</li>
            <li>tan I got is okay,</li>
            <li>What I like about it the most is the ease of use and not having to carry a tanning lotion bottle with you everywhere.</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love these tanning towelettes</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>Tan Towels work better than this brand.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free and I agreed to give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I used a body scrub and made sure to get my elbows, knees, and ankles/feet.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to get in my tanning bed every time i want to tan.  </li>
            <li>love that the box turns into a dispenser for the towelette packets.</li>
            <li>So these photos (attached below) from top to bottom are: No tan, 1 application, and 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be keeping these on hand all winter, and unless they come up with something even more awesome, then next winter too!g 10 minutes to dress</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be keeping these on hand all winter, and unless they come up with something even more awesome, then next winter too!</li>
            <li>The towelettes come individually wrapped which makes them perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>I tried to make sure I covered all spots on my legs, but after a day I could see spots where I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any color transfer on my bedding, or clothes which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to get the most applications out of my wipes</li>
            <li>Spray tan is my favorite way to get a tan.</li>
            <li>Spray tan is my favorite way to get a tan.</li>
            <li>I wear a size 10 and with that being said I would need a lot more then 2 of them.</li>
            <li>and I was more orange than tan.</li>
            <li>Clairens remain my favorite self tanner product.</li>
            <li>I received an email from the seller giving me tips to help me to achieve better results from the product.</li>
            <li>.this is an amazing self tanning product (make you look fabulous without the need to be hours ..exposed to the sun or the tanning bed ...</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than the competition and much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Definetly going to purchase more.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal is better with a thicker towel.</li>
            <li>I have used various self tanners and towelettes,  and this is the best.</li>
            <li>These do everything they say they will do and more..</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had better directions for application.</li>
            <li>And no nasty self tanner smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is also awesome to use if you have stretch marks like me at the back of your legs.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and plan to use it in the summer more.</li>
            <li>I am sure lots of people love your product, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be a return customer.  </li>
            <li>Most streaks out of any self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT)</li>
            <li>I tried /ordered this two times to make sure before i reviewed it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t work correctly for me I could tell this is a better product than most.</li>
            <li>For my second go around, it went great!</li>
            <li>I was hoping they would be more like Loreal wipes.</li>
            <li>Product was ok.</li>
            <li>, The price is much better than Tan Towels as well</li>
            <li>I have used tan towels too and these are more streaky</li>
            <li>So much better than self tenning lotions.</li>
            <li>All that I want from a self tanner is good golden color.  </li>
            <li>Priced cheaper than a lot of others but cheaper isn&#x27;t better in this case....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product, I didn&#x27;t want to miss it at this price!</li>
            <li>Make the towelette more stronger.</li>
            <li>then 2 more to correct streaks.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more??</li>
            <li>These type of products have been around for a bit over 10 years, and it seems that they are getting more and more refined.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation helps to give the skin a nice smooth surface on which to apply the towelettes.</li>
            <li>I use a hand scrub to be sure that my palms and nails aren&#x27;t tanned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love that these towelettes give me a build-able SAFE tan.</li>
            <li>I have a streak free, bronzed TAN!!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided; all opinions are my own after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>TanTowel brand is better.</li>
            <li>Will buy again :)</li>
            <li>I also think I get a better tan with Sublime.  </li>
            <li>like most self tanners.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I just love, love these towelettes.</li>
            <li>Color is also not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the 20 pack</li>
            <li>I also love the cut-out in the box where I can pull one wipe at a time.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these and recommending them to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Okay....</li>
            <li>box of Glow2Go contains 20 individually wrapped premium towelettes which are perfect for sunless tanning at home or on the go.</li>
            <li>I did not use gloves when applying the wipes, I just made sure to wash my hands &amp; wrists with soap after applying so</li>
            <li>I received a discount on this product, and for the value, even though I need to use more than 1</li>
            <li>The color is nice, light tan</li>
            <li>I will probably use them to touch up my face in between my applications of my favorite self tanner (banana boat).</li>
            <li>i love the color these give me.</li>
            <li>I just wish the wipe was better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on the self tanning products before I ordered.</li>
            <li>This would be the best self-tanner on the market if only it worked.</li>
            <li>The is a product that is layer able.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you try to wear some time of glove when applying these.</li>
            <li>Those are the part that will be most noticeable if not applied correctly.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with another reviewer that tan towels are much better.  </li>
            <li>Best to use to maintain color achieved with another product, especially if traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it will take to more times to get the color I want.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great packaging</li>
            <li>These are such a GREAT price!!</li>
            <li>Oh, BTW I have been using all sorts of tanning products for several years now, so I can say that tanning towels are the best option.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products when it comes to self tanning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and has.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>And that care and followup helps get better results from this product.  </li>
            <li>However, I prefer the self tanning lotion for a better result.</li>
            <li>Tanning and looking bright and colorful is something I am always after.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love love love these.</li>
            <li>It only takes about 4 hours, but the tan is perfectly even!</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get nervous whenever I decide to try self tanning products, results can vary dramatically, and if those results aren&#x27;t good,...</li>
            <li>After about 4 hours you will be able to see if you want to go a bit darker and can apply another application if you like, then apply again about once a week to keep the color from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get a box of 20 individually packaged tanning towelettes, perfect for vacation time!</li>
            <li>Wait 10 minutes before getting dressed, and make sure you wash your hands after applying.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to see the stuff when I applied it on my skin</li>
            <li>After waiting four or more hours and you still want to be tanner, just grab another wipe and wipe on the area.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>No orange streaks, which I love.</li>
            <li>I love it .Easy</li>
            <li>The more often you use it, the darker you will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are waterproof, odorless and safe for your skin.</li>
            <li>Yet something that would not damage my skin, or cause the orange look that many products leave.  </li>
            <li>The package said not to get dressed for 10 minutes, and I waited for 15 just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I love this product, not to mention the customer service that comes with it.</li>

            <li>In my opinion this makes a light natural color not fake, not orange and is good if you are fair to light medium.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the first sunless product I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>honestly, I didn&#x27;t get my first results in 4 hours.</li>
            <li>so this is my first impression rose.</li>
            <li>I am trying to find a way to remove this, but have not been successful so far.</li>
            <li>What many of the reviewers say is true..</li>
            <li>After just the first wipe, I really liked the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your palms won&#x27;t turn dark, and you get really great coverage!</li>
            <li>they must have gotten high with reviewer number one because I&#x27;m pretty pungent and if my attempt at self taming isn&#x27;t noticeable by my beautiful orange palms</li>
            <li>but everything turned out fine.  </li>
            <li>The color is fine and stays put.  </li>
            <li>I saw other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t do anything for them, then I saw many that said they loved it!</li>
            <li>and you better make sure you get everything - fast!</li>
            <li>but everything turned out fine.</li>
            <li>.They go on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>I normally use Tan Towels (by far THE best tan towels out there), but decided to give these a try based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>product for a quick on the go pick me up for a self tanner is a HIT!</li>
            <li>product for a quick on the go pick me up for a self tanner is a HIT!</li>
            <li>I cant tell you how convenient it was to be able to duck in the bathroom during nap time and quick do an application versus having to skip dinner while I run to the tanner.</li>
            <li>I cant tell you how convenient it was to be able to duck in the bathroom during nap time and quick do an application versus having to skip dinner while I run to the tanner.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li>Hopefully this stuff fades quick!</li>
            <li>On the plus side the color is really good, very natural.</li>
            <li>The color was ok but since it soaks in super fast, you need to make sure you get everything!</li>
            <li>You get more of a natural tan with these wipes and that is what I love about these towelettes!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you want more of an &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; experience, or have an event coming up and just want a quick tan, then Glow 2 Go is something worth considering!</li>
            <li>So far, this one has the best \\&quot;natural glow\\</li>
            <li>which is a huge bonus for me ??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for years, and am a huge fan of them.</li>
            <li>Tanning cloths arrived at my home via Amazon on time and product was accurate as described.  </li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>Its very eye catching</li>
            <li>In about 4 hours I noticed color starting to show and within 6 hours I had a great even tan.</li>
            <li>I could see it looking amazing if you really knew how to work it around the hands and</li>
            <li>The wipes do not rub smoothly on your skin and roll up when you use them.  </li>
            <li>The sound of crickets.</li>
            <li>These are half-body towelettes, which is great if you only want to do your arms, legs, or your face, and that way, you&#x27;re not wasting product.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Streak Free</li>
            <li>I noticed a light tan after just one use.</li>
            <li>I got these for free in order to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also a bit light on product.</li>
            <li>It takes 3 or 4 applications to get a light medium color.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s great for winter, and deserves 4 starts for the convenience and color</li>
            <li>Price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I find myself struggling to get a smooth application.</li>
            <li>i like how smooth it goes o</li>
            <li>It also seems scent free</li>
            <li>fragrance is light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their slogan on the box reads &amp;#34;EVEN, STREAK FREE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I just reapplied whenever I noticed it was getting too light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to traditional self-tanners.</li>
            <li>They have a light self tanner scent that does not transfer or linger once the wipes have been applied.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m bummed because I bought two boxes thinking it would be fabulous.</li>
            <li>It took me two times to get a light tan look</li>
            <li>and I have light skin color.</li>
            <li>and this is definitely another great product, even easier to use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this golden tone.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, this box comes with 20</li>
            <li>Note, Glo to glo product is great for its price and QTY, but in terms of tanning color longevity, richness of the tan, and lesser surface area of the cloth, you get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li>I recommend exfoliating for a streak free application and look.</li>
            <li>I used on my whole body and it was a nice even tam color</li>
            <li>I really was impressed that an email was sent to me, along with the tanner, to ensure a proper application!</li>
            <li>and I was able to simply rub them over my skin and felt like I was getting good coverage because of the ease of the towlette.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to Tan Towels which are by far superior.</li>
            <li>I had a comment on how my faced look nice and tan after only using it once so that was nice.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these because of all the great reviews, but they definitely were not what I was expecting</li>
            <li>NOT EVEN STREAKING VERY BUMMED!!!</li>
            <li>, I applied it two days later and it is fabulous!!!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything that night but the next day (which is always the day we look for streaks) she had a very nice glow to her skin and no streaks.</li>
            <li>Very Worth</li>
            <li>and it left a very nice shade.  </li>
            <li>I can do my entire body with just 2 cloths which is very nice</li>
            <li>A quick easy tan with a wipe</li>
            <li>My legs are the most important, so I did that first.</li>
            <li>Just started a few days ago - love the convenience, the non-greasy feel and the beautiful glow</li>
            <li>Super convenient and easy.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to get out of the shower and do a quick wipe with the towelette.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to get 20 decent size tan towelettes in this set.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell most products do and it leaves my skin a beautiful color.</li>
            <li>the towels are super easy to use, no streaks and almost no odor.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to take with you on the go</li>
            <li>Other than that, a truly great product and definitely worth the $!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, a truly great product and definitely worth the $!!</li>
            <li>new favorite!</li>
            <li>you ladies know what I mean)&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on my face which I was nervous at first but am glad I did because it eliminated foundation from my routine for  bit ( super easy)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you want more of an &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; experience, or have an event coming up and just want a quick tan, then Glow 2 Go is something worth considering!thing</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good self-tanning product that is easy to use, and no fuss, I would definitely recommend that you check this product</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good self-tanning product that is easy to use, and no fuss, I would definitely recommend that you check this product</li>
            <li>( make sure you pat yourself dry really good)</li>
            <li>The wipes are half body size (most tanning wipes come like this) which is great</li>
            <li>I love how easy they are to use and how fast they are to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practically foolproof, provides a nice natural glow, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have found a better tanner in wipes in my whole life!</li>
            <li>I was offered to review this and was so excited because I had never tried towels</li>
            <li>So, when I received these towelettes I was excited but leery to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is light and smells like suntan lotion, not bad.  </li>
            <li>My hands never got stained either .I was offered to review this and was so excited because I had never tried towels before.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Used 2 applications for a rich tan - just what I needed at the start of my beach vacation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe seasoned self-tanner users would have better luck with this</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>First off I love the box.</li>
            <li>A nice, natural golden glow. :)</li>
            <li>Follow up to my original review.....</li>
            <li>I love this product first time I used it</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get a significant tan, it takes me 4 applications, but then it isn&#x27;t even&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly how I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have definitley tried products in the past that I wasn’t impressed with.</li>
            <li>So, my mistake, is now something we can laugh at together!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried them all - this new product is truly the best in the market today- with no streaking, no blotching, no horrible orange color you get from using other products!</li>
            <li>I ended up using 3 on well buffed clean, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>They promise a golden glow (not an orange rind), easy application, and streak-free results.</li>
            <li>Before each application it is advised to clean and exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I am confident enough to go for a walk on the beach!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on quick, smooth and even, convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best self tanning product I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you wish to have the best color out there and not have your skin go dry.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not found anything better when it comes to the appearance of the tan!</li>
            <li>I did not have any streaks and was able to get a pretty good tan after using following this process twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment!!!</li>
            <li>These towelettes are so easy to use and are just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Also whenever you get a spray tan or what not you should always exfoliate take off that top layer of skin for an easy smooth application that looks and feels natural.  </li>
            <li>also had a hard time getting everything perfectly even.</li>
            <li>- I simply love the fact I don’t have to open the box but simply pull one towelette each time which makes my bathroom closet just a tiny-bit more organized ;-) and the results are fast, reliable and gives you the perfect tan.</li>
            <li>on the fifth wipe I noticed it had more moisture than the others and went on much easier.  </li>
            <li>nothing like paying for something and not getting the full effect.  </li>
            <li>, now how cool it that???</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised how nice it looked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used creams and sprays, both for full and gradual self-tanning, but not a towelette.</li>
            <li>Then it left my skin sticky and it didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>The tan will only be as good as the skin prep.</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li>Not as much product saturated into these towels as tan towels like Tan Towels better</li>
            <li>but I can see the full affect in about 6 to 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice natural and gradual tan .</li>
            <li>Used one towelette so far and achieved a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I did this over and over in a span of three days, have used most of the towels, and absolutely nothing happened.</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised how nice it looked.</li>
            <li>it created a warm tan, but I had streaks where you could see the difference between my natural skin color and the manufactured tan from the towlettes.</li>
            <li>When I was out in full sun</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for the cost</li>
            <li>a streak free golden glow that gives the illusion of color without exposing my skin to the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>
            <li>Since I wear a full bathing suit I don&#x27;t do a full body tan just arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a full 10 minutes that I wait to put on my pajama&#x27;s</li>
            <li>(really 4 would probably be better</li>
            <li>I did my entire body and was feeling good about the product,</li>
            <li>am giving your company and these Sunless Self Tanning Tan Towels my highest recommendation.eel good about my appearance when I am out and about in the land of daily sunshine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just make sure to shower and exfoliate really well before using.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, was even better than described.  </li>
            <li>and I had a nice soft glow.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but will be searching for an alternative.</li>
            <li>which is wonderful because I can get pretty pale during the winter months &amp; the coverage is buildable-</li>
            <li>A little color would do them some good!</li>
            <li>The first being that it does not have a strong smell and</li>
            <li>The first being that it does not have a strong smell and</li>
            <li>The directions are pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Would probably be great on the face/neck/chest, but anything other than that, I won&#x27;t trust.</li>
            <li>I have applied it once daily since the initial application to make sure that I maintain that beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different ones and this one is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>Towels give good color, but kind of hard to put on.</li>
            <li>Knowing this, I am even more impressed because I thought it was going to take many, many separate occasions to get the tan to a dark enough shade; but now I know that I just have to wipe it 2 or 3X in the same sitting to get the color darker.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and friendly emails!</li>
            <li>Hyped to be such a great product, was surprised that the towels do not apply easily.  </li>
            <li>My thighs are streaky from the towelette drying to quickly.</li>
            <li>Would be great for travel or a fast touch up if your going out later that evening.  </li>
            <li>I would estimate one self-tanning towel per appendage and these come in a box of 20, so they go quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its quick.</li>
            <li>Its quick.</li>
            <li>The color was mild.</li>
            <li>Drys quick without worrying about getting any on your clothes</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and i like that.</li>
            <li>Luckily they do not go on with color.</li>
            <li>The color is not just a brownish tan, but a warm, golden, natural color.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and work well.</li>
            <li>However, I am a tall person and the towels lose their moisture/tanning effect quickly.</li>
            <li>She was high, had to be, because the most luxuriously tanned part of my body are the palms of hands.</li>
            <li>As long as the price is good, so am I.</li>
            <li>Works very well and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love tanning, I live in Florida, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;GLOW2GO is a new and innovative sunless tanning towelette.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When I applied it, it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I can say one give a nice soft not fake looking tan.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it was to use these wipes without any real work.</li>
            <li>This product scared me at first because I am very fair and pale.</li>
            <li>and honestly I don&#x27;t see how you could apply this evenly without using many, many wipes to completely coat your skin and make it very wet.</li>
            <li>No fake orange coloring!</li>
            <li>on a cruise in April these will be the first thing I pack!</li>
            <li>REALLY making me not want leave the house for  anything!!</li>
            <li>REALLY making me not want leave the house for  anything!!</li>
            <li>They really work!!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t even used all of the towelettes from the first yet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the L&#x27;Oréal towelettes, but once my skin was prepared and used to the product, BANG!  </li>
            <li>NO weird brown hands after either!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I will defiantly buy more of their products and these wipes!</li>
            <li>I was pretty stoked to try these!</li>
            <li>I have a new puppy so with all the bruises I have on my legs from him plus my blinding whiteness these have really come in handy.</li>
            <li>I will tell you this is the most easy to apply especially for me</li>
            <li>I really only wanted to get a nice glow, I wasnt looking to get super tan, and Glow 2 Go</li>
            <li>Love the color but the application is not as easy as a similar product.  </li>
            <li>I know, the smell is pretty strong at first but soon after it goes away.</li>
            <li>You put on a  Natural Healthy Overnight Indoor Quick Tan for Legs, Arms and Face.</li>
            <li>so far the many many self tanning products i have tried have pretty much turned me orange.</li>
            <li>but even though I&#x27;m pretty sure I did a double pass on a few spots, the results were even and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and its hard for me to get a tan.</li>
            <li>very fair skinned and its hard for me to get a tan, as I have Lupus and can not go in the sun.</li>
            <li>These are incredible fast and convenient with now mess.</li>
            <li>my shipping was fast and very well packed ..and another very important detail ...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Thermalabs shipped quickly and the individually packaged towelettes arrived in a very attractive box.&lt;br /&gt;Anxious to hit the beach, I took the time to read the easy to understand directions on the back of the packet and crossed my fingers that the reviews I had read were true.&lt;br /&gt;After showering and exfoliating my skin, I used gloves to wipe down my legs, arms and torso in even strokes as directed and waited to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I’m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free in exchanged for this reviewida</li>
            <li>and I’m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free in exchanged for this review</li>
            <li>self tanners I would be comfortable using one of these towelettes before work because I have confidence/experience in how real the tan looks.</li>
            <li>(looks natural, not orange, more of a lavender undertone).</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li>Thermalabs stated that 1 in 1,000 may not see results, but they back their product up 100% guarantee if they do not work with your body&#x27;s own amino</li>
            <li>No dirty ankles either.  </li>
            <li>, it’s a golden tan, not orange.</li>
            <li>That has no bearing on my rating or review of them, this is my honest opinion.a couple days and did it a 3rd time.</li>
            <li>, it’s a golden tan, not orange.</li>
            <li>but for me it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost</li>
            <li>I have used a number of different self-tanners and while I liked the idea of a towelette</li>
            <li>I got some nice color on my face and upper extremities.</li>
            <li>and I want to look golden</li>
            <li>towelette comes individually wrapped which is really a nice perk.</li>
            <li>This product is worth trying.</li>
            <li>recommendation is these are worth a try</li>
            <li>It is nice to not worry about ruining your skin potentially by the weather.</li>
            <li>I have fair pink skin and always end up orangey, but not with this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get to tan just a natural healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this productese because I do like the color it gives me</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product</li>
            <li>I got a nice deep tan after apply the product.  </li>
            <li>I will get better at it as I go along as I can see I need to be a bit more careful when doing around my ankle/feet area.</li>
            <li>applied these two days after shaving, and wasn&#x27;t able to wait the 10min after applying, because I had a three year old who required my attention.</li>
            <li>Work very well, would just recommend bigger towelettes, overall very happy with results!!!</li>
            <li>One wipe is good for half of your body so you&#x27;ll need two to do your full body.</li>
            <li>Yes you get twice as many as some other tan towel products, but you have to use twice as many.</li>
            <li>They are easy to open and easy to read instructions.</li>
            <li>I have tried other things from their company and have loved them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application: I used these right after drying off after a shower.</li>
            <li>right leg, right arm, abdomen, chest and face.</li>
            <li>used these right after drying off after a shower.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use gloves because one reviewer said she washed get hands right after and didn&#x27;t have orange palms.</li>
            <li>You may not see results right away</li>
            <li>I showered and used a towel right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>On the positive, this product provides the most natural tan color ever!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure since it was my first time using this product but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Great price for this many towelettes; double the amount of another brand for half the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really like the towels, easy to use, no Streaks and works better than the local tanning salons.</li>
            <li>and 2 I am Italian, I tan very easy</li>
            <li>There is no orange, and I started with very fair, dry, almost white skin.</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to be able to get the hang of it without any missed spots but over all it is a great product and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have light skin with some slight redness on my face and this gives a nice even sun kissed glow.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and although they are not my favorite, but because they are half the price of my favorite Tan Towels, I will buy these again.</li>
            <li>The product was able to tanned my wiped areas within 24 hours but noticed in comparison to Loreal&#x27;s tanning products in the Amazon catalog, Loreal produced a deeper tan with longer sustainability, and have more tanning surface area of cloth but is twice the price and half of the qty.  </li>
            <li>I am only using these on my face and the color is perfect and seems to last a while and fade naturally.  </li>
            <li>Because of their small size, they&#x27;re great to keep in your bag or with your makeup bag for travel.</li>
            <li>After a full 24 hours I&#x27;m not seeing much color.</li>
            <li>color development is pretty, it is a golden glow, not orange</li>
            <li>I buy only organic and natural products (food, cosmetics,etc,) and finally I was so happy to find self tanning products which will answer my concerns!</li>
            <li>The lotion feels so good and smooth , I actually replaced my regular for this one!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews about how people loved it  people raved about how dark it makes u</li>
            <li>Streaks all down my legs but the color I did get was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>First world problems right there.</li>
            <li>I have used all those sunless self tanning gels and creams but they always make me look orange, streaky, or it goes on darker in certain spots!</li>
            <li>This one takes less than 10 minutes and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>My skin used to tan easy in natural sun.</li>
            <li>The fabric material only holds shape in one direction, but overall these are great for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to keep rubbing it and waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li>Now, things are much improved, and products will give you a nicer looking, more natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of Glow2Go Tanning Towelettes by Thermalabs to try out.</li>
            <li>These tanning towels arrived quickly, followed by a very informative email.</li>
            <li>( did I mention they shipped super fast</li>
            <li>The towelette dries out quickly, it leaves tons of streaks, and does not give you much color.</li>
            <li>it dries fast no streaking and blends super ...</li>
            <li>Noticed some streaking on hands and arms - again better using more than less!</li>
            <li>I usually follow-up with a light lotion to be sure I am streak free</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy how natural it looks!</li>
            <li>Used more per body part the second time around and still didn&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li>Love the tan towels EASY not to dark &amp; I just reordered</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product due to the MANY great reviews I read, unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Very natural and not orange!!!</li>
            <li>they actually called me to thank me for my loyalty and to make sure</li>
            <li>The colour truly is natural looking and streak free.</li>
            <li>It was just enough color to give it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>, many times I&#x27;ve repeated the process 4hours later.</li>
            <li>which is EXACTLY what I got.</li>
            <li>These are my first wipes, though.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying some more since I have a problem getting a tan</li>
            <li>The second I got them, I exfoliated my legs and made sure that there were no stubs.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got orange finger cleavage and it looks like you&#x27;ve eaten a fist-full of Cheetos. ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>will last longer and be more even.</li>
            <li>I could compare the before and after the first application there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve figured out 3 applications is exactly how tan I want to look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m putting a picture up of my arm about 6 hours after the first application when I noticed I missed a spot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve figured out 3 applications is exactly how tan I want to look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m putting a picture up of my arm about 6 hours after the first application when I noticed I missed a spot.</li>
            <li>it finally showing up after I worked a 10 hour shift and with 2 more days of 10 hour shifts all I did was climb into bed and sleep.</li>
            <li>it finally showing up after I worked a 10 hour shift and with 2 more days of 10 hour shifts all I did was climb into bed and sleep.</li>
            <li>Obviously these towelettes seem like a better deal</li>
            <li>I highly recommended ..5stars!!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The size of the towel is more than enough to cover my body from the waist up--including my bald head.</li>
            <li>I wore rubber gloves and was able to do my entire body with one</li>
            <li>I really like these tanning towelettes!  </li>
            <li>After the first use</li>
            <li>And I noticed that nothing happened at first yet after about 10-20 minutes</li>
            <li>but I followed the instructions exactly, exfoliating before and avoiding lotions and all that, then trying to apply in even strokes...</li>
            <li>This is a stellar product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to go to a tanning bed because I am aware of the danger of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I guess if you are using these in the winter and aren&#x27;t showing your back off in a bikini or halter top</li>
            <li>With these towelettes they come in a pack of 20, so you can use them 1 to 2 times a day its your choice , they are safe to use, only thing is they have the sun tan lotion smell to them.</li>
            <li>Each towelette will produce Quick,Even,Streak Free Natural Looking Tan</li>
            <li>Just like the packaging states, if you want a darker tan, just use another 4 hours after the first treatment.  </li>
            <li>EVEN USED THREE WIPES FOR MY FIRST APPLICATION.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident that i applied the product properly but it still did not apply an even coating on my legs, feet, or toes.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions the first time I used it but could not go without shaving my legs to use this so unsure if this is why it didn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li>Used first time yesterday and have streaks today.  </li>
            <li>First, they recommend that you bathe/shower and also exfoliate (but no shaving).</li>
            <li>work fast!</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>The first time I used one I tried to cover years of paleness, and</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve for sure when you are using these wipes because you do not realize you missed a spot until hours later.</li>
            <li>hope you like Glow2go as much as me!</li>
            <li>Bye ;)</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t wait for spring and having a tan the first day I pull out a skirt.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NOTICE THESE ARE ODOR FREE AND GO ON CLEAR</li>
            <li>but if you arenervous like me then try your legs first ( its winter</li>
            <li>and had my first spray tan.</li>
            <li>I didn’t do that the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Guys!</li>
            <li>I love that the wipes are individually packaged so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out.</li>
            <li>I took one star off because I wish they were bigger or had more product saturated in the cloths.</li>
            <li>With one wipe I&#x27;m only able to do a section of my body.</li>
            <li>I experimented with one the first night I got them and did one leg with one wipe</li>
            <li>Hoping to get more after my next application.</li>
            <li>I tried multiple applications to try to enhance the color and it only made the streaks more prominent.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting more then do your body and you can come back or wait another day and apply another one.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>:) I tried one out and left it overnight</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>First I showered and then apply on my face and body.</li>
            <li>will admit I was scared at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first wipe, I didn&#x27;t have darker palms or knees&lt;</li>
            <li>They work I will order again thank you so much !</li>
            <li>The others however cover more skin with one towel so, financially  those would be my first choice.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different tanning lotions, sprays, tanning beds, and baking in the sun.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wait until you see the tan before using a second wipe.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wait until you see the tan before using a second wipe.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to see such a difference with just one application.</li>
            <li>I used 2 towelettes and I was able to do my full body, if you wanted you could just use 1 towelette and do partial body.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>So I end up needing 5 towelettes for my first once over on my body.</li>
            <li>The customer service is great, but I am not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>Well.........I wont be able to wear shorts, dresses, skirts, or short sleeved ANYTHING for probably a month!</li>
            <li>you really TAN!</li>
            <li>and no doubt it&#x27;s much healthier way and safer!</li>
            <li>My first application, I used 4 wipes and since then, I have used two at a time for touch-ups.</li>
            <li>The good news about that was, even every few days applying, I could tell it lasted in between applications.</li>
            <li>I even gave a few packs to a friend of mine and she tried the product and LOVED it as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an easy and safe way to have a little color and be safe with my skin.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and very natural glow!</li>
            <li>Right now, I am six months pregnant, and very white, so it was a clean palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product due to good reviews.</li>
            <li>The Glow 2 Go product looks natural, it is easy to apply,and has fast results.</li>
            <li>I actually thinks these are fine for smaller areas, like face and neck, but not so great for larger areas.</li>
            <li>Warning: After reading so many good reviews I got a little hasty and only used two wipes for my whole body and saw 3hrs</li>
            <li>I love the color that it leaves and the concept, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I have to say.</li>
            <li>I used 2 towelettes every other day for a total of 3 applications and it produced a beautiful bronze tan!!&lt;br /&gt;Things to remember;</li>
            <li>the dry out very quickly!</li>
            <li>Two applications should be enough for most people if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, dark tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only a warm natural tan, even on face, but no fake tan smell.  </li>
            <li>I also love the dispense it allows you to take out only as much as you need.</li>
            <li>If only I could tell how much and where I have applied it I would gladly give this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many self-tanning lotions only to turn a very unnatural orange color.</li>
            <li>I  really doubt it&#x27;s possible to do more than just your legs with one towelette.</li>
            <li>Very consciencious seller...have received several follow ups to make sure I like the product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Glow2Go to anyone who wants to get a sexy tan without the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li>You could definitely tell that I started at the bottom of my leg and worked my way up because the top of my thigh had much lighter color than the bottom of my leg.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using a good scrub beforehand and following up 4 hours later with another towel to intensify color.  </li>
            <li>Have to use two towels in order to make sure your whole body is covered and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;4&#x27;, 135 lbs.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are like wet wipes and aren&#x27;t greasy or sticky, very easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>These towelettes add very little color with each application, but the color is good.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>and  I was not influenced in any way to write a positive review</li>
            <li>These positive reviews have to be a joke.  </li>
            <li>It really gets the job done with a very natural look!!!  </li>
            <li>So you really need to plan ahead what you&#x27;re gonna do first with this ones!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took several applications prior to my noticing a difference &amp; my tan was minimal at best.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up on having color through the winter.  </li>
            <li>First it takes two towels to cover your whole body, not one.</li>
            <li>NO streaking - no weird brushes or mitts to use - seriously fast application -</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Cons- towelettes dry out quickly and doesn&#x27;t smoothly apply.</li>
            <li>3 stars is for the excellent customer service and the nice color ( not orange and fake looking) but even with all the tips followed and a second application these left streaks.</li>
            <li>skin feels soft and has the appearance of a natural tan without the sunburn or the risk of skin cancer from too much time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Thermalabs for enabling me to feel good about my appearance when I am out and about in the land of daily sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommended and definitely my favorite self tanner today.</li>
            <li>I normally use the St. Tropez bronzing mousse and I can say that the color these gave me was right up there with that well known brand.</li>
            <li>While applying it goes on clear and dries quickly</li>
            <li>While applying it goes on clear and dries quickly</li>
            <li>exactly so it&#x27;s easy to miss tiny spots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think there are less expensive options out there that work better for a tan, but this IS good for a quick and easy glow-</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, and the directions were as simple as 1,2,3.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily with two to three cloths for entire body.</li>
            <li>I also find the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as similar items on the market.</li>
            <li>Not the fun cool smelling ones, the actual lotion.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the single pack pull out option.</li>
            <li>but it does have a certain smell.</li>
            <li>One wipe covers a large percentage of your skin.</li>
            <li>I ran into a few issues, which means more tips, guys!</li>
            <li>They are just fine - not enough product on the wipes in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I tried to get by on one and ended up color showing on the first leg I did mainly</li>
            <li>so I tried to pay good attention  to apply it evenly leaving my knees and feet since I know that they can be hard to tan without making them look unnaturally darker.</li>
            <li>So, when I originally I thought that this box would give me 20 applications of a golden glow.. now I am down to just 5 more, and that&#x27;s only if I want to self-tan my legs and nothing</li>
            <li>You use only 1-2 wipes and if you need to re-apply to get a little more tone, wait 4 hours and apply 1 more towelette.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple, so I started right away!  </li>
            <li>I was able to easily cover my entire leg and part of the other with 1 towel.</li>
            <li>I used about 4-5 on my whole body.  </li>
            <li>I really like the color</li>
            <li>I am not one to tan very well.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I got carried away and got my wrist too much</li>
            <li>I think it is always commendable and worth mentioning when a product offers this type of commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is always commendable and worth mentioning when a product offers this type of commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>No mistakes allowed since the product is transparent and you do not see where you are going, and the towelette dries up fast.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very convient for those that dont get much sun</li>
            <li>I shaved my legs the day that I ordered so that My legs were ready for the tan towels when I got them.</li>
            <li>It took 3 towels to do my whole body and face.  </li>
            <li>so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gradual, which is my preferred method.</li>
            <li>the whole application process was always a pain in the rear.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t too much to start off with, I&#x27;d say that it is build-able with use.</li>
            <li>really like the results I got with the Glow 2 Go.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not paying much attention to detail when I&#x27;m applying either.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I don’t know why, but I assumed one wipe would get my whole body.</li>
            <li>and I really noticed a difference then.</li>
            <li>The Jergen’s lotion has a much stronger odor and takes longer to get results.</li>
            <li>The Jergen’s lotion has a much stronger odor and takes longer to get results.</li>
            <li>Also although I think the product needs some work I do really</li>
            <li>Also although I think the product needs some work I do really</li>
            <li>so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This felt like a 50/50 purchase, I was one of those who it didn&#x27;t really tan much at all.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this to anyone needing a tan for a couple of days to a week.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to ontrol amount  than liquids or sprays.</li>
            <li>Had a question regarding use, called number given and talked to a REAL person.</li>
            <li>However, This really streaked my legs.</li>
            <li>I really took my time to apply it</li>
            <li>I really like these towelettes.</li>
            <li>It really disguises it.</li>
            <li>These  work very well.</li>
            <li>These towelettes work really well.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>it really doesnt matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that in fact they do really work.</li>
            <li>It took 3 towels to do my whole body and face.</li>
            <li>so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.</li>
            <li>so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.</li>
            <li>I also exfoliated before applying, but my stomach got very patchy, but thats just how my skin is</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Now this could very well have been just my compete lack of knowledge on the self tan thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6 foot tall and probably should have used the whole box to cover my flabulous self but decided 2 would do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of weeks and it really is tricky to keep the wipe from crumpling up when you put it on</li>
            <li>And came out very streaky.</li>
            <li>, so i wanted to try it out to see if it really made.</li>
            <li>it was really noticeable.</li>
            <li>but I still really like them and will keep buying them</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But,  the tanning cloth is much thinner and flimsier than Tan Towel.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see how much you&#x27;re putting on or where you&#x27;ve put it, so it takes practice.</li>
            <li>Threw the rest away after my vacation and just plan on tanning for real.</li>
            <li>Got my order fast would order from them again, will tell others about them too</li>
            <li>I do wash my hands very well as soon as I am done applying my tanner.</li>
            <li>but I have to use 3 towels to do my whole body,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these tan towelettes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole box and can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>drying time is fast.</li>
            <li>I like to do straight out of the shower</li>
            <li>Do your whole body though</li>
            <li>Thermalabs  self-tanning towelettes work very well</li>
            <li>These towelettes are very well made</li>
            <li>It was also not streaky and very even.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much tanner my arms looked.</li>
            <li>I really could see the diffrence in one application.</li>
            <li>I was very scared,</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the wipes do not hold much solution.</li>
            <li>For my whole body to receive even coverage</li>
            <li>I now have a whole box of these just sitting here.</li>
            <li>Also I have to use 3 wipes to do my whole body</li>
            <li>The company really cares about it&#x27;s product and their customers.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found it yet, any input would be greatly appreciated..</li>
            <li>I did not notice much shade difference after using 2 packets on my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for any and all people!</li>
            <li>I really like that there were no streaks, even though when I was applying it I couldn&#x27;t tell where I had already applied.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I spent most of the morning trying to remove my streaks and splotches with lemon juice and baking soda in the bath tub</li>
            <li>Just wipe on but not to much around your elbows knees and hands.</li>
            <li>I like that because it&#x27;s easier for me to control where, and how much color I want.</li>
            <li>These worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in this product.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a product that delivers a natural golden color, and doesn&#x27;t streak, and this product does it all.  </li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t like being hounded four times from the seller about how much I like these things, and how to use a tanning wipe.  </li>
            <li>The company, Thermalabs is very helpful as they send email tips on how to use these towelettes.</li>
            <li>you would need 4 or 5 towels to do your whole body..</li>
            <li>The towel dries out very quickly as it isn&#x27;t very damp to begin with.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really wash your hands after or wear a glove.</li>
            <li>Drys fast.</li>
            <li>I really like having this tanned glow and</li>
            <li>but my tan really hides them.</li>
            <li>so if I was going to do my whole body I would probably have to use 2 of them.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only put on one coat so far love it.</li>
            <li>The company offers a 100% money back guarantee as well that you will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li>The company offers a 100% money back guarantee as well that you will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li>Delivered earlier than expected and in good condition.</li>
            <li>and I have like the few I have tried, but it is a one day kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice tan color no orange, no weird smell, last for a long time 3/4 days.</li>
            <li>As far as smell, I think Fake Bake is the best.</li>
            <li>On time shipping product works well need to use it for few day for nice tan</li>
            <li>It would be better if I did one wipe for left arm and leg, another for right side and another for back and front.</li>
            <li>I can NEVER get the lotions or sprays to look natural!!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these self-tanning single use towelettes!!</li>
            <li>Compared to other similar priced wipes out there it’s a good price and works well.</li>
            <li>Compared to other similar priced wipes out there it’s a good price and works well.</li>
            <li>for me, honestly, this was not easy to use at all.</li>
            <li>I have used Tan Towels in the past and was happy with them, but I believe this product produces at least the same results, and perhaps superior results to Tan Towels, and at a lower cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tanned my whole life, born &amp; raised near beach in Florida, but after cancer scare &amp; removal, I&#x27;ve certainly learned my lesson about &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34; in the sun!</li>
            <li>It seems other reviewers had better experiences with using all over the body.  </li>
            <li>I used only one and saw a significant result.</li>
            <li>It is also really reasonably priced and the color developed pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Unlike normal (streaky!)</li>
            <li>(it sounds like a lot, but recommended dosage is 1,000-5,000 mgs for what I take it for, it&#x27;s completely safe as an amino acid) upon arising every morning, on an empty stomach with B6 vitamin &amp; look at all the benefits!</li>
            <li>I guess they would be good for just a touch up or a very small body part.</li>
            <li>70% Organic Body Cream Formula for Light, Pale, Fair, Medium, Olive or Dark</li>
            <li>I do have a few streaks after doing a double application with the four hour space between, but it us not drastic and feel I will be able to correct it easily today.</li>
            <li>The towelettes don&#x27;t have any strong odor and by the time my skin is dry there was no odor at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product very natural color lasts much longer than I expected</li>
            <li>I noticed more streaking with this, since it dries so quick it’s hard to tell where I got it.</li>
            <li>I noticed more streaking with this, since it dries so quick it’s hard to tell where I got it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice tan color, with very little self tanner smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stays on quite a while&lt;br /&gt;I havent had any streaks or anything when I got caught in the rain&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive enough to be used on the face&lt;br /&gt;Comes with clear, easy to follow directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you let yourself dry completely before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>and they also are really cool because they come in individually wrapped packages so you can use them anywhere, anytime.</li>
            <li>I’m using these every 3-4 days with some Jergen’s lotion in between when I’m cool enough to tolerate</li>
            <li>I’m using these every 3-4 days with some Jergen’s lotion in between when I’m cool enough to tolerate</li>
            <li>looks so natural like after real tanning on a beach!</li>
            <li>I have a suggestion: alternate where you start wiping (i.e. start at left leg, then next time start at right leg, etc), because the first wipe puts on the most of the tanning solution.</li>
            <li>I think this was merely though my own lack of personal knowledge on using it, as the color of the tan was wonderful, a natural color, not the fake orange bake so many self tanners have.</li>
            <li>The company claims that the tanning towelettes  are; Quick, even, streak free, natural looking tan, and show  within less then 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Like most self tanning toweletts you do get the slight &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found these because I can now get my &amp;#34;high end brand&amp;#34; tan at way less then</li>
            <li>These toweletts are either too dry or they dont have anything on them to make them smoothly glide on the skin.</li>
            <li>You need 1 for the top half and one for the bottom</li>
            <li>You pay less for this but use more.</li>
            <li>This week I have been lucky enough to review the Therma labs Glow2Go self tanning towelettes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, I&#x27;d say it takes only a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is decent, but it does not go on even with this type of wipe.  </li>
            <li>They are much smaller and the instructions say that you should not unwrap and use them folded up and slowly open to do more parts of your body.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>(one per leg and butt cheek, one for both stomach and back, and one for chest, arms, neck and face for a total of 4 wipes) I got a much better results.</li>
            <li>and I look decently darker.</li>
            <li>But they do provide some decent color.  </li>
            <li>They roll up and crumple (for instance the ones by L&#x27;Oreal are a thicker fabric and wipe more evenly and are enough for an entire body and face).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll definitely switch back to Sun Laboratories for the summer :)</li>
            <li>color looks realistic, not orange.</li>
            <li>I have tried different self tanners and this is definitely the easiest and my favorite.</li>
            <li>Next time I will use one towelette for each leg individually in the hopes of seeing a better result.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on its mostly decent reviews.</li>
            <li>It looks like my tan at its best - which is hard for my pale skin to achieve.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and have little to no smell - I have never been aware of an odor at all.  </li>
            <li>This is a product for those who want a light sunkissed look, and I do mean light.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and will be purchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product .I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone😍</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;But I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other tan towels and they are far better.  </li>
            <li>These little towels can cover a lot of area, and have better coverage.  </li>
            <li>I wish it got a little better coverage per towel and had a way I could see which areas I got.</li>
            <li>I wish it got a little better coverage per towel and had a way I could see which areas I got.</li>
            <li>One thing I would like to mention is that if you’re not a skinny little girl you’ll need 2 towelettes to cover most of your body</li>
            <li>Might need to read a little more before I attempt</li>
            <li>The product claimed to be 100% streak free and waterproof and I was curious about this as I have always ended up with streaks.</li>
            <li>was I wrong they looked great.</li>
            <li>It gave me a very even and natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>this made my skin very orange colored not like a natural bronze</li>
            <li>This is because it goes on clear and dries fast.</li>
            <li>One application provides a shade up from your normal colour.</li>
            <li>I did a second application after the required four hours and the colour was nice and dark.</li>
            <li>also love the idea that I can stick a few tan towelettes in my purse or luggage and get a glow wherever I am.</li>
            <li>If you start off with all the top layers of dead skin gone the tan</li>
            <li>These self Tan Towelettes are just as good if not better than Tan Towels and at a lesser price.  </li>
            <li>The package says to wait 24 hours after shaving to apply, which since I shave legs daily pretty much means never.  </li>
            <li>I had to use it a few times to even it out and get some more color.</li>
            <li>Only had these for a few days but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I even reviewed all the instructions to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.</li>
            <li>I did use two towels for my full body for the first application but only 1 the second time.</li>
            <li>If you want more color just keep applying until you reach the desired amounts and after that then just maintain every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want more color just keep applying until you reach the desired amounts and after that then just maintain every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The advantage to the self tan towelettes is it works quicker than lotion, without the normal tanning odor.</li>
            <li>They did not make her skin look orange and gave her a golden looking tan that last for about a week.  </li>
            <li>you can repeat few more times if you like to recieve darker color.</li>
            <li>The color is good but the towels are a wee bit too thin.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get a good wipe with them, maybe because they are too thin?  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am living in an extremely cold climate and not having good luck with tanning booths or lotions this has been an awesome product for myself.</li>
            <li>The color itself was fine, however due to the fact it was so streaky, we never continued beyond 3 separate applications to see what a deeper tan would look like.  </li>
            <li>my skin was so extremely white, while I did see a slight difference after the first application, it was more of a glow than what could be considered a tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have no patience to call them for a refund, but seriously hey need to do better packaging of certain items and not just their books...</li>
            <li>Maybe I was already too tan to start with, and this works better on pale skin?  </li>
            <li>The left is before I used the product, and the right is 4 hours after application.</li>
            <li>I did reapply twice to get a darker tan since I am really white right now, and still didn&#x27;t get any orangey color.  </li>
            <li>Just wash right away, totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These go on easy and you can pick how dark you want to be.</li>
            <li>but this certain smell has been my least favorite (it almost smells like I&#x27;ve been laying in a tanning bed).</li>
            <li>They come in handy little individually wrapped packages so you can use them anywhere, anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 4 hours I noticed a really nice glow, however I wanted to go a little darker and applied a second coat.  </li>
            <li>I know how to use the new product</li>
            <li>But i didn&#x27;t mind trying something new.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I heard about the launch of this new product in one of the forums and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt trying it for the speciail price they offered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s around this time every year that I try a new self-tan, so I hereby dub this month &amp;#34;Self-Tanuary&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keep in mind since I am new at self tanning</li>
            <li>live in Florida</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I am new to using self-tanners</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I live in south Florida</li>
            <li>Thermalabs asked me to review their new Glow 2 Go Sunless Tanning Towlettes.</li>
            <li>As a brand new user, I chose wipes as opposed to cream or spray</li>
            <li>Tan towels have been my fav but figured I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li>I heard about the launch of this new product on Facebook and got it while it was on 50% off sale</li>
            <li>and then you can see the new color of your skin.</li>
            <li>So being that I am whiter than paste, and I live where the sun don&#x27;t shine.</li>
            <li>The cloths are very easy to work with, and it&#x27;s hard to believe they will work as well as they do.</li>
            <li>The price makes this a super deal as long as the color holds out like I hope!</li>
            <li>I typically use the Fake Bake Flawless spray or the St. Tropez mousse and apply with an applicator mitt and have been much happier with those products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The towelettes do dry out quickly so</li>
            <li>so DO NOT be ALARMED as it will dry quickly anyways.</li>
            <li>I moved to SE Florida a year ago and would never have thought I would be in need of a self tanner, however I suffered from agoraphobia and was unable to leave my home and enjoy the sunshine here like I thought I would be able to when I relocated from Wisconsin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I CAN get the product on, it looks nice and last a few days.</li>
            <li>Use it quickly as the towelettes dry out rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I feel the color is very natural</li>
            <li>It gives you a very natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>Color was very natural.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smell and cannot stand the smell of self-tanners.  </li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and has a very natural color.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Stay VERY far away from these tanning</li>
            <li>I am very petite (5&#x27;1&amp;#34;), have dry skin and live in Florida.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one application so far, but I could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the color looks natural, not orange or too dark.</li>
            <li>It dried out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am tiny and skinny, real petite!</li>
            <li>So far, I adore the heck out of them!</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and do get results, so it&#x27;s not my skin that rejected it, not sure why I got nothing.  </li>
            <li>first time using these I actually tried to use gloves to apply the wipe (I was trying to avoid any excess on my hands).</li>
            <li>These were ok, I&#x27;m not sure if I did not use them correctly or</li>
            <li>The towels look exactly like a baby wipe; they are white and they do not turn color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light tint not for a dark Tan look unless you use it often .</li>
            <li>, you must first exfoliate in order for it to work properly as you would with all tanning products.</li>
            <li>You can go as light , or just have a glow, or you can use these towelettes to get as dark (tan)</li>
            <li>I applied it 1 time first day then again 2nd day</li>
            <li>the first self tanning towelettes that I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wipes are not big enough or saturated enough for me - thinner women and men might fare better.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, I will continue to use this during the cold winter days to make me look like I just got back from the beach :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I was disappointed with how many towelettes I had to use, I was still willing to stick with the product if the results were phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>#34;to go&amp;#34; like pouches; easy to carry in the purse for a weekend away, where you might want a little color.</li>
            <li>The product is lightweight, easy to transport and apply, snd has little to no smell.</li>
            <li>my 19yo ended up with a HUGE rusty line down his chest after 1 application.  </li>
            <li>It’s clean, simple, applies to your skin in a second</li>
            <li>I then was surprised to see how quickly the towelette felt dry, as if all of the product had been used up.  </li>
            <li>However, the towels are so small and the material, which is kind of rough and easily torn, bunches when you try to wipe it on, which makes it hard to get an even tan (not impossible as I have achieved an even tan, but it&#x27;s a steep learning curve.)</li>
            <li>The single packages are easy to open.</li>
            <li>I love that my legs don&#x27;t look so pale!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s streak free and less than four hours.</li>
            <li>love the fact that these DO NOT instantly give you an automatic dark tan,but gradually tans you as you use these towelettes.  </li>
            <li>Be careful to not put too much around your ankles, knees, or elbows or it will look funny.</li>
            <li>I did have some spots that were lighter around the backs of my knees and down the side of my calf but was able to fix them after the next shower as the color did lighten up a lot.</li>
            <li>Love these, I&#x27;m very pale and they work worders.</li>
            <li>As a very pale woman I love my self tanning products.  </li>
            <li>ok but does not last long like sun tan towel in orange and white box</li>
            <li>I did only half of one arm to be able to show the difference of just one cloth.</li>
            <li>Definitely not large enough for full body!</li>
            <li>that it was dry right away</li>
            <li>because my skin is so light, I mainly just burn if I use tanning beds or lay out in the sun, with very little results.</li>
            <li>Then, they recommend you wait at least 10 minutes before you get dressed, to allow the product to completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product, I found a very light but noticeable color on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I normally use St. Tropez&#x27;s Self Tan Bronzing Mousse, but that can get expensive, so I was excited to possibly find a more inexpensive</li>
            <li>Not tan, but not pale either. </li>
            <li>If these were just a little larger they would be a better choice.</li>
            <li>May take 2 towelettes per use due to quick drying.</li>
            <li>I did the upper half of my body for the first go and used one towelette: it got dry pretty quickly, ergo-</li>
            <li>You can not see if you are evenly applying the product because it goes on clear</li>
            <li>on clear and dries</li>
            <li>The product goes on clear</li>
            <li>I am clearly captain of the &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know how to evenly apply things&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I decided to use one towelete on my face and neck instead of throwing these away and I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The test: she went to dance practice two days after the application and everyone was like “wow who did your tan?”  </li>
            <li>Took at least 4 to cover most of my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.  </li>
            <li>and it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>When I got it I was really surprised to see I got 20 wipes and not just 6</li>
            <li>About 4-5 hours later I checked in, and there wasn&#x27;t much change.</li>
            <li>And day 3 it was fading, day 5 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Naturally skin sloughs off, so the tan comes off as well.</li>
            <li>After the first application I noticed a difference, although it was minor.</li>
            <li>I did miss a spot on my arm and it was very obvious to me, although my husband said he couldn’t really tell.</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>When you do open them up they roll up so fast</li>
            <li>( 100% professional seller )..</li>
            <li>I use these towelettes to develop naturally looking tan on my legs.</li>
            <li>The tan is buildable and natural looking,&lt;br /&gt;working</li>
            <li>I just started using your product and so far  </li>
            <li>You can use them if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>The towelettes really help, especially if you want to even out tan lines!</li>
            <li>They did not streak &amp; if you follow the instructions you will look like you have a natural tan.  </li>
            <li>so I guess I shouldnt be too surprised.</li>
            <li>It basically does as well as Tan Towel as far as tanning.</li>
            <li>I am used to using self tanners similar to this one that truly cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the towels do not cover much of the body.</li>
            <li>; needs to look natural.</li>
            <li>Here are some frequently asked questions answered in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the color is natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>AGAIN make sure to becareful around elbows and knees and knuckles as you don&#x27;t want to get an icky color</li>
            <li>and it looks natural as the sun itself.</li>
            <li>I found things I like and dislike so far:  </li>
            <li>Completely accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After four applications, I had the results I was looking for and tan that looked natural.  </li>
            <li>I got the exfoliated beads on amazon and added to my soap to light get the dead skin off.</li>
            <li>No streak, even coating, natural glow.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the product, it made my legs look orange after the 3rd time of using it.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not use this product..</li>
            <li>No streaks, no orange tint, just a natural appearance as if I had been out for a walk in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s day 3</li>
            <li>No streaks, no orange tint, just a natural appearance as if I had been out for a walk on the beach...</li>
            <li>I had a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>The towel itself feels like a baby wipe, it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>You may need to play around to see how frequently you will need to reapply.</li>
            <li>I use 3 towelettes for a complete body application.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very convenient so you can take you individual packets on the go or in your purse-</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes you get your complete look.</li>
            <li>I used it once so far</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a natural glow.  </li>
            <li>the tan color that took was natural looking</li>
            <li>So far I have used this once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled skin cancer from tanning and can&#x27;t use the beds or the natural sunlight.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Only consideration is you can&#x27;t really tell where you have wiped because there is no immediate color.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will have better luck the second go round.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will have better luck the second go round.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until a few days later that there was another &amp;#34;naptime&amp;#34; for me to be able to apply again.</li>
            <li>It is giving me a slow tan with each application, so it looks more natural.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty light skin, so many times fake tanning products will make me look like the long lost relative of the Oompa Loompas.</li>
            <li>The color I did get was good, but not worth the frustration with the small towelette</li>
            <li>super natural and long lasting color ...</li>
            <li>Works the same with slightly less smell...other than that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth a higher cost.</li>
            <li>I normally use Tan Towels which I really like because of the coverage, color, and the fact that they dry immediately.</li>
            <li>The box comes with an open here bottom so as to have a clean and organized towelette holder for the wipes in your closet or bathroom cabinet without having an open box and just multiple packages thrown about.</li>
            <li>The box comes with an open here bottom so as to have a clean and organized towelette holder for the wipes in your closet or bathroom cabinet without having an open box and just multiple packages thrown about.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no mess and no odor.</li>
            <li>I usually use one a day (you will need more than one if doing your entire body) after showering until I get my desire shade of tan - and it looks as though I acquired my tan gradually and naturally.  </li>
            <li>No mess, no streaks,</li>
            <li>The tan wipes on evenly leaving no mess.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no mess like a spray can.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try the Glow2Go Towelettes.</li>
            <li>And the smell of them was pretty vague, most self tanners tend to stink, and these weren&#x27;t so</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s my first time using tanning wipes, I totally missed a lot of places as you can refer in the picture above.</li>
            <li>Being crazy, I did not use the gloves the 2nd time, and the underside of my fingers are a beautiful brown color.</li>
            <li>We did prep before using the product, but if the product requires extreme measures to produce an even tan, which many other self-tanners we have used before don&#x27;t, then this product is not for us.  </li>
            <li>Only giving it 3 stars though as it was blotchy in some places, particularly on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Worked good on my face but streaked on my arms and chest and doesn&#x27;t stay moist or have enough left to do even half a body like the other brand I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t have a strong or bad odor like many self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re</li>
            <li>The only thing that is a bummer is I cannot see the product spreading on my skin, so it is easy to get some uneven color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why it has so many positive (fake?)</li>
            <li>x 7.5&amp;#34; and comes out of the package pretty wet.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have an odor the first day, but the next few days I smelled like tanner, but no one around me noticed that I&#x27;m aware of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a rough time the first go around with this self tanner, but it was partly my fault for not rubbing it evenly on my body with the towelettes.</li>
            <li>I like the color I get with these ran towels, but like other reviewers, I had to use several towelettes to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>A second application a few days later made me feel ok about showing my legs in shorts.</li>
            <li>I used Loreal full body towelettes a few times..</li>
            <li>The towels dry a little too fast and one needs to use two towels to get full body coverage.</li>
            <li>To do any more than that would require a second towel because they are thin and dry quite quickly.</li>
            <li>But I still need a little sunshine, to keep my spirits up, feel better, Dr recommended it too for my bones, due to early osteoporosis, etc.</li>
            <li>Too much product too much time too little results.</li>
            <li>First application didn&#x27;t really changed my skin color; the second application added a slight hue.</li>
            <li>I also like how i can use them easy for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>So far no streaks or bad Oder which I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised;) also nice color and not orange after glow</li>
            <li>They also sell at around half the price or more of other towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to use at least 2-3 towels to get full body coverage, but if you don&#x27;t do areas that are covered all the time, you can get away with 1!</li>
            <li>I have always been the palest person in Western New York</li>
            <li>If you’ve ever used them you know they start off really damp and then dry out.</li>
            <li>Use one towelette for top half of your body and another for the bottom, wait ten minutes to completely dry as recommended.  </li>
            <li>The next morning I woke up looking much tanner, like I just got back from vacation.</li>
            <li>I tried to fix that buy only doing the missed areas the next time without much luck.</li>
            <li>In 4 hours your skin will have a slight golden hue to it.</li>
            <li>In 4 hours your skin will have a slight golden hue to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big, only 5&#x27;2 and had to use 3 towels to get my whole body</li>
            <li>think if the wipe material was smoother and bigger (this is smaller than Tan Towel and the Loreal wipes) it would be much easier to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that I have to use so many (4)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick or easy to use as the Tan Towel</li>
            <li>dont forget to use gloves or wash your hand immediately after using, the long exposure to the towels can make your hands a little darker than the rest of your body, because its easy to forget to wash them immediately.</li>
            <li>was worried about the coloring, this left a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be give the same color, not fake, but didn&#x27;t last with daily face care.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it one leg was darker than the other.  </li>
            <li>I use a major drugstore brand and for 10.00 I get 10 tanning towels.  </li>
            <li>color you get with these on the first use is comparable to 4-5 applications of the other</li>
            <li>I am a frequent user of name brand tanning products and have bought several on Amazon, this one gives me a natural deep glow without the mess or unevenness that many other products have.</li>
            <li>Day 1 and 2 shows how big of a difference it makes I only used it on my right leg and and the day 1 and day 2 in one photo show the same leg the next day</li>
            <li>She reported no streaks -- a problem she&#x27;s had with other products, and I think the color of her tan is the most natural looking of all self tanners she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Also, the towelette seemed to dry out pretty quickly and was made of a sort of slippery wipe material that made it hard to grip and</li>
            <li>Tan developed looking very natural, legs did not develop a usual weird smell of self tanning which was a great benefit.</li>
            <li>My results were more even and subtle, it was only after I&#x27;d used 2 wipes that I started seeing rusty lines.  </li>
            <li>and so it is hard to smooth on your body.  </li>
            <li>This is less expensive than any other product or salon service ive used with the best results!</li>
            <li>These wipes streak more than other products, maybe because the towels get dry and since it’s not very damp on my skin</li>
            <li>These wipes streak more than other products, maybe because the towels get dry and since it’s not very damp on my skin</li>
            <li>It generally takes 2-3 towelettes to cover my slim body.</li>
            <li>AND, because it goes on clear (so you can&#x27;t tell where you last applied) and the flimsy wipe wads up in your hand, I saw streaks!!  </li>
            <li>The price is great but the towels are too thin and small.</li>
            <li>The stars provided are for the minimal results combined with follow up, much appreciated customer service.</li>
            <li>Just follow the simple directions and get a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the tan has lasted four days so far and is still tan after taking showers.</li>
            <li>but I ended up giving up on the home stuff entirely and getting a professional spray tan instead at a salon.</li>
            <li>what surprised me was how you can get a self tan with just a white towelette.</li>
            <li>After completely drying the skin, you open up a single-use towelette, and apply it to the desired regions, which for me were the arms, lower legs and area around the neck/upper chest.</li>
            <li>These barely have any &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; in each cloth.  </li>
            <li>Side affects are hives, itching, pain and bumps that last forever, if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it barely lightened it.</li>
            <li>The wipes make you look tan, but at the same time natural instead of an &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li>First I am curious why you should not use the product if you have shaved with in the last 24 hrs?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried tanning cloths before so when I first opened it, I was curious as to why it was white.</li>
            <li>You can go as dark as you want by using them more often and you can maintain by using every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use the loreal towels since one is all I need to cover my full body and the towel  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to believe that an effective tan towel can&#x27;t be found.</li>
            <li>Makes it kind of expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li>The more I used, the worse it got.</li>
            <li>it contains a large amount of alcohol, which will dry out your skin and may cause you to seek medical treatment..</li>
            <li>I have only used the wipes once at this point, and it left a nice subtle tint, with no streaking!</li>
            <li>I could only use 1 on my legs alone, and even then the towelette dried quickly.</li>
            <li>These wipes are simple to use and there is no mess to rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li>No mess with these towelettes either, unlike the traditional bottle or spray method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m average size and used 3 towelettes for arms, legs and torso (2 towelettes might have worked but they seemed to dry out quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brand tan wipes and these are much thinner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried leaving the toilette flat, wadded, folded...but because it goes on clear and you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve been</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m one hot, streaky, smelly mess</li>
            <li>appreciate that Thermalabs reminded me to use sparingly around my ankles, elbows and knees as I know from experience with other self tanners, that if you apply too much to these areas, they tend to appear darker and</li>
            <li>Second time I applied kept folded in half and worked a little better.  </li>
            <li>I am very pale - but have had much better results from other products.</li>
            <li>Takes too much time, it takes at least 6 to do your whole body...</li>
            <li>You need to be very deliberate and careful with the application, especially with tanning towels because there is no color guide.</li>
            <li>Seems to work good enough, but I&#x27;m afraid to try it on arms, legs and face without knowing what I should do.</li>
            <li>You will be able to see a very faint sheen when you first use the wipe</li>
            <li>i can use as little or as much as i want!</li>
            <li>I am not a big person (5&#x27;4) and barely covered my body with 2!</li>
            <li>No streaks but a little bit orange at first.  </li>
            <li>I do not think they are big enough, and they seem to feel dry really fast, leaving you to open up another one.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to rub them on me they rolled up because they were so thin and they dried out very quickly before even my face and arms were done.as far as tanning they did really good,just need to be thicker and wetter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two other types of major-brand towels for tanning, and have decided, finally, that these really stand out.</li>
            <li>I had a bare spot on each of my inner elbows, which I figured out</li>
            <li>So after about halfway through I actually took them off and used just my bare hands.</li>
            <li>They are quick and easy to use and don&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use/apply, did notice a slight difference in  color a few hours after applying.  </li>
            <li>Thermalabs really has this down.</li>
            <li>i tried so hard, but I&#x27;m still super streaky.</li>
            <li>Nice to not have to wear foundation--and bonus--as a red head I wont blind people with my white WHITE skin!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how plain wipies like this can legally sell!</li>
            <li>I did exactly what was written on the box and it came out so streaky that I was embarrassed to go out in public, not to mention the Oder it had after it dried.</li>
            <li>Comes out pretty streaky and you can&#x27;t tell until a few hours later</li>
            <li>you just want a golden glow of color and not a real all over dark self-tan, then just use one towelette-</li>
            <li>Each pack comes with 20 natural tan single use towelettes and I use one for each area.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are very convenient and do not make a mess as some products would in a liquid form or a spray.</li>
            <li>The 1st package I used from this barely showed, then tried the 2nd, 3rd, then just threw the entire box away.</li>
            <li>I began noticing for some odd reason I began tanning, without burning very rapidly, in a very short time!</li>
            <li>I normally buy another brand of tanning towels that are much more expensive, so when I saw these, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try!</li>
            <li>I know my legs are very, very pale right now</li>
            <li>my arms are bent the whole time, and the little space where my lower-bicep touches my inner-forearm didn&#x27;t develop.</li>
            <li>The formula is totally clear, but you&#x27;ll feel it wet your skin.</li>

            <li> Now in my 30’s I stay away from tanning beds and use sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and signs of aging, but I still want my beautiful summer glow.</li>
            <li> No harmful sun rays but still a beautiful glow?</li>
            <li> It gave me a beautiful glow to start and about 4 hours after I had applied it</li>
            <li> The color these towels provide is beautiful; not orange-y at all.</li>

            <li> Using once, I had a great tan that lasted about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get a great look with them.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy that it turned out the way it did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be great if they found preservative alternatives for their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great product for a great price. :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the nice glow and no streaks.</li>
            <li> All in all, good product.</li>
            <li> They go on good and stay on</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good product that wasn&#x27;t a spray so that I wouldn&#x27;t be inhaling the product...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews and pictures that people shared</li>
            <li> My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Ive heard nothing but good about this</li>
            <li> You can leave these on your vanity or sink (the package is gorgeous anyway), or store them in a bathroom closet and just pop one out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fair and needed to use it twice.</li>
            <li> These showed color in my fair skin even tho i needed 3wipes for one application</li>
            <li> Good color within two or three uses.</li>
            <li> skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I think if you are struggling with the decision to order and try this product, go ahead and try it because the company really is good to work</li>
            <li> She loved them also and is going to order them.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fair and I have not been in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> They should be good to use when traveling.  </li>
            <li> These did not work out good for me.</li>
            <li> Gives good color.</li>
            <li> Good color somewhat patchy in some areas.  </li>
            <li> Good but streaky.  </li>
            <li> does not streak and lasts a good while</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame because the color is good.  </li>
            <li> These work great for giving my face and arms a nice bronze glow.</li>
            <li> no smell to the towels at all, which is good.</li>
            <li> ; however you will want to use a good exfoliate or body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> how good it looks once you try them all.</li>
            <li> It gave me a good tan</li>
            <li> They seem to work good</li>
            <li> But, I will say to its credit, the short-lived color is good (not orange and not streaky).</li>
            <li> They are priced with quantity that I feel is fair.</li>
            <li> Im fair</li>
            <li> They do streak some, they all do, but the color was good.</li>
            <li> It stayed on and looked good for about 3 days before I needed to touch up</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products and have tanned in beds and this seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> and it dries promptly with no residue and feels good afterwards.</li>
            <li> I think these are going to work good.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and easy and make sure you read directions and do what they say!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towelettes work best if I shave my legs and under my arms and wait a full day before I use them.</li>
            <li> It works great and is so easy to apply!</li>

            <li> The customer service is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> The color payoff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It fades nicely, you still have a nice tan all the way through.</li>
            <li> no streaks, no fuss, just a nice color.</li>
            <li> I kind of like it.</li>
            <li> The color looks nice.</li>
            <li> It does give a nice tan color.</li>
            <li> so I got kind of worried since I couldn&#x27;t see where I had already done</li>
            <li> After the 4 hours I noticed a really nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> No streaks and a nice even Tan is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Warm wind.</li>
            <li> I had a nice tan.</li>

            <li> This is a nice product and if used correctly you get a nice even glow.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if there was some way of telling how much you have applied.  </li>
            <li> Nice color,</li>
            <li> This company seems very concerned that one gets the best results of Towelettes.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend anyone wanting a nice tan without skin damage try this product.</li>
            <li> with your skin&#x27;s own chemistry for a long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;tan.</li>
            <li> Fades nicely to a bronze color after 1 or 2 washes</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell as well.</li>

            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Tanning products I have tried and really liked</li>

            <li> &quot; I have come across, I love that there are not any orange pigments in the color.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a huge box, so you get a good value</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, not sticky and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice tone but need more than one towel for even just top of body to ensure no blotchiness.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is probably the BEST self tanning wipes and method overall, I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I love the towelettes, they are very easy to apply and have no odor at all.</li>
            <li> The Glow2Go Tan Towels are convenient, easy to use, gives you a beautiful tan and leaves your skin feeling fresh and alive.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> In a way I was happy about that since this was going to be my first experience with self tanning.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> it seems too good to be true, it probably is not&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> a bit of orange does come through (I&#x27;m very light skinned</li>
            <li> Results weren&#x27;t streaky and were very light.</li>
            <li> Very light color.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
            <li> After applying Glow2Go to my legs one time, I had a very light tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light and have tried all sorts of self tanners</li>
            <li> I have very light colored skin</li>
            <li> Good price and quick results</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use towelettes.</li>
            <li> color is probably the best I have ever gotten from a product, there is no scent I can tell, and it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great product with no streaks, easy to apply right out of the shower all over the body</li>
            <li> Over all the product is ok.</li>
            <li> Better than spray-ons or lotions.  </li>
            <li> If you are just doing your face, you can use the same&lt;br /&gt;towelette more than once.</li>
            <li> you’re gonna love this product.</li>
            <li> It is the best out there, and I’m just so upset it was only released to the market this year!!!</li>
            <li> Thats more my fault than the product, but just a heads up</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right off the bat I fell in love with the box design.</li>
            <li> I can place over items on top of it and not have to move them be able to get one out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely in love with these.</li>
            <li> enjoyed</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more once I finish this box.</li>
            <li> With most tanners you have to wait up to 1 hour before it dries</li>
            <li> Like many have said, this product doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> :) and no I&#x27;m not knew at self tanning.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for being on the go or if you need something to bring on your travels as they are individually packed.</li>
            <li> Ok, this one is not for the beginners.</li>
            <li> tan I got is okay,</li>
            <li> What I like about it the most is the ease of use and not having to carry a tanning lotion bottle with you everywhere.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these tanning towelettes</li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> Tan Towels work better than this brand.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free and I agreed to give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I used a body scrub and made sure to get my elbows, knees, and ankles/feet.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to get in my tanning bed every time i want to tan.  </li>
            <li> love that the box turns into a dispenser for the towelette packets.</li>
            <li> So these photos (attached below) from top to bottom are: No tan, 1 application, and 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be keeping these on hand all winter, and unless they come up with something even more awesome, then next winter too!g 10 minutes to dress</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be keeping these on hand all winter, and unless they come up with something even more awesome, then next winter too!</li>
            <li> The towelettes come individually wrapped which makes them perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I tried to make sure I covered all spots on my legs, but after a day I could see spots where I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any color transfer on my bedding, or clothes which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to get the most applications out of my wipes</li>
            <li> Spray tan is my favorite way to get a tan.</li>
            <li> Spray tan is my favorite way to get a tan.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 10 and with that being said I would need a lot more then 2 of them.</li>
            <li> and I was more orange than tan.</li>
            <li> Clairens remain my favorite self tanner product.</li>
            <li> I received an email from the seller giving me tips to help me to achieve better results from the product.</li>
            <li> .this is an amazing self tanning product (make you look fabulous without the need to be hours ..exposed to the sun or the tanning bed ...</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li> Better than the competition and much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Definetly going to purchase more.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal is better with a thicker towel.</li>
            <li> I have used various self tanners and towelettes,  and this is the best.</li>
            <li> These do everything they say they will do and more..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had better directions for application.</li>
            <li> And no nasty self tanner smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is also awesome to use if you have stretch marks like me at the back of your legs.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and plan to use it in the summer more.</li>
            <li> I am sure lots of people love your product, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will be a return customer.  </li>
            <li> Most streaks out of any self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT)</li>
            <li> I tried /ordered this two times to make sure before i reviewed it.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t work correctly for me I could tell this is a better product than most.</li>
            <li> For my second go around, it went great!</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would be more like Loreal wipes.</li>
            <li> Product was ok.</li>
            <li> , The price is much better than Tan Towels as well</li>
            <li> I have used tan towels too and these are more streaky</li>
            <li> So much better than self tenning lotions.</li>
            <li> All that I want from a self tanner is good golden color.  </li>
            <li> Priced cheaper than a lot of others but cheaper isn&#x27;t better in this case....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great product, I didn&#x27;t want to miss it at this price!</li>
            <li> Make the towelette more stronger.</li>
            <li> then 2 more to correct streaks.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more??</li>
            <li> These type of products have been around for a bit over 10 years, and it seems that they are getting more and more refined.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation helps to give the skin a nice smooth surface on which to apply the towelettes.</li>
            <li> I use a hand scrub to be sure that my palms and nails aren&#x27;t tanned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love that these towelettes give me a build-able SAFE tan.</li>
            <li> I have a streak free, bronzed TAN!!&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided; all opinions are my own after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> TanTowel brand is better.</li>
            <li> Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I also think I get a better tan with Sublime.  </li>
            <li> like most self tanners.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I just love, love these towelettes.</li>
            <li> Color is also not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the 20 pack</li>
            <li> I also love the cut-out in the box where I can pull one wipe at a time.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these and recommending them to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Okay....</li>
            <li> box of Glow2Go contains 20 individually wrapped premium towelettes which are perfect for sunless tanning at home or on the go.</li>
            <li> I did not use gloves when applying the wipes, I just made sure to wash my hands &amp; wrists with soap after applying so</li>
            <li> I received a discount on this product, and for the value, even though I need to use more than 1</li>
            <li> The color is nice, light tan</li>
            <li> I will probably use them to touch up my face in between my applications of my favorite self tanner (banana boat).</li>
            <li> i love the color these give me.</li>
            <li> I just wish the wipe was better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on the self tanning products before I ordered.</li>
            <li> This would be the best self-tanner on the market if only it worked.</li>
            <li> The is a product that is layer able.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you try to wear some time of glove when applying these.</li>
            <li> Those are the part that will be most noticeable if not applied correctly.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with another reviewer that tan towels are much better.  </li>
            <li> Best to use to maintain color achieved with another product, especially if traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it will take to more times to get the color I want.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great packaging</li>
            <li> These are such a GREAT price!!</li>
            <li> Oh, BTW I have been using all sorts of tanning products for several years now, so I can say that tanning towels are the best option.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products when it comes to self tanning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and has.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> And that care and followup helps get better results from this product.  </li>
            <li> However, I prefer the self tanning lotion for a better result.</li>
            <li> Tanning and looking bright and colorful is something I am always after.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love these.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 4 hours, but the tan is perfectly even!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get nervous whenever I decide to try self tanning products, results can vary dramatically, and if those results aren&#x27;t good,...</li>
            <li> After about 4 hours you will be able to see if you want to go a bit darker and can apply another application if you like, then apply again about once a week to keep the color from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get a box of 20 individually packaged tanning towelettes, perfect for vacation time!</li>
            <li> Wait 10 minutes before getting dressed, and make sure you wash your hands after applying.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to see the stuff when I applied it on my skin</li>
            <li> After waiting four or more hours and you still want to be tanner, just grab another wipe and wipe on the area.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> No orange streaks, which I love.</li>
            <li> I love it .Easy</li>
            <li> The more often you use it, the darker you will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are waterproof, odorless and safe for your skin.</li>
            <li> Yet something that would not damage my skin, or cause the orange look that many products leave.  </li>
            <li> The package said not to get dressed for 10 minutes, and I waited for 15 just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I love this product, not to mention the customer service that comes with it.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic-Used them two days in a row and my hands and arms look lovely.</li>
            <li> I do love these Self Tan Towelettes.  </li>

            <li> So you will need more than they say.</li>
            <li> Arms &amp; legs were okay though.  </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I am sure some baby oil will take it off, (and if it doesn&#x27;t....</li>

            <li> It was easy to apply.</li>

            <li> - I&#x27;d buy up more RIGHT now to prep for my wedding in July!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this makes a light natural color not fake, not orange and is good if you are fair to light medium.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the first sunless product I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> honestly, I didn&#x27;t get my first results in 4 hours.</li>
            <li> so this is my first impression rose.</li>
            <li> I am trying to find a way to remove this, but have not been successful so far.</li>
            <li> What many of the reviewers say is true..</li>
            <li> After just the first wipe, I really liked the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your palms won&#x27;t turn dark, and you get really great coverage!</li>
            <li> they must have gotten high with reviewer number one because I&#x27;m pretty pungent and if my attempt at self taming isn&#x27;t noticeable by my beautiful orange palms</li>
            <li> but everything turned out fine.  </li>
            <li> The color is fine and stays put.  </li>
            <li> I saw other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t do anything for them, then I saw many that said they loved it!</li>
            <li> and you better make sure you get everything - fast!</li>
            <li> but everything turned out fine.</li>
            <li> .They go on smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> I normally use Tan Towels (by far THE best tan towels out there), but decided to give these a try based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> product for a quick on the go pick me up for a self tanner is a HIT!</li>
            <li> product for a quick on the go pick me up for a self tanner is a HIT!</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how convenient it was to be able to duck in the bathroom during nap time and quick do an application versus having to skip dinner while I run to the tanner.</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how convenient it was to be able to duck in the bathroom during nap time and quick do an application versus having to skip dinner while I run to the tanner.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li> Hopefully this stuff fades quick!</li>
            <li> On the plus side the color is really good, very natural.</li>
            <li> The color was ok but since it soaks in super fast, you need to make sure you get everything!</li>
            <li> You get more of a natural tan with these wipes and that is what I love about these towelettes!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you want more of an &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; experience, or have an event coming up and just want a quick tan, then Glow 2 Go is something worth considering!</li>
            <li> So far, this one has the best \\&quot;natural glow\\</li>
            <li> which is a huge bonus for me ??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for years, and am a huge fan of them.</li>
            <li> Tanning cloths arrived at my home via Amazon on time and product was accurate as described.  </li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> Its very eye catching</li>
            <li> In about 4 hours I noticed color starting to show and within 6 hours I had a great even tan.</li>
            <li> I could see it looking amazing if you really knew how to work it around the hands and</li>
            <li> The wipes do not rub smoothly on your skin and roll up when you use them.  </li>
            <li> The sound of crickets.</li>
            <li> These are half-body towelettes, which is great if you only want to do your arms, legs, or your face, and that way, you&#x27;re not wasting product.</li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Streak Free</li>
            <li> I noticed a light tan after just one use.</li>
            <li> I got these for free in order to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are also a bit light on product.</li>
            <li> It takes 3 or 4 applications to get a light medium color.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s great for winter, and deserves 4 starts for the convenience and color</li>
            <li> Price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I find myself struggling to get a smooth application.</li>
            <li> i like how smooth it goes o</li>
            <li> It also seems scent free</li>
            <li> fragrance is light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their slogan on the box reads &amp;#34;EVEN, STREAK FREE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just reapplied whenever I noticed it was getting too light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to traditional self-tanners.</li>
            <li> They have a light self tanner scent that does not transfer or linger once the wipes have been applied.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m bummed because I bought two boxes thinking it would be fabulous.</li>
            <li> It took me two times to get a light tan look</li>
            <li> and I have light skin color.</li>
            <li> and this is definitely another great product, even easier to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this golden tone.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, this box comes with 20</li>
            <li> Note, Glo to glo product is great for its price and QTY, but in terms of tanning color longevity, richness of the tan, and lesser surface area of the cloth, you get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li> I recommend exfoliating for a streak free application and look.</li>
            <li> I used on my whole body and it was a nice even tam color</li>
            <li> I really was impressed that an email was sent to me, along with the tanner, to ensure a proper application!</li>
            <li> and I was able to simply rub them over my skin and felt like I was getting good coverage because of the ease of the towlette.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Tan Towels which are by far superior.</li>
            <li> I had a comment on how my faced look nice and tan after only using it once so that was nice.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these because of all the great reviews, but they definitely were not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> NOT EVEN STREAKING VERY BUMMED!!!</li>
            <li> , I applied it two days later and it is fabulous!!!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything that night but the next day (which is always the day we look for streaks) she had a very nice glow to her skin and no streaks.</li>
            <li> Very Worth</li>
            <li> and it left a very nice shade.  </li>
            <li> I can do my entire body with just 2 cloths which is very nice</li>
            <li> A quick easy tan with a wipe</li>
            <li> My legs are the most important, so I did that first.</li>
            <li> Just started a few days ago - love the convenience, the non-greasy feel and the beautiful glow</li>
            <li> Super convenient and easy.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to get out of the shower and do a quick wipe with the towelette.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to get 20 decent size tan towelettes in this set.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell most products do and it leaves my skin a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> the towels are super easy to use, no streaks and almost no odor.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to take with you on the go</li>
            <li> Other than that, a truly great product and definitely worth the $!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, a truly great product and definitely worth the $!!</li>
            <li> new favorite!</li>
            <li> you ladies know what I mean)&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on my face which I was nervous at first but am glad I did because it eliminated foundation from my routine for  bit ( super easy)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you want more of an &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; experience, or have an event coming up and just want a quick tan, then Glow 2 Go is something worth considering!thing</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good self-tanning product that is easy to use, and no fuss, I would definitely recommend that you check this product</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good self-tanning product that is easy to use, and no fuss, I would definitely recommend that you check this product</li>
            <li> ( make sure you pat yourself dry really good)</li>
            <li> The wipes are half body size (most tanning wipes come like this) which is great</li>
            <li> I love how easy they are to use and how fast they are to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically foolproof, provides a nice natural glow, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have found a better tanner in wipes in my whole life!</li>
            <li> I was offered to review this and was so excited because I had never tried towels</li>
            <li> So, when I received these towelettes I was excited but leery to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is light and smells like suntan lotion, not bad.  </li>
            <li> My hands never got stained either .I was offered to review this and was so excited because I had never tried towels before.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Used 2 applications for a rich tan - just what I needed at the start of my beach vacation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe seasoned self-tanner users would have better luck with this</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> First off I love the box.</li>
            <li> A nice, natural golden glow. :)</li>
            <li> Follow up to my original review.....</li>
            <li> I love this product first time I used it</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get a significant tan, it takes me 4 applications, but then it isn&#x27;t even&lt;br</li>
            <li> exactly how I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have definitley tried products in the past that I wasn’t impressed with.</li>
            <li> So, my mistake, is now something we can laugh at together!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried them all - this new product is truly the best in the market today- with no streaking, no blotching, no horrible orange color you get from using other products!</li>
            <li> I ended up using 3 on well buffed clean, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> They promise a golden glow (not an orange rind), easy application, and streak-free results.</li>
            <li> Before each application it is advised to clean and exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I am confident enough to go for a walk on the beach!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on quick, smooth and even, convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best self tanning product I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you wish to have the best color out there and not have your skin go dry.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not found anything better when it comes to the appearance of the tan!</li>
            <li> I did not have any streaks and was able to get a pretty good tan after using following this process twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment!!!</li>
            <li> These towelettes are so easy to use and are just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Also whenever you get a spray tan or what not you should always exfoliate take off that top layer of skin for an easy smooth application that looks and feels natural.  </li>
            <li> also had a hard time getting everything perfectly even.</li>
            <li> - I simply love the fact I don’t have to open the box but simply pull one towelette each time which makes my bathroom closet just a tiny-bit more organized ;-) and the results are fast, reliable and gives you the perfect tan.</li>
            <li> on the fifth wipe I noticed it had more moisture than the others and went on much easier.  </li>
            <li> nothing like paying for something and not getting the full effect.  </li>
            <li> , now how cool it that???</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised how nice it looked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used creams and sprays, both for full and gradual self-tanning, but not a towelette.</li>
            <li> Then it left my skin sticky and it didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> The tan will only be as good as the skin prep.</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li> Not as much product saturated into these towels as tan towels like Tan Towels better</li>
            <li> but I can see the full affect in about 6 to 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice natural and gradual tan .</li>
            <li> Used one towelette so far and achieved a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I did this over and over in a span of three days, have used most of the towels, and absolutely nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised how nice it looked.</li>
            <li> it created a warm tan, but I had streaks where you could see the difference between my natural skin color and the manufactured tan from the towlettes.</li>
            <li> When I was out in full sun</li>
            <li> Overall a good product for the cost</li>
            <li> a streak free golden glow that gives the illusion of color without exposing my skin to the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>
            <li> Since I wear a full bathing suit I don&#x27;t do a full body tan just arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a full 10 minutes that I wait to put on my pajama&#x27;s</li>
            <li> (really 4 would probably be better</li>
            <li> I did my entire body and was feeling good about the product,</li>
            <li> am giving your company and these Sunless Self Tanning Tan Towels my highest recommendation.eel good about my appearance when I am out and about in the land of daily sunshine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just make sure to shower and exfoliate really well before using.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, was even better than described.  </li>
            <li> and I had a nice soft glow.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but will be searching for an alternative.</li>
            <li> which is wonderful because I can get pretty pale during the winter months &amp; the coverage is buildable-</li>
            <li> A little color would do them some good!</li>
            <li> The first being that it does not have a strong smell and</li>
            <li> The first being that it does not have a strong smell and</li>
            <li> The directions are pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Would probably be great on the face/neck/chest, but anything other than that, I won&#x27;t trust.</li>
            <li> I have applied it once daily since the initial application to make sure that I maintain that beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different ones and this one is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> Towels give good color, but kind of hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Knowing this, I am even more impressed because I thought it was going to take many, many separate occasions to get the tan to a dark enough shade; but now I know that I just have to wipe it 2 or 3X in the same sitting to get the color darker.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and friendly emails!</li>
            <li> Hyped to be such a great product, was surprised that the towels do not apply easily.  </li>
            <li> My thighs are streaky from the towelette drying to quickly.</li>
            <li> Would be great for travel or a fast touch up if your going out later that evening.  </li>
            <li> I would estimate one self-tanning towel per appendage and these come in a box of 20, so they go quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its quick.</li>
            <li> Its quick.</li>
            <li> The color was mild.</li>
            <li> Drys quick without worrying about getting any on your clothes</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and i like that.</li>
            <li> Luckily they do not go on with color.</li>
            <li> The color is not just a brownish tan, but a warm, golden, natural color.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and work well.</li>
            <li> However, I am a tall person and the towels lose their moisture/tanning effect quickly.</li>
            <li> She was high, had to be, because the most luxuriously tanned part of my body are the palms of hands.</li>
            <li> As long as the price is good, so am I.</li>
            <li> Works very well and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love tanning, I live in Florida, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;GLOW2GO is a new and innovative sunless tanning towelette.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When I applied it, it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I can say one give a nice soft not fake looking tan.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it was to use these wipes without any real work.</li>
            <li> This product scared me at first because I am very fair and pale.</li>
            <li> and honestly I don&#x27;t see how you could apply this evenly without using many, many wipes to completely coat your skin and make it very wet.</li>
            <li> No fake orange coloring!</li>
            <li> on a cruise in April these will be the first thing I pack!</li>
            <li> REALLY making me not want leave the house for  anything!!</li>
            <li> REALLY making me not want leave the house for  anything!!</li>
            <li> They really work!!</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used all of the towelettes from the first yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the L&#x27;Oréal towelettes, but once my skin was prepared and used to the product, BANG!  </li>
            <li> NO weird brown hands after either!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I will defiantly buy more of their products and these wipes!</li>
            <li> I was pretty stoked to try these!</li>
            <li> I have a new puppy so with all the bruises I have on my legs from him plus my blinding whiteness these have really come in handy.</li>
            <li> I will tell you this is the most easy to apply especially for me</li>
            <li> I really only wanted to get a nice glow, I wasnt looking to get super tan, and Glow 2 Go</li>
            <li> Love the color but the application is not as easy as a similar product.  </li>
            <li> I know, the smell is pretty strong at first but soon after it goes away.</li>
            <li> You put on a  Natural Healthy Overnight Indoor Quick Tan for Legs, Arms and Face.</li>
            <li> so far the many many self tanning products i have tried have pretty much turned me orange.</li>
            <li> but even though I&#x27;m pretty sure I did a double pass on a few spots, the results were even and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and its hard for me to get a tan.</li>
            <li> very fair skinned and its hard for me to get a tan, as I have Lupus and can not go in the sun.</li>
            <li> These are incredible fast and convenient with now mess.</li>
            <li> my shipping was fast and very well packed ..and another very important detail ...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Thermalabs shipped quickly and the individually packaged towelettes arrived in a very attractive box.&lt;br /&gt;Anxious to hit the beach, I took the time to read the easy to understand directions on the back of the packet and crossed my fingers that the reviews I had read were true.&lt;br /&gt;After showering and exfoliating my skin, I used gloves to wipe down my legs, arms and torso in even strokes as directed and waited to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I’m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free in exchanged for this reviewida</li>
            <li> and I’m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free in exchanged for this review</li>
            <li> self tanners I would be comfortable using one of these towelettes before work because I have confidence/experience in how real the tan looks.</li>
            <li> (looks natural, not orange, more of a lavender undertone).</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
            <li> Thermalabs stated that 1 in 1,000 may not see results, but they back their product up 100% guarantee if they do not work with your body&#x27;s own amino</li>
            <li> No dirty ankles either.  </li>
            <li> , it’s a golden tan, not orange.</li>
            <li> That has no bearing on my rating or review of them, this is my honest opinion.a couple days and did it a 3rd time.</li>
            <li> , it’s a golden tan, not orange.</li>
            <li> but for me it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different self-tanners and while I liked the idea of a towelette</li>
            <li> I got some nice color on my face and upper extremities.</li>
            <li> and I want to look golden</li>
            <li> towelette comes individually wrapped which is really a nice perk.</li>
            <li> This product is worth trying.</li>
            <li> recommendation is these are worth a try</li>
            <li> It is nice to not worry about ruining your skin potentially by the weather.</li>
            <li> I have fair pink skin and always end up orangey, but not with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get to tan just a natural healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this productese because I do like the color it gives me</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product</li>
            <li> I got a nice deep tan after apply the product.  </li>
            <li> I will get better at it as I go along as I can see I need to be a bit more careful when doing around my ankle/feet area.</li>
            <li> applied these two days after shaving, and wasn&#x27;t able to wait the 10min after applying, because I had a three year old who required my attention.</li>
            <li> Work very well, would just recommend bigger towelettes, overall very happy with results!!!</li>
            <li> One wipe is good for half of your body so you&#x27;ll need two to do your full body.</li>
            <li> Yes you get twice as many as some other tan towel products, but you have to use twice as many.</li>
            <li> They are easy to open and easy to read instructions.</li>
            <li> I have tried other things from their company and have loved them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: I used these right after drying off after a shower.</li>
            <li> right leg, right arm, abdomen, chest and face.</li>
            <li> used these right after drying off after a shower.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use gloves because one reviewer said she washed get hands right after and didn&#x27;t have orange palms.</li>
            <li> You may not see results right away</li>
            <li> I showered and used a towel right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> On the positive, this product provides the most natural tan color ever!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure since it was my first time using this product but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Great price for this many towelettes; double the amount of another brand for half the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like the towels, easy to use, no Streaks and works better than the local tanning salons.</li>
            <li> and 2 I am Italian, I tan very easy</li>
            <li> There is no orange, and I started with very fair, dry, almost white skin.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to be able to get the hang of it without any missed spots but over all it is a great product and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have light skin with some slight redness on my face and this gives a nice even sun kissed glow.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and although they are not my favorite, but because they are half the price of my favorite Tan Towels, I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> The product was able to tanned my wiped areas within 24 hours but noticed in comparison to Loreal&#x27;s tanning products in the Amazon catalog, Loreal produced a deeper tan with longer sustainability, and have more tanning surface area of cloth but is twice the price and half of the qty.  </li>
            <li> I am only using these on my face and the color is perfect and seems to last a while and fade naturally.  </li>
            <li> Because of their small size, they&#x27;re great to keep in your bag or with your makeup bag for travel.</li>
            <li> After a full 24 hours I&#x27;m not seeing much color.</li>
            <li> color development is pretty, it is a golden glow, not orange</li>
            <li> I buy only organic and natural products (food, cosmetics,etc,) and finally I was so happy to find self tanning products which will answer my concerns!</li>
            <li> The lotion feels so good and smooth , I actually replaced my regular for this one!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about how people loved it  people raved about how dark it makes u</li>
            <li> Streaks all down my legs but the color I did get was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> First world problems right there.</li>
            <li> I have used all those sunless self tanning gels and creams but they always make me look orange, streaky, or it goes on darker in certain spots!</li>
            <li> This one takes less than 10 minutes and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> My skin used to tan easy in natural sun.</li>
            <li> The fabric material only holds shape in one direction, but overall these are great for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to keep rubbing it and waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li> Now, things are much improved, and products will give you a nicer looking, more natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of Glow2Go Tanning Towelettes by Thermalabs to try out.</li>
            <li> These tanning towels arrived quickly, followed by a very informative email.</li>
            <li> ( did I mention they shipped super fast</li>
            <li> The towelette dries out quickly, it leaves tons of streaks, and does not give you much color.</li>
            <li> it dries fast no streaking and blends super ...</li>
            <li> Noticed some streaking on hands and arms - again better using more than less!</li>
            <li> I usually follow-up with a light lotion to be sure I am streak free</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy how natural it looks!</li>
            <li> Used more per body part the second time around and still didn&#x27;t get it right.</li>
            <li> Love the tan towels EASY not to dark &amp; I just reordered</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to the MANY great reviews I read, unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Very natural and not orange!!!</li>
            <li> they actually called me to thank me for my loyalty and to make sure</li>
            <li> The colour truly is natural looking and streak free.</li>
            <li> It was just enough color to give it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> , many times I&#x27;ve repeated the process 4hours later.</li>
            <li> which is EXACTLY what I got.</li>
            <li> These are my first wipes, though.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying some more since I have a problem getting a tan</li>
            <li> The second I got them, I exfoliated my legs and made sure that there were no stubs.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got orange finger cleavage and it looks like you&#x27;ve eaten a fist-full of Cheetos. ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> will last longer and be more even.</li>
            <li> I could compare the before and after the first application there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve figured out 3 applications is exactly how tan I want to look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting a picture up of my arm about 6 hours after the first application when I noticed I missed a spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve figured out 3 applications is exactly how tan I want to look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting a picture up of my arm about 6 hours after the first application when I noticed I missed a spot.</li>
            <li> it finally showing up after I worked a 10 hour shift and with 2 more days of 10 hour shifts all I did was climb into bed and sleep.</li>
            <li> it finally showing up after I worked a 10 hour shift and with 2 more days of 10 hour shifts all I did was climb into bed and sleep.</li>
            <li> Obviously these towelettes seem like a better deal</li>
            <li> I highly recommended ..5stars!!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The size of the towel is more than enough to cover my body from the waist up--including my bald head.</li>
            <li> I wore rubber gloves and was able to do my entire body with one</li>
            <li> I really like these tanning towelettes!  </li>
            <li> After the first use</li>
            <li> And I noticed that nothing happened at first yet after about 10-20 minutes</li>
            <li> but I followed the instructions exactly, exfoliating before and avoiding lotions and all that, then trying to apply in even strokes...</li>
            <li> This is a stellar product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go to a tanning bed because I am aware of the danger of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I guess if you are using these in the winter and aren&#x27;t showing your back off in a bikini or halter top</li>
            <li> With these towelettes they come in a pack of 20, so you can use them 1 to 2 times a day its your choice , they are safe to use, only thing is they have the sun tan lotion smell to them.</li>
            <li> Each towelette will produce Quick,Even,Streak Free Natural Looking Tan</li>
            <li> Just like the packaging states, if you want a darker tan, just use another 4 hours after the first treatment.  </li>
            <li> EVEN USED THREE WIPES FOR MY FIRST APPLICATION.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident that i applied the product properly but it still did not apply an even coating on my legs, feet, or toes.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions the first time I used it but could not go without shaving my legs to use this so unsure if this is why it didn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> Used first time yesterday and have streaks today.  </li>
            <li> First, they recommend that you bathe/shower and also exfoliate (but no shaving).</li>
            <li> work fast!</li>
            <li> These really work!</li>
            <li> The first time I used one I tried to cover years of paleness, and</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve for sure when you are using these wipes because you do not realize you missed a spot until hours later.</li>
            <li> hope you like Glow2go as much as me!</li>
            <li> Bye ;)</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t wait for spring and having a tan the first day I pull out a skirt.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOTICE THESE ARE ODOR FREE AND GO ON CLEAR</li>
            <li> but if you arenervous like me then try your legs first ( its winter</li>
            <li> and had my first spray tan.</li>
            <li> I didn’t do that the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Guys!</li>
            <li> I love that the wipes are individually packaged so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because I wish they were bigger or had more product saturated in the cloths.</li>
            <li> With one wipe I&#x27;m only able to do a section of my body.</li>
            <li> I experimented with one the first night I got them and did one leg with one wipe</li>
            <li> Hoping to get more after my next application.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple applications to try to enhance the color and it only made the streaks more prominent.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting more then do your body and you can come back or wait another day and apply another one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> :) I tried one out and left it overnight</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> First I showered and then apply on my face and body.</li>
            <li> will admit I was scared at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After first wipe, I didn&#x27;t have darker palms or knees&lt;</li>
            <li> They work I will order again thank you so much !</li>
            <li> The others however cover more skin with one towel so, financially  those would be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different tanning lotions, sprays, tanning beds, and baking in the sun.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wait until you see the tan before using a second wipe.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wait until you see the tan before using a second wipe.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to see such a difference with just one application.</li>
            <li> I used 2 towelettes and I was able to do my full body, if you wanted you could just use 1 towelette and do partial body.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> So I end up needing 5 towelettes for my first once over on my body.</li>
            <li> The customer service is great, but I am not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> Well.........I wont be able to wear shorts, dresses, skirts, or short sleeved ANYTHING for probably a month!</li>
            <li> you really TAN!</li>
            <li> and no doubt it&#x27;s much healthier way and safer!</li>
            <li> My first application, I used 4 wipes and since then, I have used two at a time for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> The good news about that was, even every few days applying, I could tell it lasted in between applications.</li>
            <li> I even gave a few packs to a friend of mine and she tried the product and LOVED it as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an easy and safe way to have a little color and be safe with my skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and very natural glow!</li>
            <li> Right now, I am six months pregnant, and very white, so it was a clean palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to good reviews.</li>
            <li> The Glow 2 Go product looks natural, it is easy to apply,and has fast results.</li>
            <li> I actually thinks these are fine for smaller areas, like face and neck, but not so great for larger areas.</li>
            <li> Warning: After reading so many good reviews I got a little hasty and only used two wipes for my whole body and saw 3hrs</li>
            <li> I love the color that it leaves and the concept, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I have to say.</li>
            <li> I used 2 towelettes every other day for a total of 3 applications and it produced a beautiful bronze tan!!&lt;br /&gt;Things to remember;</li>
            <li> the dry out very quickly!</li>
            <li> Two applications should be enough for most people if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, dark tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only a warm natural tan, even on face, but no fake tan smell.  </li>
            <li> I also love the dispense it allows you to take out only as much as you need.</li>
            <li> If only I could tell how much and where I have applied it I would gladly give this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many self-tanning lotions only to turn a very unnatural orange color.</li>
            <li> I  really doubt it&#x27;s possible to do more than just your legs with one towelette.</li>
            <li> Very consciencious seller...have received several follow ups to make sure I like the product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Glow2Go to anyone who wants to get a sexy tan without the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> You could definitely tell that I started at the bottom of my leg and worked my way up because the top of my thigh had much lighter color than the bottom of my leg.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using a good scrub beforehand and following up 4 hours later with another towel to intensify color.  </li>
            <li> Have to use two towels in order to make sure your whole body is covered and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;4&#x27;, 135 lbs.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are like wet wipes and aren&#x27;t greasy or sticky, very easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> These towelettes add very little color with each application, but the color is good.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> and  I was not influenced in any way to write a positive review</li>
            <li> These positive reviews have to be a joke.  </li>
            <li> It really gets the job done with a very natural look!!!  </li>
            <li> So you really need to plan ahead what you&#x27;re gonna do first with this ones!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took several applications prior to my noticing a difference &amp; my tan was minimal at best.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up on having color through the winter.  </li>
            <li> First it takes two towels to cover your whole body, not one.</li>
            <li> NO streaking - no weird brushes or mitts to use - seriously fast application -</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Cons- towelettes dry out quickly and doesn&#x27;t smoothly apply.</li>
            <li> 3 stars is for the excellent customer service and the nice color ( not orange and fake looking) but even with all the tips followed and a second application these left streaks.</li>
            <li> skin feels soft and has the appearance of a natural tan without the sunburn or the risk of skin cancer from too much time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Thermalabs for enabling me to feel good about my appearance when I am out and about in the land of daily sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall highly recommended and definitely my favorite self tanner today.</li>
            <li> I normally use the St. Tropez bronzing mousse and I can say that the color these gave me was right up there with that well known brand.</li>
            <li> While applying it goes on clear and dries quickly</li>
            <li> While applying it goes on clear and dries quickly</li>
            <li> exactly so it&#x27;s easy to miss tiny spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think there are less expensive options out there that work better for a tan, but this IS good for a quick and easy glow-</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, and the directions were as simple as 1,2,3.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily with two to three cloths for entire body.</li>
            <li> I also find the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as similar items on the market.</li>
            <li> Not the fun cool smelling ones, the actual lotion.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the single pack pull out option.</li>
            <li> but it does have a certain smell.</li>
            <li> One wipe covers a large percentage of your skin.</li>
            <li> I ran into a few issues, which means more tips, guys!</li>
            <li> They are just fine - not enough product on the wipes in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I tried to get by on one and ended up color showing on the first leg I did mainly</li>
            <li> so I tried to pay good attention  to apply it evenly leaving my knees and feet since I know that they can be hard to tan without making them look unnaturally darker.</li>
            <li> So, when I originally I thought that this box would give me 20 applications of a golden glow.. now I am down to just 5 more, and that&#x27;s only if I want to self-tan my legs and nothing</li>
            <li> You use only 1-2 wipes and if you need to re-apply to get a little more tone, wait 4 hours and apply 1 more towelette.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple, so I started right away!  </li>
            <li> I was able to easily cover my entire leg and part of the other with 1 towel.</li>
            <li> I used about 4-5 on my whole body.  </li>
            <li> I really like the color</li>
            <li> I am not one to tan very well.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I got carried away and got my wrist too much</li>
            <li> I think it is always commendable and worth mentioning when a product offers this type of commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is always commendable and worth mentioning when a product offers this type of commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> No mistakes allowed since the product is transparent and you do not see where you are going, and the towelette dries up fast.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very convient for those that dont get much sun</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs the day that I ordered so that My legs were ready for the tan towels when I got them.</li>
            <li> It took 3 towels to do my whole body and face.  </li>
            <li> so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gradual, which is my preferred method.</li>
            <li> the whole application process was always a pain in the rear.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t too much to start off with, I&#x27;d say that it is build-able with use.</li>
            <li> really like the results I got with the Glow 2 Go.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not paying much attention to detail when I&#x27;m applying either.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I don’t know why, but I assumed one wipe would get my whole body.</li>
            <li> and I really noticed a difference then.</li>
            <li> The Jergen’s lotion has a much stronger odor and takes longer to get results.</li>
            <li> The Jergen’s lotion has a much stronger odor and takes longer to get results.</li>
            <li> Also although I think the product needs some work I do really</li>
            <li> Also although I think the product needs some work I do really</li>
            <li> so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This felt like a 50/50 purchase, I was one of those who it didn&#x27;t really tan much at all.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this to anyone needing a tan for a couple of days to a week.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to ontrol amount  than liquids or sprays.</li>
            <li> Had a question regarding use, called number given and talked to a REAL person.</li>
            <li> However, This really streaked my legs.</li>
            <li> I really took my time to apply it</li>
            <li> I really like these towelettes.</li>
            <li> It really disguises it.</li>
            <li> These  work very well.</li>
            <li> These towelettes work really well.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> it really doesnt matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that in fact they do really work.</li>
            <li> It took 3 towels to do my whole body and face.</li>
            <li> so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.</li>
            <li> so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.</li>
            <li> I also exfoliated before applying, but my stomach got very patchy, but thats just how my skin is</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Now this could very well have been just my compete lack of knowledge on the self tan thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6 foot tall and probably should have used the whole box to cover my flabulous self but decided 2 would do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of weeks and it really is tricky to keep the wipe from crumpling up when you put it on</li>
            <li> And came out very streaky.</li>
            <li> , so i wanted to try it out to see if it really made.</li>
            <li> it was really noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I still really like them and will keep buying them</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But,  the tanning cloth is much thinner and flimsier than Tan Towel.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see how much you&#x27;re putting on or where you&#x27;ve put it, so it takes practice.</li>
            <li> Threw the rest away after my vacation and just plan on tanning for real.</li>
            <li> Got my order fast would order from them again, will tell others about them too</li>
            <li> I do wash my hands very well as soon as I am done applying my tanner.</li>
            <li> but I have to use 3 towels to do my whole body,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these tan towelettes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole box and can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> drying time is fast.</li>
            <li> I like to do straight out of the shower</li>
            <li> Do your whole body though</li>
            <li> Thermalabs  self-tanning towelettes work very well</li>
            <li> These towelettes are very well made</li>
            <li> It was also not streaky and very even.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much tanner my arms looked.</li>
            <li> I really could see the diffrence in one application.</li>
            <li> I was very scared,</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the wipes do not hold much solution.</li>
            <li> For my whole body to receive even coverage</li>
            <li> I now have a whole box of these just sitting here.</li>
            <li> Also I have to use 3 wipes to do my whole body</li>
            <li> The company really cares about it&#x27;s product and their customers.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found it yet, any input would be greatly appreciated..</li>
            <li> I did not notice much shade difference after using 2 packets on my face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for any and all people!</li>
            <li> I really like that there were no streaks, even though when I was applying it I couldn&#x27;t tell where I had already applied.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I spent most of the morning trying to remove my streaks and splotches with lemon juice and baking soda in the bath tub</li>
            <li> Just wipe on but not to much around your elbows knees and hands.</li>
            <li> I like that because it&#x27;s easier for me to control where, and how much color I want.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that delivers a natural golden color, and doesn&#x27;t streak, and this product does it all.  </li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t like being hounded four times from the seller about how much I like these things, and how to use a tanning wipe.  </li>
            <li> The company, Thermalabs is very helpful as they send email tips on how to use these towelettes.</li>
            <li> you would need 4 or 5 towels to do your whole body..</li>
            <li> The towel dries out very quickly as it isn&#x27;t very damp to begin with.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really wash your hands after or wear a glove.</li>
            <li> Drys fast.</li>
            <li> I really like having this tanned glow and</li>
            <li> but my tan really hides them.</li>
            <li> so if I was going to do my whole body I would probably have to use 2 of them.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only put on one coat so far love it.</li>
            <li> The company offers a 100% money back guarantee as well that you will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li> The company offers a 100% money back guarantee as well that you will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Delivered earlier than expected and in good condition.</li>
            <li> and I have like the few I have tried, but it is a one day kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice tan color no orange, no weird smell, last for a long time 3/4 days.</li>
            <li> As far as smell, I think Fake Bake is the best.</li>
            <li> On time shipping product works well need to use it for few day for nice tan</li>
            <li> It would be better if I did one wipe for left arm and leg, another for right side and another for back and front.</li>
            <li> I can NEVER get the lotions or sprays to look natural!!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these self-tanning single use towelettes!!</li>
            <li> Compared to other similar priced wipes out there it’s a good price and works well.</li>
            <li> Compared to other similar priced wipes out there it’s a good price and works well.</li>
            <li> for me, honestly, this was not easy to use at all.</li>
            <li> I have used Tan Towels in the past and was happy with them, but I believe this product produces at least the same results, and perhaps superior results to Tan Towels, and at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned my whole life, born &amp; raised near beach in Florida, but after cancer scare &amp; removal, I&#x27;ve certainly learned my lesson about &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34; in the sun!</li>
            <li> It seems other reviewers had better experiences with using all over the body.  </li>
            <li> I used only one and saw a significant result.</li>
            <li> It is also really reasonably priced and the color developed pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> Unlike normal (streaky!)</li>
            <li> (it sounds like a lot, but recommended dosage is 1,000-5,000 mgs for what I take it for, it&#x27;s completely safe as an amino acid) upon arising every morning, on an empty stomach with B6 vitamin &amp; look at all the benefits!</li>
            <li> I guess they would be good for just a touch up or a very small body part.</li>
            <li> 70% Organic Body Cream Formula for Light, Pale, Fair, Medium, Olive or Dark</li>
            <li> I do have a few streaks after doing a double application with the four hour space between, but it us not drastic and feel I will be able to correct it easily today.</li>
            <li> The towelettes don&#x27;t have any strong odor and by the time my skin is dry there was no odor at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product very natural color lasts much longer than I expected</li>
            <li> I noticed more streaking with this, since it dries so quick it’s hard to tell where I got it.</li>
            <li> I noticed more streaking with this, since it dries so quick it’s hard to tell where I got it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice tan color, with very little self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stays on quite a while&lt;br /&gt;I havent had any streaks or anything when I got caught in the rain&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive enough to be used on the face&lt;br /&gt;Comes with clear, easy to follow directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you let yourself dry completely before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> and they also are really cool because they come in individually wrapped packages so you can use them anywhere, anytime.</li>
            <li> I’m using these every 3-4 days with some Jergen’s lotion in between when I’m cool enough to tolerate</li>
            <li> I’m using these every 3-4 days with some Jergen’s lotion in between when I’m cool enough to tolerate</li>
            <li> looks so natural like after real tanning on a beach!</li>
            <li> I have a suggestion: alternate where you start wiping (i.e. start at left leg, then next time start at right leg, etc), because the first wipe puts on the most of the tanning solution.</li>
            <li> I think this was merely though my own lack of personal knowledge on using it, as the color of the tan was wonderful, a natural color, not the fake orange bake so many self tanners have.</li>
            <li> The company claims that the tanning towelettes  are; Quick, even, streak free, natural looking tan, and show  within less then 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Like most self tanning toweletts you do get the slight &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found these because I can now get my &amp;#34;high end brand&amp;#34; tan at way less then</li>
            <li> These toweletts are either too dry or they dont have anything on them to make them smoothly glide on the skin.</li>
            <li> You need 1 for the top half and one for the bottom</li>
            <li> You pay less for this but use more.</li>
            <li> This week I have been lucky enough to review the Therma labs Glow2Go self tanning towelettes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, I&#x27;d say it takes only a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is decent, but it does not go on even with this type of wipe.  </li>
            <li> They are much smaller and the instructions say that you should not unwrap and use them folded up and slowly open to do more parts of your body.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> (one per leg and butt cheek, one for both stomach and back, and one for chest, arms, neck and face for a total of 4 wipes) I got a much better results.</li>
            <li> and I look decently darker.</li>
            <li> But they do provide some decent color.  </li>
            <li> They roll up and crumple (for instance the ones by L&#x27;Oreal are a thicker fabric and wipe more evenly and are enough for an entire body and face).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll definitely switch back to Sun Laboratories for the summer :)</li>
            <li> color looks realistic, not orange.</li>
            <li> I have tried different self tanners and this is definitely the easiest and my favorite.</li>
            <li> Next time I will use one towelette for each leg individually in the hopes of seeing a better result.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on its mostly decent reviews.</li>
            <li> It looks like my tan at its best - which is hard for my pale skin to achieve.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and have little to no smell - I have never been aware of an odor at all.  </li>
            <li> This is a product for those who want a light sunkissed look, and I do mean light.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these and will be purchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product .I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone😍</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;But I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tan towels and they are far better.  </li>
            <li> These little towels can cover a lot of area, and have better coverage.  </li>
            <li> I wish it got a little better coverage per towel and had a way I could see which areas I got.</li>
            <li> I wish it got a little better coverage per towel and had a way I could see which areas I got.</li>
            <li> One thing I would like to mention is that if you’re not a skinny little girl you’ll need 2 towelettes to cover most of your body</li>
            <li> Might need to read a little more before I attempt</li>
            <li> The product claimed to be 100% streak free and waterproof and I was curious about this as I have always ended up with streaks.</li>
            <li> was I wrong they looked great.</li>
            <li> It gave me a very even and natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> this made my skin very orange colored not like a natural bronze</li>
            <li> This is because it goes on clear and dries fast.</li>
            <li> One application provides a shade up from your normal colour.</li>
            <li> I did a second application after the required four hours and the colour was nice and dark.</li>
            <li> also love the idea that I can stick a few tan towelettes in my purse or luggage and get a glow wherever I am.</li>
            <li> If you start off with all the top layers of dead skin gone the tan</li>
            <li> These self Tan Towelettes are just as good if not better than Tan Towels and at a lesser price.  </li>
            <li> The package says to wait 24 hours after shaving to apply, which since I shave legs daily pretty much means never.  </li>
            <li> I had to use it a few times to even it out and get some more color.</li>
            <li> Only had these for a few days but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I even reviewed all the instructions to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.</li>
            <li> I did use two towels for my full body for the first application but only 1 the second time.</li>
            <li> If you want more color just keep applying until you reach the desired amounts and after that then just maintain every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want more color just keep applying until you reach the desired amounts and after that then just maintain every few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The advantage to the self tan towelettes is it works quicker than lotion, without the normal tanning odor.</li>
            <li> They did not make her skin look orange and gave her a golden looking tan that last for about a week.  </li>
            <li> you can repeat few more times if you like to recieve darker color.</li>
            <li> The color is good but the towels are a wee bit too thin.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get a good wipe with them, maybe because they are too thin?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am living in an extremely cold climate and not having good luck with tanning booths or lotions this has been an awesome product for myself.</li>
            <li> The color itself was fine, however due to the fact it was so streaky, we never continued beyond 3 separate applications to see what a deeper tan would look like.  </li>
            <li> my skin was so extremely white, while I did see a slight difference after the first application, it was more of a glow than what could be considered a tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really have no patience to call them for a refund, but seriously hey need to do better packaging of certain items and not just their books...</li>
            <li> Maybe I was already too tan to start with, and this works better on pale skin?  </li>
            <li> The left is before I used the product, and the right is 4 hours after application.</li>
            <li> I did reapply twice to get a darker tan since I am really white right now, and still didn&#x27;t get any orangey color.  </li>
            <li> Just wash right away, totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These go on easy and you can pick how dark you want to be.</li>
            <li> but this certain smell has been my least favorite (it almost smells like I&#x27;ve been laying in a tanning bed).</li>
            <li> They come in handy little individually wrapped packages so you can use them anywhere, anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 4 hours I noticed a really nice glow, however I wanted to go a little darker and applied a second coat.  </li>
            <li> I know how to use the new product</li>
            <li> But i didn&#x27;t mind trying something new.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I heard about the launch of this new product in one of the forums and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt trying it for the speciail price they offered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s around this time every year that I try a new self-tan, so I hereby dub this month &amp;#34;Self-Tanuary&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Keep in mind since I am new at self tanning</li>
            <li> live in Florida</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I am new to using self-tanners</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I live in south Florida</li>
            <li> Thermalabs asked me to review their new Glow 2 Go Sunless Tanning Towlettes.</li>
            <li> As a brand new user, I chose wipes as opposed to cream or spray</li>
            <li> Tan towels have been my fav but figured I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li> I heard about the launch of this new product on Facebook and got it while it was on 50% off sale</li>
            <li> and then you can see the new color of your skin.</li>
            <li> So being that I am whiter than paste, and I live where the sun don&#x27;t shine.</li>
            <li> The cloths are very easy to work with, and it&#x27;s hard to believe they will work as well as they do.</li>
            <li> The price makes this a super deal as long as the color holds out like I hope!</li>
            <li> I typically use the Fake Bake Flawless spray or the St. Tropez mousse and apply with an applicator mitt and have been much happier with those products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towelettes do dry out quickly so</li>
            <li> so DO NOT be ALARMED as it will dry quickly anyways.</li>
            <li> I moved to SE Florida a year ago and would never have thought I would be in need of a self tanner, however I suffered from agoraphobia and was unable to leave my home and enjoy the sunshine here like I thought I would be able to when I relocated from Wisconsin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I CAN get the product on, it looks nice and last a few days.</li>
            <li> Use it quickly as the towelettes dry out rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I feel the color is very natural</li>
            <li> It gives you a very natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> Color was very natural.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smell and cannot stand the smell of self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and has a very natural color.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Stay VERY far away from these tanning</li>
            <li> I am very petite (5&#x27;1&amp;#34;), have dry skin and live in Florida.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one application so far, but I could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and the color looks natural, not orange or too dark.</li>
            <li> It dried out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am tiny and skinny, real petite!</li>
            <li> So far, I adore the heck out of them!</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and do get results, so it&#x27;s not my skin that rejected it, not sure why I got nothing.  </li>
            <li> first time using these I actually tried to use gloves to apply the wipe (I was trying to avoid any excess on my hands).</li>
            <li> These were ok, I&#x27;m not sure if I did not use them correctly or</li>
            <li> The towels look exactly like a baby wipe; they are white and they do not turn color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light tint not for a dark Tan look unless you use it often .</li>
            <li> , you must first exfoliate in order for it to work properly as you would with all tanning products.</li>
            <li> You can go as light , or just have a glow, or you can use these towelettes to get as dark (tan)</li>
            <li> I applied it 1 time first day then again 2nd day</li>
            <li> the first self tanning towelettes that I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wipes are not big enough or saturated enough for me - thinner women and men might fare better.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, I will continue to use this during the cold winter days to make me look like I just got back from the beach :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I was disappointed with how many towelettes I had to use, I was still willing to stick with the product if the results were phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> #34;to go&amp;#34; like pouches; easy to carry in the purse for a weekend away, where you might want a little color.</li>
            <li> The product is lightweight, easy to transport and apply, snd has little to no smell.</li>
            <li> my 19yo ended up with a HUGE rusty line down his chest after 1 application.  </li>
            <li> It’s clean, simple, applies to your skin in a second</li>
            <li> I then was surprised to see how quickly the towelette felt dry, as if all of the product had been used up.  </li>
            <li> However, the towels are so small and the material, which is kind of rough and easily torn, bunches when you try to wipe it on, which makes it hard to get an even tan (not impossible as I have achieved an even tan, but it&#x27;s a steep learning curve.)</li>
            <li> The single packages are easy to open.</li>
            <li> I love that my legs don&#x27;t look so pale!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s streak free and less than four hours.</li>
            <li> love the fact that these DO NOT instantly give you an automatic dark tan,but gradually tans you as you use these towelettes.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to not put too much around your ankles, knees, or elbows or it will look funny.</li>
            <li> I did have some spots that were lighter around the backs of my knees and down the side of my calf but was able to fix them after the next shower as the color did lighten up a lot.</li>
            <li> Love these, I&#x27;m very pale and they work worders.</li>
            <li> As a very pale woman I love my self tanning products.  </li>
            <li> ok but does not last long like sun tan towel in orange and white box</li>
            <li> I did only half of one arm to be able to show the difference of just one cloth.</li>
            <li> Definitely not large enough for full body!</li>
            <li> that it was dry right away</li>
            <li> because my skin is so light, I mainly just burn if I use tanning beds or lay out in the sun, with very little results.</li>
            <li> Then, they recommend you wait at least 10 minutes before you get dressed, to allow the product to completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product, I found a very light but noticeable color on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I normally use St. Tropez&#x27;s Self Tan Bronzing Mousse, but that can get expensive, so I was excited to possibly find a more inexpensive</li>
            <li> Not tan, but not pale either. </li>
            <li> If these were just a little larger they would be a better choice.</li>
            <li> May take 2 towelettes per use due to quick drying.</li>
            <li> I did the upper half of my body for the first go and used one towelette: it got dry pretty quickly, ergo-</li>
            <li> You can not see if you are evenly applying the product because it goes on clear</li>
            <li> on clear and dries</li>
            <li> The product goes on clear</li>
            <li> I am clearly captain of the &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know how to evenly apply things&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I decided to use one towelete on my face and neck instead of throwing these away and I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The test: she went to dance practice two days after the application and everyone was like “wow who did your tan?”  </li>
            <li> Took at least 4 to cover most of my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.  </li>
            <li> and it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> When I got it I was really surprised to see I got 20 wipes and not just 6</li>
            <li> About 4-5 hours later I checked in, and there wasn&#x27;t much change.</li>
            <li> And day 3 it was fading, day 5 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Naturally skin sloughs off, so the tan comes off as well.</li>
            <li> After the first application I noticed a difference, although it was minor.</li>
            <li> I did miss a spot on my arm and it was very obvious to me, although my husband said he couldn’t really tell.</li>
            <li> Natural looking.</li>
            <li> When you do open them up they roll up so fast</li>
            <li> ( 100% professional seller )..</li>
            <li> I use these towelettes to develop naturally looking tan on my legs.</li>
            <li> The tan is buildable and natural looking,&lt;br /&gt;working</li>
            <li> I just started using your product and so far  </li>
            <li> You can use them if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> The towelettes really help, especially if you want to even out tan lines!</li>
            <li> They did not streak &amp; if you follow the instructions you will look like you have a natural tan.  </li>
            <li> so I guess I shouldnt be too surprised.</li>
            <li> It basically does as well as Tan Towel as far as tanning.</li>
            <li> I am used to using self tanners similar to this one that truly cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the towels do not cover much of the body.</li>
            <li> ; needs to look natural.</li>
            <li> Here are some frequently asked questions answered in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the color is natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AGAIN make sure to becareful around elbows and knees and knuckles as you don&#x27;t want to get an icky color</li>
            <li> and it looks natural as the sun itself.</li>
            <li> I found things I like and dislike so far:  </li>
            <li> Completely accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After four applications, I had the results I was looking for and tan that looked natural.  </li>
            <li> I got the exfoliated beads on amazon and added to my soap to light get the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> No streak, even coating, natural glow.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product, it made my legs look orange after the 3rd time of using it.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do not use this product..</li>
            <li> No streaks, no orange tint, just a natural appearance as if I had been out for a walk in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s day 3</li>
            <li> No streaks, no orange tint, just a natural appearance as if I had been out for a walk on the beach...</li>
            <li> I had a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The towel itself feels like a baby wipe, it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> You may need to play around to see how frequently you will need to reapply.</li>
            <li> I use 3 towelettes for a complete body application.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very convenient so you can take you individual packets on the go or in your purse-</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes you get your complete look.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a natural glow.  </li>
            <li> the tan color that took was natural looking</li>
            <li> So far I have used this once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled skin cancer from tanning and can&#x27;t use the beds or the natural sunlight.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Only consideration is you can&#x27;t really tell where you have wiped because there is no immediate color.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will have better luck the second go round.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will have better luck the second go round.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until a few days later that there was another &amp;#34;naptime&amp;#34; for me to be able to apply again.</li>
            <li> It is giving me a slow tan with each application, so it looks more natural.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty light skin, so many times fake tanning products will make me look like the long lost relative of the Oompa Loompas.</li>
            <li> The color I did get was good, but not worth the frustration with the small towelette</li>
            <li> super natural and long lasting color ...</li>
            <li> Works the same with slightly less smell...other than that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth a higher cost.</li>
            <li> I normally use Tan Towels which I really like because of the coverage, color, and the fact that they dry immediately.</li>
            <li> The box comes with an open here bottom so as to have a clean and organized towelette holder for the wipes in your closet or bathroom cabinet without having an open box and just multiple packages thrown about.</li>
            <li> The box comes with an open here bottom so as to have a clean and organized towelette holder for the wipes in your closet or bathroom cabinet without having an open box and just multiple packages thrown about.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no mess and no odor.</li>
            <li> I usually use one a day (you will need more than one if doing your entire body) after showering until I get my desire shade of tan - and it looks as though I acquired my tan gradually and naturally.  </li>
            <li> No mess, no streaks,</li>
            <li> The tan wipes on evenly leaving no mess.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no mess like a spray can.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try the Glow2Go Towelettes.</li>
            <li> And the smell of them was pretty vague, most self tanners tend to stink, and these weren&#x27;t so</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s my first time using tanning wipes, I totally missed a lot of places as you can refer in the picture above.</li>
            <li> Being crazy, I did not use the gloves the 2nd time, and the underside of my fingers are a beautiful brown color.</li>
            <li> We did prep before using the product, but if the product requires extreme measures to produce an even tan, which many other self-tanners we have used before don&#x27;t, then this product is not for us.  </li>
            <li> Only giving it 3 stars though as it was blotchy in some places, particularly on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Worked good on my face but streaked on my arms and chest and doesn&#x27;t stay moist or have enough left to do even half a body like the other brand I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t have a strong or bad odor like many self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a bummer is I cannot see the product spreading on my skin, so it is easy to get some uneven color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why it has so many positive (fake?)</li>
            <li> x 7.5&amp;#34; and comes out of the package pretty wet.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have an odor the first day, but the next few days I smelled like tanner, but no one around me noticed that I&#x27;m aware of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a rough time the first go around with this self tanner, but it was partly my fault for not rubbing it evenly on my body with the towelettes.</li>
            <li> I like the color I get with these ran towels, but like other reviewers, I had to use several towelettes to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> A second application a few days later made me feel ok about showing my legs in shorts.</li>
            <li> I used Loreal full body towelettes a few times..</li>
            <li> The towels dry a little too fast and one needs to use two towels to get full body coverage.</li>
            <li> To do any more than that would require a second towel because they are thin and dry quite quickly.</li>
            <li> But I still need a little sunshine, to keep my spirits up, feel better, Dr recommended it too for my bones, due to early osteoporosis, etc.</li>
            <li> Too much product too much time too little results.</li>
            <li> First application didn&#x27;t really changed my skin color; the second application added a slight hue.</li>
            <li> I also like how i can use them easy for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> So far no streaks or bad Oder which I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised;) also nice color and not orange after glow</li>
            <li> They also sell at around half the price or more of other towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to use at least 2-3 towels to get full body coverage, but if you don&#x27;t do areas that are covered all the time, you can get away with 1!</li>
            <li> I have always been the palest person in Western New York</li>
            <li> If you’ve ever used them you know they start off really damp and then dry out.</li>
            <li> Use one towelette for top half of your body and another for the bottom, wait ten minutes to completely dry as recommended.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up looking much tanner, like I just got back from vacation.</li>
            <li> I tried to fix that buy only doing the missed areas the next time without much luck.</li>
            <li> In 4 hours your skin will have a slight golden hue to it.</li>
            <li> In 4 hours your skin will have a slight golden hue to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big, only 5&#x27;2 and had to use 3 towels to get my whole body</li>
            <li> think if the wipe material was smoother and bigger (this is smaller than Tan Towel and the Loreal wipes) it would be much easier to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I have to use so many (4)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick or easy to use as the Tan Towel</li>
            <li> dont forget to use gloves or wash your hand immediately after using, the long exposure to the towels can make your hands a little darker than the rest of your body, because its easy to forget to wash them immediately.</li>
            <li> was worried about the coloring, this left a very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be give the same color, not fake, but didn&#x27;t last with daily face care.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it one leg was darker than the other.  </li>
            <li> I use a major drugstore brand and for 10.00 I get 10 tanning towels.  </li>
            <li> color you get with these on the first use is comparable to 4-5 applications of the other</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of name brand tanning products and have bought several on Amazon, this one gives me a natural deep glow without the mess or unevenness that many other products have.</li>
            <li> Day 1 and 2 shows how big of a difference it makes I only used it on my right leg and and the day 1 and day 2 in one photo show the same leg the next day</li>
            <li> She reported no streaks -- a problem she&#x27;s had with other products, and I think the color of her tan is the most natural looking of all self tanners she&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Also, the towelette seemed to dry out pretty quickly and was made of a sort of slippery wipe material that made it hard to grip and</li>
            <li> Tan developed looking very natural, legs did not develop a usual weird smell of self tanning which was a great benefit.</li>
            <li> My results were more even and subtle, it was only after I&#x27;d used 2 wipes that I started seeing rusty lines.  </li>
            <li> and so it is hard to smooth on your body.  </li>
            <li> This is less expensive than any other product or salon service ive used with the best results!</li>
            <li> These wipes streak more than other products, maybe because the towels get dry and since it’s not very damp on my skin</li>
            <li> These wipes streak more than other products, maybe because the towels get dry and since it’s not very damp on my skin</li>
            <li> It generally takes 2-3 towelettes to cover my slim body.</li>
            <li> AND, because it goes on clear (so you can&#x27;t tell where you last applied) and the flimsy wipe wads up in your hand, I saw streaks!!  </li>
            <li> The price is great but the towels are too thin and small.</li>
            <li> The stars provided are for the minimal results combined with follow up, much appreciated customer service.</li>
            <li> Just follow the simple directions and get a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the tan has lasted four days so far and is still tan after taking showers.</li>
            <li> but I ended up giving up on the home stuff entirely and getting a professional spray tan instead at a salon.</li>
            <li> what surprised me was how you can get a self tan with just a white towelette.</li>
            <li> After completely drying the skin, you open up a single-use towelette, and apply it to the desired regions, which for me were the arms, lower legs and area around the neck/upper chest.</li>
            <li> These barely have any &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; in each cloth.  </li>
            <li> Side affects are hives, itching, pain and bumps that last forever, if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it barely lightened it.</li>
            <li> The wipes make you look tan, but at the same time natural instead of an &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li> First I am curious why you should not use the product if you have shaved with in the last 24 hrs?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried tanning cloths before so when I first opened it, I was curious as to why it was white.</li>
            <li> You can go as dark as you want by using them more often and you can maintain by using every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use the loreal towels since one is all I need to cover my full body and the towel  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to believe that an effective tan towel can&#x27;t be found.</li>
            <li> Makes it kind of expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li> The more I used, the worse it got.</li>
            <li> it contains a large amount of alcohol, which will dry out your skin and may cause you to seek medical treatment..</li>
            <li> I have only used the wipes once at this point, and it left a nice subtle tint, with no streaking!</li>
            <li> I could only use 1 on my legs alone, and even then the towelette dried quickly.</li>
            <li> These wipes are simple to use and there is no mess to rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> No mess with these towelettes either, unlike the traditional bottle or spray method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average size and used 3 towelettes for arms, legs and torso (2 towelettes might have worked but they seemed to dry out quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brand tan wipes and these are much thinner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried leaving the toilette flat, wadded, folded...but because it goes on clear and you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve been</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m one hot, streaky, smelly mess</li>
            <li> appreciate that Thermalabs reminded me to use sparingly around my ankles, elbows and knees as I know from experience with other self tanners, that if you apply too much to these areas, they tend to appear darker and</li>
            <li> Second time I applied kept folded in half and worked a little better.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale - but have had much better results from other products.</li>
            <li> Takes too much time, it takes at least 6 to do your whole body...</li>
            <li> You need to be very deliberate and careful with the application, especially with tanning towels because there is no color guide.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good enough, but I&#x27;m afraid to try it on arms, legs and face without knowing what I should do.</li>
            <li> You will be able to see a very faint sheen when you first use the wipe</li>
            <li> i can use as little or as much as i want!</li>
            <li> I am not a big person (5&#x27;4) and barely covered my body with 2!</li>
            <li> No streaks but a little bit orange at first.  </li>
            <li> I do not think they are big enough, and they seem to feel dry really fast, leaving you to open up another one.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to rub them on me they rolled up because they were so thin and they dried out very quickly before even my face and arms were done.as far as tanning they did really good,just need to be thicker and wetter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two other types of major-brand towels for tanning, and have decided, finally, that these really stand out.</li>
            <li> I had a bare spot on each of my inner elbows, which I figured out</li>
            <li> So after about halfway through I actually took them off and used just my bare hands.</li>
            <li> They are quick and easy to use and don&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use/apply, did notice a slight difference in  color a few hours after applying.  </li>
            <li> Thermalabs really has this down.</li>
            <li> i tried so hard, but I&#x27;m still super streaky.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have to wear foundation--and bonus--as a red head I wont blind people with my white WHITE skin!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how plain wipies like this can legally sell!</li>
            <li> I did exactly what was written on the box and it came out so streaky that I was embarrassed to go out in public, not to mention the Oder it had after it dried.</li>
            <li> Comes out pretty streaky and you can&#x27;t tell until a few hours later</li>
            <li> you just want a golden glow of color and not a real all over dark self-tan, then just use one towelette-</li>
            <li> Each pack comes with 20 natural tan single use towelettes and I use one for each area.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are very convenient and do not make a mess as some products would in a liquid form or a spray.</li>
            <li> The 1st package I used from this barely showed, then tried the 2nd, 3rd, then just threw the entire box away.</li>
            <li> I began noticing for some odd reason I began tanning, without burning very rapidly, in a very short time!</li>
            <li> I normally buy another brand of tanning towels that are much more expensive, so when I saw these, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try!</li>
            <li> I know my legs are very, very pale right now</li>
            <li> my arms are bent the whole time, and the little space where my lower-bicep touches my inner-forearm didn&#x27;t develop.</li>
            <li> The formula is totally clear, but you&#x27;ll feel it wet your skin.</li>
            <li> I can barely finish applying the product to 1 leg before it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the towels quickly dry, so streaking can be an issue if you&#x27;re using gloves and don&#x27;t feel that it is not wet anymore.</li>
            <li> They are small and slightly dry, which I would&#x27;ve dealt with because, again, the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tanning towels &amp; these do not seem to work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> The color is natural and doesn&#x27;t leave streaky marks like some other sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> Frequently use other towel/wipes and have never had this experience.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stain your clothing while processing, they don&#x27;t smell as bad as lotions, and they are not messy!! :)</li>
            <li> I usually spend the winter pasty white in color because my summer tan fades away so fast.  </li>
            <li> ever where, especially the dreaded &amp;#34;I sat on the toilet seat too soon&amp;#34; orange ring of doom.</li>
            <li> The tan showed up in less than 4 hours time and was very natural looking.</li>
            <li> They are very small and thin  and does not feel like it has much product on them since they feel more on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Very little the 4 the time and needed about 5-6 towelettes to do my whole body</li>
            <li> The wipe is also a smaller size than other tanning towelettes so it will not dry up by the time you reach your last part of your body and besides what if you want to just tan your legs and arms only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The towelettes are small and flimsy and they didn&#x27;t provide much of a bronzing effect, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of self tanners in general but this one is not very offensive.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was at least 2 shades darker in the first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small person, and it took me 3 wipes to cover my whole body.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> A box of twenty will not last long.  </li>
            <li> 20 towelettes you will receive with your first box are 70% organic body cream formulated for all skin tones from the pale such as myself to olive or dark skin complexions as well.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations due to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t get the streaks that other users have complained about, but I feel that might be because I used SO MUCH of the product until I knew I was completely covered.  </li>
            <li> what color they did add wasn&#x27;t very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I had embarrassing stripes all over my body after using multiple towels since i have very long arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I also have to use several towels, because they dry out after doing just my legs.</li>
            <li> second it does dry after 4 hours and does not transfer to clothing or your bedding.</li>
            <li> second it does dry after 4 hours and does not transfer to clothing or your bedding.</li>
            <li> so the wipe doesn&#x27;t dry out in the middle of applying.</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;ll want to let the product air dry on your skin for 10 minutes before you put your clothes back on.</li>
            <li> Specifically, it was far too streaky, and required 3 towelettes per application, which produced a slight color change.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of the smaller towelettes for &amp;#34;half body application&amp;#34; as well as the fact that you receive 20 single wrapped towelettes.</li>
            <li> I’ve used the towelettes double as well as single use.</li>
            <li> , it was difficult to keep them from raveling up as I  wiped them on, which left me very streaky!!!</li>
            <li> I used two wipes for my arms and there was barely any scent at all as well, versus your other tanners that tend to have a stronger odor to them.</li>
            <li> For the price and the results, it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, at least not for me!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using them especially in the winter when you want a nice glow to your skin instead of the boring, dull, pasty colored skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it&#x27;s a faint smell unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> However, these towelettes are very flimsy and hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> Also the towels are super thin so its a little difficult to get a nice application due to the cotton bunching up.</li>
            <li> so I need something that doesn&#x27;t dry up in a few seconds, since I feel I need to be a professional user!</li>
            <li> The trouble is, is that when you&#x27;re using the towelettes, you can&#x27;t tell where the stuff is going since it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> I also found this doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> Long days.</li>
            <li> Lush green.</li>
            <li> The wipes are essentially like wet naps you get from restaurants.</li>
            <li> I have carefully read reviews before I bought products, so to help those of you who are on the same hunt, here is my assessment.  </li>
            <li> Wipes seemed old and dried out.</li>
            <li> As long as that&#x27;s your jam</li>
            <li> long for the tan to develop so it cuts</li>
            <li> Woke up to my legs being streaky and uneven, but after taking a shower it somehow leveled out to look like a natural glow.</li>
            <li> It is not natural looking.</li>
            <li> Over the  winter you always wondering how your tan friends can stay tan alar long.</li>
            <li> last few years I have actually gotten some color on my upper body, but I always wear pants or long skirts</li>
            <li> Thermalabs customer for a long time</li>
            <li> It does not take long at all because you’re just wiping a pre-moistened wipe on the area you want to tan.</li>
            <li> It does not take long at all because you’re just wiping a pre-moistened wipe on the area you want to tan.</li>
            <li> I looking forward to seeing how long it takes to fade once I finish the box.</li>
            <li> my husband so far didn&#x27;t notice anything weird, that&#x27;s my cue ;)</li>
            <li> I have only used these a couple times and only on my face and down my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> it again did not show up 4 hours later though It did show up about a day and half later.</li>
            <li> Left streaks both times I used them; you need one towelettes per leg, making this super expensive.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the black beauty gloves to apply the self tanner, but since they&#x27;re just &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; and not wet I could probably just wash my hands after, but prefer using the gloves.</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I saw my legs out in the sun today and my left leg was darker than the other leg and both arms.</li>
            <li> so I could compare to the other arm and leg later on.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, and try to get my fake tan started.</li>
            <li> but it’s the same like the other brands.</li>
            <li> Towelettes are very small and do not appear to have much product on them.  </li>
            <li> the lotion on the towel only worked for 1 leg when I woke up the other</li>
            <li> towelettes were almost dry..</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying on both legs, I let it dry for 10 minutes, then went about my business.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are really dry</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> The wipes work as far as the sunless tanning aspect, but the wipes are very flimsy and make application difficult.</li>
            <li> I do my tanning before bed, I use my towelettes after my shower on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;towelettes were dry</li>
            <li> No no no, all I can say is wipe seemed dry from the start.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Following the instructions, they tell you to shower &amp; exfoliate (but do not shave for 24 hours before application) and then once you are dry apply the towelettes as needed.</li>
            <li> and they were bone dry when I was done with them.</li>
            <li> I covered my legs and torso and then the towel was dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They did seem to dry out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and these were only after using for a few days so it&#x27;s only going to be getting darker!</li>
            <li> Dont want to waste much on my legs now in the dead of winter!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now as a white girl I have 2 shades pale or lobster when I tan outside or in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I scrubbed every single day for a WEEK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a single difference.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is that I think these are for someone who is looking for a natural glow NOT a super dark tan.</li>
            <li> It will give your hands a dark color too and you only want that on your body.</li>
            <li> I tried using the towelettes all over my body, and not only did I have to use several towelettes to ensure coverage, I found it very hard to get even coverage and was left with several streaks on my legs.</li>
            <li> Does a loose robe count?</li>
            <li> Does a loose robe count?</li>
            <li> So dry, that the wipes wrinkled up quickly and made them difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I do not have to hunt down scissors to open them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wore rubber gloves to prevent staining, and began to wipe down with the product starting with my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed to find out that it takes 2-3 wipes for good coverage.</li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin!.  </li>
            <li> When applying they don’t leave a wet feeling on the skin at all, they dry</li>
            <li> The tan lasts for several day and fades over time, unlike some products that streak and start to look strange after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Turns out it was pretty difficult to apply with gloves, and didn&#x27;t leave too much extra on my hands to wash off anyways.</li>
            <li> Color was not as dark as expected, especially based on photo on package.....</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, I could see a slight change.</li>
            <li> It smells super chemically and weird.</li>
            <li> Expiration date was not until 2016, but they seemed very dry.</li>
            <li> But i would almost take the mess given the actual results</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I was afraid I would wipe the towelette too many times making my skin look orange</li>
            <li> and you see results in a few hours that last A LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> I spent 10 minutes staring at a clock wondering how loosely interpreted &amp;#34;dressed&amp;#34; could be taken.</li>
            <li> I spent 10 minutes staring at a clock wondering how loosely interpreted &amp;#34;dressed&amp;#34; could be taken.</li>
            <li> When you open them, there isn&#x27;t a bad smell to them and they wipe easily</li>
            <li> I only use them in the spring time to get a nice base color down before summer</li>
            <li> waited 10 minutes to dress (what does one do for 10 minutes while naked?) and noticed a slight darkening a few hours later.</li>
            <li> I have been lucky enough to find a few brands that don&#x27;t leave you smelling like a fake bake, but this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li> The major con for me was the fact that they are not big enough/have enough product on them to do half of a body.... or at least not an average body.</li>
            <li> They gave my pale skin a very natural looking tan and lasted for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside a lot with the 4-year-old, so I did start with a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> Between that color and actually being in the sun a little, I maintain the color once a week with these towels all summer</li>
            <li> I wish the towels were just a little bigger, I found the towel crumpled in my hand rather than staying flat.&lt;br /&gt;The towels (another brand)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wipes remind me of those little mosquito repellant wipes or those hand towelettes that are wrapped in individual foil packets you get at the wings type</li>
            <li> but these little wipes I used on my face only</li>
            <li> Other than that I don&#x27;t have a single whine.</li>
            <li> Other than that I don&#x27;t have a single whine.</li>
            <li> It is a bit time consuming to apply it every single time you want to wear shorts, but have endured the time consumption due to the fact I am scared of flubbing up my self tan.</li>
            <li> I am going to use them weekly to keep a light tan through the rest of the cold season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long this product is supposed to last with showers and shaving.</li>
            <li> I would just say be careful when trying to do your hands and creases like elbows and by your fingers.</li>
            <li> I would just say be careful when trying to do your hands and creases like elbows and by your fingers.</li>
            <li> I expected these self tan towelettes to give me a darker tan.</li>
            <li> I expected a darker tan than what i got.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO streaks anywhere</li>
            <li> but I expected it to be stronger.</li>
            <li> When you put this on, it is translucent, which I am not really a fan of.</li>
            <li> I also need to mention that the towelette kept bunching and rolling up when I used it so that made it harder to apply.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been searching and using a few different kinds of self tanner</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO streaks anywhere</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO streaks anywhere</li>
            <li> Minimal color change.</li>
            <li> application took the edge of stark winter white skin.</li>
            <li> make my skin  feel rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who has alot of time to waste and this only took a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed directions and was left with streaks; now have to go to the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> While I understand that this is no substitution, and it does NOT count as a base tan to prevent burning, It was rather nice to have some color on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> l year while you&#x27;re over here standing as pale as the snow next to you.</li>
            <li> The sheets are small and not very wet with product.</li>
            <li> It was not drastic, but I didn’t want to look fake, so it was right for me.</li>
            <li> These towels are so little, have only a small amount of tanning solution on them, didn&#x27;t notice much of a different color change, etc.</li>
            <li> degrees where I live right now and putting the Jergen’s lotion on is annoying and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> degrees where I live right now and putting the Jergen’s lotion on is annoying and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> people are wondering why I need towelettes self tanning, well 2 reasons, its hard to tan when you have a baby cause of the sun they can only stay out so long</li>
            <li> It has long lasting color, which sucks, because it&#x27;s streaked into my leg.</li>
            <li> The towelettes themselves are a little awkward to use because they fold and twist easily when you are using one.  </li>
            <li> i like getting a little color to my skin but dislike tanning beds for their long term effects on my skin as well as the added expense to keep it up.</li>
            <li> the idea  of half body towelette as well as them being single use wrapped.an tan.</li>
            <li> the idea  of half body towelette as well as them being single use wrapped.</li>
            <li> There is a slight self tanning smell but not as bad as most.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could recommend these, but even after a week and a half of following all of the tips and instructions, this product still goes on streaky and severely uneven.</li>
            <li> but, I had less tan on the second leg because the towel dried out.</li>
            <li> so I do get that with other products as well)</li>
            <li> package boasts 20 towelettes, where other companies sell in packages of 6 or 10, so</li>
            <li> Comparison to other methods:</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it’s 90</li>
            <li> Comparison to other methods:</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it’s 90</li>
            <li> Absolutely no scent!</li>
            <li> I do not know if it came out orange due to me re applying though the package says you can re apply after 4 hours</li>
            <li> I do not know if it came out orange due to me re applying though the package says you can re apply after 4 hours</li>
            <li> I start with one leg at night and the other in the morning.  </li>
            <li> problem with this is that they are so small you would only get an ankle done.  </li>
            <li> They are the same size as the ones I usually buy, and they sent me tips for using.  </li>
            <li> but it took 3 wipes to get any results other than streaks.</li>
            <li> I am thinking this is due to my lack of self tanner &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product goes on clearless so there is no indication if you missed areas or overdid other areas.  </li>
            <li> Other products at twice the price were easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I am not using this on any other part of my body other than my face.  </li>
            <li> If you open all the way &#x27;skips&#x27; over the skin and towelettes bunch up and towel size is small compared to others.  </li>
            <li> Wipe is flimsy and wads up so consistent application is difficult and had to use 3 wipes for 1 application and</li>
            <li> Towelettes are small and don&#x27;t have enough product on each one - had to use 4-5 for face and body.</li>
            <li> but I had to use several because the cloth is small.</li>
            <li> You can put gloves on to apply the tanning product or you can just use your hands and then wash them , it does not turn you orange like some other products also.</li>
            <li> Their was no streaking ,no area that was darker than the other and did&#x27;nt</li>
            <li> Toweletts are too small and only cover one arm (5&#x27;6&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Usually these wipes only come in packs of 10</li>
            <li> I used as directions stated and was extremely streaky.</li>
            <li> I have used other products......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used self tanning towels for years, due to getting melanoma skin cancer twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brand name Tan Towel Plus &amp; thought I&#x27;d check these out due to offer.</li>
            <li> Usually I get really red</li>
            <li> The other brand, which I mistook these for when ordering - totally my fault - would do at least half my body with one half body towelette without showing any differences in tone the next day...</li>
            <li> It was impossible to get any semblance of a smooth, unstreaky tan.</li>
            <li> I would also say these are half body towels and dry out about half way.</li>
            <li> Its day 4 im half way through the box, with not much color at all.  </li>
            <li> Now I look like I’ve spent half the summer in the sun</li>
            <li> Now I look like I’ve spent half the summer in the sun</li>
            <li> The coverage is not great, left white streaks on myself.</li>
            <li> As far as color, I like the Fake Bake and St. Tropez equally.</li>
            <li> this product works well for my very pale skin when I only use one wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The towelettes are very thin so they are hard to rub on your skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Towelettes are &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but there is a slight scent, not quite alcohol, I&#x27;m not sure what it is but its briefly there.</li>
            <li> However, very pale, hard to detect any color change with one application, requires multiple applications over several days to be sufficient.</li>
            <li> I thought the towels would be a little thicker; the thinness makes them harder to use</li>
            <li> I hate having lotions etc on my hands and this made it very simple and clean to use.</li>
            <li> One application is sufficient for the color we need for competition and it much less time than other tanners.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s half the price of other leading brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have multiple sclerosis and have a really hard time in the Sun</li>
            <li> Being a mom and care taker, and a one car family, it is hard for me to find time to go to an actual tanner.  </li>
            <li> Being a mom and care taker, and a one car family, it is hard for me to find time to go to an actual tanner.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get a clean line of tanning solution where you want it to be.  </li>
            <li> dark you want to get.</li>
            <li> Me dark.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would say that could be a negative is that these towels are thinner than Tan Towels</li>
            <li> at least 3 wipes for my entire body&lt;br /&gt;--Barely visible color</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth all the hype...</li>
            <li> Too dark and a bit orange for my skin tone</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> but its is really uncomfortable to put on, the wipes roll up you can&#x27;t really put it on evenly because there is no tent to the wipes</li>
            <li> It fades slowly, and by January, there&#x27;s nothing left.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries before I figured out how to apply them without getting streaks</li>
            <li> just spent a few hours in the sun and got a glow after as well.</li>
            <li> Now that it has been 2 days since it showed the orange has toned down a bit.</li>
            <li> Now that it has been 2 days since it showed the orange has toned down a bit.</li>
            <li> but I have it down pat now.</li>
            <li> It beats gels and creams hands down.</li>
            <li> son has always noticed when I used tanning products due to the orange around my ankles or hands, but with these that grown boy has no idea!  </li>
            <li> I have no problem the smell is little to none not like with the other tanners</li>
            <li> From other reviews I gathered the wipes had little to no smell which I found to be untrue.</li>
            <li> Extremely streaky!  </li>
            <li> But that doesn’t mean I want to have white</li>
            <li> Small and dry towelettes.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, one of the tanning salons in our small little town starting advertising the spray tan!</li>
            <li> As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> It takes way less time to strip down, apply it, wait for it to sink in, and get dressed, than go somewhere.</li>
            <li> It takes way less time to strip down, apply it, wait for it to sink in, and get dressed, than go somewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that were came out uneven and orange.  </li>
            <li> tan is definitely natural - do NOT expect dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I only did my legs because I was afraid they would not look natural boy</li>
            <li> just a half damp towel</li>
            <li> The lighter leg was slightly streaked.  </li>
            <li> but it does not cover half your body like it states.</li>
            <li> This product was darker than the previous one that was purchased at  Marshalls.</li>
            <li> If it had less than one star that&#x27;s what I would give it-streaky orangey</li>
            <li> There was a slight scent, but nothing that was noticed by anyone else.</li>
            <li> In less then 4 hours.</li>
            <li> They returned my email in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention since these are half towelettes you can customize, for example just do your face, or even your legs, or arms.</li>
            <li> I applied one wipe and after 4 hours I had a slight tan and glow</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have any odd tan marks where they shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist said there are products out there with less alcohol and perfume...</li>
            <li> Still have a half of box that I will not use.</li>
            <li> wish it gave a SLIGHTLY darker tan</li>
            <li> Do they say this because it might transfer to your clothes, or will it mess with the color developing?</li>
            <li> Do they say this because it might transfer to your clothes, or will it mess with the color developing?</li>
            <li> You can use the towelettes and not have to be concerned with making a mess or having it everywhere.</li>
            <li> so if you mess up (which you won&#x27;t) know one will notice.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge girl (I am a size 8 US, so take that how you will): IF these towels do half of a body, it must be half the body of someone who weighs under 100 pounds.  </li>
            <li> $ down to waste</li>
            <li> with being new to applying fake tanner</li>
            <li> Have to use 2 wipes per application, but less messy..</li>
            <li> I have used other tanning wipes before, and usually I can make them work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to user error, faulty batch of product or if this product just does not work.</li>
            <li> I also had white blotches on my leg.. not streaks but weird small circular areas that were still white.</li>
            <li> I also had white blotches on my leg.. not streaks but weird small circular areas that were still white.</li>
            <li> It takes a little to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I start seeing results in as little as 4 hours</li>
            <li> followed the instructions that were provided by Thermalabs, because I was not familiar with the application technique.</li>
            <li> Little if no smell at all.</li>
            <li> so I think it is a little trickier to get everywhere evenly</li>
            <li> I did have a little bit of streaking</li>
            <li> They do leave a little bit of a streak and you cannot see where you have already covered.</li>
            <li> The product it a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> I did have to do 2 applications to get the tan a little darker.</li>
            <li> That is where it took a little practice with me.</li>
            <li> That is where it took a little practice with me.</li>
            <li> I am a little scared to do my face.</li>
            <li> So some parts of my legs were a little uneven.</li>
            <li> I got it on a little uneven</li>
            <li> I ran down there and signed up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you a little secret about tanning, I discovered awhile back!</li>
            <li> My one big complaint is that I felt like it was really hard to not get streaks.</li>
            <li> One of the first things I noticed was that unpleasant self-tan odor that comes with the majority of self tanning products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately since I have spent alot of time in the sun for the last 25 years</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid to use products that will give me an “instant tan” with the fear that it could possibly make me look orange.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times need to get the hang of it .</li>
            <li> I just wasted $14.99 on this.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using these for a year round glow.</li>
            <li> I was worried about uneven application and streaks..</li>
            <li> but these are a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you are already tanned or have darker complexion it will take a few times of using this to see a difference.</li>
            <li> In a few days when it fades I will re try it and take pictures at all stages.</li>
            <li> I would  like to point out a few positives.</li>
            <li> In a few days when it fades I will re try it and take pictures at all stages.</li>
            <li> I would  like to point out a few positives.</li>
            <li> Towels are small and they don&#x27;t get you as dark as you do with tan towel, they are also leave streaks all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times (exfoliated and avoided shaving 24 hrs, etc).</li>
            <li> The color lasts a few days and I use it about every 3-4 days to keep it up.</li>
            <li> I wear gloves when I use the wipes so my hand doesn&#x27;t get an uneven tan.</li>
            <li> I have exfoliated, dried the skin, applied one towel and waited four hours.</li>
            <li> And wouldn&#x27;t you know, it was a few days after that, that another naptime came around for another application.</li>
            <li> , the smell is a dead give away.</li>
            <li> Waste of $.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the darker towels because you need to use quite a few to get the results of a tan.  </li>
            <li> Indoor lighting was not as harsh.</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have about it is that the paper towel is a bit thin</li>
            <li> but after a few hours your skin will start looking like you</li>
            <li> so I can stay a few in my purse and always have one for a friend too.</li>
            <li> uneven streaks or missed spots for me.</li>
            <li> After achieving your desired color, use a towel every few days for upkeep.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about all I got out of them before it dried out..</li>
            <li> waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Then after I did that I moisturized the skin a lot and then did another round before I applied the towelettes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, like they say, &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to miss a spot or apply unevenly using the towelette, compared to the self tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re portable, which means I can carry a few in my purse or in my suitcase when I&#x27;m travelling.</li>
            <li> I received this product to see if it will help this poor white girl and share my experiences on it.</li>
            <li> Color showed up after a few hours but spotty.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t streak or look uneven.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using 6 towelettes within a three day period, the color was barely noticeable!!!</li>
            <li> half the cost!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going any darker, that&#x27;s half a box in just two days!</li>
            <li> While your here as pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li> , my pale legs thank you for all the sun they&#x27;re getting in February.</li>
            <li> I have really pale skin</li>
            <li> The towelettes are OK to use on my face, but the residual smell is very unpleasant (and lasts for at least 2 days, even after washing my face).</li>
            <li> Not a strong odor at all.</li>
            <li> Also, there is only a very subtle smell after applying.</li>
            <li> The wipes are not easy to use.</li>
            <li> After scrubbing and scrubbing I used a little bit of my &#x27;Fake Bake&#x27; to try to blend out my skin tone and that seemed to be the only thing the worked.</li>
            <li> Some not real pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> I usually don’t leave reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> I started using towels and sprays in the past year or so with a lot of trials and errors.</li>
            <li> They usually leave me streaked and my hands orange.</li>
            <li> Back to my fake bake</li>
            <li> I’m not sure why they say don’t shave for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> : The second photo is with artificial like make it appear even dark</li>
            <li> They add just a small amount of color so that there is no drastic color change to be afraid of, and the color is natural - not orange.  </li>
            <li> Towelettes are small.</li>
            <li> I’m always skeptical about whether something is actually going to work.</li>
            <li> My legs did get darker but it streaked and until the color showed up later you are unable to tell where you missed.</li>
            <li> NOT OKAY</li>
            <li> First time user and must say was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> In the past, if you used a self-tanning lotion, your skin ended up looking orange and strange-looking.</li>
            <li> : The towelettes are on the small side</li>
            <li> : The towelettes are on the small side</li>
            <li> usually use Tan Towels</li>
            <li> they are usually covered up and would have plenty of time to fade if I did not like the color or if streaking occurred.  </li>
            <li> The towel was small and bunched up as you used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I purchased will be sending back.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I wil buy again.</li>
            <li> I would consider buying it again  on sale, if the color last longer then Fake Baked.</li>
            <li> they come in 20 small packs in a box.</li>
            <li> The most horrible, orangey, splotchy, streaky, hide your head in shame type bottled tan will always, ALWAYS be the tan that lasts the longest too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because well I missed quite a few spots!</li>
            <li> The cloth is a bit small</li>
            <li> I thought these tanning towels worked no better or worse than the other towels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> skin!&lt;br /&gt;The thought of walking on the beach looking so white was very unappealing to me, so</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pale</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying I am very pale, in fact I don&#x27;t tan, I just burn and peel.</li>
            <li> it was impossible to know if I had completely covered an area or not.</li>
            <li> Product went on easy and no streaks or orange nasty color</li>
            <li> I am terrible at self tanner, but these wipes make it easy.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, but these may be the worst tanning wipes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I started out wearing rubber gloves but it was hard to wipe with them on</li>
            <li> it’s hard to tell when it’s out of</li>
            <li> it’s hard to tell when it’s out of</li>
            <li> Towelette is also hard to hold without it</li>
            <li> the product isn&#x27;t as streaky as I was worried it would be considering how the towelettes are hard to apply the product with.</li>
            <li> I started out wearing rubber gloves but it was hard to wipe with them on</li>
            <li> What ever the material the towelettes are made of ... makes it hard to wipe over my skin.</li>
            <li> They were hard to apply with the towels.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply since the cloth tends to bunch up.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time applying...</li>
            <li> The color was hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this on your face because I think it would be too hard to not to get noticeable tan lines</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really hard to know where you&#x27;ve applied it, until it&#x27;s to late</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars is that Amazon messed up the packaging and put it with a heavy lotion bottle that broke a little and the cream was all over the package which was so annoying.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this because I always seem to get the cream clumped under my nails or have an excess of it in between my fingers, so that by the time you rinse it off, it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> For caution, I wore latex gloves while using these, just so I wouldn&#x27;t have wonky looking hands.</li>
            <li> I do not know if that is common with all towelette or just this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least with my body chemistry that is.</li>
            <li> No matter what you should wait at least 10 minutes before you get dressed anyways...</li>
            <li> At least not here in Boston where it is below zero</li>
            <li> even then, it was the least offensive of any tanners I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would also suggest not shaving for at least 24 hours after applying this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too late to fix.</li>
            <li> I found that the sheets were a bit too thin and they rolled up while applying which made for an uneven application.</li>
            <li> The spray tan was uneven, orange and NOT attractive.</li>
            <li> I have some age spots, so I covered them with a thick make-up cover up and used the towels around and between the spots.</li>
            <li> I mean I saw a difference in at least three days.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately did not take a after photo due to</li>
            <li> I unfortunately did not take a after photo due to</li>
            <li> Towels are too small and bunch up!</li>
            <li> they are small too!</li>
            <li> In fact I always used tanning booths then recently I started to get spray tans ( which get very expensive..</li>
            <li> tried another towel on my pale arm nada no color!!</li>
            <li> They left lines and stuff on my clothes, made my skin oily and nasty but this, after one application i couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, now i don&#x27;t look like a white sheet anymore</li>
            <li> It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look.  </li>
            <li> Work as well as Tan Towels and less expensive</li>
            <li> (Seriously, y&#x27;all.), and wash hands after applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look.</li>
            <li> Results are subtle.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look.</li>
            <li> It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look.</li>
            <li> Was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but it was subtle and not noticable</li>
            <li> Subtle gradual tanning without orangey tones.  </li>
            <li> she is very pale and nothing!</li>
            <li> Thin flimsy towelettes, hard to apply.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t smell to bad and came individually wrapped..</li>
            <li> It’s expensive and comes off unevenly though.</li>
            <li> It’s expensive and comes off unevenly though.</li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> The thermalab towels were not good, just the tan&lt;br /&gt;Towels</li>
            <li> This product is not good if you want orange stripes on your legs buy this</li>
            <li> Not a good value for me.</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of them through the years and this is the first one that I have found that does not have that awful smell!  </li>
            <li> cause I have seen some pretty terrible self tanning results.</li>
            <li> i purchased these packets along with the self tanning lotion which was not successful for me..</li>
            <li> First off, it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product and will definately just stick with my current brand.</li>
            <li> but it was sticking and very hard to rub on my body....</li>
            <li> The wipes are very hard for me to use, they get all bunched up</li>
            <li> They seem to have flooded the reviews with these so that it&#x27;s hard for bad reviews like mine to bring their rating down.</li>
            <li> Wasted money!!!</li>
            <li> What a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> They are thin and seem as if they will not cover, but I have found that they do cover even when I didn&#x27;t think they would.  </li>
            <li> Towel is too thin</li>
            <li> Not happy.  </li>
            <li> The sheets are thin and make application a challenge as they tend to bunch up</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go up and down/back and forth with them because they&#x27;re so thin, they just ball up, unlike the Sublime towelettes.  </li>
            <li> so the number of wipes I have to use is irritating.</li>
            <li> One towelette covers both of my [thin] legs.</li>
            <li> Worse that a zebra.</li>
            <li> However tired of</li>
            <li> I do recommend washing the palms of your hands with soap after applying the towelettes (if you’re not using gloves) because this product is serious!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towelettes have a very subtle scent to them.</li>
            <li> I have been using self-tanning products for over 10 years and this product is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my legs do have streaks and are not as tan or even as I would hope for.</li>
            <li> Tropez, Fake Bake, Tan Towels and find this to be lighter in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Worse Streak Marks Ever!</li>
            <li> though I would consider this  product a fail in my case</li>
            <li> though I would consider this  product a fail in my case</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It tends to get  wadded in a ball and makes it difficult to rub onto skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a fake beach.</li>
            <li> the company called - which is weird -</li>
            <li> The only pros I will say about these is that they don&#x27;t smell horrible</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t leave a stain on my hands but did leave a faint &amp;#34;self</li>
            <li> the results are Tan Towels, Shiseido Self Tanning Gel and Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I tried and  was not impressed at all!  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely addicted!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions before and during application and it still went horribly wrong.</li>
            <li> and you could end up looking quite silly.</li>
            <li> When I told her no more she was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I know that all of the fake tanning products have somewhat of a smell</li>
            <li> BUT I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Parabens should be banned, they are dangerous and putting them in a product that is sitting on the skin and soaking in is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I had very poor results.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing half of the pack away because they were so bad!</li>
            <li> And I did not have to do anything crazy beforehand.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliate like crazy.</li>
            <li> And I did not have to do anything crazy beforehand.</li>
            <li> And I did not have to do anything crazy beforehand.</li>
            <li> I did not use it on my face because I am afraid it will cause sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> The color is orange, streaky and just plain terrible.  </li>
            <li> i have used others they were a streaky nasty mess!</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all :(</li>
            <li> Shelled out my money (it was expensive!)</li>
            <li> Also, these do not have that weird spray tan smell either!</li>
            <li> have used everything from very expensive to the the drug store variety.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very faint self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> it makes it very difficult.</li>
            <li> plus they are so bad for you.</li>
            <li> So  bad.</li>
            <li> but I have to bathe to remove the bad smell</li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> * bad,</li>
            <li> Did I receive a bad batch?</li>
            <li> The one pro was that they do not smell bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it has a smell, it doesn&#x27;t cling to the skin, and it isn&#x27;t a bad odor</li>
            <li> Like really bad.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> and I have been disappointed each time.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> so i of course got stripes :(</li>
            <li> I was mildly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t just put it on and go :(</li>
            <li> The streaks and blotching are horrific and are getting WORSE by the hour!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I hate laying in them.  </li>
            <li> I hate the way all the creams smell.</li>
            <li> It was so bad my husband teased me for days!</li>
            <li> I am SOOOO disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I was very disappointed by this product.</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> and you wont be sorry!!!</li>

            <li> This is the worst tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful product and the tan lasts for days before you have to reaplly. It fades nicely, you still have a nice tan all the way through. If you want to stay tanner you could reapply again befoe the 10th day. but I don&#x27;t feel the need to.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I will definitely order these again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Used it a few times need to get the hang of it . Where I did it correctly the color is great.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Didn&#x27;t work at all.  The towelettes are not saturated enough to do anything.  I used about 4-5 on my whole body.  I followed instructions and shaved and exfoliated 24 hours prior...and got streaky legs.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had used a self tanner.  What a rip-off.  Don&#x27;t buy.  I just wasted $14.99 on this.  I bought Tanwise self-tanning lotion from Sally Beauty Supply instead.  UPDATE 4.27.15:  I decided to use one towelete on my face and neck instead of throwing these away and I am pleasantly surprised.  I really like the color (looks natural, not orange, more of a lavender undertone). I will take these on my beach vacation to use on my face.  I just don&#x27;t see how these towelettes work on the body.  It seems other reviewers had better experiences with using all over the body.  I will take these for my face and a bottle of Tan-wise lotion for my body.  Changed from 1-star review to 3-star review.</li>
            <li> I am not one to tan very well.  have been using self tanners for years.  Thought I would try something different.  First I am curious why you should not use the product if you have shaved with in the last 24 hrs?  I looked all over on line.  Doesn&#x27;t give a reason just says do not shave 24 hours prior to using the product.  I was very disappointed with the fist 4 wipes I used as they did not glide over the skin well at all, it was difficult to keep them from raveling up as I  wiped them on, which left me very streaky!!! WTH.  I am guessing they were dryer than they should have been.  on the fifth wipe I noticed it had more moisture than the others and went on much easier.  So from the get go I am short 4 wipes nothing like paying for something and not getting the full effect.  There is a slight self tanning smell but not as bad as most.  color is good once you decent wipe with the product on it.  A bit pricey when the product isnt what it says it is.  Over all the product is ok.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I really was impressed that an email was sent to me, along with the tanner, to ensure a proper application! Great service and an awesome product!! Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Amazing results!!! Product is everything it says it is. The follow up is number 5 and then some. I&#x27;ve only put on one coat so far love it. I will put another coat on today. I have tanned in beds since I was 20 and im 53 I prefer this product over tanning beds by along shot. Love love it !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the easiest self tanning product that I have used yet. I have been using the towelettes in order to get tanned for my daughter&#x27;s beach wedding. I am so happy with the nice glow and no streaks. Now I will not have to wear any pantyhose with my dress. Also, there is only a very subtle smell after applying. I am looking forward to using these for a year round glow.</li>
            <li> I have used other tanning wipes before, and usually I can make them work. I wish I could recommend these, but even after a week and a half of following all of the tips and instructions, this product still goes on streaky and severely uneven. I also have to use several towels, because they dry out after doing just my legs.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Better than spray-ons or lotions.  These little towels can cover a lot of area, and have better coverage.  I can NEVER get the lotions or sprays to look natural!!!  The tan lasts days and you can always build up to whatever level of color you want.</li>
            <li> Have tried this for 3 nights now and I already have a nice tan!! It&#x27;s so easy to use -- no streaks, no fuss, just a nice color. Will definitely keep using this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used only one and saw a significant result.After that you can adjust just&lt;br /&gt;how dark you want to get. It didn&#x27;t  look unnatural or orange. If you are just doing your face, you can use the same&lt;br /&gt;towelette more than once. It is a great deal 50% off, free delivery. Really? It also doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes(let it dry).&lt;br /&gt;I got four boxes and would definitely buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Excellent tanner, best customer service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use self tanners all the time like me you’re gonna love this product. It is the best out there, and I’m just so upset it was only released to the market this year!!! Where have you been all my life??? no streaks! even! a color to die for! I usually don’t leave reviews on Amazon but I felt encouraged because the customer service was so wonderful and because I’m a returning customer (I am a big fan of Thermalabs) they actually called me to thank me for my loyalty and to make sure I know how to use the new product, now how cool it that???</li>
            <li> These tanning towels are awesome and easy to use. I get discouraged by tanning, because my skin is so light, I mainly just burn if I use tanning beds or lay out in the sun, with very little results. I started using towels and sprays in the past year or so with a lot of trials and errors. So far, this one has the best \\&quot;natural glow\\&quot; I have come across, I love that there are not any orange pigments in the color.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a huge box, so you get a good value&lt;br /&gt;Nice tan color when you apply&lt;br /&gt;Stays on quite a while&lt;br /&gt;I havent had any streaks or anything when I got caught in the rain&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive enough to be used on the face&lt;br /&gt;Comes with clear, easy to follow directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Just dont forget to use gloves or wash your hand immediately after using, the long exposure to the towels can make your hands a little darker than the rest of your body, because its easy to forget to wash them immediately. Thats more my fault than the product, but just a heads up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> What a great product.  It really gets the job done with a very natural look!!!  What a dream........</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have found a better tanner in wipes in my whole life! i have used others they were a streaky nasty mess! They left lines and stuff on my clothes, made my skin oily and nasty but this, after one application i couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, now i don&#x27;t look like a white sheet anymore, i don&#x27;t have to go tanning or stand in the sun when it hurts, i can just open two of the packs use them and wala tan skin i can use as little or as much as i want! for the best tan without sun and since it is almost completely organic who am i to complain!  Now i don&#x27;t look like a white skinned native american woman i have the tan i always wanted but couldn&#x27;t get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and its hard for me to get a tan. I have used tanning beds before but always just burn even for the short visits and plus they are so bad for you. I have used lotions and sprays but never had great luck with them. They usually leave me streaked and my hands orange. I was offered to review this and was so excited because I had never tried towels before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat I fell in love with the box design. Its very eye catching and I LOVE the single pack pull out option. I can place over items on top of it and not have to move them be able to get one out. The single packages are easy to open. I do not have to hunt down scissors to open them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first exfoliated real good as recommended before I used. I just wiped the area I wanted to tan with the towel. These towels are a great size and easy to wipe with. I recommend avoiding wrists and knees as much as possible like they recommend. I got carried away and got my wrist too much and it turned out darker than the rest. One towel done both of my arms great. In about 4 hours I noticed color starting to show and within 6 hours I had a great even tan. I was amazed that my hand was not orange. Using once, I had a great tan that lasted about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely in love with these. They are so easy to use and I get a great look with them. They are the best self tanning product I have ever used. I highly recommend these and will be purchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> This week I have been lucky enough to review the Therma labs Glow2Go self tanning towelettes. I have always been the palest person in Western New York and so I am always looking to add color to my face, arms and legs. I have tried tanning booths (but do not like the health factor concerns with skin cancer etc.) and I have tried spray tanning which ended with me looking like a striped zebra. Nothing ever works. So, when I received these towelettes I was excited but leery to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 20 towelettes you will receive with your first box are 70% organic body cream formulated for all skin tones from the pale such as myself to olive or dark skin complexions as well. These towelettes do not require you to use a glove or use a spray, you simply take out the towelette and begin cleansing the skin. The product claimed to be 100% streak free and waterproof and I was curious about this as I have always ended up with streaks. When I used the product, I do not know if I would call it streaks but my arm around the creases and where my wrist is did seem to appear a different color or streaky. I think this was merely though my own lack of personal knowledge on using it, as the color of the tan was wonderful, a natural color, not the fake orange bake so many self tanners have.The tan showed up in less than 4 hours time and was very natural looking. I could see it looking amazing if you really knew how to work it around the hands and joints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed while after applying the product and waiting to get dressed that the tanner did not feel greasy or it did not feel sticky to the touch. I hate having lotions etc on my hands and this made it very simple and clean to use. I used two wipes for my arms and there was barely any scent at all as well, versus your other tanners that tend to have a stronger odor to them. Some not real pleasant smelling. I would compare the wipes here to that of a baby wipe.I have sensitive skin and can say that these were very gentle and did not give me any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the product was wonderful. The box comes with an open here bottom so as to have a clean and organized towelette holder for the wipes in your closet or bathroom cabinet without having an open box and just multiple packages thrown about. The company offers a 100% money back guarantee as well that you will be pleased with your purchase. I think it is always commendable and worth mentioning when a product offers this type of commitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product for a quick on the go pick me up for a self tanner is a HIT! I would recommend. I would just say be careful when trying to do your hands and creases like elbows and by your fingers. Other than that, a truly great product and definitely worth the $!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold exclusively on Amazon.com!!tle and did not give me any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the product was wonderful.

            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try the Glow2Go Towelettes. The colour truly is natural looking and streak free. I was expecting some sort of orange colour but I&#x27;m happy that it turned out the way it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are easy to use. One wipe is good for half of your body so you&#x27;ll need two to do your full body. One application provides a shade up from your normal colour. Well, this was the case for myself anyway. I did a second application after the required four hours and the colour was nice and dark. Two applications should be enough for most people if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, dark tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes have a very subtle scent to them. They smell like tanning lotion. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I kind of like it. The towelettes feel damp. They don&#x27;t feel greasy, oily, or leave any residue on the skin. It absorbs quickly, I&#x27;d say it takes only a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I could say that this product has is the ingredient list. It contains parabens. I know that this can make or break a purchase for some people so it&#x27;s worth noting. It&#x27;d be great if they found preservative alternatives for their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the wipes. I plan to purchase more once I finish this box.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have been experimenting with tanners because my daughter is a competition dancer and I am not wanting to have to pay for a spray tan twice a month. I have tried lotion,  mousse and wipes of different brands. THIS tanner is awesome. With most tanners you have to wait up to 1 hour before it dries and you can get dressed. This one takes less than 10 minutes and you are good to go. I didn&#x27;t notice anything that night but the next day (which is always the day we look for streaks) she had a very nice glow to her skin and no streaks. One application is sufficient for the color we need for competition and it much less time than other tanners. The test: she went to dance practice two days after the application and everyone was like “wow who did your tan?”  I say we found a winner !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next was my turn. I very fair freckled skin. I only did my legs because I was afraid they would not look natural boy was I wrong they looked great. It was just enough color to give it a healthy glow. Here in Florida even in the summer I never tan but I am looking forward to being as tan as everyone else this summer with these wipes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brand tan wipes and these are much thinner. Definitely not large enough for full body! I did receive the tip guide that was sent and agree that rubber glove is the way to go! I&#x27;ve made it a routine almost every night after I shower to put on a pair of gloves and use a wipe just for my legs, many times I&#x27;ve repeated the process 4hours later. Unfortunately my legs do have streaks and are not as tan or even as I would hope for. I bought 2boxes so as soon as the 1st box is finished I&#x27;ll take photos of the progress and continue with the 2nd box. I don&#x27;t mind helping to improve the quality of a product if my feedback will in fact be of service to the company and clients. The stars provided are for the minimal results combined with follow up, much appreciated customer service.</li>
            <li> Like many have said, this product doesn&#x27;t have a smell. Until later that day. Thankfully it&#x27;s a faint smell unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m very very fair skinned. It takes me about three sheets to cover my body. I&#x27;m a size four. When I woke up I saw the pets I missed and reapplied. So it took about 5 sheets per application. The color looks nice. All in all, good product.</li>
            <li> Small and dry towelettes.  Streaks all down my legs but the color I did get was gorgeous. :) and no I&#x27;m not knew at self tanning.  Back to my fake bake</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no odor, no streaks or spots. NO ORANGE COLOR!&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the coloring, this left a very natural looking tan. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all :( towelettes were almost dry..I ended up using 3 on well buffed clean, moisturized skin. As there is no lotion to see..just a half damp towel I was worried about uneven application and streaks..which is EXACTLY what I got. Maybe the actual lotion works okay but these are a waste of money in my opinion. THANKFUL they were on sale, will not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> No Orange!  But good honest color!  I was skeptical I will admit because I have been orange around the edges more times than i care to mention.  These towelettes do not do that and do not leave a diminishing line where I stopped.  They blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used everything from very expensive to the the drug store variety. and will continue with these.  They are thin and seem as if they will not cover, but I have found that they do cover even when I didn&#x27;t think they would.  You can go as dark as you want by using them more often and you can maintain by using every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has always noticed when I used tanning products due to the orange around my ankles or hands, but with these that grown boy has no idea!  Thank you for the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works very well. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> So impressed with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this makes a light natural color not fake, not orange and is good if you are fair to light medium. If you are already tanned or have darker complexion it will take a few times of using this to see a difference. I would also say these are half body towels and dry out about half way. I have used St.Tropez, Fake Bake, Tan Towels and find this to be lighter in my opinion. I also found this doesn&#x27;t stay long so you need to reapply, but I exfoliate in the shower. I also tried this on my face and I found it to be give the same color, not fake, but didn&#x27;t last with daily face care. Won&#x27;t look like the pic if that&#x27;s what your shooting for but Very Worth Trying It For The Price.</li>
            <li> These towelettes work amazing! I am a frequent user of name brand tanning products and have bought several on Amazon, this one gives me a natural deep glow without the mess or unevenness that many other products have. I wasn&#x27;t sure since it was my first time using this product but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. I also love the dispense it allows you to take out only as much as you need. It&#x27;s perfect for being on the go or if you need something to bring on your travels as they are individually packed. Would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love how these towelettes give me just a nice glow without streaking or turning orange!</li>
            <li> Ok, this one is not for the beginners. No mistakes allowed since the product is transparent and you do not see where you are going, and the towelette dries up fast. I got a couple of streaks, and I do have experience with self tanning products (all the tips and tricks of shower, exfoliate, moisture on knees, elbows, hairline, etc.). These are my first wipes, though. I did the upper half of my body for the first go and used one towelette: it got dry pretty quickly, ergo- the stripes on my last parts are showing (my back). I am tiny and skinny, real petite! So you really need to plan ahead what you&#x27;re gonna do first with this ones!&lt;br /&gt;The tan I got is okay, a bit of orange does come through (I&#x27;m very light skinned so I do get that with other products as well) but it can pass (my husband so far didn&#x27;t notice anything weird, that&#x27;s my cue ;).&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll try again, maybe with some practice I&#x27;ll pull it off just right, but is this the best self tanning product available? I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Expiration date was not until 2016, but they seemed very dry. So dry, that the wipes wrinkled up quickly and made them difficult to use. Took at least 4 to cover most of my body. Results weren&#x27;t streaky and were very light. Trying something else next time. Still looking.</li>
            <li> What a surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried them all - this new product is truly the best in the market today- with no streaking, no blotching, no horrible orange color you get from using other products! What I like about it the most is the ease of use and not having to carry a tanning lotion bottle with you everywhere. It’s clean, simple, applies to your skin in a second and you see results in a few hours that last A LONG TIME! I highly recommend it if you wish to have the best color out there and not have your skin go dry. It has everything needed to make the perfect tan while keeping your skin healthy! I do recommend washing the palms of your hands with soap after applying the towelettes (if you’re not using gloves) because this product is serious! It will give your hands a dark color too and you only want that on your body. Overall highly recommended and definitely my favorite self tanner today.</li>
            <li> I expected these self tan towelettes to give me a darker tan.I got just a hint of color. There&#x27;s a very faint self tanner smell. Not a strong odor at all. I expected a darker tan than what i got.  I followed the directions, and even used 4 towelettes within 2 days. Showered in between uses. Its day 4 im half way through the box, with not much color at all.  I can&#x27;t say i would order these again. But i didn&#x27;t mind trying something new.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these tanning towelettes they are the best tanning product I have ever used they work amazing!  They go on good and stay on they don&#x27;t make your skin look orange or make streaks on your skin. and they also are really cool because they come in individually wrapped packages so you can use them anywhere, anytime. I will definitely be buying some more since I have a problem getting a tan anyway i always burn but now I can have a great tan right from home at a great price and easy to use method! I added some photos of me trying the product. Day 1 and 2 shows how big of a difference it makes I only used it on my right leg and and the day 1 and day 2 in one photo show the same leg the next day and these were only after using for a few days so it&#x27;s only going to be getting darker!</li>
            <li> I have used this product three times now and I have been disappointed each time. I am very experienced with self-tanning products, so I know how to use them. I followed the directions correctly, but I was left with no color! I like the Fake Bake brand much better. I was looking for a good product that wasn&#x27;t a spray so that I wouldn&#x27;t be inhaling the product... I bought this product because of the good reviews and pictures that people shared and I can&#x27;t believe it. There were no results for me. No color at all...</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Super fast shipment!!! No streaks and great color. Will definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. ..  no orange tint.  Easy to apply. ..no offensive odor.  Would love to order this again!</li>
            <li> Really works. Used Tanning Towels for years. This is better. Isn&#x27;t just color, but goes deeper to produce change in skin color.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe they called me to promote their product.  Was furious about that alone, never ever want a store to call me.  This product isn&#x27;t as good as a lotion, very streaky and unsubtle.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! This product is AMAZING!!!! You do not turn orange at all, it gives a nice golden tan. I also bought the lotion, which too is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions, wipes, spray tanning, and tanning beds, this is by far the best. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> The wipes do not rub smoothly on your skin and roll up when you use them.  It is frustrating to keep unrolling them to get smooth, even coverage.  The color is decent, but it does not go on even with this type of wipe.  Tan Towels work better than this brand.</li>
            <li> I had very poor results. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. The sheets are small and not very wet with product. Yes you get twice as many as some other tan towel products, but you have to use twice as many. It does give a nice tan color.</li>
            <li> By far the best sunless product on the market! So incredibly easy to use! I have never streaked or looked orange with this product. The results are absolutely flawless! I will definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The product works great and looks natural.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use. Very convient for those that dont get much sun</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs the day that I ordered so that My legs were ready for the tan towels when I got them. The second I got them, I exfoliated my legs and made sure that there were no stubs. Once I used the towels, I waited 10 minutes and it was immediate! I love these! I used one towel for both legs and my stomach. Since, I have eczema, it will be a test to see if they will hold on my skin. So far, I adore the heck out of them! I did receive this product for free and I agreed to give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> What I did before application:  The package said do not shave 24 hours prior so I did not shave. I used a body scrub and made sure to get my elbows, knees, and ankles/feet.  I did not do anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I used these right after drying off after a shower. The towel is like a baby wipe and you just need to wipe wherever you want to be tan. I started out wearing rubber gloves but it was hard to wipe with them on so I took them off.  While applying it goes on clear and dries quickly so I got kind of worried since I couldn&#x27;t see where I had already done but everything turned out fine.  It took 3 towels to do my whole body and face.  The towels have no scent and no odor.  I washed my hands twice after application so they would not get stained.  The package said not to get dressed for 10 minutes.  I got dressed after probably 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wait: I will admit I was scared, you never know what your going to get with self tanners.  My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky.  There was a tiny tiny tiny bit of self tanner smell. I emphasize the word tiny here. After the 4 hours I noticed a really nice glow.  I was actually really surprised how nice it looked.  I live in Florida so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.  It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look.  My hands never got stained either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: This is so easy!  I&#x27;ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.  You just wipe and your done.  And I did not have to do anything crazy beforehand.  I have absolutely NO streaks anywhere and it looks natural.  I am really impressed with these towels and I&#x27;m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I posted my before and after photo. The left is before I used the product, and the right is 4 hours after application. I received this product in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> A quick easy tan with a wipe how kool! Ive heard nothing but good about this and id love to try it!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to get in my tanning bed every time i want to tan.  These towelettes are so easy to use and are just the right size.  I thought I was going to have to worry about having stained hands, but that was not the deal with these.  Actually, they looked just like diaper wipes, no color and no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that these DO NOT instantly give you an automatic dark tan,but gradually tans you as you use these towelettes.  Thermalabs stated that 1 in 1,000 may not see results, but they back their product up 100% guarantee if they do not work with your body&#x27;s own amino acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also, DO NOT leave an orange result look.  You get more of a natural tan with these wipes and that is what I love about these towelettes!  You use only 1-2 wipes and if you need to re-apply to get a little more tone, wait 4 hours and apply 1 more towelette.  Once you get your desired tone, you then have to use 1-2 towelettes every one to two weeks to maintain.</li>
            <li> Item did not work well for me. Customer service is great and is trying to find a better product for me. They are very helpful.</li>
            <li> First application didn&#x27;t really changed my skin color; the second application added a slight hue. I will keep applying but I expected it to be stronger.My skin used to tan easy in natural sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tanning towels &amp; these do not seem to work nearly as well.  It took several applications prior to my noticing a difference &amp; my tan was minimal at best. This does not compare to similar products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They are very good. Work as well as Tan Towels and less expensive</li>
            <li> I used Loreal full body towelettes a few times.. my friend uses them ALL the time! And kept making me buy them.. So I thought it was the only way to go. I heard about the launch of this new product in one of the forums and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt trying it for the speciail price they offered. When I got it I was really surprised to see I got 20 wipes and not just 6 and that you&#x27;re using 2 for your entire body instead of 1 that dries in a second! I even made my friend try it and she and even she said the results are better! I only use these wipe occasionally so I need something that doesn&#x27;t dry up in a few seconds, since I feel I need to be a professional user! So I guess you can call these &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34; hehe... The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars is that Amazon messed up the packaging and put it with a heavy lotion bottle that broke a little and the cream was all over the package which was so annoying. They also did it with a power detergent I ordered that spilled. I really have no patience to call them for a refund, but seriously hey need to do better packaging of certain items and not just their books...</li>
            <li> It works great and is so easy to apply! No fake orange coloring!</li>
            <li> The reviews I read said good for fair complexions, and they were right.  It is giving me a slow tan with each application, so it looks more natural.  No dirty ankles either.  I sometimes catch a whiff of that self tanning smell, but I don&#x27;t smell it when i put my arm up to my nose, so I&#x27;m not worried about it.  Over all, I&#x27;m happy I bought this product for an upcoming formal event.</li>
            <li> The BEST tan towels I have ever purchased!  Great, natural-looking tan color within just two applications.</li>
            <li> These Towelettes are great. No streaks and a nice even Tan is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Guys! I miss summer. Anybody else with me on this? Long days. Sundresses. Lush green. Warm wind. Going to the beach. Swimming. Laying out in the sun. The smell of tanning oil. Picnics. Barbecues. Nature walks. Fireflies. The sound of crickets. *sigh* This has been the longest winter ever (she says every winter.) And every winter, I miss my tan. It fades slowly, and by January, there&#x27;s nothing left. It&#x27;s around this time every year that I try a new self-tan, so I hereby dub this month &amp;#34;Self-Tanuary&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered the chance to review this self-tanner. They promise a golden glow (not an orange rind), easy application, and streak-free results. Thermalabs has a great reputation, and since Glow2Go is a #1 Bestseller on Amazon, I was excited to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I&#x27;ve never used a tan towelette. I&#x27;ve used creams and sprays, both for full and gradual self-tanning, but not a towelette. I like the idea of this because I always seem to get the cream clumped under my nails or have an excess of it in between my fingers, so that by the time you rinse it off, it&#x27;s too late. You&#x27;ve got orange finger cleavage and it looks like you&#x27;ve eaten a fist-full of Cheetos. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package boasts 20 towelettes, where other companies sell in packages of 6 or 10, so bonus. These are half-body towelettes, which is great if you only want to do your arms, legs, or your face, and that way, you&#x27;re not wasting product. They also sell at around half the price or more of other towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the box turns into a dispenser for the towelette packets. You can leave these on your vanity or sink (the package is gorgeous anyway), or store them in a bathroom closet and just pop one out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the idea that I can stick a few tan towelettes in my purse or luggage and get a glow wherever I am. (Have you ever pictured yourself with a tan for some event or trip and totally not had time to get one?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s time for the test! Each towelette is 7.5&amp;#34; x 7.5&amp;#34; and comes out of the package pretty wet. The directions state to apply the towelette wherever needed, using sparingly around the ankles, knees, and elbows. TIP: Apply a body moisturizer beforehand, concentrating on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend going lightly and sparingly for more coverage. You can always darken it later. The formula is totally clear, but you&#x27;ll feel it wet your skin. One towelette covered both arms, my chest, shoulders, neck, and face. Wait 10 minutes before getting dressed (Seriously, y&#x27;all.), and wash hands after applying. The color will gradually develop within 4 hours. For a deeper tan, reapply after 4 hours until you reach your desired results, then use 1-2 times a week to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a photo of my arm before, then used a tan towelette and photographed it again 4 hours later. The next day, I applied another towelette for a deeper color and photographed it after another 4 hours. So these photos (attached below) from top to bottom are: No tan, 1 application, and 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference! It looks like my arm lost 20 lbs, y&#x27;all! It&#x27;s very gradual, which is my preferred method. I would rather build the color up than BAM: YOU&#x27;RE TAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a nice golden, and not orange (man, I&#x27;ve used some doozies.) I ran into a few issues, which means more tips, guys! My mistakes are your gain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1. I had a bare spot on each of my inner elbows, which I figured out was because I was doing this in the morning/afternoon so that I could get naturally-lit shots. I work at a desk in the meantime, so my arms are bent the whole time, and the little space where my lower-bicep touches my inner-forearm didn&#x27;t develop. I had read somewhere (maybe on the website) to do this before bed, and now I get it. #BloggerProblems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2. I am super-impatient. It seems like every second not doing something stretches into eternity. Waiting 10 minutes to dress felt like forever, so if you&#x27;re anything like me, do this where you can watch a show on Netflix or catch up on a book. I spent 10 minutes staring at a clock wondering how loosely interpreted &amp;#34;dressed&amp;#34; could be taken. &amp;#34;What about just a bra? Does a loose robe count? Do they say this because it might transfer to your clothes, or will it mess with the color developing? Wonder what the kids are getting into...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3. &amp;#34;Wash hands thoroughly after use.&amp;#34; I would recommend using a baby wipe afterwards on your palms and in between your fingers, so that you don&#x27;t wash it off of the backs of your hands, which I totally did. Whoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great self-tanner. I&#x27;ll be keeping these on hand all winter, and unless they come up with something even more awesome, then next winter too!g 10 minutes to dress felt like forever, so if you&#x27;re anything like me, do this where you can watch a show on Netflix or catch up on a book.

            <li> I have pretty light skin, so many times fake tanning products will make me look like the long lost relative of the Oompa Loompas. I have tried all sorts of self tanning products, from sprays to lotions and the whole application process was always a pain in the rear. I had never tried towelettes before, so I was pretty anxious to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test these on my legs since they are as white as white could be. A little color would do them some good! 2 days prior to application I shaved my legs so there would be a good smooth surface. For caution, I wore latex gloves while using these, just so I wouldn&#x27;t have wonky looking hands. The towelettes come individually wrapped which makes them perfect for travel. I was able to easily cover my entire leg and part of the other with 1 towel. When you put this on, it is translucent, which I am not really a fan of. I like a self tanner that will immediately have a tiny amount of pigment, just so I can see where I have placed it, and where I haven&#x27;t. This way everything comes out even toned. I tried to make sure I covered all spots on my legs, but after a day I could see spots where I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying on both legs, I let it dry for 10 minutes, then went about my business. About 4-5 hours later I checked in, and there wasn&#x27;t much change. The next morning I woke up looking much tanner, like I just got back from vacation. The tan was beautiful in color, and aside from the few spots that I missed, it looked great. The color isn&#x27;t too much to start off with, I&#x27;d say that it is build-able with use. By day 2, the color was still great. And day 3 it was fading, day 5 it was completely gone. I didn&#x27;t notice any color transfer on my bedding, or clothes which is fantastic! And the smell of them was pretty vague, most self tanners tend to stink, and these weren&#x27;t so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the results I got with the Glow 2 Go. The fact that these are so compact and easy to travel makes them wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.l!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> It took five wipes to get the tan to start workin. Then it left my skin sticky and it didn&#x27;t smell good. It left strikes all over my body...When I was putting it on I thought the wipes would glide on my body but it was sticking and very hard to rub on my body....so I wasn&#x27;t to happy about your product at all....needs a lot of improvement before I try it again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item. I have a new puppy so with all the bruises I have on my legs from him plus my blinding whiteness these have really come in handy. One towel will cover both legs and one towel covers both arms. I feel the color is very natural and I have not noticed any streaking. And I&#x27;m not paying much attention to detail when I&#x27;m applying either. I will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> Worse Streak Marks Ever!</li>
            <li> I love a nice tan. Now in my 30’s I stay away from tanning beds and use sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and signs of aging, but I still want my beautiful summer glow. I’ve done spray tan, tanning lotion and now these tanning wipes. I like these wipes, but they aren’t perfect. Here are some brief thoughts on them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Prep: The tan will only be as good as the skin prep. Exfoliate like crazy. Tanning products color the outer layers of the skin. Naturally skin sloughs off, so the tan comes off as well. If you start off with all the top layers of dead skin gone the tan will last longer and be more even. I’m not sure why they say don’t shave for 24 hours. I did shave about 5 hours before application and didn’t notice anything different.&lt;br /&gt;• Wipes: The wipes are essentially like wet naps you get from restaurants. If you’ve ever used them you know they start off really damp and then dry out. So do these. When applying they don’t leave a wet feeling on the skin at all, they dry very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;• Application: I don’t know why, but I assumed one wipe would get my whole body. I was a little disappointed to find out that it takes 2-3 wipes for good coverage. I decided I wanted to get the most applications out of my wipes so I was going to get it done with two wipes each time. My legs are the most important, so I did that first. Wipe #1: left leg, left arm, back. Wipe #2: right leg, right arm, abdomen, chest and face. It would be better if I did one wipe for left arm and leg, another for right side and another for back and front. But, like I said, I am trying to conserve wipes.&lt;br /&gt;• Color: After the first application I noticed a difference, although it was minor. I did miss a spot on my arm and it was very obvious to me, although my husband said he couldn’t really tell. I could compare the before and after the first application there. Then the next day I did it again and I really noticed a difference then. I had a nice tan. I waited a couple days and did it a 3rd time. Now I look like I’ve spent half the summer in the sun, it’s a golden tan, not orange. These wipes streak more than other products, maybe because the towels get dry and since it’s not very damp on my skin it’s hard to tell when it’s out of product.&lt;br /&gt;• Comparison to other methods: Spray tan is my favorite way to get a tan. It’s expensive and comes off unevenly though. Between this and the Jergen’s Glow lotion they are tied for different reasons. I noticed more streaking with this, since it dries so quick it’s hard to tell where I got it. On the other hand, it’s 90+ degrees where I live right now and putting the Jergen’s lotion on is annoying and takes forever to dry. Then the rest of the day I feel sticky. The Jergen’s lotion has a much stronger odor and takes longer to get results. A $6 bottle will last me quite awhile though compared to this being approx $1.70 per application with two towels. These towels are easy to take on trips. We are going on vacation at the end of the month, I’m happy I can take two of these with me and be done. I’m using these every 3-4 days with some Jergen’s lotion in between when I’m cool enough to tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product a lot. I&#x27;ve figured out 3 applications is exactly how tan I want to look. Compared to other similar priced wipes out there it’s a good price and works well. I wish it got a little better coverage per towel and had a way I could see which areas I got. I&#x27;m putting a picture up of my arm about 6 hours after the first application when I noticed I missed a spot. I was given a discount to test and review these. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them, this is my honest opinion.a couple days and did it a 3rd time.

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I carefully followed directions and was left with streaks; now have to go to the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very light color.I am fair and needed to use it twice. Absolutely no scent!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to the MANY great reviews I read, unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this product. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to user error, faulty batch of product or if this product just does not work. The company claims that the tanning towelettes  are; Quick, even, streak free, natural looking tan, and show  within less then 4 hours. With all the amazing reviews I thought that it would go on easy and look amazing.... though that was not the case with my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product along with any others there were some pro and cons. I like the idea of the smaller towelettes for &amp;#34;half body application&amp;#34; as well as the fact that you receive 20 single wrapped towelettes. with being new to applying fake tanner I opted to just using it on my very white legs.The major con for me was the fact that they are not big enough/have enough product on them to do half of a body.... or at least not an average body. I wear a size 10 and with that being said I would need a lot more then 2 of them. They are very small and thin  and does not feel like it has much product on them since they feel more on the dry side. You can not see if you are evenly applying the product because it goes on clear so I tried to pay good attention  to apply it evenly leaving my knees and feet since I know that they can be hard to tan without making them look unnaturally darker. I also need to mention that the towelette kept bunching and rolling up when I used it so that made it harder to apply.  Keep in mind since I am new at self tanning I do not know if that is common with all towelette or just this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second con is the fact that a tan did not show up with in the 4 hours, After 24 hours I decided to try again  except I used 2 towelettes ( one for each leg) it again did not show up 4 hours later though It did show up about a day and half later. My thighs were darker even though I started with my calves and I was more orange than tan. I also had white blotches on my leg.. not streaks but weird small circular areas that were still white. I unfortunately did not take a after photo due to it finally showing up after I worked a 10 hour shift and with 2 more days of 10 hour shifts all I did was climb into bed and sleep. Now that it has been 2 days since it showed the orange has toned down a bit. I do not know if it came out orange due to me re applying though the package says you can re apply after 4 hours and I waited 24 hours to re apply.  In a few days when it fades I will re try it and take pictures at all stages. Hopefully I will have better luck the second go round. Either way I will edit this post and add the photos and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I would consider this  product a fail in my case I would  like to point out a few positives. The first being that it does not have a strong smell and second it does dry after 4 hours and does not transfer to clothing or your bedding. Also although I think the product needs some work I do really like  the idea  of half body towelette as well as them being single use wrapped.an tan.

            <li> Towels are small and they don&#x27;t get you as dark as you do with tan towel, they are also leave streaks all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times (exfoliated and avoided shaving 24 hrs, etc). I love the color that it leaves and the concept, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I have to say. No streaks?!? More like worse streaks ever! I&#x27;ve tried going over the lighter spots, but it doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve tried leaving the toilette flat, wadded, folded...but because it goes on clear and you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve been it makes it very difficult. Jergens gradual glow and Clairens remain my favorite self tanner product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and if used correctly you get a nice even glow.</li>
            <li> These showed color in my fair skin even tho i needed 3wipes for one application but theres no bronzer so u have No idea where ur applying so i of course got stripes :(</li>
            <li> I have been in search of the perfect self tan product for years.  I have carefully read reviews before I bought products, so to help those of you who are on the same hunt, here is my assessment.  On the positive, this product provides the most natural tan color ever!  It would be perfect if there was some way of telling how much you have applied.  The towelettes are a great way of applying the product, no messy bottles or foam. I would recommend wearing disposable gloves to avoid tanning your palms.  I only use this on my legs.  The first time I used it one leg was darker than the other.  The lighter leg was slightly streaked.  I have found a way to compensate for this.  I apply as evenly as possible in the evening and again in the morning. I start with one leg at night and the other in the morning.  This results in an even application.  The tan lasts for several day and fades over time, unlike some products that streak and start to look strange after a few days.  The scent is light and smells like suntan lotion, not bad.  The packets make it easy to take with you when you travel.  Bottom line:  If only I could tell how much and where I have applied it I would gladly give this product 5 stars.  So far, I have not found anything better when it comes to the appearance of the tan!</li>
            <li> These definitely work!  The color is fine and stays put.  The fabric material only holds shape in one direction, but overall these are great for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but will be searching for an alternative. Nice color, but it does not cover half your body like it states. I could only use 1 on my legs alone, and even then the towelette dried quickly. My thighs are streaky from the towelette drying to quickly. Towelette is also hard to hold without it getting all scrunched up so you have to keep straightening it out. Would probably be great on the face/neck/chest, but anything other than that, I won&#x27;t trust.</li>
            <li> Loved it! No streaks. Natural looking.</li>
            <li> I use a major drugstore brand and for 10.00 I get 10 tanning towels.  Obviously these towelettes seem like a better deal but they are not.&lt;br /&gt;There are 20 vs my brand of 10.  However, here is the big difference.  They are much smaller and the instructions say that you should not unwrap and use them folded up and slowly open to do more parts of your body.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this is that they are so small you would only get an ankle done.  When you do open them up they roll up so fast so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get a clean line of tanning solution where you want it to be.  I have used them 4 times and actually threw the rest of them out... Takes too much time, it takes at least 6 to do your whole body...&lt;br /&gt;As they say, you get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;I would not offer these to anyone.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I just try this self tanning towelettes ...they are amazing! !! ..super natural and long lasting color ...my shipping was fast and very well packed ..and another very important detail ...I received an email from the seller giving me tips to help me to achieve better results from the product. ..( 100% professional seller ).. .this is an amazing self tanning product (make you look fabulous without the need to be hours ..exposed to the sun or the tanning bed ...I highly recommended ..5stars!!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. It gives you a very natural looking glow. I have tried many self-tanning lotions only to turn a very unnatural orange color. These towelettes are very easy to use. There&#x27;s no mess and no odor.I will definitely purchase these again in the future. Just follow the simple directions and get a natural looking tan. It&#x27;s truly that easy!</li>
            <li> Good color within two or three uses. May take 2 towelettes per use due to quick drying. No &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; smell. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> These leave me with a yellow tinge.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. Better than the competition and much more affordable. I also find the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as similar items on the market. The size of the towel is more than enough to cover my body from the waist up--including my bald head. The color is natural and doesn&#x27;t leave streaky marks like some other sunless tanning products. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again!! Wasted money!!!</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery and love the product. I look like I&#x27;ve been in the sun for a month.</li>
            <li> This is so easy!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far.&lt;br /&gt;Even&lt;br /&gt;Streak Free&lt;br /&gt;Natural Looking&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clear and dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;The towels have no scent and no odor.&lt;br /&gt;The package said do not shave 24 hours prior, but I did my arms.&lt;br /&gt;The directions said not to get dressed for 10 minutes. but I don&#x27;t thnk i waited that long.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky&lt;br /&gt;.I&#x27;m very fair skinned and its hard for me to get a tan, as I have Lupus and can not go in the sun. this gave me some nice color, nice color, real looking.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Florida so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.&lt;br /&gt;It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look. My hands never got stained either .I was offered to review this and was so excited because I had never tried towels before.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I think these are great tanning wipes. I am going to tan the rest of my body and face now!&lt;br /&gt;Going on a cruise in April these will be the first thing I pack!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great communication with buyers.  These self Tan Towelettes are just as good if not better than Tan Towels and at a lesser price.  Definetly going to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Love the tan towels EASY not to dark &amp; I just reordered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have multiple sclerosis and have a really hard time in the Sun but I&#x27;m very pale so I&#x27;ve been searching and using a few different kinds of self tanner I will tell you this is the most easy to apply especially for me I have no problem the smell is little to none not like with the other tanners and I didn&#x27;t even get one streak!!! I wore rubber gloves and was able to do my entire body with one packetI used a kabuki brush on my hands and face elbows and knees and it came out perfect I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it I would recommend it definitely!!!</li>
            <li> Towel is too thin and so it is hard to smooth on your body.  Don&#x27;t buy. L&#x27;oreal is better with a thicker towel.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t do anything for them, then I saw many that said they loved it! This felt like a 50/50 purchase, I was one of those who it didn&#x27;t really tan much at all.  I have tried many others and do get results, so it&#x27;s not my skin that rejected it, not sure why I got nothing.  They are convenient, and wish they did work.  Would be great for travel or a fast touch up if your going out later that evening.  But a no go for me.</li>
            <li> The product did not work!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product realistic tan easy to transport in your carry on for a tropical getaway!!! Make sure you exfoilate and take your time while applying,  and you&#x27;ll end up with a beautiful tan!!!</li>
            <li> Wipes seemed old and dried out.</li>
            <li> Returning these towelettes.  Didn&#x27;t like the color.  Wasn&#x27;t evenly distributed even though I exfoliated, and the towelette dried out too fast requiring you to use 2 to 3 for all over application.  Not a good value.</li>
            <li> great product - natural looking tan, no streaks!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used various self tanners and towelettes,  and this is the best. It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any odor. The color lasts a few days and I use it about every 3-4 days to keep it up. I have light skin with some slight redness on my face and this gives a nice even sun kissed glow.&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Not as much product saturated into these towels as tan towels like Tan Towels better</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is just a preference but I don&#x27;t think I am a fan of towelettes. I am not a big person (5&#x27;4) and barely covered my body with 2! The color was ok but since it soaks in super fast, you need to make sure you get everything! Otherwise you become streaky like I did. It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to keep rubbing it and waiting for it to dry but it doesn&#x27;t show where it goes and you better make sure you get everything - fast! Wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product was darker than the previous one that was purchased at  Marshalls. It leaves my legs somewhat streaky. Are there different shades?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really hard to know where you&#x27;ve applied it, until it&#x27;s to late and you see the line.</li>
            <li> I really like these tanning towelettes!  They are quick and easy to use and don&#x27;t smell bad.  It gave me a very even and natural looking tan.  I did reapply twice to get a darker tan since I am really white right now, and still didn&#x27;t get any orangey color.  I really recommend this to anyone needing a tan for a couple of days to a week.  It is also really reasonably priced and the color developed pretty fast.  I applied it around 10 and by 2 I could tell that it was working. Go ahead and get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the great reviews,but I did not like them at all.I bought 2 boxes and I returned the unuseed one.When I tried to rub them on me they rolled up because they were so thin and they dried out very quickly before even my face and arms were done.as far as tanning they did really good,just need to be thicker and wetter</li>
            <li> this made my skin very orange colored not like a natural bronze I do not like it</li>
            <li> These do everything they say they will do and more.. Best part is your skin looks sun kissed and not orange. They don&#x27;t streak and I ended up buying the lotion as well. They both work great..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It takes a little to rub in.  I did buy a nut to use after and I find that it does even out the application .  I would buy again and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> The thermalab towels were not good, just the tan&lt;br /&gt;Towels</li>
            <li> so far Tanning Towelettes are working Great. Much easier to ontrol amount  than liquids or sprays. Had a question regarding use, called number given and talked to a REAL person. This company seems very concerned that one gets the best results of Towelettes.  Will continue to order !!!  Linda Solomon</li>
            <li> If it had less than one star that&#x27;s what I would give it-streaky orangey</li>
            <li> I have used several different kinds of bronzing towelettes and would not purchase this product again. The towelettes are small and flimsy and they didn&#x27;t provide much of a bronzing effect, and what color they did add wasn&#x27;t very long lasting.</li>
            <li> These towelettes provide great color in steady increases with use. They were streak free and easy to use!</li>
            <li> One good thing is if u can get it applied correctly it will stay for days! However, This really streaked my legs. I wish they had better directions for application. I really took my time to apply it but it just didn&#x27;t do a good job. It was so bad my husband teased me for days!</li>
            <li> I was mildly disappointed. The package says to wait 24 hours after shaving to apply, which since I shave legs daily pretty much means never.  Did skip the shave one day and applied the cloth....waited 10 minutes to dress (what does one do for 10 minutes while naked?) and noticed a slight darkening a few hours later. Unfortunately since I have spent alot of time in the sun for the last 25 years I have sun spots on my face, arms and legs and those spots darkened too.  On the plus side, I noticed no streaks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Glow2Go Self Tanning Towelettes and I love how easy these towelettes are to use. It took me a few tries before I figured out how to apply them without getting streaks but I have it down pat now. Each pack comes with 20 natural tan single use towelettes and I use one for each area. When I’m through, I just throw the towelettes away. The towelettes are individually packaged and contains a self-tan formula. I start seeing results in as little as 4 hours but I can see the full affect in about 6 to 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes work best if I shave my legs and under my arms and wait a full day before I use them. I’ve used the towelettes double as well as single use. After the first use and I saw the streaks, I used the towelettes again to make my tan even. Now I use them at night then again in the morning. They can be used after 4 hours for a deeper tan but I only have to use them twice a week to keep my tanned look going.</li>
            <li> This is a great product with no streaks, easy to apply right out of the shower all over the body and you can use it after your shower every day!!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Just started a few days ago - love the convenience, the non-greasy feel and the beautiful glow it gave me - I&#x27;ll be reordering!</li>
            <li> I really like these towelettes. The one thing I will say is that I think these are for someone who is looking for a natural glow NOT a super dark tan. As long as that&#x27;s your jam then it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply. No streaks at all. And no nasty self tanner smell.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel sticky or goopy afterwards. And this did not stain any of my clothes or sheets.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think this is a great product. Super convenient and easy. And a beautiful natural looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;A win win!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average size and used 3 towelettes for arms, legs and torso (2 towelettes might have worked but they seemed to dry out quickly so I used 3). Worked great. Used 2 applications for a rich tan - just what I needed at the start of my beach vacation.</li>
            <li> There are 5 different Parabens in this! That&#x27;s outrages! Parabens should be banned, they are dangerous and putting them in a product that is sitting on the skin and soaking in is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> 3 stars is for the excellent customer service and the nice color ( not orange and fake looking) but even with all the tips followed and a second application these left streaks.</li>
            <li> Like the color but the cloths are flimsy and roll up when you&#x27;re trying to use them.  Also you need two to cover.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this getting this product followed instructions and it was a big flop!</li>
            <li> The towelettes are working well. I have a suggestion: alternate where you start wiping (i.e. start at left leg, then next time start at right leg, etc), because the first wipe puts on the most of the tanning solution. I discovered this when I saw my legs out in the sun today and my left leg was darker than the other leg and both arms.</li>
            <li> I use these towelettes to develop naturally looking tan on my legs. In order to use towelettes,before opening the individual packages I place my hands in the disposable gloves in order to avoid forming stains on my hands. I use a one towelette for a leg. Tan developed looking very natural, legs did not develop a usual weird smell of self tanning which was a great benefit. I would recommend this product to my friend.</li>
            <li> It was not what I thought - thought it would be organic - would like to send back - package was damaged too when I got it</li>
            <li> This Glow 2 Go comes with 20 tanning towelettes. I&#x27;ve never tried tanning cloths before so when I first opened it, I was curious as to why it was white. I just applied it all over my arm and leg so I could compare to the other arm and leg later on. And I noticed that nothing happened at first yet after about 10-20 minutes, I could tell my skin was turning 2 to 3 shades tanner. I tan easily when it&#x27;s summer but I tend to be lighter in the winter. Since it&#x27;s my first time using tanning wipes, I totally missed a lot of places as you can refer in the picture above. It&#x27;s amazing how tan I got after using just one towelette. This is also awesome to use if you have stretch marks like me at the back of your legs. It really disguises it. I am in love with this product and plan to use it in the summer more. Lastly, the tan has lasted four days so far and is still tan after taking showers. I recommend this product to people who love to tan with a cheaper cost than using tanning beds, plus it&#x27;s much safer but results are just as amazing.</li>
            <li> I was asked by a friend to do a review of this item because she knows I like self tanners. I have used plenty of them through the years and this is the first one that I have found that does not have that awful smell!  Impressed already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 3 towlettes to tan my hands, arms, face and neck and again, I was impressed.  This towlette is so easy to use and I was able to simply rub them over my skin and felt like I was getting good coverage because of the ease of the towlette.  I did not have any streaks and was able to get a pretty good tan after using following this process twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how these are packaged in &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; like pouches; easy to carry in the purse for a weekend away, where you might want a little color.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Doesn&#x27;t have unnatural &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; look on skin.</li>
            <li> Warning: After reading so many good reviews I got a little hasty and only used two wipes for my whole body and saw 3hrs later I missed some spots. But after a second attempt this time being  generous with the wipes. (one per leg and butt cheek, one for both stomach and back, and one for chest, arms, neck and face for a total of 4 wipes) I got a much better results. It got rid of the areas I missed and I look decently darker. Disclaimer: The second photo is with artificial like make it appear even dark but regardless the difference is noticeable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. Would have to use multiple towelettes over a few days to achieve any real color. I am very pale - but have had much better results from other products. The delivery system is convenient, but doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I changed this from one star to three stars because I will say that Thermalabs has excellent customer service and sent out a helpful self-tanning guide with the product and even called to follow up that I received the product and guide and see if I had questions. When I ultimately returned the product, I had no problem with the return so they stood by their &amp;#34;satisfaction guarantee&amp;#34;. For that reason, I think if you are struggling with the decision to order and try this product, go ahead and try it because the company really is good to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, honestly, this was not easy to use at all. I&#x27;ll admit I am new to using self-tanners but I followed the instructions exactly, exfoliating before and avoiding lotions and all that, then trying to apply in even strokes... and honestly I don&#x27;t see how you could apply this evenly without using many, many wipes to completely coat your skin and make it very wet. I had streaky places everywhere and without any color to the tanner it was impossible to know if I had completely covered an area or not. Also, the towelette seemed to dry out pretty quickly and was made of a sort of slippery wipe material that made it hard to grip and evenly apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe seasoned self-tanner users would have better luck with this but I ended up giving up on the home stuff entirely and getting a professional spray tan instead at a salon. Which I do recommend for newbies who have never done any self-tanning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see keeping these on hand for touch-ups but for me it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost and I ended up returning them.</li>
            <li> Color was very natural. Took 2 towelettes just for legs and torso.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product and this time I ordered a double supply.  I am very sensitive to smell and cannot stand the smell of self-tanners.  These are easy to use and have little to no smell - I have never been aware of an odor at all.  I like to use these on my legs especially so that I do not feel the need to wear nylons during the summer.  It is so easy to get out of the shower and do a quick wipe with the towelette.  I usually follow-up with a light lotion to be sure I am streak free but I have never had a problem with streaks either.  They add just a small amount of color so that there is no drastic color change to be afraid of, and the color is natural - not orange.  I usually use one a day (you will need more than one if doing your entire body) after showering until I get my desire shade of tan - and it looks as though I acquired my tan gradually and naturally.  This is a stellar product and I think I will always have it on hand!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the product arove promptly.</li>
            <li> They work great. They are so easy to use. I wear gloves when I use the wipes so my hand doesn&#x27;t get an uneven tan. I noticed a light tan after just one use. You can use them once a day till you like the tan color. No streak marks and no orange color like self tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> These are great!! Nice natural and gradual tan . Love these!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaged nicely.  Used one towelette so far and achieved a nice glow.  I have used Tan Towels in the past and was happy with them, but I believe this product produces at least the same results, and perhaps superior results to Tan Towels, and at a lower cost. I didn&#x27;t notice a &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; smell.  Would recommend anyone wanting a nice tan without skin damage try this product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tan in a box system&lt;br /&gt;available.  No mess, no streaks, no akward&lt;br /&gt;orange tones.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;take long for the tan to develop so it cuts&lt;br /&gt;down on drying time.  The towelettes make it&lt;br /&gt;convenient to tan any anywhere and at any time.&lt;br /&gt;Plus the packaging also includes a slot on the side&lt;br /&gt;where you can pull the towelettes out individually&lt;br /&gt;on the go.  The tan is buildable and natural looking,&lt;br /&gt;working with your skin&#x27;s own chemistry for a long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;tan.</li>
            <li> These  work very well. They are easy to apply and dont leave a streak like most brands. I like hoe they are wrapped individually. I also like how i can use them easy for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. The tan wipes on evenly leaving no mess. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found that the sheets were a bit too thin and they rolled up while applying which made for an uneven application.</li>
            <li> I am SOOOO disappointed! It does NOTHING on my skin. I have exfoliated, dried the skin, applied one towel and waited four hours. Zero color. Applied two towels and waited four hours. Zero results. I did this over and over in a span of three days, have used most of the towels, and absolutely nothing happened. I guess they just aren&#x27;t for me. My skin is a medium tone, and I tan well in the sun or with a self-tanning mousse. I am sure lots of people love your product, but it isn&#x27;t for me. Sorry. Stephanie Purcell</li>
            <li> Only have used these on my face.  No streaks but a little bit orange at first.  Fades nicely to a bronze color after 1 or 2 washes</li>
            <li> The towelettes are really dry so it takes two to just do one leg.</li>
            <li> These towelettes work really well.  I don&#x27;t notice any odor.  Gave a couple to a friend to try.  She loved them also and is going to order them.  I&#x27;m sure I will be a return customer.  I have almost transparent skin and have medical issues that prevent me from being in the sun.  These are a wonderful solution.</li>
            <li> Love these tanning wipes! Goes on evenly and has a very natural color. Has a nice smell as well. Would buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> The product was inferior to Loreal tanning towels in that one towel could only be used for 1 leg and several applications were needed for a tan effect.  In addition it was streaky.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Thin flimsy towelettes, hard to apply. One pack covers one arm or leg.</li>
            <li> Great price for this many towelettes; double the amount of another brand for half the money.  They are the same size as the ones I usually buy, and they sent me tips for using.  Good follow up to see if I was satisfied.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These are &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  Towelettes are small. I would estimate one self-tanning towel per appendage and these come in a box of 20, so they go quickly.  Results are subtle.  I still feel like I look a bit &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;.  But they do provide some decent color.  Probably won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> I know lots of people see results with this product and that&#x27;s why I bought it.  Having followed all the directions, I saw no difference at all.  My skin is fair and I have not been in the sun.  Wanted to wear capris and didn&#x27;t want my legs blinding anyone.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  But maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this a 5 star review but it took 3 wipes to get any results other than streaks. From other reviews I gathered the wipes had little to no smell which I found to be untrue.</li>
            <li> I got these for free in order to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got great results with these. I noticed a difference after just two uses! They were easy to apply, went on streak free and worked! I’m always skeptical about whether something is actually going to work. I have been around the block with self tanning products. There was a slight scent, but nothing that was noticed by anyone else. I really enjoyed having these! I&#x27;m not going to go to a tanning bed because I am aware of the danger of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read my full review please visit my blog! http://ericabarker.com</li>
            <li> Convenient to use; some streaking with use.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are very thin so they are hard to rub on your skin smoothly. They roll up and crumple (for instance the ones by L&#x27;Oreal are a thicker fabric and wipe more evenly and are enough for an entire body and face). They are also a bit light on product. I  really doubt it&#x27;s possible to do more than just your legs with one towelette. the product isn&#x27;t as streaky as I was worried it would be considering how the towelettes are hard to apply the product with.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge girl (I am a size 8 US, so take that how you will): IF these towels do half of a body, it must be half the body of someone who weighs under 100 pounds.  While I can get both legs, toe to hip, out of one towel - I can also tell a difference the next day as the leg I started with is noticeably darker than the leg I finished (the next day).  The other brand, which I mistook these for when ordering - totally my fault - would do at least half my body with one half body towelette without showing any differences in tone the next day...and I was over 4 sizes bigger when I used them last year.</li>
            <li> The box comes with 20 wipes for your tanning pleasure. Each wipe comes individually packaged. Before each application it is advised to clean and exfoliate the skin.  These wipes are considered &amp;#34;half body&amp;#34; wipes. After the application you need to let it soak in for 10 minutes before getting dressed. If you want a quicker tan, you can reapply after 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time using these I actually tried to use gloves to apply the wipe (I was trying to avoid any excess on my hands). Turns out it was pretty difficult to apply with gloves, and didn&#x27;t leave too much extra on my hands to wash off anyways. So after about halfway through I actually took them off and used just my bare hands. Much easier to apply. On day one I used the wipe in the morning, and then again later in the afternoon. The next day I used them again in the morning and later in the afternoon. I actually used one wipe each time and just hit my legs, arms, face and neck. I figured since its winter time, nobody will be seeing my stomach, thighs, or boobs anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It wasn&#x27;t until a few days later that there was another &amp;#34;naptime&amp;#34; for me to be able to apply again. And wouldn&#x27;t you know, it was a few days after that, that another naptime came around for another application. The good news about that was, even every few days applying, I could tell it lasted in between applications. I really only wanted to get a nice glow, I wasnt looking to get super tan, and Glow 2 Go did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con about using a product like this is that you cant reach your back. But I guess if you are using these in the winter and aren&#x27;t showing your back off in a bikini or halter top it really doesnt matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a hard time getting everything perfectly even. I am thinking this is due to my lack of self tanner &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34;. I accidentally kept brushing a portion of the wipe over a spot I had already done. So some parts of my legs were a little uneven. Good thing it&#x27;s winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have talked about the cons I have found, lets talk about the pro&#x27;s! Being a mom and care taker, and a one car family, it is hard for me to find time to go to an actual tanner.  I cant tell you how convenient it was to be able to duck in the bathroom during nap time and quick do an application versus having to skip dinner while I run to the tanner. Not to mention its been anywhere from -1 to 13 degrees for the last week or so, REALLY making me not want leave the house for  anything!! Its quick. It takes way less time to strip down, apply it, wait for it to sink in, and get dressed, than go somewhere. You could also kill two birds by doing your hair while you are waiting for it to sink in too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want more of an &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; experience, or have an event coming up and just want a quick tan, then Glow 2 Go is something worth considering!thing it&#x27;s winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have talked about the cons I have found, lets talk about the pro&#x27;s!

            <li> Towels give good color, but kind of hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Put it on my legs and waited 20 mins before going to bed. Woke up to my legs being streaky and uneven, but after taking a shower it somehow leveled out to look like a natural glow. This has happened all 3 times Ive used it on my legs. Each time lasts like a week or so.</li>
            <li> I just started using your product and so far  I like it and will re-order it. Please do not expect for me to reply beyond this review, I have a demanding job and no time for responses.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Helve</li>
            <li> I had a more effective product before</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, they give you a nice glow , but you have to read the directions and follow them completely. I did have some spots that were lighter around the backs of my knees and down the side of my calf but was able to fix them after the next shower as the color did lighten up a lot.</li>
            <li> Most streaks out of any self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT) I had embarrassing stripes all over my body after using multiple towels since i have very long arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I love tanning, I live in Florida, so people are wondering why I need towelettes self tanning, well 2 reasons, its hard to tan when you have a baby cause of the sun they can only stay out so long and 2 I am Italian, I tan very easy and I don’t like to keep going out in the sun and ruining my skin, cause the sun is the leading cause of cancer. I like the option of self tanning at times. With these towelettes they come in a pack of 20, so you can use them 1 to 2 times a day its your choice , they are safe to use, only thing is they have the sun tan lotion smell to them. If you see in the picture what surprised me was how you can get a self tan with just a white towelette. It looks like there is nothing on it. I been using them for about 2 weeks now and I have noticed that in fact they do really work. You can use them if you have sensitive skin. Each towelette will produce Quick,Even,Streak Free Natural Looking Tan In less then 4 hours. 1 application last about a week, depending on how your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I used these right after drying off after a shower. The towel is like a baby wipe and you just need to wipe wherever you want to be tan. I started out wearing rubber gloves but it was hard to wipe with them on so I took them off. While applying it goes on clear and dries quickly so I got kind of worried since I couldn’t see where I had already done but everything turned out fine. It took 3 towels to do my whole body and face. The towels have no scent and no odor. I washed my hands twice after application so they would not get stained. The package said not to get dressed for 10 minutes. I got dressed after probably 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wait: I will admit I was scared, you never know what your going to get with self tanners. My skin felt good and was not greasy or sticky. There was a tiny tiny tiny bit of self tanner smell. I emphasize the word tiny here. After the 4 hours I noticed a really nice glow. I was actually really surprised how nice it looked. I live in Florida so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real. It is subtle so I will need to do it again to get a darker look. My hands never got stained either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: This is so easy! I’ve tried lotions, sprays, and foams and this the easiest by far. You just wipe and your done. And I did not have to do anything crazy beforehand. I have absolutely NO streaks anywhere and it looks natural. I am really impressed with these towels and I’m going to use them in the winter when my real tan fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free in exchanged for this reviewida so I know what a real tan looks like and this looks real.

            <li> These towelettes add very little color with each application, but the color is good.  It takes 3 or 4 applications to get a light medium color.  The towelettes themselves are a little awkward to use because they fold and twist easily when you are using one.  They should be good to use when traveling.  Haven&#x27;t decided yet whether I would buy them again</li>
            <li> Loved them,wish I had ordered more..No hints of orange,odorless and honestly Streak-Free.It&#x27;s a winner !!!!</li>
            <li> it created a warm tan, but I had streaks where you could see the difference between my natural skin color and the manufactured tan from the towlettes. It didn&#x27;t have an odor the first day, but the next few days I smelled like tanner, but no one around me noticed that I&#x27;m aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a glove so my hands didn&#x27;t turn tan, so that worked well, as suggested. I also exfoliated before applying, but my stomach got very patchy, but thats just how my skin is I guess.</li>
            <li> I received these very quickly and packaged well! I like that they are individually wrapped so the ones not in use don&#x27;t dry out. The towelettes really help, especially if you want to even out tan lines! Just like the packaging states, if you want a darker tan, just use another 4 hours after the first treatment.  Perfect for those needing a quick tan without a tanning bed or laying in the sun! Happy Tanning!!</li>
            <li> they haven&#x27;t worked at all</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different self-tanners and while I liked the idea of a towelette I was disappointed.  The product goes on clearless so there is no indication if you missed areas or overdid other areas.  The tanning takes some time to become visible and then you get to see what you missed.  I think I will pass on this one.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  I&#x27;ve used other tan towels and they are far better.  These streak no matter what.  I ended up throwing half of the pack away because they were so bad!</li>
            <li> Towels are too small and bunch up!</li>
            <li> When I applied it, it was fast and easy. There were no streak marks like you get with some tanning lotions &amp; my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; looked great!</li>
            <li> These are awesome!! I love the towelettes, they are very easy to apply and have no odor at all. This is honestly the first sunless product I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange or streaky. I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> DIDNT NOTICE A COLOR CHANGE AT ALL. EVEN USED THREE WIPES FOR MY FIRST APPLICATION.  NOT EVEN STREAKING VERY BUMMED!!!</li>
            <li> Now this could very well have been just my compete lack of knowledge on the self tan thing but I&#x27;m one hot, streaky, smelly mess and this is after a shower. I&#x27;m 6 foot tall and probably should have used the whole box to cover my flabulous self but decided 2 would do. I didn&#x27;t use gloves because one reviewer said she washed get hands right after and didn&#x27;t have orange palms. She was high, had to be, because the most luxuriously tanned part of my body are the palms of hands. There was another review that said there was no smell.....they must have gotten high with reviewer number one because I&#x27;m pretty pungent and if my attempt at self taming isn&#x27;t noticeable by my beautiful orange palms, the smell is a dead give away. Like I said operator error is likely to blame and I should probably stick to laying in the tanning bed. Good luck to everyone else though !!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful way to get a summer glow without harmful rays from the sun/tanning bed! Loved using this on my legs/arms!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product without any expectations. Im very fair skinned and so far the many many self tanning products i have tried have pretty much turned me orange. i like getting a little color to my skin but dislike tanning beds for their long term effects on my skin as well as the added expense to keep it up. Using this product is soo easy! One towelette and i have an instant shade or two darker (visible white panty and bra lines!) This is less expensive than any other product or salon service ive used with the best results! Fan for life right here!! give them a try and you wont be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> I tried /ordered this two times to make sure before i reviewed it. What ever the material the towelettes are made of ... makes it hard to wipe over my skin. I guess they would be good for just a touch up or a very small body part.</li>
            <li> These are incredible fast and convenient with now mess. The color is great too. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and I felt like this made a noticeable difference without seeming orange. My one big complaint is that I felt like it was really hard to not get streaks. I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of weeks and it really is tricky to keep the wipe from crumpling up when you put it on and you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve covered exactly so it&#x27;s easy to miss tiny spots. Overall, it&#x27;s great for winter, and deserves 4 starts for the convenience and color but I&#x27;ll definitely switch back to Sun Laboratories for the summer :)</li>
            <li> No color! So  bad. Waste of $. U get what u pay for. Never forget that</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the booklet with my order so I have only tried it in places that don&#x27;t show. :)  Seems to work good enough, but I&#x27;m afraid to try it on arms, legs and face without knowing what I should do.</li>
            <li> did not like them!!! messey</li>
            <li> These did not work out good for me. They were hard to apply with the towels. And came out very streaky. The color was mild. I had to use it a few times to even it out and get some more color. I would defiantly not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed!  After reading reviews about how people loved it  people raved about how dark it makes u, so i wanted to try it out to see if it really made. Me dark.  Wat a bummer, does not give any color !</li>
            <li> Only had these for a few days but so far, so good. Very consciencious seller...have received several follow ups to make sure I like the product. For right now, they are great...</li>
            <li> Gives good color. Has no odor. Easy to use. Price is fantastic. Will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I usually am completely white, so I bought these in hopes for tan and not to turn orange. I loved the fact I had a glow for my wedding! Everyone kept telling me I was going to turn orange, but nope tan I was!</li>
            <li> I should have bought the darker towels because you need to use quite a few to get the results of a tan.  They did not streak &amp; if you follow the instructions you will look like you have a natural tan.  I will be reordering them</li>
            <li> Not happy.  Extremely streaky!  Never again will I purchase these.</li>
            <li> Works great for some quick color. I use on my arms, legs and neck area.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations due to the other reviews. I got some nice color on my face and upper extremities. I was very disappointed with the coloring on my legs. I feel confident that i applied the product properly but it still did not apply an even coating on my legs, feet, or toes. When I was out in full sun it was really noticeable. Indoor lighting was not as harsh. I did appreciate the follow up email from the company giving me the best tips to use. I realize that any product in this category is just a &amp;#34;tinting&amp;#34; product so I guess I shouldnt be too surprised.</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t work correctly for me I could tell this is a better product than most. I followed the directions the first time I used it but could not go without shaving my legs to use this so unsure if this is why it didn&#x27;t work as well for me. My legs did get darker but it streaked and until the color showed up later you are unable to tell where you missed. I tried to fix that buy only doing the missed areas the next time without much luck. I even reviewed all the instructions to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything. It seems to work for some people without streaking so maybe it will work for you</li>
            <li> The color is good but the towels are a wee bit too thin.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have used yet! I am on day 2 of using and loving my results already!</li>
            <li> I had a rough time the first go around with this self tanner, but it was partly my fault for not rubbing it evenly on my body with the towelettes. For my second go around, it went great! It isn&#x27;t orange at all and I really enjoy how natural it looks! I&#x27;ll definitely be using it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check out my official review here: www.ambitiouslifeofacitygirl.com/beauty/self-tanning-towelettes-review/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Tan Towels which are by far superior. The Thermalabs towelettes get all bunched up and you can&#x27;t spread the color. It was impossible to get any semblance of a smooth, unstreaky tan.</li>
            <li> This is a great self tanner! The only qualm I have about it is that the paper towel is a bit thin and I have to spread the product over me after applying but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like the towels, easy to use, no Streaks and works better than the local tanning salons. I have bought more at the very fair price.</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner.  The wipes work as far as the sunless tanning aspect, but the wipes are very flimsy and make application difficult. I was hoping they would be more like Loreal wipes.</li>
            <li> Product was ok. Did the job. Just wish it had some color going on so you could see it when going on. Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, not sticky and dries quickly. Packaged well.</li>
            <li> I normally use Tan Towels which I really like because of the coverage, color, and the fact that they dry immediately. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve bought many tan type towels of different brands which just didn&#x27;t work out. The only thing I would say that could be a negative is that these towels are thinner than Tan Towels but I still really like them and will keep buying them, The price is much better than Tan Towels as well and I hope they keep it at this price point</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; seller went out of her way to make sure I was happy with my order. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply since the cloth tends to bunch up. Other products at twice the price were easier to apply.  Good color somewhat patchy in some areas.  Overall a good product for the cost</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an easy and safe way to have a little color and be safe with my skin. I love that my legs don&#x27;t look so pale!</li>
            <li> Good but streaky.  I have used tan towels too and these are more streaky</li>
            <li> Works very well and super easy to use. Def beats going to the tanning bed!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product in place of Tan Towel. It basically does as well as Tan Towel as far as tanning. But,  the tanning cloth is much thinner and flimsier than Tan Towel. It tends to get  wadded in a ball and makes it difficult to rub onto skin.</li>
            <li> They really work!! I will order again. So much better than self tenning lotions. Drys quick without worrying about getting any on your clothes</li>
            <li> Glow to go is an awesome product. Its so easy to apply and you dont turn orange.Its a gradual color change without a run or smear.You can use the towelettes and not have to be concerned with making a mess or having it everywhere.Dries quickly and i like that.</li>
            <li> I am used to using self tanners similar to this one that truly cost twice as much.  I love what really good self tanners do to my skin tone in the summer time.  All that I want from a self tanner is good golden color.  That is what I am getting from this one...a streak free golden glow that gives the illusion of color without exposing my skin to the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  I am only using these on my face and the color is perfect and seems to last a while and fade naturally.  I am not using this on any other part of my body other than my face.  I don&#x27;t want to look orange and I want to look golden and this works for me...lol...my husband is using them, too.  He loves them!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see how much you&#x27;re putting on or where you&#x27;ve put it, so it takes practice. But once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s a nice tan color, with very little self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> BOX ALREADY OPENED!!!!!! SEAL ALREADY CUT!!!!!!! NOT OKAY</li>
            <li> Super great when you are out and like to refresh your tan.</li>
            <li> First time user and must say was disappointed.  Hyped to be such a great product, was surprised that the towels do not apply easily.  If you open all the way &#x27;skips&#x27; over the skin and towelettes bunch up and towel size is small compared to others.  Second time I applied kept folded in half and worked a little better.  Color was not as dark as expected, especially based on photo on package.....doesn&#x27;t last long and you have wait 10 minutes before putting clothes on.  Priced cheaper than a lot of others but cheaper isn&#x27;t better in this case.... Think I&#x27;ll go back to &#x27;TAN TOWELS&#x27; -</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! I have already ordered a second box and I haven&#x27;t even used all of the towelettes from the first yet! It&#x27;s such a great product, I didn&#x27;t want to miss it at this price!</li>
            <li> Love this product very natural color lasts much longer than I expected doesn&#x27;t smell works great</li>
            <li> does not streak and lasts a good while</li>
            <li> The towelette just balls up to be size of a cotton ball as you try to wipe on. Terrible. Make the towelette more stronger. Was ridiculous. I sent both boxes back and got a refund. Nutrogena towelettes don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> does not work as expeted</li>
            <li> Love the color but the application is not as easy as a similar product.  Wipe is flimsy and wads up so consistent application is difficult and had to use 3 wipes for 1 application and then 2 more to correct streaks.  Used first time yesterday and have streaks today.  That&#x27;s a shame because the color is good.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be orange or yellow at all.  Delivered earlier than expected and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Excellent, quick, and professional service in the ordering and delivery process.  Will definately use again.</li>
            <li> These work great for giving my face and arms a nice bronze glow.</li>
            <li> These were ok, I&#x27;m not sure if I did not use them correctly or my skin just doesn&#x27;t respond well to self tanners.</li>
            <li> It did leave a glowy color with repeat use but it does have a certain smell. It is nothing putrid by any means but it&#x27;s definitely a chemical smell to a degree. At least with my body chemistry that is. Threw the rest away after my vacation and just plan on tanning for real.</li>
            <li> These are awesome gives an awesome tan, not orange and streaky. Got my order fast would order from them again, will tell others about them too</li>
            <li> delivered next day!! I&#x27;ve only used one application so far, but I could tell a difference right away. it did take 3 towels since I am a big woman. no smell to the towels at all, which is good. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better way to get a tan! I just wish I had found these earlier this year!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  My skin is very fair.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that were came out uneven and orange.  This product builds gradually and the towelettes are so easy to work with and to apply.  Exfoliation is key.  I have a really nice color now!</li>
            <li> Not as happy with these as &amp;#34;Tan Towels&amp;#34; that I bought last year.  These made my skin look yellow and streaked.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to good reviews. Unfortunately, after using 6 towelettes within a three day period, the color was barely noticeable!!! Need I say more?? Too much product too much time too little results.</li>
            <li> ok but does not last long like sun tan towel in orange and white box</li>
            <li> It’s summer time and people (including me!) want to have a nice glow on their skin. I choose not to spend a lot of time in the sun, because it makes my skin age prematurely, and also I don’t want to get skin cancer. But that doesn’t mean I want to have white skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the solution? Self-tanning products are the choice for me. These type of products have been around for a bit over 10 years, and it seems that they are getting more and more refined. In the past, if you used a self-tanning lotion, your skin ended up looking orange and strange-looking. Now, things are much improved, and products will give you a nicer looking, more natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of Glow2Go Tanning Towelettes by Thermalabs to try out. I was really excited to try this product, and try to get my fake tan started. Right now, I am six months pregnant, and very white, so it was a clean palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions that were provided by Thermalabs, because I was not familiar with the application technique. First, they recommend that you bathe/shower and also exfoliate (but no shaving). The exfoliation helps to give the skin a nice smooth surface on which to apply the towelettes. After completely drying the skin, you open up a single-use towelette, and apply it to the desired regions, which for me were the arms, lower legs and area around the neck/upper chest. I am going to be attending a wedding and christening in the next couple weeks, so I want to have a bit of color for those occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After apply the towelette, you wash your hands to get the self-tanning product off the palms. Then, they recommend you wait at least 10 minutes before you get dressed, to allow the product to completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product, I found a very light but noticeable color on my arms and legs. It was not drastic, but I didn’t want to look fake, so it was right for me. Later in the week, I applied another towelette to enhance the color a bit, and it seemed to do the trick. I loved how easy it was to apply this product, and it generated just the right amount of color on my skin. When I get closer to the wedding and christening dates, I will reapply the product again to keep the skin looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved this product, and how easy it was to use. If you are looking for a good self-tanning product that is easy to use, and no fuss, I would definitely recommend that you check this product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.

            <li> There is a reason that these towelettes are the #1 selling sunless tanner! THEY WORK!!! I&#x27;m outside a lot with the 4-year-old, so I did start with a little bit of color. Not tan, but not pale either. I used 2 towelettes every other day for a total of 3 applications and it produced a beautiful bronze tan!!&lt;br /&gt;Things to remember; Don&#x27;t shave 24 hours before you use these towelettes; however you will want to use a good exfoliate or body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Each towelette comes individually wrapped which is really a nice perk. The towels look exactly like a baby wipe; they are white and they do not turn color. The towelettes don&#x27;t have any strong odor and by the time my skin is dry there was no odor at all. Simply wipe the towelette anywhere that you want color. I stayed away from my elbows and knees. You will be able to see a very faint sheen when you first use the wipe so I used that sheen as my marker of where I would be getting color. That works perfectly. It takes me 1 wipe to do my legs and a second wipe to do my arms and face. Since I wear a full bathing suit I don&#x27;t do a full body tan just arms and legs. Color starts to appear in about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes do dry out quickly so work fast! The package says not to get dressed for 10 minutes to insure that your clothing or bedding doesn&#x27;t get stained. I do my tanning before bed, I use my towelettes after my shower on dry skin.  Then do the rest of my night-time routine, brushing teeth, cleaning my contacts and such. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a full 10 minutes that I wait to put on my pajama&#x27;s but I haven&#x27;t seen any staining on my bedding or on my pj&#x27;s.  I do wash my hands very well as soon as I am done applying my tanner. I use a hand scrub to be sure that my palms and nails aren&#x27;t tanned.&lt;br /&gt;I love that these towelettes give me a build-able SAFE tan. To maintain the color that I want I use 2 towelettes every 5 or 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;This tanner is not greasy, oily or smelly. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel sticky either.&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus Thermalabs includes their best-selling guide “Self Tan Secrets” that is packed with all the facts and secrets you need to know about the wonderful world of self-tanning!

            <li> Love them! They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> The towelettes work. Luckily they do not go on with color. Since the towelettes are white you can tell that it definitely is self tanning. You may not see results right away but after a few hours your skin will start looking like you just spent a few hours in the sun and got a glow after as well.</li>
            <li> Towelettes are small and don&#x27;t have enough product on each one - had to use 4-5 for face and body. TanTowel brand is better.</li>
            <li> Great product! Quick delivery and very natural glow!</li>
            <li> Love these self tan towelettes! Great color! No odor or streaking.  Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I like the color I get with these ran towels, but like other reviewers, I had to use several towelettes to get full coverage. The sheets are thin and make application a challenge as they tend to bunch up and I find myself struggling to get a smooth application. I actually thinks these are fine for smaller areas, like face and neck, but not so great for larger areas. The color is nice and it wears off evenly. I just wish the application towels were larger and thicker.</li>
            <li> awesome product. i like how smooth it goes o the skin and how good it looks once you try them all. I recommend these towelettes for anyone to use.awesome for any skin type.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would replace the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Towelettes because they were a bit cheaper.  However, these towelettes are very flimsy and hard to work with.  You can&#x27;t go up and down/back and forth with them because they&#x27;re so thin, they just ball up, unlike the Sublime towelettes.  You need to go in one direction (up is best), which makes for streaks because you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;ve missed.  I also think I get a better tan with Sublime.  Back to L&#x27;Oreal Sublime for me!</li>
            <li> Left streaks both times I used them; you need one towelettes per leg, making this super expensive. It has long lasting color, which sucks, because it&#x27;s streaked into my leg.</li>
            <li> This product is not good if you want orange stripes on your legs buy this</li>
            <li> I purchased  the glo 2 go tan towels ,i got them in 2 days (prime)  they were really nice, great price,they went on real easy ,no streaking, no smell !!!  like most self tanners. I had a question for their customer service (thermalabs) and they were wonderful!!! They returned my email in less than 5 minutes. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s perfect for traveling .... Little if no smell at all. Highly recommend this product .I don&#x27;t leave home without it. It&#x27;s a light tint not for a dark Tan look unless you use it often .</li>
            <li> These really work! I just ordered my second set because I don&#x27;t want to run out now that I found these. The cloths are very easy to work with, and it&#x27;s hard to believe they will work as well as they do. The first time I used one I tried to cover years of paleness, and honestly, I didn&#x27;t get my first results in 4 hours. I used another cloth and the next morning I was a beautiful  color! 1 week later I still have tan but I just applied the tanner again and this time I know what the results will be, I&#x27;m very pleased. I also ordered the black beauty gloves to apply the self tanner, but since they&#x27;re just &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; and not wet I could probably just wash my hands after, but prefer using the gloves.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would. I did exactly what was written on the box and it came out so streaky that I was embarrassed to go out in public, not to mention the Oder it had after it dried. I would never buy this again!</li>
            <li> It gave me a good tan but I had to use several because the cloth is small. Cloth should be made bigger to go further. One cloth did one leg.</li>
            <li> I got the Glow2Go towels for my girlfriend and she loves them. She reported no streaks -- a problem she&#x27;s had with other products, and I think the color of her tan is the most natural looking of all self tanners she&#x27;s tried in the past. Five stars for a happy girlfriend.</li>
            <li> The color looks great but I have to use 3 towels to do my whole body, the dry out very quickly! Also the towels are super thin so its a little difficult to get a nice application due to the cotton bunching up. Like most self tanning toweletts you do get the slight &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34; smell. I usually use the loreal towels since one is all I need to cover my full body and the towel  is thicker so it goes on a lot easier...but I thought with all the reviews Id give this product a try. Works the same with slightly less smell...other than that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth a higher cost.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;--Streak free&lt;br /&gt;--Washed off evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Took at least 3 wipes for my entire body&lt;br /&gt;--Barely visible color</li>
            <li> I have only used the towels a couple of times. I am very pleased so far. I will change my rating to 5 stars if the color stays as I hope it will. I do have a few streaks after doing a double application with the four hour space between, but it us not drastic and feel I will be able to correct it easily today. I am very pleased with the coverage per towel. I did use two towels for my full body for the first application but only 1 the second time. The price makes this a super deal as long as the color holds out like I hope!</li>
            <li> No it did not ... Need edit for a wedding passes wknd. Not one change in color . Very little the 4 the time and needed about 5-6 towelettes to do my whole body&lt;br /&gt;towelettes were dry</li>
            <li> I just love, love these towelettes. They do not have a smell and they don&#x27;t come off on your clothes. Ten minutes you wait and you can get dressed and go on your way for your day. They are wonderful and I will buy them again and again.</li>
            <li> They seem to work good but I have to bathe to remove the bad smell so I can&#x27;t just put it on and go :(</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend these tan towelettes!</li>
            <li> No no no, all I can say is wipe seemed dry from the start. Minimal color change. Frequently use other towel/wipes and have never had this experience. 👎</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me but may for you.  Your skin type... amino acids etc. make each skin type different with results of this product.  I do, however, love this companies great customer service!  This product is worth trying.</li>
            <li> They did not work for me.  I didn&#x27;t notice any color change.  I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> These barely have any &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; in each cloth.  I have to use one per leg, and another if I want to do arms/face.  The tan only lasts 1 day (disappears with 1 shower).  Not worth it.  But, I will say to its credit, the short-lived color is good (not orange and not streaky).</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes and used them up so I could go with another brand</li>
            <li> These tanning towels arrived quickly, followed by a very informative email. This contains detailed instructions, and it educates the user on how the lotion in the towels reacts chemically with your skin - very useful in applying these in the best way. I&#x27;ve used two other types of major-brand towels for tanning, and have decided, finally, that these really stand out. The color is not just a brownish tan, but a warm, golden, natural color. It looks like my tan at its best - which is hard for my pale skin to achieve. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. It made me orange.</li>
            <li> No one knows how I got my great looking tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole box and can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li> Seller is wonderful! Gave great advice and product came on time and in excellent condition. The only drawback is that the towels do not cover much of the body. I had to use 4 towels for just legs and arms. Not a good value for me. Color is also not my favorite. It is not natural looking. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> While the color took a bit longer to show up for me, the color payoff is AMAZING! There is a learning curve for sure when you are using these wipes because you do not realize you missed a spot until hours later. If anybody has any suggestions, I would love to know because these are such a great item, I would love to use it for my wedding in October.</li>
            <li> I use many tan towels, but these smell the best! They smell like suntan lotion but only fresher. They are easy to use and the color looks natural, not orange or too dark. I live in south Florida so my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; needs to look natural. Great product!</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife and it does NOT work!! she is very pale and nothing! tried another towel on my pale arm nada no color!! I don&#x27;t know how plain wipies like this can legally sell! $ down to waste</li>
            <li> Over the  winter you always wondering how your tan friends can stay tan alar long. While your here as pale as a ghost. l year while you&#x27;re over here standing as pale as the snow next to you. Well I have a solution for all my buddies. This self tanning is so easy a baby could do it. But I don’t recommend to do that. Anyway my point is, it is super easy! It latterly takes 10-11 minutes. Yeah I know, its awesome. Here are some frequently asked questions answered in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.How does it smell? It smells like lotion. Not the fun cool smelling ones, the actual lotion. I know, the smell is pretty strong at first but soon after it goes away. Rate? 3 stars ***&lt;br /&gt;2.How is the price? It is $12.49. Around like $15 to go to a tanning bed, but those take forever!!! And there are 20 wips in one box! Rate? 4 stars****&lt;br /&gt;3.How does it feel? It feels like those makeup remover wipes but with water on them. Thats best way I can explain. On your skin it feels like nothing but I do recommend not to have an open cut, because it hurts!! Rate? 3 stars***&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Im pretty sure it works! I mean I saw a difference in at least three days. Rate? 4 stars****&lt;br /&gt;I hope you like Glow2go as much as me! I know my legs are very, very pale right now so I will see you in like 10  minutes! Bye ;)</li>
            <li> These on the go self tanning towelettes are so much more affordable than booth tanning and look just as good. The Towelette allows for even application. Unlike normal (streaky!) self tanners I would be comfortable using one of these towelettes before work because I have confidence/experience in how real the tan looks. It also seems scent free so I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a fake beach. Love the 20 pack so I can stay a few in my purse and always have one for a friend too. Now I can&#x27;t wait for spring and having a tan the first day I pull out a skirt.</li>
            <li> This tanner is acceptable. There are two big pluses: inexpensive and the color is natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Tan Towels but because of the price, I thought I would give these Thermalab self tanner towels a try. One towel is enough to refresh a tan on lower legs, arms, and face. To do any more than that would require a second towel because they are thin and dry quite quickly. The towel itself is also &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not as thick or easy to use as the Tan Towel so I think it is a little trickier to get everywhere evenly but it&#x27;s not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;One application took the edge of stark winter white skin. A second application a few days later made me feel ok about showing my legs in shorts. Between that color and actually being in the sun a little, I maintain the color once a week with these towels all summer long.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light. I don&#x27;t like the smell of self tanners in general but this one is not very offensive.&lt;br /&gt;The drying time is fast. Getting any self tanner on clothes or sheets has never been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is these are worth a try and although they are not my favorite, but because they are half the price of my favorite Tan Towels, I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Very good product it does not streak and has no bad Oder</li>
            <li> I have always been so sketched out about self tanners. In fact I always used tanning booths then recently I started to get spray tans ( which get very expensive..Trust me) So when I was approached about reviewing this product I knew this was up my alley as I have done reviews on Tanning lotions before but never a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;  First off I love the box. Its amazing. So cute, you can take one out at a time at the bottom which is so easy for me.  Each towelette was individually wrapped thank God.  ( did I mention they shipped super fast which is a huge bonus for me ?? Cuse sometimes I need that tan like ASAP* I know you ladies know what I mean)&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on my face which I was nervous at first but am glad I did because it eliminated foundation from my routine for  bit ( super easy) Best part was &amp;#34; I was NOT ORANGE &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you should know:&lt;br /&gt;DONT SHAVE 24 hours before applying. Also whenever you get a spray tan or what not you should always exfoliate take off that top layer of skin for an easy smooth application that looks and feels natural.  REMEMBER : ANKLES AND FEET. ELBOWS AND KNEES. THESE ARE YOUR BEST FRIENDS WHEN IT COMES TO SCRUBBING BEFORE AN APPLICATION. I like to do straight out of the shower ( make sure you pat yourself dry really good) Take a wipe,or two or even three ( depending on what you want to do ) and start to apply. YOU WILL NOTICE THESE ARE ODOR FREE AND GO ON CLEAR so DO NOT be ALARMED as it will dry quickly anyways. Please do NOT rush into throwing some clothing on though and my personal suggestion ( what I do when I spray tan anyways is to wear something baggy like sweats ( if you do this at night and you will just be home anyways) No matter what you should wait at least 10 minutes before you get dressed anyways...I forgot to mention since these are half towelettes you can customize, for example just do your face, or even your legs, or arms. Its up to you. Do your whole body though but if you arenervous like me then try your legs first ( its winter so if you mess up (which you won&#x27;t) know one will notice. At least not here in Boston where it is below zero so no one is seeing my legs anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You can notice this within four hours and the great part is if you want a darker shade you can even apply again. Score. Double Bonus points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*no uneven streaks or missed spots for me. You can have a friend do your back for you if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Always WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER USING. AGAIN make sure to becareful around elbows and knees and knuckles as you don&#x27;t want to get an icky color there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Today I was thinking of dropping almost $200 for a self tanning spray package at my salon. Thank the Lord I did not. The price on these you can NOT beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Thermalabs sent me this to review for my HONEST opinion. These thoughts and opinions are all my own and  I was not influenced in any way to write a positive review*</li>
            <li> Thermalabs  self-tanning towelettes work very well, you must first exfoliate in order for it to work properly as you would with all tanning products. .They go on smoothly and easily. The towelettes are very convenient and do not make a mess as some products would in a liquid form or a spray. I used one towelette and then another and did this every day for about 3 days, as I saw the tanning come through, I only had to use like one towelette per week to maintain the tan. You can go as light , or just have a glow, or you can use these towelettes to get as dark (tan) as  you would like. They are priced with quantity that I feel is fair. I like the fact that I do not have to get out in the sun or tan beds that may be harmful to you. These towelettes are very well made and you do not have to worry about getting sunburned and damage your skin and it looks natural as the sun itself. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for a nice glowing tan with out the harmful effects. You can put gloves on to apply the tanning product or you can just use your hands and then wash them , it does not turn you orange like some other products also. * This product does not have a sun protection\\&quot; .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy I got the .chance to try these self tanning wipes for quality testing purposes. I normally use the St. Tropez bronzing mousse and I can say that the color these gave me was right up there with that well known brand. The wipes are half body size (most tanning wipes come like this) which is great so the wipe doesn&#x27;t dry out in the middle of applying. Also if I just wanna touch up my legs or face I&#x27;m not wasting product. I applied one wipe and after 4 hours I had a slight tan and glow but because I prefer a darker tan I applied a second application. When I woke up in the morning I was very pleased to see my tan was darker. It was also not streaky and very even. Best of all I was not orange at all. I do wish the initial application was darker but all skin is different. I also love the cut-out in the box where I can pull one wipe at a time. I will be buying more of these and recommending them to everyone I know. I&#x27;m so glad to have found these because I can now get my &amp;#34;high end brand&amp;#34; tan at way less then half the cost!</li>
            <li> I used these self-tanning wipes on my arms for 5 days. I can&#x27;t believe how much tanner my arms looked. Easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;. Looks very natural. Great for a tan without the dangers and high costs of a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works wonderfully and easy and make sure you read directions and do what they say! Product went on easy and no streaks or orange nasty color nope I applied it 1 time first day then again 2nd day Love it all my friends and family are asking me where did i go lol Plus it comes with 20 wipes! Best tanner i ever tried love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this product but twice now, still testing it out so this is my first impression rose. I found things I like and dislike so far:  Cons:  1.) (maybe it&#x27;s just me) The wipes are very hard for me to use, they get all bunched up and I can&#x27;t get a good wipe with them, maybe because they are too thin?  2.) It takes several to cover your entire body  Pros:  1.) Does not smell like self tanner! I can use before bed and sleep and not sleep like self tanner  2.) It does leave a nice color    I might try the same brand lotion to see if I can use that easier??</li>
            <li> These are my go to self-tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are all the things I love about these fantastic towelettes:&lt;br /&gt;-The &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is easy apply to apply and it&#x27;s streak free! Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;-The color shows up in only 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-The product doesn&#x27;t have a strong or bad odor like many self-tanners.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re not ending up with self-tanner all over your bathroom or clothes like you would with a spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;-The color looks realistic, not orange. A nice, natural golden glow. :)&lt;br /&gt;-The directions are easy to follow and direct.&lt;br /&gt;-The towelettes are perfect for someone on the go, you could easily apply your tan at work or the gym.&lt;br /&gt;-There are 20, yes 20 towelettes per box! So your tan will last a while! They easily re-apply to get the desired color you want/need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their slogan on the box reads &amp;#34;EVEN, STREAK FREE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.&amp;#34; Completely accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thermalabs, my pale legs thank you for all the sun they&#x27;re getting in February.</li>
            <li> the first self tanning towelettes that I have found that actually works. I opened the package and took towellette out , unfolded it and put it on my arms and waited 10 minutes . Their was no streaking ,no area that was darker than the other and did&#x27;nt make my skin  feel rough. I really could see the diffrence in one application. I was at least 2 shades darker in the first application. Best self tanner i have found! I received this gift for my unbies and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, one of the tanning salons in our small little town starting advertising the spray tan! I was so excited! A tan in a spray! No harmful sun rays but still a beautiful glow? I ran down there and signed up! Shelled out my money (it was expensive!) and had my first spray tan. Bad decision. The spray tan was uneven, orange and NOT attractive. After that, I pretty much gave up and just figured I would never have that beautiful tan glow again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Thermalabs asked me to review their new Glow 2 Go Sunless Tanning Towlettes. They promised no streaks or orange color. Since they promised, I agreed. The box I received comes with 20 Towlettes. The directions are pretty easy. One Towlette is for your entire body (2 if you are larger). Wash hands after using. I didn’t do that the first time. Another mistake on my part. Don’t shave or exfoliate for 24 hours BEFORE using. Color can take 4 hours to develop, so wait and see if you like the color depth. If not, use another towel. After achieving your desired color, use a towel every few days for upkeep. I showered and used a towel right out of the shower. I focused on my face, neck, chest and arms. Nothing is going to help these legs. It would take the entire box. I only used 1 towel. When I woke up the next morning, I could see a slight change. It was a glow. I wanted a little more color, so I used another towel and by mid-afternoon, my color was perfect. No streaking, no orange. Thermalabs really has this down. I plan on using these forever now. Also, these do not have that weird spray tan smell either!</li>
            <li> I recently had the chance to review a box of Glow2Go Self Tanning Towelettes by Thermalabs.  I have two working tanning beds in my basement but I hate laying in them.  I only use them in the spring time to get a nice base color down before summer so I don&#x27;t burn.  I usually spend the winter pasty white in color because my summer tan fades away so fast.  I have tried several self tanning lotions but I always turn out orange and streaked so I pretty much gave up on having color through the winter.  After reading about Glow2Go, I was exited to try it.  I had literally no color before I started using this product.  After applying Glow2Go to my legs one time, I had a very light tan.  I did have a little bit of streaking but I just applied another towelette four hours later.  It evened the tan out.  The next day, I repeated the process of one wipe application another after four hours.  After four applications, I had the results I was looking for and tan that looked natural.  I used one towelette for my legs and one for the rest of my body.  I did not use it on my face because I am afraid it will cause sensitivity issues.  I love how easy they are to use and how fast they are to apply.  I only have to wait about ten minutes to get dressed.  The color lasts up to two weeks but I noticed it getting lighter after every shower.  I just reapplied whenever I noticed it was getting too light.  I think these would be perfect for someone who wants a nice tan for a night out or a special weekend.  I would definitely recommend Glow2Go to anyone who wants to get a sexy tan without the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> So far no streaks or bad Oder which I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised;) also nice color and not orange after glow</li>
            <li> The Glow2Go wipes come in an easy to dispense box. You can tear out the side and just remove one wipe at the time. The wipe is also a smaller size than other tanning towelettes so it will not dry up by the time you reach your last part of your body and besides what if you want to just tan your legs and arms only.&lt;br /&gt;This is coming from someone who has never self tanned before. I was very scared, cause I have seen some pretty terrible self tanning results. I watch a lot of You tube videos and even the most experienced self tanner makes mistakes and have the oompa loompa results unintentionally. I have also heard that &amp;#34;wipes&amp;#34; don&#x27;t work. In a way I was happy about that since this was going to be my first experience with self tanning.&lt;br /&gt;Let me mention I have used &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tanning lotions which wash off once you get in the shower and I have like the few I have tried, but it is a one day kind of thing. It is a bit time consuming to apply it every single time you want to wear shorts, but have endured the time consumption due to the fact I am scared of flubbing up my self tan. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> I wish the towels were just a little bigger, I found the towel crumpled in my hand rather than staying flat.&lt;br /&gt;The towels (another brand) I have used before were larger and I felt were easier to use.</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying I am very pale, in fact I don&#x27;t tan, I just burn and peel. I just think about going into the sun, and I burn. I have to wear SPF-ITS A SWEATER! Okay....I&#x27;m not *that* bad, but I definitely got the sun sensitivity from my Irish relatives. Thanks Guys! Just Kidding. (No Really!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last few years I have actually gotten some color on my upper body, but I always wear pants or long skirts so my legs are blindingly white - which only makes me scared to expose them to the sun. While I understand that this is no substitution, and it does NOT count as a base tan to prevent burning, It was rather nice to have some color on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLOW2GO is a new and innovative sunless tanning towelette.&lt;br /&gt;This box of Glow2Go contains 20 individually wrapped premium towelettes which are perfect for sunless tanning at home or on the go. The box is designed to &amp;#34;dispense&amp;#34; one towelette at a time. They&#x27;re perfect for traveling because you don&#x27;t need to carry around a big bottle of product (and also great for air travel as I don&#x27;t think this would count toward your liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included with my purchase was a 50 page guide, &amp;#34;Self Tan Secrets&amp;#34; which has lots of facts, tips and secrets about self-tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Towelettes are &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but there is a slight scent, not quite alcohol, I&#x27;m not sure what it is but its briefly there. It leaves no scent on the skin. They go onto your skin transparent so you&#x27;re not going to get orange dyes ever where, especially the dreaded &amp;#34;I sat on the toilet seat too soon&amp;#34; orange ring of doom. I didn&#x27;t have any streaks nor did I look like an oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions, they tell you to shower &amp; exfoliate (but do not shave for 24 hours before application) and then once you are dry apply the towelettes as needed. Wash your hands and then you&#x27;ll want to let the product air dry on your skin for 10 minutes before you put your clothes back on. In 4 hours your skin will have a slight golden hue to it. If you want more color just keep applying until you reach the desired amounts and after that then just maintain every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.k on. In 4 hours your skin will have a slight golden hue to it.

            <li> This was the best smelling self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!  It was only hours later that I briefly encountered that &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; tanner smell and even then, it was the least offensive of any tanners I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the wipes do not hold much solution. I tried to get by on one and ended up color showing on the first leg I did mainly AND, because it goes on clear (so you can&#x27;t tell where you last applied) and the flimsy wipe wads up in your hand, I saw streaks!!  I tried using two wipes the next time, but it appears I&#x27;m going to need to use four or five and I&#x27;m around a petite size ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes remind me of those little mosquito repellant wipes or those hand towelettes that are wrapped in individual foil packets you get at the wings type restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the company called - which is weird - and I didn&#x27;t answer because it was not a known number to me.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to traditional self-tanners. I love that the wipes are individually packaged so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out. Because of their small size, they&#x27;re great to keep in your bag or with your makeup bag for travel. They have a light self tanner scent that does not transfer or linger once the wipes have been applied. I did not use gloves when applying the wipes, I just made sure to wash my hands &amp; wrists with soap after applying so I wouldn&#x27;t have any odd tan marks where they shouldn&#x27;t be. I took one star off because I wish they were bigger or had more product saturated in the cloths. With one wipe I&#x27;m only able to do a section of my body. For my whole body to receive even coverage I have to use 3-4 towels for one tan. I received a discount on this product, and for the value, even though I need to use more than 1 it&#x27;s still more cost effective than getting a spray tan. I experimented with one the first night I got them and did one leg with one wipe so I could do a comparison. You could definitely tell that I started at the bottom of my leg and worked my way up because the top of my thigh had much lighter color than the bottom of my leg. The color is nice, light tan and it&#x27;s definitely buildable. I have a wedding in 2 weeks and I&#x27;ll probably do an application every 3-4 days to keep my color and continue to deepen my tan until my box runs out.</li>
            <li> These are horrible. I was fooled by the amount of stars but looking through some of the reviews now there are a lot of sponsored reviews. They seem to have flooded the reviews with these so that it&#x27;s hard for bad reviews like mine to bring their rating down. Hopefully people click on the lower star reviews to read. I&#x27;ve never been so streaky in my life and I only left the stuff on for two hours. I&#x27;m not big, only 5&#x27;2 and had to use 3 towels to get my whole body and they were bone dry when I was done with them. I now have a whole box of these just sitting here. I will probably use them to touch up my face in between my applications of my favorite self tanner (banana boat). The only pros I will say about these is that they don&#x27;t smell horrible and they didn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> The wipes are not easy to use. They do leave a little bit of a streak and you cannot see where you have already covered. I&#x27;m a small person, and it took me 3 wipes to cover my whole body. After a full 24 hours I&#x27;m not seeing much color. Hoping to get more after my next application. I did like that it was dry right away and there&#x27;s no mess like a spray can. But i would almost take the mess given the actual results</li>
            <li> As a brand new user, I chose wipes as opposed to cream or spray figuring that I would have more control over where the color would be applied, and I found this to be very true.  I started on my arms since at this time of year they are usually covered up and would have plenty of time to fade if I did not like the color or if streaking occurred.  I was very happy with the results, so I went onto my legs. I have some age spots, so I covered them with a thick make-up cover up and used the towels around and between the spots. I did have some streaking on my legs, but this was my fault as I know that I wiped some areas twice and, therefore the tan is darker in those places. Knowing this, I am even more impressed because I thought it was going to take many, many separate occasions to get the tan to a dark enough shade; but now I know that I just have to wipe it 2 or 3X in the same sitting to get the color darker. Being crazy, I did not use the gloves the 2nd time, and the underside of my fingers are a beautiful brown color. I am trying to find a way to remove this, but have not been successful so far. There is no orange, and I started with very fair, dry, almost white skin. This is a great color and if you follow the directions, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> i love the color these give me. However, the towels are so small and the material, which is kind of rough and easily torn, bunches when you try to wipe it on, which makes it hard to get an even tan (not impossible as I have achieved an even tan, but it&#x27;s a steep learning curve.) Also I have to use 3 wipes to do my whole body (really 4 would probably be better but I can squeak by with 3) and I am 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and a size 2/4 (or 26 jeans size) so I&#x27;m not a big person so the number of wipes I have to use is irritating. I only have to use 1-2 from Tan Towel or L&#x27;oreal wipes.&lt;br /&gt;I think if the wipe material was smoother and bigger (this is smaller than Tan Towel and the Loreal wipes) it would be much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The color is probably the best I have ever gotten from a product, there is no scent I can tell, and it dries super fast. I just wish the wipe was better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my thermalabs experience. I have only used the wipes once at this point, and it left a nice subtle tint, with no streaking! I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on the self tanning products before I ordered. These wipes are simple to use and there is no mess to rub off on clothes. I&#x27;m not a person who has alot of time to waste and this only took a couple of minutes. The company really cares about it&#x27;s product and their customers. I&#x27;ve received emails from them with helpful tips and contact information in case I needed to ask questions or had any problems. I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> i tried so hard, but I&#x27;m still super streaky.</li>
            <li> i purchased these packets along with the self tanning lotion which was not successful for me..but these little wipes I used on my face only and they gave me a nice,even tan..I didn&#x27;t use gloves or a mitt when I used the wipes and they didn&#x27;t leave a stain on my hands but did leave a faint &amp;#34;self tanning lotion&amp;#34; smell on them for about a day..these wipes worked well for my face,neck, chest and shoulders...that&#x27;s about all I got out of them before it dried out..I didn&#x27;t use on my arms or legs..I would buy these again</li>
            <li> What many of the reviewers say is true.. The product is lightweight, easy to transport and apply, snd has little to no smell. This would be the best self-tanner on the market if only it worked. Did I receive a bad batch? To be continued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different brands of tan towels. This is one of them. These had zero effect. It could be that the window, that these towels react, within, passed. That would explain why they didn&#x27;t work. However, Every brand of tan towels that I have tried had the same result. There wasn&#x27;t any effect/tan. I can&#x27;t believe that every brand that I have tried, to date, have been sitting on Amazon&#x27;s selves for over 6 months. I don&#x27;t buy it. I think all of these tan towels have a window, from the time they are manufactured, of 1 - 3 weeks, tops. It&#x27;s difficult to believe that an effective tan towel can&#x27;t be found.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I was psyched for these to come because the reviews were so awesome. Not so much. And I&#x27;m bummed because I bought two boxes thinking it would be fabulous. First it takes two towels to cover your whole body, not one. I covered my legs and torso and then the towel was dry. I have been using self tanner in it&#x27;s various forms for years. I know how to apply it. You can&#x27;t just wipe it over the surface of your skin. You need to be very deliberate and careful with the application, especially with tanning towels because there is no color guide. You also need to use vertical and horizontal strokes so you don&#x27;t get streaks. Well I had streaks. Obvious streaks. So I buffed my skin and waited a week then tried it again. Still streaky.  On the plus side the color is really good, very natural. And it dries very quickly but that&#x27;s why I think it streaks so easily. So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do with the rest the towelettes - when necessary I am going to apply them to my legs and arms in between my gel self tanner applications. They are portable so I&#x27;ll take them with me to Vegas and pray that I don&#x27;t end up with streaks on my butt.</li>
            <li> I thought the towels would be a little thicker; the thinness makes them harder to use and I had to use several of them to get the desired color I want.  But thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Good price and quick results</li>
            <li> Not worth all the hype...waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> worked great but follow the rules. I went swimming 12 hours after I applied it and had streaking</li>
            <li> I have been using self-tanning products for over 10 years and this product is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve tried. The towelette dries out quickly, it leaves tons of streaks, and does not give you much color. I can barely finish applying the product to 1 leg before it is completely dry. It generally takes 2-3 towelettes to cover my slim body.I tried multiple applications to try to enhance the color and it only made the streaks more prominent. I would definitely advise against purchasing this product. Tanning products I have tried and really liked the results are Tan Towels, Shiseido Self Tanning Gel and Fake Bake.The smell may not be the best with these other products but they leave great color and NO STREAKS.</li>
            <li> The price is great but the towels are too thin and small. I had a hard time applying...the towelette kept rolling up and I couldn&#x27;t get an even application. The color I did get was good, but not worth the frustration with the small towelette</li>
            <li> I had an opportunity to try this product out. I have tried other things from their company and have loved them. It is nice to get 20 decent size tan towelettes in this set. I would suggest reading the package before you start. It suggest not to shave with in 24 hours before using this product. I would also suggest not shaving for at least 24 hours after applying this product. What I did instead was use my own exfoliated. I got the exfoliated beads on amazon and added to my soap to light get the dead skin off. Then after I did that I moisturized the skin a lot and then did another round before I applied the towelettes. I then after waiting the proper time used the towelettes. I can say one give a nice soft not fake looking tan. If you are wanting more then do your body and you can come back or wait another day and apply another one. The is a product that is layer able.  I would use this again. It is nice to not worry about ruining your skin potentially by the weather. Make sure you try to wear some time of glove when applying these. I would suggest after you have applied it in all the spots lightly go back and run them over the hands, feet, knees, and elbows. Those are the part that will be most noticeable if not applied correctly. As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I tried and  was not impressed at all!  I have to agree with another reviewer that tan towels are much better.  The towel was small and bunched up as you used it.  It dried out pretty quickly.  I could only use one towel for my life&#x27;s and another for my area - tan towels you only need one.  I&#x27;m sorry I purchased will be sending back.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and work well.</li>
            <li> Product did not work for neither myself, nor my wife.  Specifically, it was far too streaky, and required 3 towelettes per application, which produced a slight color change.  The color itself was fine, however due to the fact it was so streaky, we never continued beyond 3 separate applications to see what a deeper tan would look like.  We did prep before using the product, but if the product requires extreme measures to produce an even tan, which many other self-tanners we have used before don&#x27;t, then this product is not for us.  Sorry I bought it, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Follow up to my original review.....just ordered my second box!  I am in love with this product!  Dries superfast!  Do plan to use double the amount of towelettes as compared to the competitor&#x27;s product.  I use one towelette for each leg and one towelette for each arm.  I am very petite (5&#x27;1&amp;#34;), have dry skin and live in Florida.</li>
            <li> Just perfect. Never using any self tanner but thermalabs! No streak, even coating, natural glow. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I like these a lot - nice color, easy application, great for travel.</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product. Easy to use and convienent way to use self tanner.</li>
            <li> gave me streaks but did work. if they could eliminate the streaks this would be awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> nice bronze color and goes on nice and even with the towelettes</li>
            <li> After reading lots of good reviews on this product, I was excited to try it. I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for years, and am a huge fan of them. I was very disappointed by this product. The towelettes did not stay moist. I ended up having to use 4 at a time to apply from chest-legs. The color was hardly noticeable. I followed all instructions before applying, cleansing exfoliating etc. The one pro was that they do not smell bad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product, it made my legs look orange after the 3rd time of using it.</li>
            <li> Love love love them!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I bought the Thermalabs self tanner lotion back in July and loved it! I was out so I went online and then I saw the Glow 2 go towels by Thermalabs and decided to try it. I fell in love!!! The result are amazing! Very natural and not orange!!! I would definitely recommend this to all the self tanner lovers!!!</li>
            <li> The Glow2Go Tan Towels are convenient, easy to use, gives you a beautiful tan and leaves your skin feeling fresh and alive.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to pack for travel as apposed to cream, gel  or spray bottles and so simple to apply. Wow. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Streaky and horrible. Had to hide my legs for about a week until it wore off.</li>
            <li> Great idea, perfect for travel. Doesn&#x27;t smell funky. Easy to apply evenly. One towelette covers both of my [thin] legs. However, very pale, hard to detect any color change with one application, requires multiple applications over several days to be sufficient. Best to use to maintain color achieved with another product, especially if traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light and have tried all sorts of self tanners bc I&#x27;m not supposed to go in the sun.  Tan towels have been my fav but figured I&#x27;d try something new.  Pros of this. Gives a nice tan color no orange, no weird smell, last for a long time 3/4 days. Cons- towelettes dry out quickly and doesn&#x27;t smoothly apply. Comes out pretty streaky and you can&#x27;t tell until a few hours later and it&#x27;s too late to fix. Not sure if I wil buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product first time I used it I got it on a little uneven but it was subtle and not noticable, I applied it two days later and it is fabulous!!!  I have fair pink skin and always end up orangey, but not with this product. I highly recommend it to anyone😍</li>
            <li> Best color I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a tanning product, with no odor.</li>
            <li> The color is natural and looks great. Best product for the face!  The towels dry a little too fast and one needs to use two towels to get full body coverage. It took me two times to get a light tan look and I have light skin color. I&#x27;m thinking it will take to more times to get the color I want.  The product it a little too pricey. I would consider buying it again  on sale, if the color last longer then Fake Baked.</li>
            <li> Toweletts are too small and only cover one arm (5&#x27;6&amp;#34;. 125 lbs).  They do not go on well and smear easily. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do not use this product..it contains a large amount of alcohol, which will dry out your skin and may cause you to seek medical treatment.. Side affects are hives, itching, pain and bumps that last forever, if you have sensitive skin my dermatologist said there are products out there with less alcohol and perfume... Haven&#x27;t found it yet, any input would be greatly appreciated..</li>
            <li> I did not notice much shade difference after using 2 packets on my face.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply. You need to use two towelettes to apply all over &amp; it still streaked orangish. Still have a half of box that I will not use. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These new towelettes are wonderful. I heard about the launch of this new product on Facebook and got it while it was on 50% off sale and I’m so happy I did. Fast delivery, great packaging - I simply love the fact I don’t have to open the box but simply pull one towelette each time which makes my bathroom closet just a tiny-bit more organized ;-) and the results are fast, reliable and gives you the perfect tan. One thing I would like to mention is that if you’re not a skinny little girl you’ll need 2 towelettes to cover most of your body but it’s the same like the other brands.</li>
            <li> Great color. Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Thermalabs customer for a long time and this is definitely another great product, even easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love these! Got them to take on my upcoming cruise!</li>
            <li> These are such a GREAT price!! I normally buy another brand of tanning towels that are much more expensive, so when I saw these, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try! :) I tried one out and left it overnight and the results are great! There was a lot of color, and I am very happy with these!! I just saw that the price has been reduced even more!! I will have to buy more now!! :D Thanks!  Oh, BTW I have been using all sorts of tanning products for several years now, so I can say that tanning towels are the best option. They don&#x27;t stain your clothing while processing, they don&#x27;t smell as bad as lotions, and they are not messy!! :)</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, but these may be the worst tanning wipes I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t be swayed by the incredible price! They are small and slightly dry, which I would&#x27;ve dealt with because, again, the price is right. I did my entire body and was feeling good about the product, UNTIL I woke up the next morning. Oh my goodness! I haven&#x27;t seen streaks and blotches like that since 1993 when I tried my 1st tanning lotion. IT. WAS. TERRIBLE. I jumped in the shower and scrubbed like I&#x27;d been sprayed by a skunk! I scrubbed every single day for a WEEK and I still had streaks. So I guess that could be a &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34;, I lasts forever and won&#x27;t scrub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away. Stay VERY far away from these tanning wipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture I posted is after a week of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I moved to SE Florida a year ago and would never have thought I would be in need of a self tanner, however I suffered from agoraphobia and was unable to leave my home and enjoy the sunshine here like I thought I would be able to when I relocated from Wisconsin.&lt;br /&gt;A year later I have finally overcome the agoraphobia, however I still had my \\&quot;Wisconsin Tan\\&quot; which was snow white skin!&lt;br /&gt;The thought of walking on the beach looking so white was very unappealing to me, so when I heard about these Self Tanning Towelettes, I knew I had to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;And I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Thermalabs shipped quickly and the individually packaged towelettes arrived in a very attractive box.&lt;br /&gt;Anxious to hit the beach, I took the time to read the easy to understand directions on the back of the packet and crossed my fingers that the reviews I had read were true.&lt;br /&gt;After showering and exfoliating my skin, I used gloves to wipe down my legs, arms and torso in even strokes as directed and waited to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that Thermalabs reminded me to use sparingly around my ankles, elbows and knees as I know from experience with other self tanners, that if you apply too much to these areas, they tend to appear darker and unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;As my skin was so extremely white, while I did see a slight difference after the first application, it was more of a glow than what could be considered a tan.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I got up, opened a second packet and repeated the process. Within a few hours I could see that this product really works!&lt;br /&gt;I had the beginnings of a bona fide suntan. No streaks, no orange tint, just a natural appearance as if I had been out for a walk in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s day 3 and I have again repeated the process with a 3rd towelette and I can honestly say I am confident enough to go for a walk on the beach!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft and has the appearance of a natural tan without the sunburn or the risk of skin cancer from too much time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Thermalabs for enabling me to feel good about my appearance when I am out and about in the land of daily sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving your company and these Sunless Self Tanning Tan Towels my highest recommendation.eel good about my appearance when I am out and about in the land of daily sunshine.  I am giving your company and these Sunless Self Tanning Tan Towels my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these tanning towelettes! They are the best tanning product I have used so far- including a spray tan at the salon! They come in handy little individually wrapped packages so you can use them anywhere, anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted by the result and the color! No streaks, no orange tint, just a natural appearance as if I had been out for a walk on the beach...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color you get with these on the first use is comparable to 4-5 applications of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to shower and exfoliate really well before using.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products when it comes to self tanning. Usually these wipes only come in packs of 10 but this box has not 10 but 20 wipes! They are easy to open and easy to read instructions. When you open them, there isn&#x27;t a bad smell to them and they wipe easily so you can get a nice even tan when you want it and where you want it. Not to mention they leave you looking beautiful! One wipe covers a large percentage of your skin. I have enjoyed using them especially in the winter when you want a nice glow to your skin instead of the boring, dull, pasty colored skin. These are perfect for all skin types and will make your skin beautiful! I highly recommend these for any and all people!</li>
            <li> 20 come in a box I wanted a light glow because I&#x27;m very light. Summer around the corner I will get a head start on my tan. I love the facet that these are good for traveling. So If I don&#x27;t have enough time to lay in the sun. The Glow 2 Go will help it it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You can take anywhere they come in 20 small packs in a box. First I showered and then apply on my face and body. It does not have any smell to it, so that great it will not over power my perfume or body sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit I was scared at first. I didn&#x27;t want to get to tan just a natural healthy glow. You put on a  Natural Healthy Overnight Indoor Quick Tan for Legs, Arms and Face. In the comfort of your own home. No need to run to the tanning salon you can apply everywhere on you body. It&#x27;s safe and has. 70% Organic Body Cream Formula for Light, Pale, Fair, Medium, Olive or Dark Summer Skin Complexion.  It&#x27;s streak free and less than four hours. Comes with money Back Guarantee!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! It gave me a beautiful glow to start and about 4 hours after I had applied it I had a natural looking tan. I did have to do 2 applications to get the tan a little darker. I really like that there were no streaks, even though when I was applying it I couldn&#x27;t tell where I had already applied. This is because it goes on clear and dries fast. but even though I&#x27;m pretty sure I did a double pass on a few spots, the results were even and beautiful! I have tried different self tanners and this is definitely the easiest and my favorite. The towel itself feels like a baby wipe, it&#x27;s so soft and there&#x27;s only the tiniest scent of a tanner. You almost can&#x27;t smell it. I am absolutely addicted!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, was even better than described.  Goes on quick, smooth and even, convenient for travel.  No mess, The color looks fabulous.(and Im fair so that&#x27;s tricky)  I also like the lotion. It smells great and really moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> Customer care could not be better!  And that care and followup helps get better results from this product.  At first, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the L&#x27;Oréal towelettes, but once my skin was prepared and used to the product, BANG!  Not only a warm natural tan, even on face, but no fake tan smell.  And it doesn&#x27;t rub off!  And, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin!.  The lotion is also awesome.  As long as the price is good, so am I.</li>
            <li> About the size of the wipes you find a a BBQ joint and turns you the color of BBQ Sauce</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to apply and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Nice price too.</li>
            <li> These pads cover one arm before drying.  I didn&#x27;t have any change in my coloring and am VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, like they say, &amp;#34;if it seems too good to be true, it probably is not&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I do not think they are big enough, and they seem to feel dry really fast, leaving you to open up another one.  A box of twenty will not last long.  The coverage is not great, left white streaks on myself.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Only complaint is that I have to use so many (4) just to get my upper body done.  Makes it kind of expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me.  Gives a great bronze color and no streaks!  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Personal discount provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that it does work - it tans, and it does it gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to travel with- each wipe is individually packaged.&lt;br /&gt;First color development is pretty, it is a golden glow, not orange&lt;br /&gt;Though it has a smell, it doesn&#x27;t cling to the skin, and it isn&#x27;t a bad odor&lt;br /&gt;After first wipe, I didn&#x27;t have darker palms or knees&lt;br /&gt;Developed overnight for me.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for days and days- about 6 for me before it even began to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;Mixed results- my 19yo ended up with a HUGE rusty line down his chest after 1 application.  My results were more even and subtle, it was only after I&#x27;d used 2 wipes that I started seeing rusty lines.  After just the first wipe, I really liked the product.&lt;br /&gt;To get a significant tan, it takes me 4 applications, but then it isn&#x27;t even&lt;br /&gt;Wipes are not big enough or saturated enough for me - thinner women and men might fare better.  But larger people might find they use 2 wipes at once&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great of a value......THOUGH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you just want a golden glow of color and not a real all over dark self-tan, then just use one towelette- this product works well for my very pale skin when I only use one wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think there are less expensive options out there that work better for a tan, but this IS good for a quick and easy glow- *IF* you only use ONE.  The more I used, the worse it got.</li>
            <li> They work I will order again thank you so much !</li>
            <li> I thought these tanning towels worked no better or worse than the other towels I&#x27;ve used. The others however cover more skin with one towel so, financially  those would be my first choice. They do streak some, they all do, but the color was good. If these were just a little larger they would be a better choice.</li>
            <li> These toweletts are either too dry or they dont have anything on them to make them smoothly glide on the skin. They roll up as I try to apply to my body. Once I CAN get the product on, it looks nice and last a few days. It&#x27;s taking 1 towel per leg and that&#x27;s not a value. I will be going back to the more expensive Loreal&#x27; towels.</li>
            <li> It works. However, I prefer the self tanning lotion for a better result. The advantage to the self tan towelettes is it works quicker than lotion, without the normal tanning odor. I used one towelette on my legs, avoiding knees and ankles, as directed. Though I thought I applied it evenly, the tan was patchy. It&#x27;s easier to miss a spot or apply unevenly using the towelette, compared to the self tanning lotion. Next time I will use one towelette for each leg individually in the hopes of seeing a better result.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful!! I don&#x27;t get why it has so many positive (fake?) reviews.. I followed the directions before and during application and it still went horribly wrong. The trouble is, is that when you&#x27;re using the towelettes, you can&#x27;t tell where the stuff is going since it goes on clear. Also, after the tan is done developing (several hours) it&#x27;s there to STAY.. I spent most of the morning trying to remove my streaks and splotches with lemon juice and baking soda in the bath tub and it barely lightened it. After scrubbing and scrubbing I used a little bit of my &#x27;Fake Bake&#x27; to try to blend out my skin tone and that seemed to be the only thing the worked. I have a wedding to attend next weekend so I&#x27;m super glad I gave this stuff a test run before hand or I would&#x27;ve been screwed. I&#x27;ll be returning it and hopefully get my money refunded.. Off to buy more Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these self-tanning single use towelettes!! They&#x27;re portable, which means I can carry a few in my purse or in my suitcase when I&#x27;m travelling. Also, there&#x27;s a dispenser slot on the side of the box, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the box coming open and them spilling out everywhere. They offer great coverage- which is wonderful because I can get pretty pale during the winter months &amp; the coverage is buildable- meaning if I want to be darker, I can apply more than one towelette! Yay!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this golden tone.  I used it once and it left a very nice shade.  Nice product, I will continue to use this during the cold winter days to make me look like I just got back from the beach :)</li>
            <li> Tanning and looking bright and colorful is something I am always after. Now as a white girl I have 2 shades pale or lobster when I tan outside or in a tanning bed. First world problems right there. I have tried many different tanning lotions, sprays, tanning beds, and baking in the sun. Unfortunately I am living in an extremely cold climate and not having good luck with tanning booths or lotions this has been an awesome product for myself. Just wipe on but not to much around your elbows knees and hands. It took about 4 hours for the tan to appear but looked great. I did only half of one arm to be able to show the difference of just one cloth. It took me a few tries to be able to get the hang of it without any missed spots but over all it is a great product and looks fabulous. I love that it comes with 20 individually packaged towelettes which is really great I can do my entire body with just 2 cloths which is very nice and it lasts a while. I have had it for over a week and it hasn&#x27;t faded yet even through showering. I was so gracious I received this product to see if it will help this poor white girl and share my experiences on it.</li>
            <li> I am now a customer for life! I absolutely love this product! It doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell most products do and it leaves my skin a beautiful color. It is very easy to apply and does not leave my tan looking streaky. Absolutely love love love these.</li>
            <li> YES! I have used all those sunless self tanning gels and creams but they always make me look orange, streaky, or it goes on darker in certain spots! These wipes are so much better than all of that! Your palms won&#x27;t turn dark, and you get really great coverage! It only takes about 4 hours, but the tan is perfectly even! The best part? There is NO SMELL! I hate the way all the creams smell. You have to use at least 2-3 towels to get full body coverage, but if you don&#x27;t do areas that are covered all the time, you can get away with 1!</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get nervous whenever I decide to try self tanning products, results can vary dramatically, and if those results aren&#x27;t good,... well then you&#x27;re stuck with them until they fade away. The most horrible, orangey, splotchy, streaky, hide your head in shame type bottled tan will always, ALWAYS be the tan that lasts the longest too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have decided I like about these self tanning wipes is they start you off with a nice light bit of color, being fair skinned I like that because it&#x27;s easier for me to control where, and how much color I want. These are so simple to use too. After about 4 hours you will be able to see if you want to go a bit darker and can apply another application if you like, then apply again about once a week to keep the color from fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a box of 20 individually packaged tanning towelettes, perfect for vacation time! No mess with these towelettes either, unlike the traditional bottle or spray method. The towelettes are like wet wipes and aren&#x27;t greasy or sticky, very easy to apply evenly. Wait 10 minutes before getting dressed, and make sure you wash your hands after applying. This has been the simplest self tanning product I have used!</li>
            <li> These definitely will give you a tan. I thought I would be able to see the stuff when I applied it on my skin but you do not. It goes on invisible. About four hours or so later and then you can see the new color of your skin. I would not recommend using this on your face because I think it would be too hard to not to get noticeable tan lines and you could end up looking quite silly. I used these on my legs. I only used it twice and then I had the color I wanted. The only thing that is a bummer is I cannot see the product spreading on my skin, so it is easy to get some uneven color. For example, I wiped this thoroughly all over my legs but for some reason the back of my legs had areas that did not look tan. There were white areas. I don&#x27;t know how that happens though since I wiped everywhere as evenly as I possibly could. It was not a big deal though because I was not that tan which made it not that noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice to get used to using these and to discover the color you want. After waiting four or more hours and you still want to be tanner, just grab another wipe and wipe on the area. Be careful to not put too much around your ankles, knees, or elbows or it will look funny. Also, wash your hands immediately after using the wipe. You probably should scrub them. I washed after using them but probably not well enough and my palms were brown the next day. I like how easy it was to use these wipes without any real work. You should probably exfoliate your skin as much as possible before using this product, though. I&#x27;m not sure how long this product is supposed to last with showers and shaving. I will find out soon enough, though. The instructions did not tell me. Once you find the color you like you should only have to use a wipe one or two times a week. You may need to play around to see how frequently you will need to reapply. Fortunately, this box comes with 20 and I found that two wipes gives me the color I want. I will continue to use these because I do like the color it gives me and it was easy to use. With practice and patience, I think I have figured out to get a nice tan with these. It does not take long at all because you’re just wiping a pre-moistened wipe on the area you want to tan. Make sure you wait until you see the tan before using a second wipe. Try to make it as even as possible. That is where it took a little practice with me. I think this is a great product for giving me a quick tan. I like the results. I received a discount on this product through a promotion. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this productese because I do like the color it gives me and it was easy to use.

            <li> Love!!! I would like to buy these wholesale . Where can I find them.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for me. One use and I had a nice soft glow. I am pleased to see such a difference with just one application. I am going to use them weekly to keep a light tan through the rest of the cold season. I didn&#x27;t streak and there was no chemical smell. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a safer way to tan.</li>
            <li> Towelettes are very small and do not appear to have much product on them.  I used one and could not see ANY results.  You would probably have to use 3 or 4 to cover your body.  Very dissapointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Great product  instructions a very accurate. Easy to use</li>
            <li> These self tanning towelettes are great. I got these as a promotional item. I am in a wedding coming up soon and I don&#x27;t like tanning beds. These gave me a great streak free tan. And they are so easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These work well. I think it is more for fair skin people then people who already have a tan on them. I did not see much of a difference on me because I am fairly tanned but when I put it on my husband he turned a shade darker.</li>
            <li> The customer service is AMAZING.  Truly.&lt;br /&gt;I find that there is not enough tanner on one towelette to do your entire body.  You need 1 for the top half and one for the bottom half.&lt;br /&gt;The tan is definitely natural - do NOT expect dramatic results.  I can&#x27;t speak on how that &amp;#34;builds&amp;#34; if you use it multiple days in a row, I haven&#x27;t tried that.  Dont want to waste much on my legs now in the dead of winter!&lt;br /&gt;They are INCREDIBLY convenient to use.  NO streaking - no weird brushes or mitts to use - seriously fast application - exactly how I love it.  NO weird brown hands after either!  Just wash right away, totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it gave a SLIGHTLY darker tan - I&#x27;d buy up more RIGHT now to prep for my wedding in July!</li>
            <li> great coverage and very natural looking. Nice to not have to wear foundation--and bonus--as a red head I wont blind people with my white WHITE skin!!</li>
            <li> I had to use several towels to get some color, I returned these not what the photos showed.</li>
            <li> I used as directions stated and was extremely streaky. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I like these.  They are the best I have tried so far. I will buy them again.  No orange tint.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have always been afraid to use products that will give me an “instant tan” with the fear that it could possibly make me look orange. I have very light colored skin and it would be very easy for a product to look orange. I have definitley tried products in the past that I wasn’t impressed with. The Glow 2 Go product looks natural, it is easy to apply,and has fast results. No orange streaks, which I love. I even gave a few packs to a friend of mine and she tried the product and LOVED it as well. I used 2 towelettes and I was able to do my full body, if you wanted you could just use 1 towelette and do partial body.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Definitely the best self tanning product I have used thus far.  I have been searching for a product that delivers a natural golden color, and doesn&#x27;t streak, and this product does it all.  Plus it lasts longer than anything else I have used and does not come off on sheets or clothes.  It gives the same level of color/tan I get from a weekend on the beach, but without the damage!!  I do recommend using a good scrub beforehand and following up 4 hours later with another towel to intensify color.  Also, I do notice the level of color intensifies a couple of days after initial use. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love it .Easy to use.. great results.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations..nic</li>
            <li> This was the worst self tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I was so excited about this product because i read some really good reviews. I have really pale skin and I don&#x27;t tan, I just burn, so self tanners are a must for me in the summer. I used the Kardashian brand for a while but I decided to try something else on a whim so I found this. First off, it smells terrible. Like really bad. It smells super chemically and weird. Secondly, &amp;#34;Streak free&amp;#34; my ass. This stuff left a ton of streaks all over my legs and stomach and now I look like a zebra. Worse that a zebra. Like a splotchy zebra with lepersy. I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product and will definately just stick with my current brand.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very fair complexion and fears the sun.  She burns very easily.  I allowed her to go to a tanning bed salon for a couple months to get a tan for prom and the color looked so nice on her.  When I told her no more she was so disappointed but I fear the repercussions and health risks associated with tanning beds.  In come these self tan towelettes, they appeared easy use and the reviews were excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all they work.  They did not make her skin look orange and gave her a golden looking tan that last for about a week.  Use one towelette for top half of your body and another for the bottom, wait ten minutes to completely dry as recommended.  As time goes by you will get darker, after 4 hours it will reach it&#x27;s maximum level of darkness.  The more often you use it, the darker you will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are waterproof, odorless and safe for your skin.</li>
            <li> The Tanning Towels arrived with no delay. After trying it for two weeks I am extremely impressed, no one can tell that this is a \\&quot;tan in a can.\\&quot; As Southern Belle I was raised that the sun was enemy. However tired of the white pasty look that months indoors causes I was looking for a product that was inexpensive and easy to you. Yet something that would not damage my skin, or cause the orange look that many products leave.  I received the product and scrubbed my skin to exfoliate. The package said do not shave 24 hours prior so I did not shave. After my shower I used the product. It was easy to apply, and the directions were as simple as 1,2,3. I wore rubber gloves to prevent staining, and began to wipe down with the product starting with my arms and legs. The product goes on clear but if you are systematic you can apply the product with no problem. My husband helped to apply the product on my back and neck. I have Psoriasis and at times products can cause a burning sensation, The Towelettes did not cause any discomfort. There was no scent, and was not sticky or greasy. I got a nice deep tan after apply the product.  The package said not to get dressed for 10 minutes, and I waited for 15 just to be on the safe side. After 4 hours I noticed a really nice glow, however I wanted to go a little darker and applied a second coat.  I have gotten compliment after compliment wondering if I went to the beach or the islands over the weekend. I have applied it once daily since the initial application to make sure that I maintain that beautiful glow. I looking forward to seeing how long it takes to fade once I finish the box.</li>
            <li> They are just fine - not enough product on the wipes in my opinion.  Plus I don&#x27;t like being hounded four times from the seller about how much I like these things, and how to use a tanning wipe.  It isn&#x27;t rocket science.</li>
            <li> Tanning cloths arrived at my home via Amazon on time and product was accurate as described.  The product is simple to use and you must read the directions on hand washing after its application to your covered area or your hands turn orange.  The product was able to tanned my wiped areas within 24 hours but noticed in comparison to Loreal&#x27;s tanning products in the Amazon catalog, Loreal produced a deeper tan with longer sustainability, and have more tanning surface area of cloth but is twice the price and half of the qty.  Note, Glo to glo product is great for its price and QTY, but in terms of tanning color longevity, richness of the tan, and lesser surface area of the cloth, you get what you paid for.  I will still use this Glo 2 glo product for the price and tan quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product, not to mention the customer service that comes with it. Emails to make sure you love the product and advice and tips to help you be successful in using it.</li>
            <li> great stuff no streaking</li>
            <li> Color showed up after a few hours but spotty. Nice tone but need more than one towel for even just top of body to ensure no blotchiness. Noticed some streaking on hands and arms - again better using more than less!</li>
            <li> Great self tanner for beginners. It&#x27;s practically foolproof, provides a nice natural glow, and dries very quickly. I&#x27;ve used spray self-tanners, and while they give a deeper tan, they also are a lot messier to apply. I use 3 towelettes for a complete body application. Very pleased with this product and plan to reorder in spring/summer to maintain a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this self tanner! I&#x27;ve used many different ones and this one is hands down the best! The smell is pleasant and Inlike how easy it goes on.  No streaks and it leave a nice color or glow! I&#x27;ve  gotten many compliments and will definetly buy it again !</li>
            <li> This really works! Leaves a nice color- looks like I have been sun kissed!</li>
            <li> The color these towels provide is beautiful; not orange-y at all. However, I am a tall person and the towels lose their moisture/tanning effect quickly. So I have to use one towel per leg, one towel per arm/shoulder, one towel for abdomen/lower back. So I end up needing 5 towelettes for my first once over on my body. If I&#x27;m going any darker, that&#x27;s half a box in just two days! Also, the towels quickly dry, so streaking can be an issue if you&#x27;re using gloves and don&#x27;t feel that it is not wet anymore.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic-Used them two days in a row and my hands and arms look lovely.</li>
            <li> I do love these Self Tan Towelettes.  They gave my pale skin a very natural looking tan and lasted for a few days.</li>
            <li> The customer service is great, but I am not thrilled with the product. The towelettes are OK to use on my face, but the residual smell is very unpleasant (and lasts for at least 2 days, even after washing my face). I know that all of the fake tanning products have somewhat of a smell no matter what they advertise, but this certain smell has been my least favorite (it almost smells like I&#x27;ve been laying in a tanning bed). I tried using the towelettes all over my body, and not only did I have to use several towelettes to ensure coverage, I found it very hard to get even coverage and was left with several streaks on my legs. I typically use the Fake Bake Flawless spray or the St. Tropez mousse and apply with an applicator mitt and have been much happier with those products. As far as smell, I think Fake Bake is the best. As far as color, I like the Fake Bake and St. Tropez equally.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is probably the BEST self tanning wipes and method overall, I&#x27;ve bought. The packaging is very convenient so you can take you individual packets on the go or in your purse- they are small too! At first I was skeptical because I was afraid I would wipe the towelette too many times making my skin look orange BUT I was wrong. After about 10 minutes you get your complete look. It&#x27;s a gradual progress that in the end makes a difference. The wipes make you look tan, but at the same time natural instead of an &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; color. Overall, I will defiantly buy more of their products and these wipes! I&#x27;m a very happy costumer :)</li>
            <li> I used this product and i did have some steaking. although it has a great color, its the perfect tan color</li>
            <li> On time shipping product works well need to use it for few day for nice tan</li>
            <li> This product scared me at first because I am very fair and pale. I worried it would look orange. It was easy to apply. I rub it in well after exfoliating. I recommend exfoliating for a streak free application and look. It stayed on and looked good for about 3 days before I needed to touch up and it was so simple.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I used it once so far and I can see great results. I will get better at it as I go along as I can see I need to be a bit more careful when doing around my ankle/feet area. The company, Thermalabs is very helpful as they send email tips on how to use these towelettes. I would definitely refer this item to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> These wipes are AMAZING!!!!  You have to get them.  Leaves you with a natural glow.  No tanning lotion scent.  Last for two days!  I look and feel great!  Addicting!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily with two to three cloths for entire body. No smell and great golden color.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t streak or look uneven.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and friendly emails! Great product for a great price. :)</li>
            <li> you would need 4 or 5 towels to do your whole body..the lotion on the towel only worked for 1 leg when I woke up the other was completely white and the one that was tan was spotted all over...not a fan</li>
            <li> I love it .. I&#x27;ll bay mor and mor</li>
            <li> My friend bought this and loves it, so I am giving it the 5 stars.  I bought it so I will not look like a ghost when I go to FL next month, but I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used but twice, seems to work. Have to use 2 wipes per application, but less messy..</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned so this didnt work well for me. Too dark and a bit orange for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Have to use two towels in order to make sure your whole body is covered and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;4&#x27;, 135 lbs. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s half the price of other leading brands.</li>
            <li> best tanning wipes, have recommended to many people that also love them!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I am assuming some of them were fabricated.... These wipes did leave streaks. Turned my hands orange and I wouldn&#x27;t ever buy them again.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money. Should have stuck to buying what I always have L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Tanning Wipes are the best. The 1st package I used from this barely showed, then tried the 2nd, 3rd, then just threw the entire box away.</li>
            <li> HOLY FREAKIN STREAKS! I bought this product based on its mostly decent reviews. Well.........I wont be able to wear shorts, dresses, skirts, or short sleeved ANYTHING for probably a month! HORRIBLE. I look like a brown zebra! This is the worst tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. The streaks and blotching are horrific and are getting WORSE by the hour!  I followed the instructions to the T and it came out awful. Sending this junk back for a refund. Hopefully this stuff fades quick!</li>
            <li> Worked good on my face but streaked on my arms and chest and doesn&#x27;t stay moist or have enough left to do even half a body like the other brand I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use towelettes. Give a nice even self tan.</li>
            <li> These worked well. Make sure you let yourself dry completely before getting dressed. They didn&#x27;t smell to bad and came individually wrapped..</li>
            <li> This is a product for those who want a light sunkissed look, and I do mean light. The towel dries out very quickly as it isn&#x27;t very damp to begin with. I prefer Tan Towel but I thought I would give this a try. I&#x27;ll stick with my prefered product. You pay less for this but use more.</li>
            <li> Subtle gradual tanning without orangey tones.  Very easy to apply.  I needed 2 packages for both upper and lower body.  Use it quickly as the towelettes dry out rapidly.  I would definitely order these agin.  It beats gels and creams hands down.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product. Even nice tanning result.</li>
            <li> I tried all the tips and tricks but I just couldn&#x27;t use this product without being streaky. Used more per body part the second time around and still didn&#x27;t get it right. However, besides looking like I had a disease, the tan color that took was natural looking and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have used other products......but this really works awesome it dries fast no streaking and blends super ...it has the look of basking out in the sun ...by just applying and staying indoors....I plan on using always using this now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used self tanning towels for years, due to getting melanoma skin cancer twice. I&#x27;ve been using the brand name Tan Towel Plus &amp; thought I&#x27;d check these out due to offer. What a rip off! I asked for a refund! These towels are so little, have only a small amount of tanning solution on them, didn&#x27;t notice much of a different color change, etc. Compared to the brand Tan Towels, it&#x27;s definitely a loser! The Tan Towel brand towel goes much, much further for your money!  I&#x27;ll tell you a little secret about tanning, I discovered awhile back! I&#x27;ve tanned my whole life, born &amp; raised near beach in Florida, but after cancer scare &amp; removal, I&#x27;ve certainly learned my lesson about &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34; in the sun! But I still need a little sunshine, to keep my spirits up, feel better, Dr recommended it too for my bones, due to early osteoporosis, etc. I began using an amino acid called L-Tyrosine for energy, lift mood, etc., with B6 vitamin about 10 years ago, I&#x27;d get at Health Food Stores, now Amazon here carries it! I began noticing for some odd reason I began tanning, without burning very rapidly, in a very short time! Suddenly realized it had something to do with the L-Tyrosine. &amp; did some research! Come to find out, it assists the tanning chemical in our skin melanin, which turns our skin brown! Whoa! So I got to looking at bottles of tanning accelerator ingredients &amp; guess what most of them contain! L-TYROSINE!!! I take 2,000 mgs (it sounds like a lot, but recommended dosage is 1,000-5,000 mgs for what I take it for, it&#x27;s completely safe as an amino acid) upon arising every morning, on an empty stomach with B6 vitamin &amp; look at all the benefits! I&#x27;ll now tan brown in 1-11/2  hour&#x27;s &amp; get same bronze tan in what use to take 4-5 hours of laying in the sun &amp;#34;baking&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Will not buy again will stick with tan towel</li>
            <li> So far I have used this once. I LOVE THE COLOR! Not orange at all. In fact, i liked it even better after my first shower. The only problem is ... you really TAN! so if you miss spots, you can definitely see them. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do both my hands in one sitting yet. You can&#x27;t really wash your hands after or wear a glove. I would love tips on this. Definitely didn&#x27;t do my back. You need someone you trust to do it, because like I said, you TAN so if you miss.... you will see. One towel didn&#x27;t quite do both my legs. I am 5&#x27;2 125lbs, so I am not that big but, I had less tan on the second leg because the towel dried out. So you will need more than they say. I used 4 towels for 2 legs and 2 arms and just my chest. I am a little scared to do my face. Might need to read a little more before I attempt it.&lt;br /&gt;But I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent self tanner.  I&#x27;ve tried tanning wipes before which left me rather orange. But these wipes leave me with the most beautiful color!  No orange! Just a great bronzed shade. I&#x27;ve used them several times and already am tanned!  Thank you Thermalabs! I&#x27;ve battled skin cancer from tanning and can&#x27;t use the beds or the natural sunlight. Now I can be safely tanned all year! I recommend these wipes to everyone.  They are amazing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use/apply, did notice a slight difference in  color a few hours after applying.  Only giving it 3 stars though as it was blotchy in some places, particularly on my neck.  Arms &amp; legs were okay though.  Will use them for touch ups on legs &amp; arms, but would not recommend these wipes for overall body tan.</li>
            <li> These go on easy and you can pick how dark you want to be.</li>
            <li> I normally use St. Tropez&#x27;s Self Tan Bronzing Mousse, but that can get expensive, so I was excited to possibly find a more inexpensive option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes come in trendy gold-toned packaging.  The instructions say to unfold and apply towelette all over your body as needed.  Pretty simple, so I started right away!  One of the first things I noticed was that unpleasant self-tan odor that comes with the majority of self tanning products on the market.  I have been lucky enough to find a few brands that don&#x27;t leave you smelling like a fake bake, but this is not one of them.  I then was surprised to see how quickly the towelette felt dry, as if all of the product had been used up.  I ended up using THREE towelettes, just to do my legs!  So, when I originally I thought that this box would give me 20 applications of a golden glow.. now I am down to just 5 more, and that&#x27;s only if I want to self-tan my legs and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was disappointed with how many towelettes I had to use, I was still willing to stick with the product if the results were phenomenal.  So, I waited the directed 4 hours, and took after photos.  Upon comparison.... I don&#x27;t see a single difference.  Maybe I was already too tan to start with, and this works better on pale skin?  Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t get the streaks that other users have complained about, but I feel that might be because I used SO MUCH of the product until I knew I was completely covered.  I also could smell my legs for the rest of the day until I finally took a shower to wash the scent away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;ve gotta be honest - I do not recommend this product.  For the price and the results, it just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, at least not for me!</li>
            <li> Addicted!&lt;br /&gt; I was delighted by the result and the color! looks so natural like after real tanning on a beach! and no doubt it&#x27;s much healthier way and safer! I buy only organic and natural products (food, cosmetics,etc,) and finally I was so happy to find self tanning products which will answer my concerns! I received one tone of the color without any color stains! just perfect! you can repeat few more times if you like to recieve darker color. I combined those tanning wipes along with their lotion and the result is amazing! The lotion feels so good and smooth , I actually replaced my regular for this one!</li>
            <li> Okay. So being that I am whiter than paste, and I live where the sun don&#x27;t shine. I was pretty stoked to try these! I can&#x27;t say I am disappointed.  Now, with that being said. I am clearly captain of the &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know how to evenly apply things&amp;#34; club, because well I missed quite a few spots! So, my mistake, is now something we can laugh at together! Good thing, it&#x27;s winter and I can wear pants! I am sure some baby oil will take it off, (and if it doesn&#x27;t....well...I can wait)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the towelettes are very easy to use. Have no awful smell, and are easy to store.  The color payoff is amazing. No orange, nasty looking skin here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides:&lt;br /&gt;The towels aren&#x27;t as big as I would like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;They did seem to dry out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Color pay off&lt;br /&gt;Not orange&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Enough to last&lt;br /&gt;Color appears fast.&lt;br /&gt;Did not stain my clothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied these two days after shaving, and wasn&#x27;t able to wait the 10min after applying, because I had a three year old who required my attention. Guess what, they didn&#x27;t stain my pants! Product received for review</li>
            <li> my love this they are so easy to use and a great buy</li>
            <li> Maybe its just me..but its is really uncomfortable to put on, the wipes roll up you can&#x27;t really put it on evenly because there is no tent to the wipes, I guess I just prefer lotion.</li>
            <li> These positive reviews have to be a joke.  These are the worst tan towels I have ever used.  I normally use Tan Towels (by far THE best tan towels out there), but decided to give these a try based on the reviews.  The color is orange, streaky and just plain terrible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> very nice. no streaks. I will buy again. Drys fast.</li>
            <li> I love these towels.  I really like having this tanned glow and the towels are super easy to use, no streaks and almost no odor.  Just a hint of something but nothing chemical or foul. I will use them again and again. I have noticed that I have had a couple pimples-  those deep pimples that don&#x27;t come to a head but I also get them when I&#x27;m hormonal or stressed. I have sensitive skin and I break out VERY easily if a product has oil.  I didn&#x27;t see an ingredient that is an oil derivative so I don&#x27;t think the wipes caused it.  I will say that my tan totally disguises them.  Usually I get really red and you can still see them when they are covered with makeup but my tan really hides them.</li>
            <li> These self tanning towelettes are simply amazing!! They are every bit or more than described on the website. One use with 2 towels and your tanned with no streaks or orange coloring! Four hours later use a second set of 2 and you are glowing all over with a beautiful brown tan! I never thought they would work so well and I was just so excited that they did!!!! I&#x27;m 55 and grew up outdoors in the sun, no such thing as sunscreen back then! Then when working I would go to tanning bed when no time to get a tan! So for sure I definely has sun damage and now being in the sun just causes redness, not sunburn but just a reddish tint where I used to get such a beautiful brown tan!! These Glow2go towelettes have definely given that tan again and I love it!! My husband does too!! Really great product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price. I used on my whole body and it was a nice even tam color no streaks at all! I will definitely be buying the product again. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these, I&#x27;m very pale and they work worders. No orange color, no chemical smell. Better than the Loreal brand.</li>
            <li> These are great! I am terrible at self tanner, but these wipes make it easy. The color is not orange and looks like I&#x27;ve been laying on the beach somewhere. My first application, I used 4 wipes and since then, I have used two at a time for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Only used once at this stage.  The tan took about 8 hours to show up.  Very easy to use.  Great for taking on holidays in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> I have only used these a couple times and only on my face and down my neck and chest. I have used a lot of products and have tanned in beds and this seems like a good product. The cloth is a bit small so if I was going to do my whole body I would probably have to use 2 of them. There does not seem to be any after smell, which is nice and it dries promptly with no residue and feels good afterwards. I had a comment on how my faced look nice and tan after only using it once so that was nice. I think these are going to work good.</li>
            <li> Easiest self-tanner that my wife has used. She really likes it. Only consideration is you can&#x27;t really tell where you have wiped because there is no immediate color. Just pay attention while you apply it and this is great.</li>
            <li> I need two towelettes to do my who body, worked well. But I got a streaky messes on the elbow joint, but that just happens with any product.</li>
            <li> As a very pale woman I love my self tanning products.  It&#x27;s important for me to have a nice heathy glow without the use of tanning beds or the suns harmful rays.  I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning products over time &amp; let me tell you.....these are awesome!!!!  They are super easy to use, smell geat (not all tanning products do), &amp; work even better than they smell!!!  Super easy to take with you on the go or when you&#x27;re traveling.  I&#x27;m so pleased!!!!  This is a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Work very well, would just recommend bigger towelettes, overall very happy with results!!! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Streaky. Probably one of the worst towels I&#x27;ve ever used.. I was so excited to get these because of all the great reviews, but they definitely were not what I was expecting</li>
