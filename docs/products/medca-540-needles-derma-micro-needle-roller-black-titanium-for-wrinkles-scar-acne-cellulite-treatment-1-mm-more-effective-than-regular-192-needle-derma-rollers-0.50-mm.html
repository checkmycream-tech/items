            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>it does gives you some results if you have a great serum after using a a good branch moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Hopefully i&#x27;ll get some good results.</li>
            <li>I still use it in principle it&#x27;s good used with Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it more often!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>and I swear that this routine has done amazing things for my skin.</li>
            <li>Upon opening it appeared to be to quality made and had its own case.</li>
            <li>I love the roller.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt cause so many needles.</li>
            <li>So I guess better than 192 needles.</li>
            <li>Seriously love this thing.</li>
            <li>Instead, it stimulated the skin and allowed my firming cream to better absorb.</li>
            <li>I think over time the collagen production will show more improvements in skin.</li>
            <li>You will love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that fact</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited for the results(;</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>As easily as I roll it, I just don&#x27;t believe puncturing ur skin is healthy.  </li>
            <li>sure to clean it with alcohol.</li>
            <li>but their was no manual included so I&#x27;ll have to inquire if one is available.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and have noticed a significant change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyways this was worth it!</li>
            <li>I just used the roller for the first time two days ago and can&#x27;t believe how many compliments I&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li>Really does allow your face products to work better, skin feels great the next day.  </li>
            <li>After doing some research, I figured it was worth a try..</li>
            <li>So for under $20 it was worth trying this Derma Roller SGF.</li>
            <li>it actually cause more acne even though i cleansed and clean my product well.</li>
            <li>The product was packaged good and received before the due date.</li>
            <li>Do NOT wash your face right after you use this.</li>
            <li>I think it can be effective with regular consistent use.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>a sunburn the first day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite facial product.</li>
            <li>Scars would be the higher numbers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing the fine lines starting to disappear!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This really helps for collagen production.</li>
            <li>my stomach is all messed up,its loose all around the navel and full of marks.</li>
            <li>Its early days yet</li>
            <li>If someone really wants to try to change their skin…this would be where to start, especially if you don&#x27;t have tons of money to spend!&lt;br /&gt;Home</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and big pores</li>
            <li>I found other websites sell these products with higher prices.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary&lt;br /&gt;57 year old male</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seller was prompt. I totally am stoked to use this with the oils for my hair. Thank you very much. Hopefully i&#x27;ll get some good results.</li>
            <li> I still use it in principle it&#x27;s good used with Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;m very excited for the results(; $</li>
            <li> well after reading all of the reviews I decided to give this a try.  I am not disappointed!  I use this once a week and have noticed a significant change in my skin.  After I use this I apply my skin cream and it looks like I a sunburn the first day.  After the 2nd and 3rd day my skin starts getting flaky and sheds.  I am going to continue the schedule I am using.  Anyways this was worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the roller. I use it every night for a little skin stimulation. I&#x27;m seeing the fine lines starting to disappear!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt cause so many needles. You can sleep on a bed of nails, but not on a few nails. Same theory. So I guess better than 192 needles. I can see the 8 rollers. I can&#x27;t believe there are over 70 pins on each. But it&#x27;s too hard to count</li>
            <li> good for the price and kilt! it does gives you some results if you have a great serum after using a a good branch moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got the 1 mm for my stomach, after having 2 kids my stomach is all messed up,its loose all around the navel and full of marks.I have tried exercising and few creams nothing helped much, with this i saw major results after 2 only weeks,i would say repaired 50% of the damage, using it once a week(each time 1 min) this is the the easiest and cheapest thing ever! go ahead and try ur luck.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I figured it was worth a try.. and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! Any time my skin gets upset, whether from stress or hormones or any other reason, this thing works like a charm. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to clean it with alcohol. Do NOT wash your face right after you use this. (Remember, you&#x27;ve just poked hundreds of holds into your skin). There&#x27;s a pain curve.. meaning it&#x27;s more painful when you start but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite facial product.</li>
            <li> I just used the roller for the first time two days ago and can&#x27;t believe how many compliments I&#x27;ve received. My face looks younger and fresher already. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more often!</li>
            <li> Not certain about this one.....I think it can be effective with regular consistent use. I watched many you-tube videos about this product and some are frightening. I would use it more often if it weren&#x27;t so painful. I&#x27;m not a fan of self inflicted pain.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this thing. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Treatments are usually frightfully expensive, often invasive and have varying degrees of success. So for under $20 it was worth trying this Derma Roller SGF. Admittedly I had apprehension regarding the thought of thousands of needle picks in the quest for beauty, but was amazed to find it really wasn&#x27;t painful at all. Instead, it stimulated the skin and allowed my firming cream to better absorb. Its early days yet but I do feel it is making a difference. I will continue to use as part of my body skincare ritual.</li>
            <li> As easily as I roll it, I just don&#x27;t believe puncturing ur skin is healthy.  I&#x27;ll just use it for my scalp, hoping it encourages hair growth.</li>
            <li> I use this roller three times a week.  I hate any level of pain so after washing my face I use Solarcaine Aloe gel which has a numbing ingredient in it.  Don&#x27;t roll back and forth.  Really does allow your face products to work better, skin feels great the next day.  I think over time the collagen production will show more improvements in skin.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged good and received before the due date. Upon opening it appeared to be to quality made and had its own case. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet so I&#x27;ll have to defer a review on its use until I&#x27;ve had a chance to use it. It did say on the box to read the manual before using it but their was no manual included so I&#x27;ll have to inquire if one is available. The price was very good for an item of this quality.</li>
            <li> Ouch!!!  Glamour hurts!</li>
            <li> The product was sent well, no problems with the seller, needleds are on it were great. I just didnt end up liking the way the it ahould be used plus for me it actually cause more acne even though i cleansed and clean my product well.</li>
            <li> this is great for home use. I am in esthetics and often tell my patients of this item. This really helps for collagen production. If someone really wants to try to change their skin…this would be where to start, especially if you don&#x27;t have tons of money to spend!&lt;br /&gt;Home use for face is .5 or 1.0.  Scars would be the higher numbers.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is the best thing you can do for yourself. I use mines before I go to bed after I was my face with my Clarisonic! I follow up with my Clinique clarifying lotion and moisturizer. I have really oily skin and big pores and I swear that this routine has done amazing things for my skin. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I started with the .50 and have moved up the the 1.00mm. Simply said... THIS THING WORKS. My acne scars are virtually gone after just TWO WEEKS, using it every other day. If you think about it the technology here is almost mid evil. I mean... rolling tiny needles over your face? Regardless... Don;t walk... RUN to get one. You will love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary&lt;br /&gt;57 year old male</li>
            <li> I found other websites sell these products with higher prices. I got it from here for cheaper price. I love that fact, I am still using it and I think I will keep using since I agree with this product.</li>
