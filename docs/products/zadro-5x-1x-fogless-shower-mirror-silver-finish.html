    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That said, all I do is splash some soapy water on the mirror before I shave and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This mirror worked great for a day.  </li>
            <li>It looks good, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice plastic mirror not glass</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a good mirror is out there somewhere, but believe me, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>You move a dial and it flexes the mirror, which is a plastic of some kind.</li>
            <li>The magnification is good and the light is nice, but the light can&#x27;t be turned off, It turn&#x27;s itself off after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t pay more than 10$ for yes</li>
            <li>Oh well...maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck with this thing than I did</li>
            <li>It falls off the wall once a week if you don&#x27;t remove it and re-stick it on more often than that.</li>
            <li>I like it just fine.</li>
            <li>But before it fell off the wall, the light got&lt;br /&gt;stuck</li>
            <li>Now the light, which is supposed to shut off by itself in five minutes, never goes off.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and isn&#x27;t fogless.  </li>
            <li>Doing so removed whatever coating was keeping it fog free.</li>
            <li>I then used the free wipe of fog free solution to re-apply this coating.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks the light&#x27;s electrical circuit shorted from moisture and kept the light on.</li>
            <li>it has a light and clock who cares...</li>
            <li>so I removed the AA batteries removing the horrifically hued light from my shower permanently.</li>
            <li>and the light quit working after 2 months.  </li>
            <li>After poking around a bit, I discovered that the clock had filled up with water between the LCD and the lens.  </li>
            <li>Had to remove the batteries to get the light off.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CHEAP JUNK.  </li>
            <li>Tryed to clean soap skum off mirror with windex.</li>
            <li>After a couple of months of use I decided to clean off the mirror.</li>
            <li>This first solution may not work for some depends on your shower setup, I have a removable shower head meaning it&#x27;s tethered to a hose and clips in at the top by pulling it off and aiming the water onto the mirror from the shower head, once the mirror has fogged the water clears it right up quick!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, at full brightness they aren&#x27;t bright enough to make a difference in my shower.</li>
            <li>This has caused me to rotate the mirror so the suction cups come into full contact with the tiles and not overlap any grout lines.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t worth mentioning...</li>
            <li>Fell off wall  Day 5: Super glued to wall.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t need it since I have adequate lighting in my shower.    </li>
            <li>The suction cups are barely adequate to hold up the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Finally, after 7 days of use, the clock/date part filled up with water and shorted out!!</li>
            <li>I got into the habit of turning the shower to full hot and then rinsing the mirror for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mirror fogged over by the end of the first week and now requires continual washing and wiping to use it to have adequate reflectiveness to see myself for shaving purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mirror fogged over by the end of the first week and now requires continual washing and wiping to use it to have adequate reflectiveness to see myself for shaving purposes.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s right at eye level with no fear of falling.    </li>
            <li>Once a week I wipe down the mirror with some rubbing alcohol--which takes about 30 seconds--and it&#x27;s good to go again.    </li>
            <li>Well, it is supposed to be a mirror that you can mount in the shower, stays fog free, and allows you to see yourself while shaving in low light.    </li>
            <li>Light does not give enough light to shave with.            </li>
            <li>Fogged up on first use.</li>
            <li>Now I am going to return and hope to get my money back or a like or better product.                                                      </li>
            <li>It used to show \\&quot;8\\&quot; on most of the numbers, but the individual sectors are now burning out.   </li>
            <li>The light turns on and won&#x27;t turn off, the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; description is complete wishful thinking, and the thing always falls off the wall.  </li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>First let me state that I&#x27;ve owned this particular mirror for over a year (although not purchased from Amazon).  </li>
            <li>over-priced \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; is a real piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I cannot think of another product that accomplishes absolutely nothing that it sets out to do.    </li>
            <li>The digital time display, the light, the magnification.</li>
            <li>I didnâ€™t really care too much as I have another clock in my bathroom and it provided me with a fogless shaving experience.</li>
            <li>but mine did absolutely nothing from the time I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>First: the suction cups aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the mirror up for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>Yes, the mirror light had somehow turned itself on during the night (and yes, I am absolutely positive it was off when I went to bed and the shower had been closed all night.</li>
            <li>I had to steady the mirror</li>
            <li>and it was passably accurate for the first few hours.</li>
            <li>I was trying to mentally figure out the source of the light when I realized it was coming from the shower.</li>
            <li>Mine is going back for a refund right now.</li>
            <li>This mirror was purchased to replace a similar mirror I got 10 years or so ago, but for what you pay you don&#x27;t get very much.</li>
            <li>The difference isn&#x27;t worth the 20 turns it takes to do it, not to mention you have to hold the whole thing with one hand while turning the knob with the other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap mirror with numerous alleged features, none of which work very well.</li>
            <li>This item only worked for the first 45 days, never worked 100%.</li>
            <li>Pretty much any other mirror.mirror to shave with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much any other mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a couple years now and have to agree with everyone that the suction doesn&#x27;t work nor does it stay clear from the fog and the only reason I gave it high stars is only because I&#x27;ve found the solution to both problems and most any other problems others are having with this mirror.    </li>
            <li>The mirror will fall down no matter how clean the surface is.</li>
            <li>This is a complete ripoff.</li>
            <li>The razor \\&quot;holder\\&quot; is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>Funny that a shower mirror that will get wet is not even close to being waterproof or resistant.</li>
            <li>its brighter than something dark, am I right or what?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>In fact just to maintain a slight \\&quot;initial resistance\\&quot; to fog, you have to apply a special cleaner like using a rain x wipe.</li>
            <li>My mirror arrived with a major scratch on the face for starters.</li>
            <li>General:  </li>
            <li>Since I was just using it to shave my face and nothing delicate like eyebrow plucking or detailed tweezing, the magnification feature was another</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be clear that I cannot recommend this mirror for any purposes that one would traditionally associate with showers and reflections.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be clear that I cannot recommend this mirror for any purposes that one would traditionally associate with showers and reflections.</li>
            <li>Did the prep., but it simply never was clear.</li>
            <li>, when you wipe the mirror off to get the fog off it scratches even with soft cloths and the battery does not last</li>
            <li>Fourth: bought outdoor double-sided tape to use which worked for about two months - just long enough for Amazon&#x27;s return policy to expire - upon which it fell off the wall once again nearly hitting my 5year old in the head while she was bathing.</li>
            <li>Fell off the wall within a few hours after first installation.</li>
            <li>It does work for a few minutes AFTER running hot water on it.  </li>
            <li>I tried the light but found it was an unpleasant hue and decided not to use it in the future as my shower has adequate illumination.</li>
            <li>My problem is the shower is not flat anywhere</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to accidentally yank it off and it only got worse after the first time.</li>

            <li> On the second morning I entered my dark bathroom at about 4:00 AM and was surprised and confused to see a light on in there.</li>
            <li> It worked well for about two weeks, which was just long enough to throw away the box it came in.</li>
            <li> The light is useless.  </li>
            <li> The product works with relatively minor assistance and modifications.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a short circuit even in the miniscule electrical wiring of this mirror in a wet area</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that did not go over well with my better half.  </li>
            <li> The 5x magnification is just a big tuner style knob on the side which concaves the plastic mirror causing it to magnify slightly.</li>
            <li> I pulled the tab on the other battery and set the clock</li>
            <li> In short, this is an extremely overpriced mirror with no redeeming qualities that I can detect, all for an outsized price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In short, this is an extremely overpriced mirror with no redeeming qualities that I can detect, all for an outsized price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do this, it fogs up like any other bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> Two days after installation the clock failed, the light switch failed the next day.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side it does reflect your image when you look into it (initially at least,) and that&#x27;s what earns it a single star</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wish the esthetics were a little nicer.  </li>
            <li> The unit will stay up for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have small uneven tiles in my shower.  </li>
            <li> I tried the magnification feature and I am not exactly sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> never able to use it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the light is completely worthless, unless you&#x27;re 4 inches from the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; and it&#x27;s got an irritating timed shut off.</li>
            <li> Hard to see</li>
            <li> At least I still had a fogless shower mirror to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have since put this aside got tired of fooling with it.</li>
            <li> Advertising this mirror as \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; should be considered \\&quot;false advertising\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Thinking the tiles were dirty, I used a soap scum cleaner to ensure they were cleaned and re-applied.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got distortion instead of magnification when I did this, rendering the mirror worse than useless.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is useless.    </li>

            <li> ...then it kept falling off the wall. But before it fell off the wall, the light got&lt;br /&gt;stuck on and used up the batteries. Then the clock stopped working. THEN it fell off&lt;br /&gt;the wall several times until it broke in twain. The zoom feature is of dubious value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This over-priced \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; is a real piece of junk. I would not lie to you. Hope this&lt;br /&gt;review helps you pick a different mirror.</li>
            <li> Gave this mirror one star because I couldn&#x27;t give it zero stars.    Well, it is supposed to be a mirror that you can mount in the shower, stays fog free, and allows you to see yourself while shaving in low light.    It doesn&#x27;t stay on the wall.  It fogs up.  It distorts your image.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is useless.    I cannot think of another product that accomplishes absolutely nothing that it sets out to do.    I got this as a gift, or I would have thrown it out months ago.</li>
            <li> It worked well for about two weeks, which was just long enough to throw away the box it came in. Now the light, which is supposed to shut off by itself in five minutes, never goes off. I suppose it will eventually when the batteries die.</li>
            <li> Day 1: Fogged up on first use. Fogless it ain&#x27;t!  Day 2: Fell off wall.  Day 3: Fell off wall.  Day 4: Fell off wall  Day 5: Super glued to wall.  Day 7: Clock malfunctioned, (hour digit not working)  Day 10:  Tryed to clean soap skum off mirror with windex. Now is permanently fogged over.  General:  Light does not give enough light to shave with.            Magnification distorts drastically.  Now I am going to return and hope to get my money back or a like or better product.                                                      Zadro Fogless Lighted Shaving Shower Mirror with Clock 8.5\\&quot; x 9\\&quot; x 1 1/4\\&quot;]]</li>
            <li> This mirror does the trick for my husband.. for me it&#x27;s a little \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot;. I wish the esthetics were a little nicer.  The magnification is good and the light is nice, but the light can&#x27;t be turned off, It turn&#x27;s itself off after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a couple years now and have to agree with everyone that the suction doesn&#x27;t work nor does it stay clear from the fog and the only reason I gave it high stars is only because I&#x27;ve found the solution to both problems and most any other problems others are having with this mirror.    1. This first solution may not work for some depends on your shower setup, I have a removable shower head meaning it&#x27;s tethered to a hose and clips in at the top by pulling it off and aiming the water onto the mirror from the shower head, once the mirror has fogged the water clears it right up quick! just squirt it with water.    2. I have mine tied hanging from the towel rack that&#x27;s mounted in the shower so it&#x27;s right at eye level with no fear of falling.    Once I discovered these two solutions it&#x27;s worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> The one star is because it actually reflects your image. Everything else about it stopped working almost immediately. The digital time display, the light, the magnification. Product was awful.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this mirror.  It is cheap and isn&#x27;t fogless.  The suction cups don&#x27;t work and the clock malfunctions.  This is a complete ripoff. Do yourself a favor and never buy a product from Zadro.</li>
            <li> Where to start...  First let me state that I&#x27;ve owned this particular mirror for over a year (although not purchased from Amazon).  Fell off the wall within a few hours after first installation. Thinking the tiles were dirty, I used a soap scum cleaner to ensure they were cleaned and re-applied. It fell off in the middle of the night, waking us up. I re-hung it in the morning and did so by wetting the tiles and cups with water. This method seems to work, but it still falls off each month or two.  There are three suction cups in an inverted triangle. If you have a grid type tile pattern (think tic tac toe), the third cup will overlap the grout line and not perform its job. This has caused me to rotate the mirror so the suction cups come into full contact with the tiles and not overlap any grout lines. It will not stay on the wall with just two suction cups, it will fall often.  After a couple of months of use I decided to clean off the mirror. Doing so removed whatever coating was keeping it fog free. I then used the free wipe of fog free solution to re-apply this coating. Needless to say, it did not work. I got into the habit of turning the shower to full hot and then rinsing the mirror for a minute or two. I have a handheld shower head, but the risk of scalding myself is still present.  Within a couple of weeks the light&#x27;s electrical circuit shorted from moisture and kept the light on. Only battery removal turned it off and I&#x27;ve never used it since.   The digital clock display also shorted out. It used to show \\&quot;8\\&quot; on most of the numbers, but the individual sectors are now burning out.   The razor \\&quot;holder\\&quot; is a complete joke. It&#x27;s made of plastic with tiny nubs to hold it in place. It doesn&#x27;t take much to accidentally yank it off and it only got worse after the first time. I ended up throwing the holder away.</li>
            <li> Not fogless... not fogless at all. In fact just to maintain a slight \\&quot;initial resistance\\&quot; to fog, you have to apply a special cleaner like using a rain x wipe. The 5x magnification is just a big tuner style knob on the side which concaves the plastic mirror causing it to magnify slightly. The difference isn&#x27;t worth the 20 turns it takes to do it, not to mention you have to hold the whole thing with one hand while turning the knob with the other. The light isn&#x27;t worth mentioning... its like that commercial \\&quot;its a relative term... its brighter than something dark, am I right or what?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this because mu nephew has one and likes it. My problem is the shower is not flat anywhere and I cannot get this mirror to stick. It falls and breaks the parts. It also does not come with enough cloth for the fogless portion. You need to re-apply the fogless every week. I have since put this aside got tired of fooling with it.</li>
            <li> this is a nice plastic mirror not glass i wouldn&#x27;t pay more than 10$ for yes it has a light and clock who cares...</li>
            <li> It looks good, but that&#x27;s about it.  The light turns on and won&#x27;t turn off, the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; description is complete wishful thinking, and the thing always falls off the wall.  I&#x27;m sure a good mirror is out there somewhere, but believe me, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about two years.  It works, but some assistance is helpful:    1.  I have small uneven tiles in my shower.  The suction cups obviously wouldn&#x27;t work on there so I attached it to my shower door.  Unfortunately that did not go over well with my better half.  The solution:  Some outdoor double-sided tape.  I attached it to the back of the hanger, cleaned the tile wall and presto--it works!  The unit will stay up for a few months.  Over time you&#x27;ll need to replace the tape.    2.  I have had a number of fogless mirrors and none of them have been fogless.  That said, all I do is splash some soapy water on the mirror before I shave and it works perfectly.  No fogging.  Once a week I wipe down the mirror with some rubbing alcohol--which takes about 30 seconds--and it&#x27;s good to go again.    3.  The light is useless.  But I didn&#x27;t need it since I have adequate lighting in my shower.    Bottom line:  The product works with relatively minor assistance and modifications.  I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> This mirror was purchased to replace a similar mirror I got 10 years or so ago, but for what you pay you don&#x27;t get very much. It&#x27;s a cheap mirror with numerous alleged features, none of which work very well. On the plus side it does reflect your image when you look into it (initially at least,) and that&#x27;s what earns it a single star (and no stars isn&#x27;t allowed.) I didn&#x27;t try the suction cup mounting so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I put three AA batteries in it and the lighted ring worked...at first. I pulled the tab on the other battery and set the clock and it was passably accurate for the first few hours. By the time I got up the next morning the clock was already off by over 2 1/2 hours. I didnâ€™t really care too much as I have another clock in my bathroom and it provided me with a fogless shaving experience. I tried the light but found it was an unpleasant hue and decided not to use it in the future as my shower has adequate illumination. I tried the magnification feature and I am not exactly sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do but mine did absolutely nothing from the time I took it out of the box. Since I was just using it to shave my face and nothing delicate like eyebrow plucking or detailed tweezing, the magnification feature was another I was content to write off although I was increasingly disappointed in the build quality of the unit. On the second morning I entered my dark bathroom at about 4:00 AM and was surprised and confused to see a light on in there. I was trying to mentally figure out the source of the light when I realized it was coming from the shower. Yes, the mirror light had somehow turned itself on during the night (and yes, I am absolutely positive it was off when I went to bed and the shower had been closed all night.) I didn&#x27;t want a short circuit even in the miniscule electrical wiring of this mirror in a wet area so I removed the AA batteries removing the horrifically hued light from my shower permanently. At least I still had a fogless shower mirror to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kid, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror fogged over by the end of the first week and now requires continual washing and wiping to use it to have adequate reflectiveness to see myself for shaving purposes. In short, this is an extremely overpriced mirror with no redeeming qualities that I can detect, all for an outsized price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be clear that I cannot recommend this mirror for any purposes that one would traditionally associate with showers and reflections. Save your money, buy another mirror. Pretty much any other mirror.mirror to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kid, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror fogged over by the end of the first week and now requires continual washing and wiping to use it to have adequate reflectiveness to see myself for shaving purposes.

            <li> Hard to see and it still fogs up. Oh well...maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck with this thing than I did</li>
            <li> This item only worked for the first 45 days, never worked 100%. The suction cups do not work properly. The mirror will fall down no matter how clean the surface is.</li>
            <li> Like to shave in the shower. Zadro &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34; Shower Mirror, should be the Zadro Extra Foggy Shower Mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Was never able to use it. Did the prep., but it simply never was clear.</li>
            <li> My mirror arrived with a major scratch on the face for starters. Then I attached it to my shower wall with the suction cups and it fell off before I even used it. I reattached it and started to shave but the magnification feature distorts your view no matter what adjustment.    Returned!!!</li>
            <li> Glass fogs up constantly, even when taking cooler showers.  Must wipe it or rise it while shaving.  Water gets into the clock area sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, I just can&#x27;t recommend this product at all. Yes it is fogless, yes it has LED lights. But no, it makes no difference. The LED&#x27;s are designed to come on with a pushbutton, then gradually fade out. Unfortunately, at full brightness they aren&#x27;t bright enough to make a difference in my shower. I was afraid to use the suction cups on my tiled wall, so used a suspension rope instead. I had to steady the mirror every so often. I am farsighted and looked forward to using the magnification feature. You move a dial and it flexes the mirror, which is a plastic of some kind. Unfortunately, I got distortion instead of magnification when I did this, rendering the mirror worse than useless. I&#x27;ve never used the product since.</li>
            <li> First: the suction cups aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the mirror up for more than a few hours. Second: the tape provided only held to the plastic mounting bracket strip for about a day before peeling away. Third: fog-less it isn&#x27;t. Fourth: bought outdoor double-sided tape to use which worked for about two months - just long enough for Amazon&#x27;s return policy to expire - upon which it fell off the wall once again nearly hitting my 5year old in the head while she was bathing. Now the clock doesn&#x27;t work and the LEDs won&#x27;t shut off without removing the batteries. So now we are stuck with something unusable.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever purchased from Amazon!  Fogs up, when you wipe the mirror off to get the fog off it scratches even with soft cloths and the battery does not last and the light quit working after 2 months.  STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> This mirror worked great for a day.  The second day, I noticed the clock display had disappeared.  After poking around a bit, I discovered that the clock had filled up with water between the LCD and the lens.  Wonderful.  Also, after about a week, one of the 8 LEDs arrayed around the mirror began to flicker.  About a week after that, that LED went out permanently.  Possibly the LEDs are also not waterproof?  The suction cups are barely adequate to hold up the mirror.  It falls off the wall once a week if you don&#x27;t remove it and re-stick it on more often than that.</li>
            <li> Two days after installation the clock failed, the light switch failed the next day.  Had to remove the batteries to get the light off.  Funny that a shower mirror that will get wet is not even close to being waterproof or resistant.</li>
            <li> Advertising this mirror as \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; should be considered \\&quot;false advertising\\&quot;.  It does work for a few minutes AFTER running hot water on it.  If you don&#x27;t do this, it fogs up like any other bathroom mirror. Additionally, the light is completely worthless, unless you&#x27;re 4 inches from the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; and it&#x27;s got an irritating timed shut off. Finally, after 7 days of use, the clock/date part filled up with water and shorted out!! They made a shower mirror with electronic parts that are NOT waterproof!! Go figure!! Recommendation:  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CHEAP JUNK.  Mine is going back for a refund right now.</li>
