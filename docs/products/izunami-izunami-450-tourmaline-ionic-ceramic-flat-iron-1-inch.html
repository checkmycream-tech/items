            <li>I took a risk buying a brand i have never heard of, and i am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It also snagged my hair a bunch of times, causing more breakage!</li>

            <li>In love with this iron,!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straightener!</li>
            <li>Gets Really hot and smooths even the thickest hair wonderfully!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Purchased this iron 4 years ago and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing to watch as the hair goes through the blades.</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>And the price is amazing</li>
            <li>I have used a CHI for many many years and though it works just great</li>
            <li>It looks best straight, but without a stylist to wield it, even the chi couldn&#x27;t make my hair look nice.  </li>
            <li>It comes in this fancy box, which is nice if you ever want to store it, which I won&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, about 4 days &amp; no cost for shipping was great!</li>
            <li>I thought about getting another Sedu since I have course hair and liked the way it smoothed out my hair, but then came across the reviews on this product on Amazon and some beauty sites.</li>
            <li>Additionally, you can curl your hair with this iron, which is always a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>(it would just be slightly warm) but would work again once it was turned off and restarted.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s probably my own fault.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t catch my hair in the plates, it straightened in one swipe and styled nicely, to avoid that \\&quot;I just straightened my hair\\&quot; look that came sometimes happen at the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li>and she was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I baught this straightener and thought it was absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it, but I just wanted a good, durable straightener.</li>
            <li>Takes 5 seconds to warm up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls come out really nice...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great flat iron for a great price!</li>
            <li>This one is great as you can specifically set the temperature and it heats up quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this item, it heats up fast and straightens my hair perfect, I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied!</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell puts out some good tools, but this is  one of the best flat irons i have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have one daughter with natural hair and one with relaxed hair and it works WONDERFULLY on both hair textures.</li>
            <li>My salon uses this brand and it&#x27;s by the far the best.  </li>
            <li>Before this happened it made my hair look better than spectacular for a week.  </li>
            <li>It works just perfect and your hair looks so soft and shine...</li>
            <li>Anyway, It&#x27;s good but don&#x27;t expect the best miracle flat iron ever or anything. :)</li>
            <li>she is late 20&#x27;s and beautiful kind and just wonderful with all ages of her clients)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and is better than one that I paid 160$ for.</li>
            <li>It was a worked great for the first 3-4 months</li>
            <li>I am also happy that I selected the 1 inch because it really works like a curling iron too!</li>
            <li>It was a pretty great purchase.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all because of the Izunami - it makes my hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the next best thing to the Marcels!</li>
            <li>I would love to share with you the results of my hair after use.</li>
            <li>and I have many who have purchased and received their irons</li>
            <li>and they are SO pleased</li>
            <li>MORE FHI OR CHI for me!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>so I was pleased with the amount of time it took to ship it over a weekend.</li>
            <li>it went UP some more.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the iron itself, no pulling or tugging on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I need more heat when it&#x27;s close to relaxer time.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see why I didn&#x27;t have better results.</li>
            <li>it just glided so smoothly through my hair!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product so glad I was able to purchase it for the price that I did.  </li>
            <li>my relaxer has lasted much better.</li>
            <li>Still thoroughly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give an update because I got so many compliments on my hair this morning</li>
            <li>I let my cousin try it on her hair who is a hirstylist and more picky than me</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>It takes more than an hour to get it blow-dried.</li>
            <li>The best part is that I got it on sale for only $68 -</li>
            <li>THIS IS MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>The best part is the final product-</li>
            <li>so glad i bought it</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>We also made sure she has  thermal protection product to use.   </li>
            <li>It was priced over $200 on the Izunami website, however I was able to catch a deal on Amazon where I was able to purchase it for $70.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Izunami iron.</li>
            <li>I felt confident that if anything were to happen to the iron that Amazon would take care of the issue promptly.  </li>
            <li>worked excellent for the first week, then one plate stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>/ STATIC.</li>
            <li>you will be able to redeem your 1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than my Chi!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and it maintains the temperature the entire time that it is being used, it is great!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>She also said to make sure when addressing anything to there company at 83 Harbor Rd.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I am soo glad i did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for about 4 months now and love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before</li>
            <li>I decided to go for it, and boy I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>When I do use heat, I prefer for it to be administered in the most efficient way to prevent any additional damage and stress to my hair.</li>
            <li>I just love love love it...</li>
            <li>cos it really did a great job when it worked.</li>
            <li>would love to get another one and pray its not defective</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>The power cord is much better than the Chi also.  </li>
            <li>but if I have to keep purchasing this product every 10/11 months at $70 a pop then I rather purchase another more reliable brand like the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fool</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This flatiron is actually better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Im satisfied.</li>
            <li>To be sure it was my straightener and mot products or hair dryer, I replaced my shampoo/cond.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and i thought i have bought so many why not try another one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Izunami.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definiely my MUST HAVE product. :)</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it has great results.</li>
            <li>I love love love...</li>
            <li>It also works fantastically as a hair-curling tool; even better than a curling iron, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I got this based off reviews and have been pleased.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>The Izunami 450 is fantastic!</li>

            <li>I am so happy that I purchased an Izunami flat iron because it straightened my hair better than when I wore a chemical relaxer!</li>
            <li>i have thick, wavy, course hair and by fair this iron has been the been the best for me!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>but this one really made my hair stay straight and smooth all day!!!!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, no problem with this product, works just fine, love it.  </li>
            <li>These are great flat irons, I&#x27;ll always own a pair..</li>
            <li>The very cool box that it comes in says that Izunami means in-dis-pen-sible.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is safe and secure that way.  </li>
            <li>and I realized my hair was becoming damaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener now for roughly three months, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It works great so far.</li>
            <li>Good price and very durable product.</li>
            <li>This year in September I was doing a clients hair, she really wanted me to use the irons because her friend told her how good they were.</li>
            <li>my hair looks and feels healthy, and it stays completely straight on the most humid of days!      </li>
            <li>They were all true!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, even if you&#x27;ve never done it before, you&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li>I can easily arrange my hair in couple minutes.</li>
            <li>you may have to get used to it working so easily.</li>
            <li>so the cord doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and makes straightening my hair very quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel.</li>
            <li>So, so true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been about five months, and this iron is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this iron is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>You only need 1 maybe 2 glides and your hair is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Hands down this product is a great buy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Yes, that was her offer to a customer who had all the original box, the original receipt, and the warranty card!</li>
            <li>, i have three iron with high prices, yet this one is so far excellent</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and relaxed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it is light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This one is slimmer than the previous one, but according to her, they both heat up in a flash and are excellent to use.</li>
            <li>I love how it straightens quickly</li>
            <li>The iron heats so quickly (and beeps when heated within what seems to be one minutes!)</li>
            <li>It gets my hair straight with ONE glide, makes my hair shiny, and what amazed me the most was how silky-soft my hair was afterwards!  </li>
            <li>If it matters, I have light colored, fine, wavy hair.    </li>
            <li>Love at first stroke!</li>
            <li>It worked great and my hair was perfect in half the time of my other straighteners (I have owned many).  </li>
            <li>though I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference; apart from the things I mentioned.</li>
            <li>I prefer the ones that you can control the temperature which is a huge plus with this one.</li>
            <li>It goes over my hair so smooth and leaves it shining.</li>
            <li>hair smooth and shinny</li>
            <li>It glides so smoothly and you don&#x27;t need to put any pressure on the plates because they \\&quot;float.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and it was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have had the iron for several months and am so happy I made this purchase over the Sedu.</li>
            <li>It glides so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>A GREAT iron, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t use cheap styling appliances.</li>
            <li>My hair did not become smooth.</li>
            <li>This iron makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Very functional, amazing price</li>
            <li>Keeps hair smooth for days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times, and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Really straightens nicely without frying the hair.</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly on hair when used</li>
            <li>BUT the light kept blinking</li>
            <li>Her hair came out smooth, pin-straight and stayed that way for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li>Nice flatiron that performs very well.</li>
            <li>It glides through my hair so smoothly without burning.</li>
            <li>It looked like I had stuck my finger in a light socket or had my hands on one of those \\&quot;plasma</li>
            <li>I bought the iron and was using it regularly with great luck.</li>
            <li>The light would flash and</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, and only takes me about fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>I have contacted the seller and they confirmed it.  </li>
            <li>All it take is one glide to get smooth, silky, and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>After I was done, my hair was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>If i have problems with with it in a few weeks like some have had, i will write another review but for now it&#x27;s just GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m happy it lasted two years, I guess I&#x27;m concerned that both irons seemed to break in the same way.  </li>
            <li>It heats fast and does an amazing job of straighting hair.</li>
            <li>I always kept it back in a ponytail and gave up hope that I might ever be able to have a good hair day without paying for a blowout.  </li>
            <li>So, I learned about the Izunami from a good friend of mine, who is also natural.  </li>
            <li>This one is good so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating whether or not I should give this product another shot, or whether I should purchase from another store, because I will be really bummed if the same thing happens, but it was the best while it worked!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for this particular flatiron for a while, was pleased to find it and the price was unbeatable!</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon is good &amp; if you catch it at the right time you can really save.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this is the absolute best flat iron i have used to date.</li>
            <li>I finally used it for me was great and took my daughters braids out and was so excited</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best flat irons.</li>
            <li>Excellent article recommend, everything you say is real and Article gace what it says on the specifications, highly recommended, hope to contribute much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li>Great flat iron.</li>
            <li>The flat iron was doing my hair great.</li>
            <li>I sent the product, the original receipt, and the warranty card filled out to Izunami.</li>
            <li>The tagline on the box is \\&quot;love at first glide\\&quot; and I think that&#x27;s 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>Amazon is brilliant to make such items available at such an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>Port Washington, New York 11050 to make sure to write Izunami at the top because this is also a residence.</li>
            <li>So watch out Izunami MORE orders coming, I&#x27;m really pushing this!</li>
            <li>In addition, there was a recent wedding in the family and many, many, members of the family had a chance to use it and all fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>~ It&#x27;s Love at First Glide.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As usual I came to Amazon to do my research and found awesome reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>and I must say that I&#x27;m just as pleased with it as I was the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>So far, very pleased with the puchase.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I paid $179.99 plus tax on the spot and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It was the first time she had ever had her hair straightened, and she fell in love with the look.</li>
            <li>, that I would need to contact the original seller on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this flat iron..</li>
            <li>It created a nice shine to it and made it so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair extremely shiny and curled it beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love how it heats super fast in 30 secs!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Flat Iron on the market.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying another brand flat iron and so far am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Again Thanks so much for putting out such a WONDERFUL product.</li>
            <li>I would also buy from the seller again because everything they promised in their ad was true.</li>
            <li>I love that it heats up in under a minute and even beeps when it&#x27;s ready.  </li>
            <li>Amazon gave me a full refund of my money paid for this iron today.</li>
            <li>After a good wash and condition it makes it seem like you just left the dominicans chair in a hair salon.  </li>
            <li>I love how straight my hair gets with this iron.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and with one or two swipes it straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>When a company won&#x27;t back their product, it can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron just to TRY to learn to do my own hair, thinkikng that I would never get it nice and straight.</li>

            <li>It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this iron and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was iffy spending so much money, but after reading the reviews I was convinced and I&#x27;m so happy I did.     </li>
            <li>Luckily, my client was understanding.</li>
            <li>Plus this company shipped it quickly</li>
            <li>straightener works super</li>
            <li>Heats up so quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li>It also arrived really quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this iron because it straighten well, leaves hair with natural shine and its light weight.</li>
            <li>and it did it quickly, but</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and straightens well.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW great product.  </li>
            <li>this flat iron is awesome, i just tested it out on a small section of my hair and it was amazing</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied by this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have only had this flat iron for about a week, but I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li>I used to buy middle-of-the-line products...not cheap crappy straighteners and not expensive ones either, and they always worked \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron, much better than Chi.  </li>
            <li>Because even at 270 degrees it gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and it is strong , yet gentle.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Izunami because of its high reviews and low price... and so far, so good!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have had this product for about 5 months now and I am still as excited today as I was the first day.  </li>
            <li>, that is a first for me!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and easily could sell for 2 or 3 times as much.</li>
            <li>I wanted to update to say that I&#x27;ve started using this iron for defined curls (rather than slight bends) and it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li>This is a great little product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this flat iron for anyone wanting some stress free straightening!!!</li>
            <li>Looking for a replacement for my Cricket, which survived over 3 years of daily use and abuse, I came across the Izunami flat iron and was impressed with all the positive reviews.   </li>
            <li>and my hair is perfectly straight and silky smooth,</li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly hair, so it takes a while to get it straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The light will be lit which I thought meant it was ready, but it clearly isn&#x27;t warm enough or working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had $30 flat irons from Wal Mart that are better than this!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>She  straightens her hair until it smokes, so we wanted a more professional appliance for her to use.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unbelieveavle and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use this iron it looks like I&#x27;ve just gotten a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair glossy after so I rarely have to use any shining products afterwards.</li>
            <li>It has an adjustable heat setting which is nice, though I&#x27;ve only used it on the highest one.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m THRILLED.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that the IZUNAMI is by far BETTER.  </li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>This straightener is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this iron is powerful and can damage your hair if you don&#x27;t take care of your hair.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am in love with this iron so far.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron ever, I have curly hair and usually took about 1 hour to get it all ironed, but with the Izunami I get it done in less than 25 minutes, it is so amazing!!</li>
            <li>Her hair seems less damaged, and has a beautiful sheen, and is very managable.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend, I wish it had an automatic shut off, but other than that no complaints - a great deal from amazon!</li>
            <li>heats up quickly and stays hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, it heats up super fast!</li>
            <li>Gets hot really quick and straightens with one or two swipes..</li>
            <li>This flat iron is AMAZING</li>
            <li>I set it at 400, and it glides right through my hair and straightens in one pass.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase it right away, and haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase at all.  </li>
            <li>and she was totally right.  </li>
            <li>I went into a salon and the guy used it on my hair right then.</li>
            <li>So as of right now i give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I was using a cheap Conair straightener from Walmart that pretty much ripped my hair out.  </li>
            <li>As some stated, it started out great the first few uses then</li>
            <li>My clients loved the flat irons and I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li>I have used many of the top brand professional straighteners out there such as the CHI and the SOLIA, however none compare to the Izunami.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is hands down one of the best products out there.  </li>
            <li>These are hands down THE BEST flat irons that you will ever purchase.</li>
            <li>Either that or on that nice little HASSLE FREE ONE YEAR WARRANTY card that comes with this iron, they need to put a disclaimer about buying it from a authorized dealer on it.</li>
            <li>and bought a new cheap blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite flat iron ever!</li>
            <li>it would always leave my hair very staticy if i went for the super sleek look, so</li>
            <li>It made the smooth side of my hair smoother and softer, and the coarse side perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>We had previously owned a Izunmani Straightner for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The iron heats up quickly (and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready) and the heat stays consistent.</li>
            <li>It was used very gently.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and does a fantastic job on my hair of straightening or adding loose curls.</li>
            <li>I first seen this product about a month with a price of $71 and some change.</li>
            <li>My point exactly.</li>
            <li>I would love to see this product back at $71 or just at a set price.</li>
            <li>NO LONGER GETS HOT.</li>
            <li>All have been \\&quot;professional\\&quot; and higher end brands.</li>
            <li>Hair is left bouncy shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair, and I have A LOT of it!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>I used the Izunami for the first time this morning...</li>
            <li>I have been using cheapy ones for a long time, and decided to pay the extra for a great one.  </li>
            <li>Izunami is my first hair iron.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks I noticed the straightener was no longer getting hot on one side.  </li>
            <li>I turned it on one more time just to see what it did, (not that I would have chanced burning my hair again) and it starting beeping repeatedly whatever that meant.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of several products we decided to go with the Izunami, and we are glad we did.  </li>
            <li>It stays hot.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a try, since even the ones offered at retail stores are almost that much.</li>
            <li>It heats up so unbelievably fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different irons and none have come close to how well this one works.  </li>
            <li>It got so hot that it burned a chunck of my hair out of my head.</li>
            <li>And, to the sole Izunami customer service rep who&#x27;s sitting somewhere alone in a house all smug and snuggly and warm while ignoring my e-mail: thanks for nothing--you&#x27;ll be getting my returned product very soon.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast &amp; straightens to perfection!</li>
            <li>and it would randomly not heat up</li>
            <li>It did not get hot after that and it continuously beeped.  </li>
            <li>They could have used a much smaller box for shipment, and more sustainable packaging.</li>
            <li>Iron worked perfectly for 2 weeks, even though initially it faintly smelled like burning wires.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot and just beeps continuously.</li>
            <li>heats extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results I feel like I just left the salon when finished with my hair!</li>
            <li>I first saw this at my Salon.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever taken time to review a product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Heats up real fast thanks</li>
            <li>it litteritly gets hot in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>The exact product I wanted</li>
            <li>and I used this for the first time about a week ago and my hair looked like I had just permed it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had to re-flat-iron my hair since I did it the first time.</li>
            <li>it moves and feels light and soft.</li>
            <li>I for some reason, one side would not heat, I turned it on and off and it got hot, but it did make me nervous.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly one year and one month to the day</li>
            <li>so if you plan on using more often than that, it probably wont even last a year.</li>
            <li>They sell it at the salon for more then double the price.</li>
            <li>the lady that does my hair uses the same one at her shop i have enjoyed it .</li>
            <li>Simply said, I LOVE</li>
            <li>I was managing a salon 2 1/2 to 3 years ago when this product first came out.</li>
            <li>but the plates would not get hot.</li>
            <li>The straighteners are so cheap even the company doesnt want to deal with getting them fixed.</li>
            <li>the first time in my life my hair does not react and frizz up in Summer Heat and Humidity after I spend time drying and ironing  </li>
            <li>But, now when I turn on the Izunami iron, it just beeps and does not get hot.  </li>
            <li>I MOST DEFINITELY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Should there be any changes i will be sure to come back and update my review</li>
            <li>The first one broke within the one year warranty so it was replaced by the salon I purchased it through.  </li>
            <li>High quality, gets super hot, has suspension on the ceramic tiles</li>
            <li>When used with the right styling products (For me, small amounts of: a heat protection spray, mousse and anti-frizz serum) and, on good hair days, without, the Izunami creates a professional looking, sleek, smooth and long-lasting hair style.</li>
            <li>One major bonus: it heats super quickly (lest than 20-30 seconds depending on temperature)</li>
            <li>I have purchased a 15.00 flat iron from Walmart that works muchhhhhh better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this flat iron because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Now with that being said, I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li>USED TOP OF THE LINE FLAT IRONS -</li>
            <li>took out my \\&quot;indispensible\\&quot; flat iron and whipped it into magic.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>but I have somewhat wavy hair and what I love about this flat iron was that it straightened my hair and made it shiny without removing the volume from my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair seems much better off after using this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This one cut my styling time down a bunch, plus it looks a lot better!  </li>
            <li>I really really love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I love that it has multiple heat settings and beeps when it is ready for use.</li>
            <li>It heats up incredibly fast and works a million times better than my prior one did.</li>
            <li>I bought it after reading all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>but this flat iron keeps it super straight and smooth, even at the roots.</li>
            <li>, i have never been able to actually curl my hair with a flat iron and this made it so easy to do.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>and I am STILL in LOVE with my IZUNAMI FLAT IRON!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>I have gotten my hair straight before, but not THIS straight!</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron so much</li>
            <li>within a matter of seconds of turning it on the iron gets hot so fast.</li>
            <li>They get hot and keep your hair straight as if you had a relaxer in your.</li>
            <li>This worked well for the first year I&#x27;d say and about 2 months ago, I realized that my hair was feeling very frizzy and</li>
            <li>So far I loving this flat iron.</li>
            <li>In the beginnging I loved how shiny and straight it made my hair, but after only one week of regular use it started to smoke and it burned a chunk of my hair off.  </li>
            <li>these are just as good if not better.     </li>
            <li>I have the thickest, curliest, frizziest hair IN THE WORLD, and somehow this amazing straightener slenderizes it down, into sleek straightened hair.</li>
            <li>It gives my Hair slip and body like no other and leaves it feeling soft and light not to mention how shiny it makes my Hair !</li>
            <li>I had considered a Chi or a Paul Mitchell, but this one is amazing and costs less.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion,  the T3 leaves a healthier sheen and is better for your hair in the long term for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>If you are on a budget and need a flat iron that is as good a as Chi, I would recommend ths flat iron.</li>
            <li>So I search on the original website but they were too much for me, so I finally decided to check on amazon and the price was right up my ally</li>
            <li>This would have to be by far the BEST flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever purchased (also the most expensive).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what all the hype is about on this particular flat iron.</li>
            <li>Now I have to shop for a new one!!</li>
            <li>While it does heat up in less than 20 seconds, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything else that I would consider amazing...</li>
            <li>typically I use it to curl.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE GOT PRETTY LONG, FINE, UNALTERED HAIR (NEVER</li>
            <li>Why, for the love of God, would anyone design a product with a feature created for no other apparent reason than to annoy its users 100% of the time it&#x27;s being used?  </li>
            <li>I am in love with my new Flat Iron...</li>
            <li>It takes only one swipe for each section and my hair is silky smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>I was telling my hairdresser that she REALLY REALLY REALLY needs to invest in this product line.</li>
            <li>, they said, \\&quot;Thanks Lucretia, \\&quot;NO</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it still didn&#x27;t get it as straight as it should of.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Izunami, those days might be over.  </li>
            <li>It glided through my hair as smoothly as silk and left my hair looking like I&#x27;d just visited the salon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My daughters have ethnic, very curly/kinky/thick hair.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about products and styling tools on my hair</li>
            <li>YOU GIRL THANKS FOR TAKING YOUR TIME OUT FOR YOUR VIDEOS)</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY AND WORKS WONDERS ON HAIR.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s after 12:00 pm and my hair is still straight...</li>
            <li>The strip turned light and was totally burned!  </li>
            <li>I just had to glide this once over each section of hair and it was straight.</li>
            <li>this straight.</li>
            <li>It can handle my hair in one pass whereas with the Sedu took several, and leaves your hair smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it</li>
            <li>It is so fast</li>
            <li>It really gets my hair straighter than I have ever had it</li>
            <li>and it stays straight until I wash my hair again</li>
            <li>It is ready to go in about 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it is.  </li>
            <li>She loves this product just as much as i do.  </li>
            <li>Heats up incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Fast forward 12 months</li>
            <li>It leaves hair silky, straight and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I will try to contact amazon and the seller to get a refund or exchange, and I really hope they will because they are selling defective products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset about the Izunami.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>i have been searching and searching for a Iron and could not find one which really could help my frizzy</li>
            <li>really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>Very reliable.</li>
            <li>I will try to contact amazon and the seller to get a refund or exchange, and I really hope they will because they are selling defective products.</li>
            <li>so I really doubted the Izunami until I used it.</li>
            <li>I like how it beeps when ready</li>
            <li>I pass through and my hair is bone straight.</li>
            <li>it straight..</li>
            <li>The iron worked very well on my hair while it worked.  </li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Izunami but perhaps the seller.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t track very well on your hair piece</li>
            <li>Got my hair STRAIGHT without causing any problems, so I decided to purchase it myself.</li>
            <li>I have never had hair so straight.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this iron to all my friends who want straight hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out shiny, not damaged and it takes me 10 minutes to do my hair, much quicker.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this iron for a week, but it is far better than the Chi.</li>
            <li>I have mixed hair that is naturally curly so a good flat iron is a must!</li>
            <li>The cord is quite long and the end rotates making it easy to roll the iron when curling your hair.</li>
            <li>It only took one glide for the izunami to smooth out my new growth-just one!</li>
            <li>returning the product please include Original Receipt &amp; Package, as well as the following information...</li>
            <li>It felt like it was  getting \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; and not gliding through the flat iron plates smoothly.</li>
            <li>Do not spend your money on a cheap flat iron and don&#x27;t fall for product hype.</li>
            <li>asked more questions about what they do with the item and essentially they give you a new one and throw away the old ones.</li>
            <li>I continued to use it, despite an apparent short, thinking there was nothing better or cheaper out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and used it about 3-4 times, but it works better than my Croc with barely any noticeable damage.   </li>
            <li>Nice extra long swivel cord.</li>
            <li>Flat hair after the first pass...impossible!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to save tons of time doing their hair.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this iron at 375 degrees (with only a little Jane Carter Solution Nourish and Shine as protectant), my hair feels so healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>While it has been just a few weeks, it heats up quickly and hair turns out smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing irons have had them a few years couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li>I have tried other, more expensive hair irons but this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to get another name-brand flat iron, but as I researched, I became intrigued with the Izunami 450.</li>
            <li>They work much better than your average irons.</li>
            <li>I know it may be a little to early to write a review, but I just wanted to express and share my joy with this Flat iron to the Amazon community.</li>
            <li>It got my new growth straight as if I had a relaxed.</li>
            <li>, i have a dry fine hair, when i use it instantly it smoothes and shines the hair, it is much quicker than a conventional blow dryers with amazing results.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>i would say this is better than a CHI which i had before and for less the price....</li>
            <li>You set it to the temperature you&#x27;d like, unlike others I&#x27;d previously purchased or had given to me as a gift which were much more in price.</li>
            <li>Now it takes about 20 minutes and it goes by quickly because I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same piece of hair five times.</li>
            <li>SO MY MAIN CONCERNS WERE HAIR DAMAGE AND FRIZZ</li>
            <li>After seeing Aateya&#x27;s review about this iron on youtube, I decided to buy this iron for my natural hair, so I could wear it straight when I wanted straight hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon better give me a refund back for such a defective product!  </li>
            <li>Im able to get close to the scalp on my extra coarse clients</li>
            <li>Plus, it only requires one quick movement</li>
            <li>and I thought they were hot telling me they were hot enough</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the price and the quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to any and every one...</li>
            <li>All in all, I would highly recommend this straightener for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>It has really high setting</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one over anything on the market.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this one, I was totally in love with my FHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I just received mine today and did my hair in a fraction of the time it took my old, cheap, flat irons to do.</li>
            <li>THEY COMPLETELY BLEW UP AND SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT OF THEM!!</li>
            <li>and I love how it smooths down my hair!</li>
            <li>I have curly with frizz hair and my hair looks like it is naturally shiney straight after using this.</li>
            <li>Works very well so far.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t believe it so far.</li>
            <li>Much prefer my old CHI one, will never buy another of this brand.</li>
            <li>than a minute later it beeps again to tell you it&#x27;s ready -- so fast!  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;in link with my flat iron:[[ASIN:B005NLOLLU Izunami Flat Iron Ktx450]]</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I necessarily think it was worth over $90 dollars</li>
            <li>It heats up so fast and does such a good job on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>That&amp;#34;s huge because I have super long, super thick, super curly hair and older flat irons used to take me an hour plus.</li>
            <li>Usually I do quite a bit of research before buying a new straightener, but I saw this one had such good reviews here on amazon, so I just went for it.</li>
            <li>and this flat iron get my hair silky straight on the first pass.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly, heats evenly and is not hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money and never again will I buy another inexpensive flat iron.</li>
            <li>I repeatedly told this lady that this product came in a sealed new box with there warranty card....</li>
            <li>and it still works like new</li>
            <li>I was at a Janet Collection Show In New York and Celebrity Stylist</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by my new hair dresser</li>
            <li>My new one won&#x27;t be an izunami.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, thin hair and the cheapy Conair never got hot enough to straighten it for more than half the day...</li>
            <li>I returned it to Amazon today and in the future I&#x27;m going to be more careful about which straightener I use.    </li>
            <li>I got this flat iron a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I am super lucky to have crazy, coarse, frizzy kind of hair...</li>
            <li>I have used excellent flat irons in the past (T3, CHI, Sedu, Solano, GHD, FHI), never cheap or drugstore quality.</li>
            <li>I have fine fragile hair that in using this  flat iron gave me split ends</li>
            <li>The metal plates are high quality and after the hair is completely straightened</li>
            <li>I have only used the straightener a handful of times and it has been very gently used.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the straightener a handful of times and it has been very gently used.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, my new hair growth after having excessive post-partum hair loss is more concealed now.</li>
            <li>But after I use it my hair look shiny and it last whole day!</li>
            <li>This flat iron gave a smooth finish initially, but walking around the house all of my straightness and and style was lost and it began to turn to frizz.</li>
            <li>Her hair had survived Florida heat and humidity (mid 80&#x27;s) and her hair was pin straight!  </li>
            <li>It completely burned off my clients hair from the roots and the iron began to melt!</li>
            <li>I, along with several women waiting to get their hair cut, were amazed at how fast and efficient this tool was!  </li>
            <li>I am about to travel to the UK next week, which is why I purchased this in the first place (it is supposed to work with 110 or 220V, 50 or 60 Hz).</li>
            <li>This is my first review and the only reason why i did this review because i felt like it deserved it times 20.</li>
            <li>Just yesterday though it stopped getting hot in the middle of doing my hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the item was a refurbished unit or what the problem was, but not going with this brand any more.</li>
            <li>It beeps constantly and one of the plates does not get hot.</li>
            <li>suddenly it wasn&#x27;t getting hot anymore.</li>
            <li>Prior to it shorting out, it would get too hot.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and beeps when ready which is like less than a minute.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing flat iron, I cant believe how fast I can iron my hair, and I have thick/frizzy/wavy hair, it literally takes me less that 10 minutes</li>
            <li>So this morning I washed my hair, and used my new flat iron for the first time.  </li>
            <li>But for what I paid for it, and how frequently I use thing thing (pretty much every single day)..</li>
            <li>One side is soft, and the other side tends to be more coarse.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron after using one of those cheap pharmacy brands, that say professional - but definitely aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is great for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>also I needed some new ones anyways also because I wanted to start doing hair professionally too.</li>
            <li>FYI: In the package it says to make sure your hair is dry before using it, and I have attempted to style it while just slightly damp, and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Im white with long light brown hair</li>
            <li>I usually buy cheap ones and I wanted one that would hopefully last and not dry my hair out like my cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine any other flat iron being better.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats up fast, like 30 seconds, and offers ultra low to intensively high heat choices, and the plates slide effortlessly over your hair.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this flat iron on my hair</li>
            <li>Just tried this flat iron for the first time.</li>
            <li>Instead of using the chemicals I chose to use heat with hot combs, flat irons and curling irons.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the Izunami Ceramic Flat Iron (1 inch)</li>
            <li>And since it takes only seconds to heat up, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being hot enough to do a whole head of hair.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron will not even get hot anymore.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t going to spend $200+ on a flat iron</li>
            <li>With this flat iron, my hair looks like it&#x27;s been straight all my life!</li>
            <li>First received the benefits of this flat iron when my hair stylist used it on me in the salon.  </li>
            <li>Those other flat irons have been moved to the junk drawer and we&#x27;re keeping this one handy as our go-to flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron really heats completely to 450 degrees in literally 30 seconds!</li>
            <li>My younger daughter LOVES it - her very ethnic hair, with multiple textures (very curly in the back, very tight/frizzy in the front)</li>
            <li>I was unsure about the purchase because it was such an affordable price, but it is the real deal</li>
            <li>I was definitely surprised when this one (which was cheaper than a CHI as well) didnt do that.</li>
            <li>What stopped me in my tracks was how soft and shinny my hair felt and looked.</li>
            <li>Every heating tool that I tried using just wouldn&#x27;t get my hair straight enough, or shiny.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only product I have found that makes my hair shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>and I have no split ends (for the first time in a LONG time) and</li>
            <li>I have a nine-month old baby</li>
            <li>It made my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints thus far about this iron.  </li>
            <li>she wants to get the same one as me.</li>
            <li>It works really well, especially on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S ON--it beeps loudly in the user&#x27;s ear.  </li>
            <li>I have had this iron for about a month, I have used it maybe four times and so far, its working as it should.</li>
            <li>wear my afro textured hair naturally and without chemical relaxers.</li>
            <li>I found out about this iron from the natural hair community on YouTube.</li>
            <li>straightens natural hair to where it looks relaxed  </li>
            <li>My hair type is 4A natural kinky/curly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been raining for the last 3 days and my hair still manage to remain straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair</li>
            <li>I was overjoyed with the results on natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>For professional results you need professional tools.</li>
            <li>the ceramic plates leave my hair really soft....</li>
            <li>About a year, I started doing hair professionally.</li>
            <li>This is complete BULL</li>
            <li>I have been natural for over 3 years</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>It worked really well but for only 6 weeks-ugh.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the cord twists around too much at the end where it connects to the straightener.</li>
            <li>This iron did shorten my ironing time, but even with a leave in heat protector, my hair was left very staticy.</li>
            <li>Also, it takes multiple passes to get hair straight.</li>
            <li>This is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve ever bought and it was definately worth every penny.</li>
            <li>With this flat iron I am able to do a routine hair dry without having to brush it straight and then follow up with about 20 minutes of flat ironing with this product and have stick straight hair that last me several days without a retouch.  </li>
            <li>When she woke up the next morning, I turned the flat iron on, it heated up in about 45 seconds I think, and did about 5 minutes worth of touch up ironing</li>
            <li>450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch]] at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron heats up in about 40 seconds thoroughly heated and ready to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron 1 inch here on Amazon from this very company.</li>
            <li>The flat iron works really well.</li>
            <li>I bought a flat iron from a kiosk at a mall which cost almost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe i am asking too much but flat irons should have a longer shelf life than this....</li>
            <li>Though this has been only my 3rd time using this tool, I am an absolute believer!</li>
            <li>so its been hard finding an iron that can really smooth out my new growth and the izunami does just that.</li>
            <li>It heats up within 30 seconds, cools down fast and it straightens hair fast.  </li>
            <li>I ordered an extra one even though the one I bought a few years ago is still going strong.</li>
            <li>This is the first flat iron that I have owned that takes less than 3 glides to get my hair stick straight!  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy myself one when the more expensive one failed to make me happy.</li>
            <li>It straighten my long curly hair fast without damage.</li>
            <li>send us back the Iron and we will arrange to send you a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cheaper irons, which straighten but never seem to hold, and I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive salon flat irons (BabylissPro, Cricket), which work better but tend to make my hair look and feel dry with daily use, not to mention that the frizziness would reappear at the slightest hint of humidity.      </li>
            <li>As a bonus, the price was fabulous at 73 dollars and it arrived in only a few days.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I now think the difficult side of my hair behaves better than the smoother side!</li>
            <li>This iron is like no other iron</li>
            <li>However this iron has caused major breakage with my hair.</li>
            <li>You can flatten your hair straight or do loose or spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>have extremely curly, long, fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>At first i was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product, because it seems too good to be true, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>I am half African-American and have always had problems finding the right straightener.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with flat irons (this is my second one)</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Nick Arrojo from What Not to Wear, when i heard he came out with a new flat iron</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new flat iron for a while.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, and it takes me about 30 minutes to straightened all of my mid back length mixed african american hair.     </li>
            <li>My hair is long and naturally pretty straight, but a little wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I had to go out and buy another brand new flat iron!</li>
            <li>I generally just straighten my bangs and the front part of my hair</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and this flat iron makes it have so much movement without it looking flat.</li>
            <li>IT WARMS UP IMMEDIATELY AND LEAVES HAIR SILKY WITHOUT ANY APPARENT DAMAGE.  </li>
            <li>I have very coarse african-american natural hair 4b-c</li>
            <li>My old straightener would literally flatten my hair taking out any volume I had and would result in greasy hair the next day.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and just recently got a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I was actually out on a boat in New York Harbour after a thunderstorm last week and my hair did not react.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Now, because my hair isn&#x27;t the most un-manageable there, I&#x27;d also like to say that this worked just as well for a friend of mine with very long, thick, curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, so using the cheapy ones that don&#x27;t get hot enough in the first place, and then having to wait while it heats back up after I did half</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever bought and one of the least expensive.</li>
            <li>Our products are guaranteed for 1 full year, so as long as it&#x27;s purchased from our authorized distributor and not from any other unauthorized on-line sellers (such as amazon, ebay, etc.)</li>
            <li>so the clamps would stay together when it wasn&#x27;t being used (a feature my old flat iron had).</li>
            <li>It took me years to toss my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron as a Christmas gift for my 18 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after trying it at my friend&#x27;s house, I was really surprised with the shiny hair style I got from this flat iron,</li>
            <li>my flat iron I have at home could not get my hair as straight because of the different texture in my hair, but this flat iron did the trick.</li>
            <li>then i saw Ateyaa&#x27;s review on youtube and a whole bunch of other but was pricey</li>
            <li>but then I saw the other reviews and said umm I would like to see if it really does work and</li>
            <li>but Izumani takes it to a whole other level</li>
            <li>My old flat iron is used to pull my hair but this one does not.</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s on, that&#x27;s pretty annoying, but I suppose it&#x27;s a good safety feature, also it only starts blinking once it has reached the temperature you&#x27;ve set.</li>
            <li>Both chi plates fell off after 9 years so I finally decided to get a new flat iron</li>
            <li>This product works much better for my very thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I set the temperature up to 400 degrees when starting with my natural curls, and 340 when I only need a touch up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t praise this flat iron enough so far!  </li>
            <li>hair reverted back to its natural state with a regular shampoo and condition with no heat damage.</li>
            <li>Helps to protect your hair from heat damage and keeps your style set - no dry flyaways.</li>
            <li>The price does go down, then it&#x27;s right back up the next day.</li>
            <li>I have spent hours in the past first blow drying my hair straight with a brush and</li>
            <li>I CAN CONTROL HOW HOT IT GETS, AND THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE MY HAIR STATIC-EEE OR TOO LIMP.</li>
            <li>It is also pretty sturdy as I dropped it a few time.</li>
            <li>A few seconds later it gives me the double beep that it is at the right temperature.  </li>
            <li>i have decided to purchase a more expensive flat iron ( from a conair)after going natural for 1 1/2 years now</li>
            <li>This iron was only average to me, it got my hair straight</li>
            <li>My hair had never gotten so straight with a CHI or any other flat iron.</li>
            <li>It seems to work intermittently because if I don&#x27;t use it for awhile I get the same results; works well for a few days and then it stops getting hot.</li>
            <li>I have curly, fine but very thick hair.</li>
            <li>What took me so long to buy this professional grade Flat Iron?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different flat irons in the past, but none of them have ever done the job right.  </li>

            <li> Had one and as very pleased with it</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I took a risk buying a brand i have never heard of, and i am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> It also snagged my hair a bunch of times, causing more breakage!</li>

            <li> and I make sure to tell everyone I know about Izunami&#x27;s non warranty!</li>
            <li> If someone is switching from a Hot Tools product to this one, of course they are going to think this one is superb.  </li>
            <li> In love with this iron,!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener!</li>
            <li> Gets Really hot and smooths even the thickest hair wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this iron 4 years ago and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> it was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing to watch as the hair goes through the blades.</li>
            <li> It is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> And the price is amazing</li>
            <li> I have used a CHI for many many years and though it works just great</li>
            <li> It looks best straight, but without a stylist to wield it, even the chi couldn&#x27;t make my hair look nice.  </li>
            <li> It comes in this fancy box, which is nice if you ever want to store it, which I won&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, about 4 days &amp; no cost for shipping was great!</li>
            <li> I thought about getting another Sedu since I have course hair and liked the way it smoothed out my hair, but then came across the reviews on this product on Amazon and some beauty sites.</li>
            <li> Additionally, you can curl your hair with this iron, which is always a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> (it would just be slightly warm) but would work again once it was turned off and restarted.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably my own fault.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t catch my hair in the plates, it straightened in one swipe and styled nicely, to avoid that \\&quot;I just straightened my hair\\&quot; look that came sometimes happen at the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> and she was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I baught this straightener and thought it was absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it, but I just wanted a good, durable straightener.</li>
            <li> Takes 5 seconds to warm up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Curls come out really nice...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great flat iron for a great price!</li>
            <li> This one is great as you can specifically set the temperature and it heats up quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this item, it heats up fast and straightens my hair perfect, I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell puts out some good tools, but this is  one of the best flat irons i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have one daughter with natural hair and one with relaxed hair and it works WONDERFULLY on both hair textures.</li>
            <li> My salon uses this brand and it&#x27;s by the far the best.  </li>
            <li> Before this happened it made my hair look better than spectacular for a week.  </li>
            <li> It works just perfect and your hair looks so soft and shine...</li>
            <li> Anyway, It&#x27;s good but don&#x27;t expect the best miracle flat iron ever or anything. :)</li>
            <li> she is late 20&#x27;s and beautiful kind and just wonderful with all ages of her clients)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and is better than one that I paid 160$ for.</li>
            <li> It was a worked great for the first 3-4 months</li>
            <li> I am also happy that I selected the 1 inch because it really works like a curling iron too!</li>
            <li> It was a pretty great purchase.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all because of the Izunami - it makes my hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the next best thing to the Marcels!</li>
            <li> I would love to share with you the results of my hair after use.</li>
            <li> and I have many who have purchased and received their irons</li>
            <li> and they are SO pleased</li>
            <li> MORE FHI OR CHI for me!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE</li>
            <li> so I was pleased with the amount of time it took to ship it over a weekend.</li>
            <li> it went UP some more.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the iron itself, no pulling or tugging on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I need more heat when it&#x27;s close to relaxer time.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see why I didn&#x27;t have better results.</li>
            <li> it just glided so smoothly through my hair!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product so glad I was able to purchase it for the price that I did.  </li>
            <li> my relaxer has lasted much better.</li>
            <li> Still thoroughly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give an update because I got so many compliments on my hair this morning</li>
            <li> I let my cousin try it on her hair who is a hirstylist and more picky than me</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> It takes more than an hour to get it blow-dried.</li>
            <li> The best part is that I got it on sale for only $68 -</li>
            <li> THIS IS MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> The best part is the final product-</li>
            <li> so glad i bought it</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> We also made sure she has  thermal protection product to use.   </li>
            <li> It was priced over $200 on the Izunami website, however I was able to catch a deal on Amazon where I was able to purchase it for $70.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Izunami iron.</li>
            <li> I felt confident that if anything were to happen to the iron that Amazon would take care of the issue promptly.  </li>
            <li> worked excellent for the first week, then one plate stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> / STATIC.</li>
            <li> you will be able to redeem your 1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than my Chi!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and it maintains the temperature the entire time that it is being used, it is great!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> She also said to make sure when addressing anything to there company at 83 Harbor Rd.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I am soo glad i did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 4 months now and love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before</li>
            <li> I decided to go for it, and boy I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> When I do use heat, I prefer for it to be administered in the most efficient way to prevent any additional damage and stress to my hair.</li>
            <li> I just love love love it...</li>
            <li> cos it really did a great job when it worked.</li>
            <li> would love to get another one and pray its not defective</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> The power cord is much better than the Chi also.  </li>
            <li> but if I have to keep purchasing this product every 10/11 months at $70 a pop then I rather purchase another more reliable brand like the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fool</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This flatiron is actually better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Im satisfied.</li>
            <li> To be sure it was my straightener and mot products or hair dryer, I replaced my shampoo/cond.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and i thought i have bought so many why not try another one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Izunami.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definiely my MUST HAVE product. :)</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it has great results.</li>
            <li> I love love love...</li>
            <li> It also works fantastically as a hair-curling tool; even better than a curling iron, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I got this based off reviews and have been pleased.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> The Izunami 450 is fantastic!</li>
            <li> alot make sure</li>
            <li> Which is not the products fault it is not being educated on what to do to keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Much better iron than CHIs.  </li>

            <li> I am so happy that I purchased an Izunami flat iron because it straightened my hair better than when I wore a chemical relaxer!</li>
            <li> i have thick, wavy, course hair and by fair this iron has been the been the best for me!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but this one really made my hair stay straight and smooth all day!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, no problem with this product, works just fine, love it.  </li>
            <li> These are great flat irons, I&#x27;ll always own a pair..</li>
            <li> The very cool box that it comes in says that Izunami means in-dis-pen-sible.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is safe and secure that way.  </li>
            <li> and I realized my hair was becoming damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener now for roughly three months, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It works great so far.</li>
            <li> Good price and very durable product.</li>
            <li> This year in September I was doing a clients hair, she really wanted me to use the irons because her friend told her how good they were.</li>
            <li> my hair looks and feels healthy, and it stays completely straight on the most humid of days!      </li>
            <li> They were all true!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, even if you&#x27;ve never done it before, you&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li> I can easily arrange my hair in couple minutes.</li>
            <li> you may have to get used to it working so easily.</li>
            <li> so the cord doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and makes straightening my hair very quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel.</li>
            <li> So, so true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been about five months, and this iron is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this iron is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> You only need 1 maybe 2 glides and your hair is beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Hands down this product is a great buy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, that was her offer to a customer who had all the original box, the original receipt, and the warranty card!</li>
            <li> , i have three iron with high prices, yet this one is so far excellent</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and relaxed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it is light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This one is slimmer than the previous one, but according to her, they both heat up in a flash and are excellent to use.</li>
            <li> I love how it straightens quickly</li>
            <li> The iron heats so quickly (and beeps when heated within what seems to be one minutes!)</li>
            <li> It gets my hair straight with ONE glide, makes my hair shiny, and what amazed me the most was how silky-soft my hair was afterwards!  </li>
            <li> If it matters, I have light colored, fine, wavy hair.    </li>
            <li> Love at first stroke!</li>
            <li> It worked great and my hair was perfect in half the time of my other straighteners (I have owned many).  </li>
            <li> though I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference; apart from the things I mentioned.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ones that you can control the temperature which is a huge plus with this one.</li>
            <li> It goes over my hair so smooth and leaves it shining.</li>
            <li> hair smooth and shinny</li>
            <li> It glides so smoothly and you don&#x27;t need to put any pressure on the plates because they \\&quot;float.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> and it was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have had the iron for several months and am so happy I made this purchase over the Sedu.</li>
            <li> It glides so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> A GREAT iron, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t use cheap styling appliances.</li>
            <li> My hair did not become smooth.</li>
            <li> This iron makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Very functional, amazing price</li>
            <li> Keeps hair smooth for days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times, and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Really straightens nicely without frying the hair.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly on hair when used</li>
            <li> BUT the light kept blinking</li>
            <li> Her hair came out smooth, pin-straight and stayed that way for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li> Nice flatiron that performs very well.</li>
            <li> It glides through my hair so smoothly without burning.</li>
            <li> It looked like I had stuck my finger in a light socket or had my hands on one of those \\&quot;plasma</li>
            <li> I bought the iron and was using it regularly with great luck.</li>
            <li> The light would flash and</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, and only takes me about fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> I have contacted the seller and they confirmed it.  </li>
            <li> All it take is one glide to get smooth, silky, and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> After I was done, my hair was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> If i have problems with with it in a few weeks like some have had, i will write another review but for now it&#x27;s just GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m happy it lasted two years, I guess I&#x27;m concerned that both irons seemed to break in the same way.  </li>
            <li> It heats fast and does an amazing job of straighting hair.</li>
            <li> I always kept it back in a ponytail and gave up hope that I might ever be able to have a good hair day without paying for a blowout.  </li>
            <li> So, I learned about the Izunami from a good friend of mine, who is also natural.  </li>
            <li> This one is good so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating whether or not I should give this product another shot, or whether I should purchase from another store, because I will be really bummed if the same thing happens, but it was the best while it worked!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this particular flatiron for a while, was pleased to find it and the price was unbeatable!</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon is good &amp; if you catch it at the right time you can really save.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this is the absolute best flat iron i have used to date.</li>
            <li> I finally used it for me was great and took my daughters braids out and was so excited</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best flat irons.</li>

            <li> Great flat iron.</li>
            <li> The flat iron was doing my hair great.</li>
            <li> I sent the product, the original receipt, and the warranty card filled out to Izunami.</li>
            <li> The tagline on the box is \\&quot;love at first glide\\&quot; and I think that&#x27;s 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> Amazon is brilliant to make such items available at such an amazing price.  </li>
            <li> Port Washington, New York 11050 to make sure to write Izunami at the top because this is also a residence.</li>
            <li> So watch out Izunami MORE orders coming, I&#x27;m really pushing this!</li>
            <li> In addition, there was a recent wedding in the family and many, many, members of the family had a chance to use it and all fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> ~ It&#x27;s Love at First Glide.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As usual I came to Amazon to do my research and found awesome reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> and I must say that I&#x27;m just as pleased with it as I was the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> So far, very pleased with the puchase.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I paid $179.99 plus tax on the spot and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It was the first time she had ever had her hair straightened, and she fell in love with the look.</li>
            <li> , that I would need to contact the original seller on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this flat iron..</li>
            <li> It created a nice shine to it and made it so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely shiny and curled it beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love how it heats super fast in 30 secs!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Flat Iron on the market.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying another brand flat iron and so far am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Again Thanks so much for putting out such a WONDERFUL product.</li>
            <li> I would also buy from the seller again because everything they promised in their ad was true.</li>
            <li> I love that it heats up in under a minute and even beeps when it&#x27;s ready.  </li>
            <li> Amazon gave me a full refund of my money paid for this iron today.</li>
            <li> After a good wash and condition it makes it seem like you just left the dominicans chair in a hair salon.  </li>
            <li> I love how straight my hair gets with this iron.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and with one or two swipes it straightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> When a company won&#x27;t back their product, it can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron just to TRY to learn to do my own hair, thinkikng that I would never get it nice and straight.</li>
            <li> Bought this item in June and thought it was great!....did a fantastic job of straightening my hair with just the right amount of heat.  </li>
            <li> This was a great flat iron for the first 3 months I had it.</li>
            <li> Great product as other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> This is a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is so good that I HAD to let people</li>
            <li> Not too good with the flat iron yet,</li>
            <li> This is a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron and I gladly would have paid twice the price for it after I saw the results!  </li>
            <li> Works better than the Chi, light-weight and smaller than most.</li>
            <li> :  Amazon processed the return quickly and returned my money.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using this iron and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was iffy spending so much money, but after reading the reviews I was convinced and I&#x27;m so happy I did.     </li>
            <li> Luckily, my client was understanding.</li>
            <li> Plus this company shipped it quickly</li>
            <li> straightener works super</li>
            <li> Heats up so quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> It also arrived really quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love this iron because it straighten well, leaves hair with natural shine and its light weight.</li>
            <li> and it did it quickly, but</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and straightens well.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW great product.  </li>
            <li> this flat iron is awesome, i just tested it out on a small section of my hair and it was amazing</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied by this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have only had this flat iron for about a week, but I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to buy middle-of-the-line products...not cheap crappy straighteners and not expensive ones either, and they always worked \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, much better than Chi.  </li>
            <li> Because even at 270 degrees it gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and it is strong , yet gentle.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Izunami because of its high reviews and low price... and so far, so good!!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 5 months now and I am still as excited today as I was the first day.  </li>
            <li> , that is a first for me!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and easily could sell for 2 or 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> I wanted to update to say that I&#x27;ve started using this iron for defined curls (rather than slight bends) and it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this flat iron for anyone wanting some stress free straightening!!!</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacement for my Cricket, which survived over 3 years of daily use and abuse, I came across the Izunami flat iron and was impressed with all the positive reviews.   </li>
            <li> and my hair is perfectly straight and silky smooth,</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair, so it takes a while to get it straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The light will be lit which I thought meant it was ready, but it clearly isn&#x27;t warm enough or working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had $30 flat irons from Wal Mart that are better than this!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> She  straightens her hair until it smokes, so we wanted a more professional appliance for her to use.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelieveavle and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this iron it looks like I&#x27;ve just gotten a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair glossy after so I rarely have to use any shining products afterwards.</li>
            <li> It has an adjustable heat setting which is nice, though I&#x27;ve only used it on the highest one.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m THRILLED.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that the IZUNAMI is by far BETTER.  </li>
            <li> but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> This straightener is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this iron is powerful and can damage your hair if you don&#x27;t take care of your hair.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am in love with this iron so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever, I have curly hair and usually took about 1 hour to get it all ironed, but with the Izunami I get it done in less than 25 minutes, it is so amazing!!</li>
            <li> Her hair seems less damaged, and has a beautiful sheen, and is very managable.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend, I wish it had an automatic shut off, but other than that no complaints - a great deal from amazon!</li>
            <li> heats up quickly and stays hot.  </li>
            <li> Also, it heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> Gets hot really quick and straightens with one or two swipes..</li>
            <li> This flat iron is AMAZING</li>
            <li> I set it at 400, and it glides right through my hair and straightens in one pass.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase it right away, and haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase at all.  </li>
            <li> and she was totally right.  </li>
            <li> I went into a salon and the guy used it on my hair right then.</li>
            <li> So as of right now i give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was using a cheap Conair straightener from Walmart that pretty much ripped my hair out.  </li>
            <li> As some stated, it started out great the first few uses then</li>
            <li> My clients loved the flat irons and I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the top brand professional straighteners out there such as the CHI and the SOLIA, however none compare to the Izunami.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is hands down one of the best products out there.  </li>
            <li> These are hands down THE BEST flat irons that you will ever purchase.</li>
            <li> Either that or on that nice little HASSLE FREE ONE YEAR WARRANTY card that comes with this iron, they need to put a disclaimer about buying it from a authorized dealer on it.</li>
            <li> and bought a new cheap blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> it would always leave my hair very staticy if i went for the super sleek look, so</li>
            <li> It made the smooth side of my hair smoother and softer, and the coarse side perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> We had previously owned a Izunmani Straightner for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The iron heats up quickly (and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready) and the heat stays consistent.</li>
            <li> It was used very gently.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and does a fantastic job on my hair of straightening or adding loose curls.</li>
            <li> I first seen this product about a month with a price of $71 and some change.</li>
            <li> My point exactly.</li>
            <li> I would love to see this product back at $71 or just at a set price.</li>
            <li> NO LONGER GETS HOT.</li>
            <li> All have been \\&quot;professional\\&quot; and higher end brands.</li>
            <li> Hair is left bouncy shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair, and I have A LOT of it!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> I used the Izunami for the first time this morning...</li>
            <li> I have been using cheapy ones for a long time, and decided to pay the extra for a great one.  </li>
            <li> Izunami is my first hair iron.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks I noticed the straightener was no longer getting hot on one side.  </li>
            <li> I turned it on one more time just to see what it did, (not that I would have chanced burning my hair again) and it starting beeping repeatedly whatever that meant.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of several products we decided to go with the Izunami, and we are glad we did.  </li>
            <li> It stays hot.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was worth a try, since even the ones offered at retail stores are almost that much.</li>
            <li> It heats up so unbelievably fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different irons and none have come close to how well this one works.  </li>
            <li> It got so hot that it burned a chunck of my hair out of my head.</li>
            <li> And, to the sole Izunami customer service rep who&#x27;s sitting somewhere alone in a house all smug and snuggly and warm while ignoring my e-mail: thanks for nothing--you&#x27;ll be getting my returned product very soon.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast &amp; straightens to perfection!</li>
            <li> and it would randomly not heat up</li>
            <li> It did not get hot after that and it continuously beeped.  </li>
            <li> They could have used a much smaller box for shipment, and more sustainable packaging.</li>
            <li> Iron worked perfectly for 2 weeks, even though initially it faintly smelled like burning wires.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot and just beeps continuously.</li>
            <li> heats extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results I feel like I just left the salon when finished with my hair!</li>
            <li> I first saw this at my Salon.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever taken time to review a product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Heats up real fast thanks</li>
            <li> it litteritly gets hot in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> The exact product I wanted</li>
            <li> and I used this for the first time about a week ago and my hair looked like I had just permed it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had to re-flat-iron my hair since I did it the first time.</li>
            <li> it moves and feels light and soft.</li>
            <li> I for some reason, one side would not heat, I turned it on and off and it got hot, but it did make me nervous.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly one year and one month to the day</li>
            <li> so if you plan on using more often than that, it probably wont even last a year.</li>
            <li> They sell it at the salon for more then double the price.</li>
            <li> the lady that does my hair uses the same one at her shop i have enjoyed it .</li>
            <li> Simply said, I LOVE</li>
            <li> I was managing a salon 2 1/2 to 3 years ago when this product first came out.</li>
            <li> but the plates would not get hot.</li>
            <li> The straighteners are so cheap even the company doesnt want to deal with getting them fixed.</li>
            <li> the first time in my life my hair does not react and frizz up in Summer Heat and Humidity after I spend time drying and ironing  </li>
            <li> But, now when I turn on the Izunami iron, it just beeps and does not get hot.  </li>
            <li> I MOST DEFINITELY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Should there be any changes i will be sure to come back and update my review</li>
            <li> The first one broke within the one year warranty so it was replaced by the salon I purchased it through.  </li>
            <li> High quality, gets super hot, has suspension on the ceramic tiles</li>
            <li> When used with the right styling products (For me, small amounts of: a heat protection spray, mousse and anti-frizz serum) and, on good hair days, without, the Izunami creates a professional looking, sleek, smooth and long-lasting hair style.</li>
            <li> One major bonus: it heats super quickly (lest than 20-30 seconds depending on temperature)</li>
            <li> I have purchased a 15.00 flat iron from Walmart that works muchhhhhh better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this flat iron because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Now with that being said, I LOVE this flat iron.</li>
            <li> USED TOP OF THE LINE FLAT IRONS -</li>
            <li> took out my \\&quot;indispensible\\&quot; flat iron and whipped it into magic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I have somewhat wavy hair and what I love about this flat iron was that it straightened my hair and made it shiny without removing the volume from my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems much better off after using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This one cut my styling time down a bunch, plus it looks a lot better!  </li>
            <li> I really really love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I love that it has multiple heat settings and beeps when it is ready for use.</li>
            <li> It heats up incredibly fast and works a million times better than my prior one did.</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> but this flat iron keeps it super straight and smooth, even at the roots.</li>
            <li> , i have never been able to actually curl my hair with a flat iron and this made it so easy to do.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> and I am STILL in LOVE with my IZUNAMI FLAT IRON!!!  </li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> I have gotten my hair straight before, but not THIS straight!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron so much</li>
            <li> within a matter of seconds of turning it on the iron gets hot so fast.</li>
            <li> They get hot and keep your hair straight as if you had a relaxer in your.</li>
            <li> This worked well for the first year I&#x27;d say and about 2 months ago, I realized that my hair was feeling very frizzy and</li>
            <li> So far I loving this flat iron.</li>
            <li> In the beginnging I loved how shiny and straight it made my hair, but after only one week of regular use it started to smoke and it burned a chunk of my hair off.  </li>
            <li> these are just as good if not better.     </li>
            <li> I have the thickest, curliest, frizziest hair IN THE WORLD, and somehow this amazing straightener slenderizes it down, into sleek straightened hair.</li>
            <li> It gives my Hair slip and body like no other and leaves it feeling soft and light not to mention how shiny it makes my Hair !</li>
            <li> I had considered a Chi or a Paul Mitchell, but this one is amazing and costs less.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion,  the T3 leaves a healthier sheen and is better for your hair in the long term for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget and need a flat iron that is as good a as Chi, I would recommend ths flat iron.</li>
            <li> So I search on the original website but they were too much for me, so I finally decided to check on amazon and the price was right up my ally</li>
            <li> This would have to be by far the BEST flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever purchased (also the most expensive).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what all the hype is about on this particular flat iron.</li>
            <li> Now I have to shop for a new one!!</li>
            <li> While it does heat up in less than 20 seconds, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything else that I would consider amazing...</li>
            <li> typically I use it to curl.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE GOT PRETTY LONG, FINE, UNALTERED HAIR (NEVER</li>
            <li> Why, for the love of God, would anyone design a product with a feature created for no other apparent reason than to annoy its users 100% of the time it&#x27;s being used?  </li>
            <li> I am in love with my new Flat Iron...</li>
            <li> It takes only one swipe for each section and my hair is silky smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li> I was telling my hairdresser that she REALLY REALLY REALLY needs to invest in this product line.</li>
            <li> , they said, \\&quot;Thanks Lucretia, \\&quot;NO</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t get it as straight as it should of.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Izunami, those days might be over.  </li>
            <li> It glided through my hair as smoothly as silk and left my hair looking like I&#x27;d just visited the salon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My daughters have ethnic, very curly/kinky/thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about products and styling tools on my hair</li>

            <li> FAST DELIVERY AND WORKS WONDERS ON HAIR.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s after 12:00 pm and my hair is still straight...</li>
            <li> The strip turned light and was totally burned!  </li>
            <li> I just had to glide this once over each section of hair and it was straight.</li>
            <li> this straight.</li>
            <li> It can handle my hair in one pass whereas with the Sedu took several, and leaves your hair smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it</li>
            <li> It is so fast</li>
            <li> It really gets my hair straighter than I have ever had it</li>
            <li> and it stays straight until I wash my hair again</li>
            <li> It is ready to go in about 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it is.  </li>
            <li> She loves this product just as much as i do.  </li>
            <li> Heats up incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Fast forward 12 months</li>
            <li> It leaves hair silky, straight and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I will try to contact amazon and the seller to get a refund or exchange, and I really hope they will because they are selling defective products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset about the Izunami.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> i have been searching and searching for a Iron and could not find one which really could help my frizzy</li>
            <li> really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> Very reliable.</li>
            <li> I will try to contact amazon and the seller to get a refund or exchange, and I really hope they will because they are selling defective products.</li>
            <li> so I really doubted the Izunami until I used it.</li>
            <li> I like how it beeps when ready</li>
            <li> I pass through and my hair is bone straight.</li>
            <li> it straight..</li>
            <li> The iron worked very well on my hair while it worked.  </li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Izunami but perhaps the seller.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t track very well on your hair piece</li>
            <li> Got my hair STRAIGHT without causing any problems, so I decided to purchase it myself.</li>
            <li> I have never had hair so straight.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this iron to all my friends who want straight hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out shiny, not damaged and it takes me 10 minutes to do my hair, much quicker.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this iron for a week, but it is far better than the Chi.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair that is naturally curly so a good flat iron is a must!</li>
            <li> The cord is quite long and the end rotates making it easy to roll the iron when curling your hair.</li>
            <li> It only took one glide for the izunami to smooth out my new growth-just one!</li>
            <li> returning the product please include Original Receipt &amp; Package, as well as the following information...</li>
            <li> It felt like it was  getting \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; and not gliding through the flat iron plates smoothly.</li>
            <li> Do not spend your money on a cheap flat iron and don&#x27;t fall for product hype.</li>
            <li> asked more questions about what they do with the item and essentially they give you a new one and throw away the old ones.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it, despite an apparent short, thinking there was nothing better or cheaper out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and used it about 3-4 times, but it works better than my Croc with barely any noticeable damage.   </li>
            <li> Nice extra long swivel cord.</li>
            <li> Flat hair after the first pass...impossible!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to save tons of time doing their hair.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this iron at 375 degrees (with only a little Jane Carter Solution Nourish and Shine as protectant), my hair feels so healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> While it has been just a few weeks, it heats up quickly and hair turns out smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing irons have had them a few years couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li> I have tried other, more expensive hair irons but this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to get another name-brand flat iron, but as I researched, I became intrigued with the Izunami 450.</li>
            <li> They work much better than your average irons.</li>
            <li> I know it may be a little to early to write a review, but I just wanted to express and share my joy with this Flat iron to the Amazon community.</li>
            <li> It got my new growth straight as if I had a relaxed.</li>
            <li> , i have a dry fine hair, when i use it instantly it smoothes and shines the hair, it is much quicker than a conventional blow dryers with amazing results.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> i would say this is better than a CHI which i had before and for less the price....</li>
            <li> You set it to the temperature you&#x27;d like, unlike others I&#x27;d previously purchased or had given to me as a gift which were much more in price.</li>
            <li> Now it takes about 20 minutes and it goes by quickly because I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same piece of hair five times.</li>
            <li> SO MY MAIN CONCERNS WERE HAIR DAMAGE AND FRIZZ</li>
            <li> After seeing Aateya&#x27;s review about this iron on youtube, I decided to buy this iron for my natural hair, so I could wear it straight when I wanted straight hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon better give me a refund back for such a defective product!  </li>
            <li> Im able to get close to the scalp on my extra coarse clients</li>
            <li> Plus, it only requires one quick movement</li>
            <li> and I thought they were hot telling me they were hot enough</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the price and the quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any and every one...</li>
            <li> All in all, I would highly recommend this straightener for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> It has really high setting</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one over anything on the market.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this one, I was totally in love with my FHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I just received mine today and did my hair in a fraction of the time it took my old, cheap, flat irons to do.</li>
            <li> THEY COMPLETELY BLEW UP AND SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT OF THEM!!</li>
            <li> and I love how it smooths down my hair!</li>
            <li> I have curly with frizz hair and my hair looks like it is naturally shiney straight after using this.</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t believe it so far.</li>
            <li> Much prefer my old CHI one, will never buy another of this brand.</li>
            <li> than a minute later it beeps again to tell you it&#x27;s ready -- so fast!  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;in link with my flat iron:[[ASIN:B005NLOLLU Izunami Flat Iron Ktx450]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I necessarily think it was worth over $90 dollars</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast and does such a good job on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> That&amp;#34;s huge because I have super long, super thick, super curly hair and older flat irons used to take me an hour plus.</li>
            <li> Usually I do quite a bit of research before buying a new straightener, but I saw this one had such good reviews here on amazon, so I just went for it.</li>
            <li> and this flat iron get my hair silky straight on the first pass.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly, heats evenly and is not hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the money and never again will I buy another inexpensive flat iron.</li>
            <li> I repeatedly told this lady that this product came in a sealed new box with there warranty card....</li>
            <li> and it still works like new</li>
            <li> I was at a Janet Collection Show In New York and Celebrity Stylist</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my new hair dresser</li>
            <li> My new one won&#x27;t be an izunami.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, thin hair and the cheapy Conair never got hot enough to straighten it for more than half the day...</li>
            <li> I returned it to Amazon today and in the future I&#x27;m going to be more careful about which straightener I use.    </li>
            <li> I got this flat iron a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I am super lucky to have crazy, coarse, frizzy kind of hair...</li>
            <li> I have used excellent flat irons in the past (T3, CHI, Sedu, Solano, GHD, FHI), never cheap or drugstore quality.</li>
            <li> I have fine fragile hair that in using this  flat iron gave me split ends</li>
            <li> The metal plates are high quality and after the hair is completely straightened</li>
            <li> I have only used the straightener a handful of times and it has been very gently used.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the straightener a handful of times and it has been very gently used.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, my new hair growth after having excessive post-partum hair loss is more concealed now.</li>
            <li> But after I use it my hair look shiny and it last whole day!</li>
            <li> This flat iron gave a smooth finish initially, but walking around the house all of my straightness and and style was lost and it began to turn to frizz.</li>
            <li> Her hair had survived Florida heat and humidity (mid 80&#x27;s) and her hair was pin straight!  </li>
            <li> It completely burned off my clients hair from the roots and the iron began to melt!</li>
            <li> I, along with several women waiting to get their hair cut, were amazed at how fast and efficient this tool was!  </li>
            <li> I am about to travel to the UK next week, which is why I purchased this in the first place (it is supposed to work with 110 or 220V, 50 or 60 Hz).</li>
            <li> This is my first review and the only reason why i did this review because i felt like it deserved it times 20.</li>
            <li> Just yesterday though it stopped getting hot in the middle of doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the item was a refurbished unit or what the problem was, but not going with this brand any more.</li>
            <li> It beeps constantly and one of the plates does not get hot.</li>
            <li> suddenly it wasn&#x27;t getting hot anymore.</li>
            <li> Prior to it shorting out, it would get too hot.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly and beeps when ready which is like less than a minute.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing flat iron, I cant believe how fast I can iron my hair, and I have thick/frizzy/wavy hair, it literally takes me less that 10 minutes</li>
            <li> So this morning I washed my hair, and used my new flat iron for the first time.  </li>
            <li> But for what I paid for it, and how frequently I use thing thing (pretty much every single day)..</li>
            <li> One side is soft, and the other side tends to be more coarse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after using one of those cheap pharmacy brands, that say professional - but definitely aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is great for thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> also I needed some new ones anyways also because I wanted to start doing hair professionally too.</li>
            <li> FYI: In the package it says to make sure your hair is dry before using it, and I have attempted to style it while just slightly damp, and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Im white with long light brown hair</li>
            <li> I usually buy cheap ones and I wanted one that would hopefully last and not dry my hair out like my cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine any other flat iron being better.  </li>
            <li> This iron heats up fast, like 30 seconds, and offers ultra low to intensively high heat choices, and the plates slide effortlessly over your hair.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this flat iron on my hair</li>
            <li> Just tried this flat iron for the first time.</li>
            <li> Instead of using the chemicals I chose to use heat with hot combs, flat irons and curling irons.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the Izunami Ceramic Flat Iron (1 inch)</li>
            <li> And since it takes only seconds to heat up, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being hot enough to do a whole head of hair.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron will not even get hot anymore.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t going to spend $200+ on a flat iron</li>
            <li> With this flat iron, my hair looks like it&#x27;s been straight all my life!</li>
            <li> First received the benefits of this flat iron when my hair stylist used it on me in the salon.  </li>
            <li> Those other flat irons have been moved to the junk drawer and we&#x27;re keeping this one handy as our go-to flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron really heats completely to 450 degrees in literally 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> My younger daughter LOVES it - her very ethnic hair, with multiple textures (very curly in the back, very tight/frizzy in the front)</li>
            <li> I was unsure about the purchase because it was such an affordable price, but it is the real deal</li>
            <li> I was definitely surprised when this one (which was cheaper than a CHI as well) didnt do that.</li>
            <li> What stopped me in my tracks was how soft and shinny my hair felt and looked.</li>
            <li> Every heating tool that I tried using just wouldn&#x27;t get my hair straight enough, or shiny.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only product I have found that makes my hair shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> and I have no split ends (for the first time in a LONG time) and</li>
            <li> I have a nine-month old baby</li>
            <li> It made my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints thus far about this iron.  </li>
            <li> she wants to get the same one as me.</li>
            <li> It works really well, especially on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ON--it beeps loudly in the user&#x27;s ear.  </li>
            <li> I have had this iron for about a month, I have used it maybe four times and so far, its working as it should.</li>
            <li> wear my afro textured hair naturally and without chemical relaxers.</li>
            <li> I found out about this iron from the natural hair community on YouTube.</li>
            <li> straightens natural hair to where it looks relaxed  </li>
            <li> My hair type is 4A natural kinky/curly</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been raining for the last 3 days and my hair still manage to remain straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair</li>
            <li> I was overjoyed with the results on natural and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> For professional results you need professional tools.</li>
            <li> the ceramic plates leave my hair really soft....</li>
            <li> About a year, I started doing hair professionally.</li>
            <li> This is complete BULL</li>
            <li> I have been natural for over 3 years</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> It worked really well but for only 6 weeks-ugh.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the cord twists around too much at the end where it connects to the straightener.</li>
            <li> This iron did shorten my ironing time, but even with a leave in heat protector, my hair was left very staticy.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes multiple passes to get hair straight.</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve ever bought and it was definately worth every penny.</li>
            <li> With this flat iron I am able to do a routine hair dry without having to brush it straight and then follow up with about 20 minutes of flat ironing with this product and have stick straight hair that last me several days without a retouch.  </li>
            <li> When she woke up the next morning, I turned the flat iron on, it heated up in about 45 seconds I think, and did about 5 minutes worth of touch up ironing</li>
            <li> 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch]] at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron heats up in about 40 seconds thoroughly heated and ready to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron 1 inch here on Amazon from this very company.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works really well.</li>
            <li> I bought a flat iron from a kiosk at a mall which cost almost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe i am asking too much but flat irons should have a longer shelf life than this....</li>
            <li> Though this has been only my 3rd time using this tool, I am an absolute believer!</li>
            <li> so its been hard finding an iron that can really smooth out my new growth and the izunami does just that.</li>
            <li> It heats up within 30 seconds, cools down fast and it straightens hair fast.  </li>
            <li> I ordered an extra one even though the one I bought a few years ago is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is the first flat iron that I have owned that takes less than 3 glides to get my hair stick straight!  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy myself one when the more expensive one failed to make me happy.</li>
            <li> It straighten my long curly hair fast without damage.</li>
            <li> send us back the Iron and we will arrange to send you a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheaper irons, which straighten but never seem to hold, and I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive salon flat irons (BabylissPro, Cricket), which work better but tend to make my hair look and feel dry with daily use, not to mention that the frizziness would reappear at the slightest hint of humidity.      </li>
            <li> As a bonus, the price was fabulous at 73 dollars and it arrived in only a few days.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I now think the difficult side of my hair behaves better than the smoother side!</li>
            <li> This iron is like no other iron</li>
            <li> However this iron has caused major breakage with my hair.</li>
            <li> You can flatten your hair straight or do loose or spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> have extremely curly, long, fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> At first i was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product, because it seems too good to be true, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am half African-American and have always had problems finding the right straightener.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with flat irons (this is my second one)</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Nick Arrojo from What Not to Wear, when i heard he came out with a new flat iron</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new flat iron for a while.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, and it takes me about 30 minutes to straightened all of my mid back length mixed african american hair.     </li>
            <li> My hair is long and naturally pretty straight, but a little wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I had to go out and buy another brand new flat iron!</li>
            <li> I generally just straighten my bangs and the front part of my hair</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this flat iron makes it have so much movement without it looking flat.</li>
            <li> IT WARMS UP IMMEDIATELY AND LEAVES HAIR SILKY WITHOUT ANY APPARENT DAMAGE.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse african-american natural hair 4b-c</li>
            <li> My old straightener would literally flatten my hair taking out any volume I had and would result in greasy hair the next day.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and just recently got a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I was actually out on a boat in New York Harbour after a thunderstorm last week and my hair did not react.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Now, because my hair isn&#x27;t the most un-manageable there, I&#x27;d also like to say that this worked just as well for a friend of mine with very long, thick, curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, so using the cheapy ones that don&#x27;t get hot enough in the first place, and then having to wait while it heats back up after I did half</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever bought and one of the least expensive.</li>
            <li> Our products are guaranteed for 1 full year, so as long as it&#x27;s purchased from our authorized distributor and not from any other unauthorized on-line sellers (such as amazon, ebay, etc.)</li>
            <li> so the clamps would stay together when it wasn&#x27;t being used (a feature my old flat iron had).</li>
            <li> It took me years to toss my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron as a Christmas gift for my 18 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying it at my friend&#x27;s house, I was really surprised with the shiny hair style I got from this flat iron,</li>
            <li> my flat iron I have at home could not get my hair as straight because of the different texture in my hair, but this flat iron did the trick.</li>
            <li> then i saw Ateyaa&#x27;s review on youtube and a whole bunch of other but was pricey</li>
            <li> but then I saw the other reviews and said umm I would like to see if it really does work and</li>
            <li> but Izumani takes it to a whole other level</li>
            <li> My old flat iron is used to pull my hair but this one does not.</li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s on, that&#x27;s pretty annoying, but I suppose it&#x27;s a good safety feature, also it only starts blinking once it has reached the temperature you&#x27;ve set.</li>
            <li> Both chi plates fell off after 9 years so I finally decided to get a new flat iron</li>
            <li> This product works much better for my very thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I set the temperature up to 400 degrees when starting with my natural curls, and 340 when I only need a touch up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise this flat iron enough so far!  </li>
            <li> hair reverted back to its natural state with a regular shampoo and condition with no heat damage.</li>
            <li> Helps to protect your hair from heat damage and keeps your style set - no dry flyaways.</li>
            <li> The price does go down, then it&#x27;s right back up the next day.</li>
            <li> I have spent hours in the past first blow drying my hair straight with a brush and</li>
            <li> I CAN CONTROL HOW HOT IT GETS, AND THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE MY HAIR STATIC-EEE OR TOO LIMP.</li>
            <li> It is also pretty sturdy as I dropped it a few time.</li>
            <li> A few seconds later it gives me the double beep that it is at the right temperature.  </li>
            <li> i have decided to purchase a more expensive flat iron ( from a conair)after going natural for 1 1/2 years now</li>
            <li> This iron was only average to me, it got my hair straight</li>
            <li> My hair had never gotten so straight with a CHI or any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> It seems to work intermittently because if I don&#x27;t use it for awhile I get the same results; works well for a few days and then it stops getting hot.</li>
            <li> I have curly, fine but very thick hair.</li>
            <li> What took me so long to buy this professional grade Flat Iron?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different flat irons in the past, but none of them have ever done the job right.  </li>
            <li> I was about to purchase, but i waited till the next day and the Izunami flat iron was $10.00 extra.</li>
            <li> She recently had a medium level Keratin treatment and when we straightened her hair with our flat iron, her hair was frizzy 10 minutes after going outside.     </li>
            <li> A little sad that when I bought my sister&#x27;s on Amazon, it was only $100, but I still say it&#x27;s a worthy investment, considering I was spending $55 each time I wanted my hair pressed!!!</li>
            <li> I decided a year ago to stop using relaxers and other chemicals in my hair to make it staight and soft.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron based off reviews I saw on youtube especially Ateya&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I wish the flat iron had a clamp lock</li>
            <li> Last week I flat ironed my hair and the iron malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> I only need to flat iron my hair maybe twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for a replacement to my JRS Superstar Flat Iron, which recently died and the others are on backorder.</li>
            <li> So back in 2011 I saw a youtuber using these flat irons</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this flat iron when my current one died.</li>
            <li> Though I only had the Izunami Flat Iron for about a week (Knock on wood,</li>
            <li> I still have this flat iron and occasionally try to use it</li>
            <li> I have used 20 different flat irons.</li>
            <li> It worked after one slide down my natural hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter has mixed-race hair, which leaves some parts of her hair straight and shiny, and other parts frizzy, damaged looking or just extremely curly.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and this iron makes my hair very straight and silky.</li>
            <li> Usually by now, I&#x27;m ready to pull my hair out</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I was a bit concerned about purchasing this flat iron because of all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> and it get my hair straight usually in one glide.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Izunami Flat Iron on the 6th (a weds.) and received it on the 10th (monday)</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED IZUNAM1  FLAT IRON IN JANUARY 2011</li>
            <li> For the longest time I had a Chi which was supposed to be the end all, be all of flat irons.  </li>
            <li> This iron works for me even in humid weather and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> As the company logo stamped on the flat iron declares, Izunami is truly \\&quot;in-dis-pen-sa-ble\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My sister had been using her izunami flat iron on my hair for years</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron yesterday</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T OWNED A FLAT IRON IN FOREVER...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no apparent way to turn the beeping off</li>
            <li> It never looks over-ironed or flat.</li>
            <li> When I got this flat iron, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002QHFG3Q Izunami Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a flat ironed hair video my YouTube channel under \\&quot;Mid-Life Crisis\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> By process of elimination, I realized that it was the flat iron causing havoc on my hair.</li>

            <li> I use argan oil on my hair before using this flat iron, and my hair doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron on my hair every day since receiving it.  </li>
            <li> If you are considering buying this flat iron then you don&#x27;t need to think twice.</li>
            <li> I am african american and I have shoulder-length natural hair; dry, very thick and very tightly-curl texture.  </li>
            <li> With this flat iron, her hair was done in about an hour!  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair out, plus I had to keep going over my new growth over and over again</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these flat irons for a long time.  </li>
            <li> There is NO snagging of the hair which I have experienced and hated about past/cheapo flat irons I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> and I mostly wet bun or blow out and flat iron, occasionally I will wear it curly as a wash and go.</li>
            <li> I usually try to spend a decent amount of money on one because i don&#x27;t want to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener and to my surprise and disappointment</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener and to my surprise and disappointment</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, wavy and long.</li>
            <li> my hair took a long time.  </li>
            <li> I can straighten my long, curly hair in ~35 minutes.</li>
            <li> But even if it was a design issue, it&#x27;s so minor</li>
            <li> , my Izunami will function for a long time.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t take long to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> I definitely expected it to last longer than that.</li>
            <li> It straightens my wavy thick hair very well.  </li>
            <li> then flat ironing it only to have it start curling back up within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my other heating tools that took at least 2 minutes to get hot.</li>
            <li> The cord is too long but other than that it is definitely meeting my needs.</li>
            <li> Imagine a toaster or coffeemaker or lamp or ANY other electronic appliance in your home beeping loudly simply for the heck of it just to say \\&quot;I&#x27;M</li>
            <li> and usually you only have to straighten a section once instead of going over the same section multiple times.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews saying the same thing</li>
            <li> I have very long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well it straightens in a single</li>
            <li> Izunami last 2-3 days and takes half as long to flatiron.</li>
            <li> I bought this Izunami flat iron after becoming incredibly frustrated with my crappy Remington flat iron.</li>
            <li> With other flat irons I have had to glide it over each section 2 to 3 times to get it</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I&#x27;d say is the constant red blinking</li>
            <li> The primary reason I bought this flat iron was for the \\&quot;sleep\\&quot; function but much to my disappointment it is an error in the Amazon description.  </li>
            <li> So I thought the price would go back down, so i waited, but</li>
            <li> I color my hair and had become concerned about the dry ends after using my previous flat iron; they appeared and felt dry.</li>
            <li> and I seriously cannot live without it!  </li>
            <li> but it died less than a year even though I didn&#x27;t use regularly.</li>
            <li> I had to cut what was left of them so short that I looked ridiculous until they grew back.</li>
            <li> and makes fast work of straightening my thick, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, I really liked this straightner.</li>
            <li> While my hair is thick and mostly straight, I have a few random sections that have developed a stubborn frizzy wave pattern that require a whip and chair to tame, especially in the humid New England summers!  </li>
            <li> This iron only lasted a little over a year before it burned out.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron heats up in less than a minute and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine already came defective because it does not get as hot as it says and it hardly straightens the hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of hair irons but been to a few black owned salons where they use different flat irons.  </li>
            <li> It takes only few seconds to reach the temp I need.</li>
            <li> I spent over $80 on a product that did not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> but it was really no info on it, but my eyes seen it all.</li>
            <li> Sedu iron as a gift a few years back after putting it on my XMAS wish list as it was allegedly the #1 flatiron.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that is naturally curly.</li>
            <li> One of the other buyers who critiqued this product (with a negative review) said the company is run out of someone&#x27;s house and that the sole customer service representative has no \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; because she&#x27;s the entire \\&quot;customer service department\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about, this iron is no better than any other flat iron (not including target or wal-mart flat irons).</li>
            <li> Just a big disappointment for such a decent amount of money spent.</li>
            <li> Sadly I didn&#x27;t attempt to return this iron in the right amount of time</li>
            <li> This is my second izunami purchase and in less than 12 months, the iron broke down.  </li>
            <li> I bought this straightener about a year and a half ago  after using cheapies for so long.</li>
            <li> There appears to be no real reason for the beeping other than to indicate that the product is turned on.</li>
            <li> Had the Izunami flat iron for less than one week, and, it longer works!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this buy, but was very disappointed when it stopped working within the first month.  </li>
            <li> If only it had blown up a little sooner I might not be out $89!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also damaged my hair very much.</li>
            <li> leaves hair extremely silky.</li>
            <li> but I know I won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m white and my hair is reddish brown, I usually have to wear products that are made for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> i only have to go over each piece no more then twice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned(I&#x27;ve owned the chi and other brands.</li>
            <li> I have a Chi iron,  Babyliss and a host of other ceramic irons.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> After looking up my warranty information for this product, I learned that not only am I past a one year warranty..</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the thing and can&#x27;t seem to live without it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to squeeze hard or use any pressure to get an even effect because a soft/smooth glide is all you need, and it doesn&#x27;t really clamp down hard if you try, anyway.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and with this flat iron I can create bouncy voluminous waves in less then 30min.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used a number of flat irons.  </li>
            <li> - fairly average thickness etc</li>
            <li> The work on real hair and fake hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Though this is a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; iron, it&#x27;s not worth the price you pay.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t even thick or overly coarse</li>
            <li> I have thick course curly red hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it does go faster with this one than my last one -</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick or coarse, but I do have A LOT OF HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> The only down-point I would say is that the dial on the handle is a little hard to turn but other than that</li>
            <li> Even so, when it arrived yesterday, I left it in the box because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed right away.  </li>
            <li> After that it started making a chirping nose after you put it down.</li>
            <li> It cools down well making this nose.</li>
            <li> God knows its hard for to lay down my new growth when I am in between relaxers but with this product it is a hassle no more!  </li>
            <li> After a disappointing sales cancellation for a cheaper flat iron, I decided to bite the bullet and go for the more expensive Izunami.  </li>
            <li> With lesser irons, my hair usually takes over an hour!  </li>
            <li> So I was a bit nervous about purchasing this flat iron since there have been some negative reviews about it, but I went ahead and bought it anyways.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant due to a few negative reviews on Amazon but, cross my fingers</li>
            <li> It used to take me about 45 minutes to flat iron my thick, medium length hair</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a flat iron that can handle my thick roots.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had at least a half dozen flat irons over the years.</li>
            <li> about half the time did not snag my hair once and got to temp in about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I can do my hair in half that time it took with my Chi.</li>
            <li> if you are looking to cut your time in half with ironing your hair, this is the iron to purchase.</li>
            <li> When you turn it on it beeps at you and less</li>
            <li> Takes less time to heat up and straighten my hair plus doesn&#x27;t get caught up in the plates.</li>
            <li> I owned the Izunami straightener for about 3 and a half weeks.  </li>
            <li> She is bi-racial and it cuts the time to straighten her hair in half.</li>
            <li> I was half way through and out of nowhere</li>
            <li> Previously owned GHD&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I agree with previous comments about the price fluctuating on these, I bought mine for 82</li>
            <li> However, less than one minute into straightening my hair, I am now getting a beep every 5 seconds or so and the heat is turning off.    </li>
            <li> so I spend less time straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> problems I&#x27;ve had with previous styling tools.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with one from Target that cost half the price and hasn&#x27;t stopped working yet.</li>
            <li> takes less time to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews it sounds like at least a few people have had this same issue.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m doing her hair, all of a sudden the flat irons just happened to work perfectly, no shortage NOTHING!!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> (I usually have to go over twice with other irons).</li>
            <li> It brings a little booklet explaining how the iron works and how to care for it.  </li>
            <li> UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE AND WANT TO BE IGNORED BY THE SELLER.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.    </li>
            <li> Now I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It turns on, and starts beeping continually after a few seconds, and it does not heat up.  </li>
            <li> After a few months they had a shortage in the cord but was still working</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months.</li>
            <li> It heats up to over 400 degrees in less than 30 seconds!  </li>
            <li> Now the wash/blow dry/flat iron process is cut in half!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser and this flat iron is even worse than a chi.</li>
            <li> If you like using a product that works fine but was intentionally designed to be as irritating as possible, buy a cargo-load of these bad boys and pass them out to your family and friends!  </li>
            <li> hmmmm makes me wonder if they offloaded a batch of bad flat irons on to random vendors and then refused to honor the warranty unless purchased at full price from their \\&quot;approved  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a temp control (i usually keep it a little below max).</li>
            <li> I used to keep my hair in a pony tail because I didn&#x27;t want to look like a crazy new mom, but now I style my hair while my baby is taking a nap and wear my hair down like I used to before I had a baby!</li>
            <li> This gets crazy hot, so if you have thin Caucasian hair, turn down the heat.  </li>
            <li> (Every once in a while the side of my finger gets pinched in the plastic-by the base so not by the hot iron parts, but I&#x27;m also typically half-asleep when I&#x27;m straightening my hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad as (a)</li>
            <li> Amazon return policy was very helpful or this would have been a bad experience.</li>
            <li> no static.</li>
            <li> IF NOT BETTER.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I have owned the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!  </li>
            <li> I use it 3-4 times a week and for no more than 20 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> For the past 2 years I used the InfraRed Chi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the chord that became dysfunctional or the iron itself.  </li>
            <li> but it turns on for no more than a minute, if that, before automatically turning off.</li>
            <li> For serious curls, I rely on a curling iron but for little curls and flips, this works well.   </li>
            <li> this is an expensive flat iron and</li>
            <li> Annoyed and disappointed that this device has only lasted a year and a half, I recently e-mailed the seller to see if they will do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you don&#x27;t use it past 300 degrees depending on your hair type of course, or if your hair is thin or if you are flat ironing in thin sections (dont know if that makes sense to the reader?).  </li>
            <li> I had a Chi and wanted to try something a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to decide to try this iron.   </li>
            <li> I should have listened to all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> ; So I bought another emergency cheapie for the time being, but it totally sucks.</li>
            <li> , so I guess it&#x27;s a fairly common problem.  </li>
            <li> and i have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Maybe for thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and at one time I did the Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> and I have medium thick wavy hair.     </li>
            <li> One glide is all that was needed, yes, even for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> and i go through flat irons like crazy.</li>
            <li> AND I MEAN 100% OF THE TIME</li>
            <li> This alarm must mean, &amp;#34; our time has come to and end!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have natural hair no chemicals and was actually disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated how rough and damaged my hair felt and looked after using it and how long it was taking for my hair to grow out</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This company is a very small company who has no idea what the word customer service means, nor do they stand behind there product.</li>
            <li> it sucks!</li>
            <li> Get this flat iron and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly on my VERY thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair and</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s your sign that they are officially broken.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet, I e-mailed the Izunami people, described the issue and asked them if the product I received was defective or if they actually designed it to be intentionally annoying.</li>
            <li> It has temperature controls so you can use as little or as much hate you need.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update...I&#x27;m so sad that its dying on me and no longer for sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> The laughable offer she gave me was to take the $89 I paid for it from this company and subtract it off of the $207 the item should have cost me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> quite sad</li>
            <li> YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear about the people whose product was faulty.</li>
            <li> Maybe I purchased a fake but either way</li>
            <li> A must for any hairdresser doing difficult straightening or keratins.</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to keep it from frizzing.</li>
            <li> They both just randomly started beeping and wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
            <li> (because I had to keep cutting it to get rid of the damage).  </li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to buy it.</li>
            <li> Everytime I turned it on, it just beeped and was ice cold.</li>
            <li> Horrible purchase wasted money.  </li>
            <li> It stopped heating up so is rather useless!</li>
            <li> There is supposed to be a one-year warranty, but it&#x27;s impossible to get in contact with anyone at the company.  </li>
            <li> so it is quite impossible to turn it off or change the temp accidentally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m notoriously bad at doing hair though.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t revolt as badly to humidity.  </li>
            <li> Too bad warranty is not covered...</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the Izunami.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> ...very disappointed that the irons no longer work.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> BUT NOOOOO BOY WAS I WRONG!!</li>
            <li> it would look like crap by mid-morning.</li>
            <li> I used to hate washing my hair until I got the Izunami.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy anything from Izunami ever again, I was appalled by their customer service and inability to provide a sustainable</li>
            <li> beware, I burnt myself badly!</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed as it was not heating up</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> ITS TERRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> What is insane is the amount of waste/packaging that the iron arrived in.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product!  </li>
            <li> I hate it!  </li>
            <li> it starts beeping like crazy and stops working?!!@@!!</li>
            <li> The shine that I get from this iron is crazy!!!</li>
            <li> It was awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these flat irons for a long time.  I was unsure about the purchase because it was such an affordable price, but it is the real deal and I absolutely love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start. This is the BEST FLAT IRON in the world. I was telling my hairdresser that she REALLY REALLY REALLY needs to invest in this product line. It&#x27;s the next best thing to the Marcels! I wish you all had where you can upload pictures. I would love to share with you the results of my hair after use. INCREDIBLE! My hair looks like GLASS....and I owe it all you you. Again Thanks so much for putting out such a WONDERFUL product. Also, I&#x27;ve posted it all over my Facebook page and I have many who have purchased and received their irons and they are SO pleased, they said, \\&quot;Thanks Lucretia, \\&quot;NO MORE FHI OR CHI for me!\\&quot; So watch out Izunami MORE orders coming, I&#x27;m really pushing this! Oh..I forgot to add that I also purchased the 1/2 inch...LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I ordered my Izunami Flat Iron on the 6th (a weds.) and received it on the 10th (monday) so I was pleased with the amount of time it took to ship it over a weekend. Now to the review. The flat iron heats up in less than a minute and works like a charm. It made my hair extremely shiny and curled it beautifully. I have a short hair cut so I thought the one inch might be to big but it worked perfetly. I highly recommend this product for the price and the quality. Thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I first seen this product about a month with a price of $71 and some change. I was about to purchase, but i waited till the next day and the Izunami flat iron was $10.00 extra. I was so disappointed. So I thought the price would go back down, so i waited, but it went UP some more. The price does go down, then it&#x27;s right back up the next day. As of 2-16-11, it was $101 and today, 2-17-11, it&#x27;s $99. My point exactly. I would love to see this product back at $71 or just at a set price.</li>
            <li> Just got mine and have used it twice. It goes over my hair so smooth and leaves it shining. I am an african-american woman and i would recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Prior to purchasing this one, I was totally in love with my FHI flat iron.  However, now I&#x27;ve  realized that this Izunami is a step above my FHI.  Totally love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing flat iron, I cant believe how fast I can iron my hair, and I have thick/frizzy/wavy hair, it literally takes me less that 10 minutes and my hair is perfectly straight and silky smooth, no static. The iron has temperature settings up to 400 degrees, i use it at about 350 and it is just excellent. I have used a CHI for many many years and though it works just great it would always leave my hair very staticy if i went for the super sleek look, so I was definitely surprised when this one (which was cheaper than a CHI as well) didnt do that. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> One of my friends purchased this iron after reading the reviews. She has permed hair so she was impressed. I have natural hair no chemicals and was actually disappointed. I have purchased a 15.00 flat iron from Walmart that works muchhhhhh better.</li>
            <li> i have been straightening my hair for about ten years now and i go through flat irons like crazy. I usually try to spend a decent amount of money on one because i don&#x27;t want to damage my hair. I would have to say this is the absolute best flat iron i have used to date. it took me about half the time did not snag my hair once and got to temp in about 10 seconds. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a flat iron. I took a risk buying a brand i have never heard of, and i am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> this product is great for straightening! leaves hair extremely silky. however, I do like to curl the ends of my hair and this product tends to leave the curled ends looking fried and split.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Although I&#x27;m having a bit of a learning curve trying to figure out the correct setting for my coarse, wiry relaxed hair.  I love the feel of the iron itself, no pulling or tugging on my hair.  It&#x27;s heats up in only seconds and the adjustable heat dial is a must...I need more heat when it&#x27;s close to relaxer time.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED IZUNAM1  FLAT IRON IN JANUARY 2011 I USED ONLY ONCE PER MONTH IT IS JUNE 2011 AND NO LONGER WORKS NO LONGER GETS HOT. TRIED TO CONTACT THE SELLER WITH NO RESPONSE. BUYER BEWARE UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE AND WANT TO BE IGNORED BY THE SELLER.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron based off reviews I saw on youtube especially Ateya&#x27;s. It made her hair look great. This iron was only average to me, it got my hair straight but I still had some frizz and puffiness. My hair isn&#x27;t even thick or overly coarse so I don&#x27;t see why I didn&#x27;t have better results. My hair is fine and relaxed. It dried my hair out, plus I had to keep going over my new growth over and over again and it still didn&#x27;t get it as straight as it should of. I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about, this iron is no better than any other flat iron (not including target or wal-mart flat irons). It also snagged my hair a bunch of times, causing more breakage! I returned it..</li>
            <li> It work perfectly. I was very worry it will damage my hair alot with using it everyday. But after I use it my hair look shiny and it last whole day!</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used a number of flat irons.  For the longest time I had a Chi which was supposed to be the end all, be all of flat irons.  I&#x27;m notoriously bad at doing hair though.  It looks best straight, but without a stylist to wield it, even the chi couldn&#x27;t make my hair look nice.  It was always lifeless or frizzy.  I always kept it back in a ponytail and gave up hope that I might ever be able to have a good hair day without paying for a blowout.  Thanks to the Izunami, those days might be over.  I bought it after reading all of the positive reviews.  Even so, when it arrived yesterday, I left it in the box because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed right away.  So this morning I washed my hair, and used my new flat iron for the first time.  And let me tell you all, the Chi has *nothing* on the Izunami.  I cannot imagine any other flat iron being better.  It glided through my hair as smoothly as silk and left my hair looking like I&#x27;d just visited the salon.  If it matters, I have light colored, fine, wavy hair.    As a bonus, the price was fabulous at 73 dollars and it arrived in only a few days.    A five star product for sure!</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair that is naturally curly so a good flat iron is a must! When I first tried this flat iron on my hair it was AMAZING. It did not tug and pull on my hair it just glided so smoothly through my hair! It created a nice shine to it and made it so smooth and soft. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great flat iron for a great price!</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disappointed in this product. I bought it in June, by September it was not working. When I turned it on, it would beep repeatedly and not heat up. The manufactor will NOT honor the warranty if it is bought through Amazon. I contacted Amazon and they agreed to refund my money. I am in the middle of processing the return. I am very pleased with the way Amazon responded and very satisfied with them.  I&#x27;ve had $30 flat irons from Wal Mart that are better than this! I would not buy this under any circumstances. ITS TERRIBLE!! Even when it worked for awhile it wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Just tried this flat iron for the first time. I am very impressed. What stopped me in my tracks was how soft and shinny my hair felt and looked. I color my hair and had become concerned about the dry ends after using my previous flat iron; they appeared and felt dry. After just one use with the Izunami, I could see a difference. My hair looks healthy! Please give it a try....you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!! It makes my hair look great. It keeps it shiny, bouncy and silky. It doesn&#x27;t burn or pull my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it. Great flat iron.</li>
            <li> hair smooth and shinny</li>
            <li> I am african american and I have shoulder-length natural hair; dry, very thick and very tightly-curl texture.  I decided a year ago to stop using relaxers and other chemicals in my hair to make it staight and soft.  The chemicals where causing a lot of damage to my hair.  Instead of using the chemicals I chose to use heat with hot combs, flat irons and curling irons.  Every heating tool that I tried using just wouldn&#x27;t get my hair straight enough, or shiny.  I ended up spending a lot of money on brand name products that I figured would get the job done but they didn&#x27;t.  So, I learned about the Izunami from a good friend of mine, who is also natural.  I saw how she used it in her hair and the way it looked after and I was amazed!  I went and ordered it for myself and I am very happy that I did.  This flat iron really heats completely to 450 degrees in literally 30 seconds! Unlike my other heating tools that took at least 2 minutes to get hot. It gets my hair straight with ONE glide, makes my hair shiny, and what amazed me the most was how silky-soft my hair was afterwards!  The only down-point I would say is that the dial on the handle is a little hard to turn but other than that I would definitely recommend this product.  It works great!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, curly, frizzy hair and this is the only product I have found that makes my hair shiny and straight.  This iron works for me even in humid weather and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look flat ironed. I have tried other, more expensive hair irons but this is definitely the best. I love that it has multiple heat settings and beeps when it is ready for use. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product so glad I was able to purchase it for the price that I did.  I would also buy from the seller again because everything they promised in their ad was true.</li>
            <li> I bought this Izunami flat iron after becoming incredibly frustrated with my crappy Remington flat iron. I hated how rough and damaged my hair felt and looked after using it and how long it was taking for my hair to grow out (because I had to keep cutting it to get rid of the damage).  I don&#x27;t have much experience with flat irons (this is my second one) but I know I won&#x27;t use any other brand. Despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this iron at 375 degrees (with only a little Jane Carter Solution Nourish and Shine as protectant), my hair feels so healthy and smooth. It&#x27;s been three months since I had my hair relaxed and cut and I have no split ends (for the first time in a LONG time) and my relaxer has lasted much better. Usually by now, I&#x27;m ready to pull my hair out but this flat iron keeps it super straight and smooth, even at the roots. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t revolt as badly to humidity.  It used to take me about 45 minutes to flat iron my thick, medium length hair and I dreaded it. Now it takes about 20 minutes and it goes by quickly because I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same piece of hair five times. The iron heats up quickly (and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready) and the heat stays consistent. For serious curls, I rely on a curling iron but for little curls and flips, this works well.   My only gripe is that I wish the flat iron had a clamp lock so the clamps would stay together when it wasn&#x27;t being used (a feature my old flat iron had). Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased with this flat iron.  Update (12/19/11) - I wanted to update to say that I&#x27;ve started using this iron for defined curls (rather than slight bends) and it does a very nice job. I have to do smaller sections of hair than I would with a curling iron but the curls can be comparable to curls from a curling iron if you bend the iron enough. Still thoroughly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really really love this flat iron! It heats up so fast and does such a good job on my thick hair. I can do my hair in half that time it took with my Chi.</li>
            <li> I searched &amp; searched for the perfect flat iron.  I have curly, fine but very thick hair. My daughters have ethnic, very curly/kinky/thick hair. We&#x27;ve had at least a half dozen flat irons over the years. All have been \\&quot;professional\\&quot; and higher end brands. But none of them work as well as the Izunami 450.  I love that it heats up in under a minute and even beeps when it&#x27;s ready.  I can set it at a lower temperature for my color treated Caucasian hair and then ramp up the temp when I&#x27;m doing my daughters&#x27; hair.  It glides so smoothly and you don&#x27;t need to put any pressure on the plates because they \\&quot;float.\\&quot;  Those other flat irons have been moved to the junk drawer and we&#x27;re keeping this one handy as our go-to flat iron.  The very cool box that it comes in says that Izunami means in-dis-pen-sible.  So, so true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been about five months, and this iron is still going strong. Thought I&#x27;d give an update because I got so many compliments on my hair this morning and it&#x27;s all because of the Izunami - it makes my hair very smooth and shiny. My younger daughter LOVES it - her very ethnic hair, with multiple textures (very curly in the back, very tight/frizzy in the front) comes out like silk. Truly amazing to watch as the hair goes through the blades. I do recommend that you use a dab of smoothing cream on damp hair before blow drying and then straightening. Helps to protect your hair from heat damage and keeps your style set - no dry flyaways.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of hair irons but been to a few black owned salons where they use different flat irons.  A lot of them pull my hair and burn my scalp but with izunami IT IS THE BEST.  I am very picky about products and styling tools on my hair so it was hard to decide to try this iron.   After research and watching Ateeya&#x27;s youtube videos(LOVE YOU GIRL THANKS FOR TAKING YOUR TIME OUT FOR YOUR VIDEOS) I PURCHASED THIS MASTERPIECE.  I let my cousin try it on her hair who is a hirstylist and more picky than me and she loved it.  She will be purchasing it as well and I will let my hairstylist know about this iron.  Hope it last because I do not want anything else.  Hair is left bouncy shiny and healthy.  You can flatten your hair straight or do loose or spiral curls.  Must HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love at first stroke!</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair, and I have A LOT of it! Though I&#x27;m white and my hair is reddish brown, I usually have to wear products that are made for ethnic hair. I have gotten my hair straight before, but not THIS straight! I set the temperature up to 400 degrees when starting with my natural curls, and 340 when I only need a touch up. Though this has been only my 3rd time using this tool, I am an absolute believer!</li>
            <li> I am currently 16 weeks post relaxer and let me tell you, this iron is definately above the rest. All I have to do is one stroke and my hair is straighten. No second, third or fourth pass through is needed with this iron, so if you are looking to cut your time in half with ironing your hair, this is the iron to purchase.</li>
            <li> heats up quickly and stays hot.  It straightens my wavy thick hair very well.  I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product. It works perfectly on my VERY thick hair.  It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and soft. Get one!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, wavy and long. It takes more than an hour to get it blow-dried. I have a nine-month old baby so I don&#x27;t have the time or the money to get my hair styled at a beauyt salon. I bought this flat iron just to TRY to learn to do my own hair, thinkikng that I would never get it nice and straight. The first time I used the Izunami Ceramic Flat Iron (1 inch) I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. It&#x27;s so easy to use, even if you&#x27;ve never done it before, you&#x27;ll get the job done. The best part is that I got it on sale for only $68 - that&#x27;s what I pay for 2 salon visits. I used to keep my hair in a pony tail because I didn&#x27;t want to look like a crazy new mom, but now I style my hair while my baby is taking a nap and wear my hair down like I used to before I had a baby! I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied by this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this flat iron makes it have so much movement without it looking flat. i only set it at 340 degrees and it was silky smooth. i will never look else where for another.</li>
            <li> i have decided to purchase a more expensive flat iron ( from a conair)after going natural for 1 1/2 years now and it does great. i only have to go over each piece no more then twice and i have really thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...I&#x27;m so sad that its dying on me and no longer for sale. It lasted 4 years and was the best flat iron I ever owned.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!  FAST DELIVERY AND WORKS WONDERS ON HAIR.....WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.  IT WARMS UP IMMEDIATELY AND LEAVES HAIR SILKY WITHOUT ANY APPARENT DAMAGE.  COMPARED TO BABYLISS THIS IS MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> After a disappointing sales cancellation for a cheaper flat iron, I decided to bite the bullet and go for the more expensive Izunami.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I was using a cheap Conair straightener from Walmart that pretty much ripped my hair out.  I have super fine, thin hair and the cheapy Conair never got hot enough to straighten it for more than half the day...it would look like crap by mid-morning. I&#x27;d have to go over each section over and over (knowing I was causing all kinds of damage).  I used the Izunami for the first time this morning...and maybe I&#x27;m just being optimistic, but I&#x27;m stunned that I only had to go over each section ONCE at about 340 degrees...not even cranked up to the highest heat setting it can go!  It&#x27;s after 12:00 pm and my hair is still straight...I&#x27;m not used to this!  YAY!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to use it on the keratin setting and see how that works!  Would highly recommend this flat iron for anyone wanting some stress free straightening!!!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron so much I ordered another one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house.  Wonderful control temperatures &amp; wonderful results.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron and I gladly would have paid twice the price for it after I saw the results!  While my hair is thick and mostly straight, I have a few random sections that have developed a stubborn frizzy wave pattern that require a whip and chair to tame, especially in the humid New England summers!  I&#x27;ve used the cheaper irons, which straighten but never seem to hold, and I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive salon flat irons (BabylissPro, Cricket), which work better but tend to make my hair look and feel dry with daily use, not to mention that the frizziness would reappear at the slightest hint of humidity.      Looking for a replacement for my Cricket, which survived over 3 years of daily use and abuse, I came across the Izunami flat iron and was impressed with all the positive reviews.   From the minute I started using it, I was hooked!  Offering a great heat range, the iron heats up super-fast and glides over hair with ease (no snagging).  I am amazed at how well it straightens in a single pass-- it takes me a fraction of the time to straighten my hair because I don&#x27;t have to keep going back over the same section again and again!  The best part is the final product- my hair looks and feels healthy, and it stays completely straight on the most humid of days!      As the company logo stamped on the flat iron declares, Izunami is truly \\&quot;in-dis-pen-sa-ble\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this flat iron because of the reviews.  I have fine fragile hair that in using this  flat iron gave me split ends and I take really  good care of my hair. Maybe for thick hair this  would work well.</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic.  I have been using cheapy ones for a long time, and decided to pay the extra for a great one.  It is worth every penny.  It comes in this fancy box, which is nice if you ever want to store it, which I won&#x27;t be.  I use it everyday.    When you turn it on it beeps at you and less than a minute later it beeps again to tell you it&#x27;s ready -- so fast!  And since it takes only seconds to heat up, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being hot enough to do a whole head of hair.  I have very long hair, so using the cheapy ones that don&#x27;t get hot enough in the first place, and then having to wait while it heats back up after I did half my hair took a long time.  This one cut my styling time down a bunch, plus it looks a lot better!  Like having a great hair day, every day!    FYI: In the package it says to make sure your hair is dry before using it, and I have attempted to style it while just slightly damp, and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> this flat iron is awesome, i just tested it out on a small section of my hair and it was amazing, i have never been able to actually curl my hair with a flat iron and this made it so easy to do. within a matter of seconds of turning it on the iron gets hot so fast. so glad i bought it</li>
            <li> Nice extra long swivel cord. Works better than the Chi, light-weight and smaller than most. Takes less time to heat up and straighten my hair plus doesn&#x27;t get caught up in the plates. Recomend this unit!</li>
            <li> Izunami is my first hair iron. It takes only few seconds to reach the temp I need. I can easily arrange my hair in couple minutes. Now I use it almost everyday. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I owned the Izunami straightener for about 3 and a half weeks.  I thought I had found the best straightener in the world.  I bragged about it to friends and my hairdresser.  It worked great and my hair was perfect in half the time of my other straighteners (I have owned many).  After about 2 weeks I noticed the straightener was no longer getting hot on one side.  I turned it up to check out if it was working and tried it on a strip of my hair.  The strip turned light and was totally burned!  In all my years of straightening my hair and all the products and appliances I have used (hair straighteners, curling irons etc.) this has never happened. I turned it on one more time just to see what it did, (not that I would have chanced burning my hair again) and it starting beeping repeatedly whatever that meant.  I returned it to Amazon today and in the future I&#x27;m going to be more careful about which straightener I use.    Update Aug 24:  Amazon processed the return quickly and returned my money.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. My sister had been using her izunami flat iron on my hair for years &amp; I finally got up the nerve to purchase my own!! I love it...</li>
            <li> It was a worked great for the first 3-4 months and then it just stopped working.  There is supposed to be a one-year warranty, but it&#x27;s impossible to get in contact with anyone at the company.  I had to go out and buy another brand new flat iron!</li>
            <li> We gave this straightener as a gift for our daughter. She  straightens her hair until it smokes, so we wanted a more professional appliance for her to use.   After reading the reviews of several products we decided to go with the Izunami, and we are glad we did.  Her hair seems less damaged, and has a beautiful sheen, and is very managable. We also made sure she has  thermal protection product to use.   We are very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thick course curly red hair and I&#x27;ve had a chi iron for the last 9 years. Both chi plates fell off after 9 years so I finally decided to get a new flat iron but I didn&#x27;t realize how inferier chi iron was till I tried my friends izunami. I thought chi was the best.  It made my hair silky and soft. So I bought one. Great deal! Arrived in a week. I used to have to flatiron every angle day with the chi and sometimes multiple times a day. Izunami last 2-3 days and takes half as long to flatiron. It&#x27;s unbelieveavle and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I used it today and I&#x27;m very happy with the results of my hair. I have very curly, coarse hair. I just had to glide this once over each section of hair and it was straight. With other flat irons I have had to glide it over each section 2 to 3 times to get it this straight. It also heats up instantly! Delivery was fast, about 4 days &amp; no cost for shipping was great!</li>
            <li> It took me years to toss my old flat iron.  I continued to use it, despite an apparent short, thinking there was nothing better or cheaper out there.  Then I saw that my hair stylist was using an Izunami.  So I searched Amazon and was delighted to find the [[ASIN:B002QHFG3Q Izunami Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch]] at a reasonable price.  It arrived promptly, and I have been delighted.  It heats up quickly.  I can select the heat level.  It stays hot.  And it does a great job!</li>
            <li> I had received the $100+ Sedu iron as a gift a few years back after putting it on my XMAS wish list as it was allegedly the #1 flatiron. Within 2 years, the iron shorted out. I had replaced the plug, but then the iron just gave out. I thought about getting another Sedu since I have course hair and liked the way it smoothed out my hair, but then came across the reviews on this product on Amazon and some beauty sites. It was priced over $200 on the Izunami website, however I was able to catch a deal on Amazon where I was able to purchase it for $70. I thought it was worth a try, since even the ones offered at retail stores are almost that much. I absolutely love the Izunami iron. It can handle my hair in one pass whereas with the Sedu took several, and leaves your hair smooth and shiney. It heats up within a minute and beeps to let you know when it has reached the desired temperature. I have had the iron for several months and am so happy I made this purchase over the Sedu. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the Izunami.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I was a bit concerned about purchasing this flat iron because of all the negative reviews. I considered what everyone had to say, did some research, and then ultimately decided to purchase anyway.  The main reason I decided to go ahead with the purchase is b/c of Amazon&#x27;s great response time and attentiveness to it&#x27;s customers. I felt confident that if anything were to happen to the iron that Amazon would take care of the issue promptly.  Now with that being said, I LOVE this flat iron. I am so happy I decided to purchase it. I have one daughter with natural hair and one with relaxed hair and it works WONDERFULLY on both hair textures. The flat iron heats up in about 40 seconds thoroughly heated and ready to use. As stated by others in reviews you only need one pass with this iron. I enjoy using this iron and so far I love it. I&#x27;m very happy that I did my research and made the purchase. I don&#x27;t have any complaints thus far about this iron.  If you are looking for a professional quality flat iron that delivers great heat and excellent smoothing, this is the iron for you.</li>
            <li> This is a good flat iron. I usually buy cheap ones and I wanted one that would hopefully last and not dry my hair out like my cheap ones. This one is good so far. It heats up so unbelievably fast! I have thick hair and it does go faster with this one than my last one - but I think maybe I should have gotten the one wider than 1\\&quot;, but I wanted the curling ability so I got this one. I haven&#x27;t even tried out the curling with this yet. Anyway, It&#x27;s good but don&#x27;t expect the best miracle flat iron ever or anything. :)</li>
            <li> Great product as other reviews have stated. While it has been just a few weeks, it heats up quickly and hair turns out smooth. Good product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> worked excellent for the first week, then one plate stopped getting hot. I had to send it back to seller, must have been refurbished but iron suppose to be a great iron.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 5 months now and I am still as excited today as I was the first day.  I have yet to find an iron that works as great as this one.  I&#x27;ve tried many different irons and none have come close to how well this one works.  In addition, there was a recent wedding in the family and many, many, members of the family had a chance to use it and all fell in love with it.  This is certainly a great buy.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one just to store away in case it goes out of stock in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, My cousin tried it and she really likes it she wants to get the same one as me.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best.  It does wonders for both procesed and non processed urban hair.  I would def recommend it to anyone.  It glides so smoothly.  You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd on of these I have owned.  It works really well, especially on my daughters hair.  She is bi-racial and it cuts the time to straighten her hair in half.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this one and I love how it smooths down my hair! I have curly with frizz hair and my hair looks like it is naturally shiney straight after using this. Do not be afraid to buy it.</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T OWNED A FLAT IRON IN FOREVER... AND I&#x27;M HAPPY I OWN THIS ONE. I&#x27;VE USED TOP OF THE LINE FLAT IRONS - SO WAS A LIL&#x27; NERVOUS PURCHASING THIS BRAND JUST BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE... BUT I CAN SAY IT&#x27;S JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER. I&#x27;VE GOT PRETTY LONG, FINE, UNALTERED HAIR (NEVER DYED) SO MY MAIN CONCERNS WERE HAIR DAMAGE AND FRIZZ / STATIC. I LIKE THAT I CAN CONTROL HOW HOT IT GETS, AND THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE MY HAIR STATIC-EEE OR TOO LIMP. OVER ALL - I&#x27;M A HAPPY CALI GIRL LIVING IN BOSTON WITH FLAT SEXY HAIR!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a year and a half ago. The flat iron was doing my hair great. It got my new growth straight as if I had a relaxed. Last week I flat ironed my hair and the iron malfunctioned. It got so hot that it burned a chunck of my hair out of my head. The house smelled like burnt hair for three days. The flat iron will not even get hot anymore. It just beeps constantly. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on Amazon.com, and after only about 15 uses it broke (after owning it for 6 months).  It turns on, and starts beeping continually after a few seconds, and it does not heat up.  I contacted Izunami, and this was their reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for choosing IZUNAMI ~ It&#x27;s Love at First Glide.&lt;br /&gt;I greatly apologize for any inconvenience. Our products are guaranteed for 1 full year, so as long as it&#x27;s purchased from our authorized distributor and not from any other unauthorized on-line sellers (such as amazon, ebay, etc.) you will be able to redeem your 1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Please send us back the Iron and we will arrange to send you a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;When returning the product please include Original Receipt &amp; Package, as well as the following information...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this product on Amazon.com, which they consider an \\&quot;unauthorized vendor\\&quot;, then your warranty is void.  DON&#x27;T DO IT!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noted that several people are having the same problem with this product, all within the last couple of months...hmmmm makes me wonder if they offloaded a batch of bad flat irons on to random vendors and then refused to honor the warranty unless purchased at full price from their \\&quot;approved  sellers\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Flat Iron on the market.  My salon uses this brand and it&#x27;s by the far the best.  High quality, gets super hot, has suspension on the ceramic tiles so it doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair.  Combine this product with Keraste Nectar and you&#x27;re doing your hair justice.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron as a Christmas gift for my 18 year old daughter.  Her review:  \\&quot;Amazing!  It&#x27;s a lot better than my Chi!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this item for Christmas for my girlfriend off her Amazon Wish List. Frankly, the product works great...EXCEPT for the fact that when it&#x27;s on--AND I MEAN 100% OF THE TIME IT&#x27;S ON--it beeps loudly in the user&#x27;s ear.  There&#x27;s no apparent way to turn the beeping off and there&#x27;s no mention made of this annoyance in the user manual. There appears to be no real reason for the beeping other than to indicate that the product is turned on. Imagine a toaster or coffeemaker or lamp or ANY other electronic appliance in your home beeping loudly simply for the heck of it just to say \\&quot;I&#x27;M ON...I&#x27;M FUNCTIONING...I&#x27;M PLUGGED IN...HELLOOOOOO HUMAN...PAY SOME ATTENTION TO ME!!!\\&quot;.  Why, for the love of God, would anyone design a product with a feature created for no other apparent reason than to annoy its users 100% of the time it&#x27;s being used?  Worse yet, I e-mailed the Izunami people, described the issue and asked them if the product I received was defective or if they actually designed it to be intentionally annoying. That was over a week ago and I&#x27;ve still received no response to date.  One of the other buyers who critiqued this product (with a negative review) said the company is run out of someone&#x27;s house and that the sole customer service representative has no \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; because she&#x27;s the entire \\&quot;customer service department\\&quot;. That may well be the case. If you like using a product that works fine but was intentionally designed to be as irritating as possible, buy a cargo-load of these bad boys and pass them out to your family and friends!  As for me, I&#x27;m contacting Amazon to tell them I&#x27;m returning the one I got for my girlfriend and that I&#x27;m looking for a product that works just as well--only one that works QUIETLY! And, to the sole Izunami customer service rep who&#x27;s sitting somewhere alone in a house all smug and snuggly and warm while ignoring my e-mail: thanks for nothing--you&#x27;ll be getting my returned product very soon.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I have owned the [[ASIN:B0010VSUI2 Turboion Rbt Turboion Croc Classic Titanium Straightener, Black, 1.5 Inch]], which broke like clockwork every 3-6 months. The only reason I kept getting it repaired is because it straightened my hair so well. Unfortunately, it also damaged my hair very much. The last time it broke I had finally had enough of the constant malfunction and damage.  I decided to try the Izunami because of its high reviews and low price... and so far, so good!! I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and used it about 3-4 times, but it works better than my Croc with barely any noticeable damage.   I can straighten my long, curly hair in ~35 minutes. With lesser irons, my hair usually takes over an hour!  Additionally, you can curl your hair with this iron, which is always a nice touch.  A GREAT iron, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair. One side is soft, and the other side tends to be more coarse. I originally wanted to get another name-brand flat iron, but as I researched, I became intrigued with the Izunami 450. It was on sale and was too good a price to pass up. I got it within days of ordering, and was immediately impressed with the packaging. The first time I used it, I was hooked. It made the smooth side of my hair smoother and softer, and the coarse side perfectly smooth. I now think the difficult side of my hair behaves better than the smoother side! I set it at 400, and it glides right through my hair and straightens in one pass. I sort of curl under a bit as I straighten, and it straightens and smooths out my hair while still leaving volume. It never looks over-ironed or flat. I actually think my hair feels healthier now than it did before. As a bonus, my new hair growth after having excessive post-partum hair loss is more concealed now. Somehow, the iron helps to blend it in so I don&#x27;t look like a gremlin. Totally impressed with this iron, the price, the shipping, and the packaging. Rave reviews here!!!</li>
            <li> I have only had this flat iron for about a week, but I LOVE IT!!!!! I have very long, curly hair.  It isn&#x27;t thick or coarse, but I do have A LOT OF HAIR!!! This is the first flat iron that I have owned that takes less than 3 glides to get my hair stick straight!  It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, it is light weight and easy to use.  It heats up to over 400 degrees in less than 30 seconds!  It is so fast and it maintains the temperature the entire time that it is being used, it is great!  I can&#x27;t praise this flat iron enough so far!  It really gets my hair straighter than I have ever had it and it stays straight until I wash my hair again, that is a first for me!</li>
            <li> This would have to be by far the BEST flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever purchased (also the most expensive). The price at Amazon is good &amp; if you catch it at the right time you can really save. I paid around $60. It heats up fast &amp; straightens to perfection! I&#x27;d recommend the Izunami to everyone. I also have the 1/2 inch and it&#x27;s just as fantastic!</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it!  It is ready to go in about 15 seconds.  I can&#x27;t believe how fast it is.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for about a month, I have used it maybe four times and so far, its working as it should. It heats up quickly, and it takes me about 30 minutes to straightened all of my mid back length mixed african american hair.     I will post another review in a couple to let you know how it holds up!    Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> After seeing Aateya&#x27;s review about this iron on youtube, I decided to buy this iron for my natural hair, so I could wear it straight when I wanted straight hair. This iron is like no other iron I&#x27;ve owned(I&#x27;ve owned the chi and other brands. This iron gets the roots straights and adds shine to the hair. Whenever I use this iron it looks like I&#x27;ve just gotten a fresh relaxer. I love this iron. It is one of the very best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron 1 inch here on Amazon from this very company. BEWARE You have a 3 week warranty if you purchase this item from this company.   I had this iron for 4 months when one morning while ironing my hair it blew up. Literally in my hair, it melted my hair on one side of my head. I had to go get 6 inches cut off my hair. Now this was not a user error, this product simply overheated and blew up while in my hair.  I sent the product, the original receipt, and the warranty card filled out to Izunami. A customer service lady called me from the company and said this iron was not covered by a warranty because I did not buy it from a authorized dealer. The laughable offer she gave me was to take the $89 I paid for it from this company and subtract it off of the $207 the item should have cost me. Yes, that was her offer to a customer who had all the original box, the original receipt, and the warranty card! Nevermind the fact that there product blew up and I had to cut my hair off...that she didn&#x27;t even care about at all!   I asked to speak to her supervisor...she said \\&quot;I don&#x27;t have one\\&quot;. I am the only customer service rep. for this company. She also said to make sure when addressing anything to there company at 83 Harbor Rd. Port Washington, New York 11050 to make sure to write Izunami at the top because this is also a residence. Here is the customer service number 516-883-7756 if you don&#x27;t believe me call for yourself!  This company is a very small company who has no idea what the word customer service means, nor do they stand behind there product. I repeatedly told this lady that this product came in a sealed new box with there warranty card....she did not care.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT she said no one on AMAZON is authorized to sell this and it will not be covered by there warranty. So you have 3 weeks to find out if this iron is not defective in any way and you can get your money back, otherwise forget it! If only it had blown up a little sooner I might not be out $89!  UPDATE! 10/05/2011  Amazon gave me a full refund of my money paid for this iron today. I think Amazon has gone over and above customer satisfaction....this faulty product should have been covered by the company that made it! Either that or on that nice little HASSLE FREE ONE YEAR WARRANTY card that comes with this iron, they need to put a disclaimer about buying it from a authorized dealer on it. My salon I go to has stopped carrying this product and I make sure to tell everyone I know about Izunami&#x27;s non warranty! THANK YOU AMAZON for paying for a faulty product from a company that needs to be put out of buisness!</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for over a year now and I seriously cannot live without it!  I love how it straightens quickly and usually you only have to straighten a section once instead of going over the same section multiple times. It also leaves my hair glossy after so I rarely have to use any shining products afterwards.</li>
            <li> I also got one for my sister who lives in Tanzania.  She loves this product just as much as i do.  I use this on a daily basis. And once a quarter i use it when i do the Keratin treatment.  LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Heats up incredibly fast. Works very well so far. It has an adjustable heat setting which is nice, though I&#x27;ve only used it on the highest one. When I went to the beauty store the man told me he recommends this one over the Chi ... though I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference; apart from the things I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have very coarse african-american natural hair 4b-c and this flat iron get my hair silky straight on the first pass. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> When I got this flat iron, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier. It was the best one I had ever used and loved how great it straightened my hair.  Fast forward 12 months and it would randomly not heat up (it would just be slightly warm) but would work again once it was turned off and restarted.  Two months later, it doesn&#x27;t heat up at all.  Thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002QHFG3Q Izunami Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my afro textured hair naturally and without chemical relaxers. Even so, I occasionally want to wear my hair straightened. I found out about this iron from the natural hair community on YouTube. I am so happy that I purchased an Izunami flat iron because it straightened my hair better than when I wore a chemical relaxer! I am also happy that I selected the 1 inch because it really works like a curling iron too! I used Argan oil as the heat protectant and my hair did not get frizzy when I walked in the Memphis snow storm! I have a flat ironed hair video my YouTube channel under \\&quot;Mid-Life Crisis\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair reverted back to its natural state with a regular shampoo and condition with no heat damage.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Izunami watching a youtube channel and I am soo glad i did.  After a good wash and condition it makes it seem like you just left the dominicans chair in a hair salon.  It leaves hair silky, straight and bouncy.  And you dont need to straighten it to the point that your hair is almost burnt.  You only need 1 maybe 2 glides and your hair is beautiful.  I only need to flat iron my hair maybe twice a week.  Loves it!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever!  straightens natural hair to where it looks relaxed  I am in love with this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that is naturally curly. I used to buy middle-of-the-line products...not cheap crappy straighteners and not expensive ones either, and they always worked \\&quot;okay\\&quot;. This is the most expensive one I&#x27;ve ever bought and it was definately worth every penny. What used to take me about 45-50 minutes to straighten now takes me about 25-30. I&#x27;ve had this product for about 4 months now and love it. (Every once in a while the side of my finger gets pinched in the plastic-by the base so not by the hot iron parts, but I&#x27;m also typically half-asleep when I&#x27;m straightening my hair...so it&#x27;s probably my own fault. But even if it was a design issue, it&#x27;s so minor it doesn&#x27;t even matter.)</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before but I&#x27;m so impressed I had to for this thing. I just received mine today and did my hair in a fraction of the time it took my old, cheap, flat irons to do. This is well worth the money and never again will I buy another inexpensive flat iron. Initially, I was iffy spending so much money, but after reading the reviews I was convinced and I&#x27;m so happy I did.     I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to save tons of time doing their hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the top brand professional straighteners out there such as the CHI and the SOLIA, however none compare to the Izunami.  I bought this because my Chi was yet again shorting out on power so I wanted to try something different.  As usual I came to Amazon to do my research and found awesome reviews of this product.  I was skeptical because with products such as this, I couldn&#x27;t be sure that the reviewers had been using the same quality products as me.  If someone is switching from a Hot Tools product to this one, of course they are going to think this one is superb.  I decided to go for it, and boy I am glad I did.  This flat iron is hands down one of the best products out there.  I didn&#x27;t catch my hair in the plates, it straightened in one swipe and styled nicely, to avoid that \\&quot;I just straightened my hair\\&quot; look that came sometimes happen at the ends of your hair.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying it at my friend&#x27;s house, I was really surprised with the shiny hair style I got from this flat iron,</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, much better than Chi.  I ordered an extra one even though the one I bought a few years ago is still going strong.</li>
            <li> The tagline on the box is \\&quot;love at first glide\\&quot; and I think that&#x27;s 100% accurate. The metal plates are high quality and after the hair is completely straightened I felt like my hair was softer than it was before. There is NO snagging of the hair which I have experienced and hated about past/cheapo flat irons I&#x27;ve had. You don&#x27;t have to squeeze hard or use any pressure to get an even effect because a soft/smooth glide is all you need, and it doesn&#x27;t really clamp down hard if you try, anyway. The only negative thing I&#x27;d say is the constant red blinking while it&#x27;s on, that&#x27;s pretty annoying, but I suppose it&#x27;s a good safety feature, also it only starts blinking once it has reached the temperature you&#x27;ve set. Overall I&#x27;m THRILLED.</li>
            <li> My hair type is 4A natural kinky/curly and I mostly wet bun or blow out and flat iron, occasionally I will wear it curly as a wash and go. When I do use heat, I prefer for it to be administered in the most efficient way to prevent any additional damage and stress to my hair. So I don&#x27;t use cheap styling appliances. I am looking for a replacement to my JRS Superstar Flat Iron, which recently died and the others are on backorder. I have used excellent flat irons in the past (T3, CHI, Sedu, Solano, GHD, FHI), never cheap or drugstore quality. and expect that over time my hair doesn&#x27;t fry, it doesn&#x27;t poof up immediately after, and it doesn&#x27;t take multiple passes to straighten my hair. This flat iron gave a smooth finish initially, but walking around the house all of my straightness and and style was lost and it began to turn to frizz. This is unacceptable for the price point of this flat iron. In my opinion,  the T3 leaves a healthier sheen and is better for your hair in the long term for a much lower cost. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit nervous about purchasing this flat iron since there have been some negative reviews about it, but I went ahead and bought it anyways. I just received my flat iron in the mail this Monday and used it immediately. It&#x27;s awesome!!! I am African American and transitioning my relax hair to natural(been on this journey for about year now)and my flat iron I have at home could not get my hair as straight because of the different texture in my hair, but this flat iron did the trick. Its straighten all the way to the roots and it&#x27;s been raining for the last 3 days and my hair still manage to remain straight. It heated up quickly and beeps when ready which is like less than a minute. So far I loving this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever, I have curly hair and usually took about 1 hour to get it all ironed, but with the Izunami I get it done in less than 25 minutes, it is so amazing!! I just love love love it...</li>
            <li> My daughter has mixed-race hair, which leaves some parts of her hair straight and shiny, and other parts frizzy, damaged looking or just extremely curly.  She recently had a medium level Keratin treatment and when we straightened her hair with our flat iron, her hair was frizzy 10 minutes after going outside.     After reading a bunch of reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with the Izunami.  Since it takes a while to straighten her hair (about two hours with drying time included) we put it off for a week.  With this flat iron, her hair was done in about an hour!  That includes the time I was drying it too.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  When she woke up the next morning, I turned the flat iron on, it heated up in about 45 seconds I think, and did about 5 minutes worth of touch up ironing and she was good to go.  We went to school and she went about her day.  When I went to pick her up, she yelled, \\&quot;Mommy!  Look!  And we even were outside today for recess!\\&quot;  Her hair had survived Florida heat and humidity (mid 80&#x27;s) and her hair was pin straight!  It is well worth the money and now I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my hair! I had considered a Chi or a Paul Mitchell, but this one is amazing and costs less.  I am seriously so impressed with this flat iron, and my daughter loves her hair.</li>
            <li> In love with this iron,!</li>
            <li> Izunami 1 inch:  In the beginnging I loved how shiny and straight it made my hair, but after only one week of regular use it started to smoke and it burned a chunk of my hair off.  The burn CUT my hair like a pair of scissors.  It did not get hot after that and it continuously beeped.  I returned it and received an immediate refund without a problem.  Before this happened it made my hair look better than spectacular for a week.  Part of me says \\&quot;the iron was a lemon reorder it and give it another try\\&quot;.  I may reorder or go with a CHI, FHI or GHD.  NOTE:  This iron has only a 30-day warranty/return period.</li>
            <li> My title says it all. The flat iron works really well. I am addicted to the thing and can&#x27;t seem to live without it in the mornings. The cord is too long but other than that it is definitely meeting my needs. What is insane is the amount of waste/packaging that the iron arrived in. It was packaged in a hefty display box with a non-recyclable molded insert, and a magneticly closable lid. That was placed inside another much larger box with a lot of padding for shipment. They could have used a much smaller box for shipment, and more sustainable packaging. It is almost 2012 after all!</li>
            <li> Iron worked perfectly for 2 weeks, even though initially it faintly smelled like burning wires. 3rd week of use I was flat ironing my clients hair and it sounded like frying water! It completely burned off my clients hair from the roots and the iron began to melt! I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HEED TO THE REVIEWS!!!!!.  Would be an awesome product if they can fix the element. I had no problem returning it. Luckily, my client was understanding. I WOULD NOT have been.</li>
            <li> Had the Izunami flat iron for less than one week, and, it longer works!  What a waste of time and money!  It does not get hot and just beeps continuously. Very disappointed with this product!  I hate it!  Amazon better give me a refund back for such a defective product!  Or, I will raise hell with them!  I should have listened to all the negative reviews.  They were all true!  I will not purchase any product made by this company ever again!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Nick Arrojo from What Not to Wear, when i heard he came out with a new flat iron i wanted it. then i saw Ateyaa&#x27;s review on youtube and a whole bunch of other but was pricey so i put it on my wish list, saved my pennies and got it on ma bday.  I prayed i wouldnt have one of the defective ones. Couldnt wait to use it on my hair and my girls, we all have 4b/c hair. I finally used it for me was great and took my daughters braids out and was so excited cos her hair was going to be swanging. took out my \\&quot;indispensible\\&quot; flat iron and whipped it into magic. I was half way through and out of nowhere it starts beeping like crazy and stops working?!!@@!! what, please say it aint so!!! we had somewhere to go so had to go get my cheapie flat iron and finish with that. Tried again and same thing happened so its basically on and off. Now its off and i am so bummed cos it really did a great job when it worked. WIll see if Amazon will give me a refund. would love to get another one and pray its not defective but if it is i have to find another brand. quite sad cos i thot i was done trying to find one that works. I hope Nick reads all the reviews cos theres a glitch somewhere in his irons that dont make it last.  So i have to give a low rating.  For those whose irons have survived i must say i am jealous.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener! It heats up incredibly fast and works a million times better than my prior one did. Losing it was the best thing that happened to me!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my order.  Arrived on time, no problem with this product, works just fine, love it.  I would definitely purchased from them in the future.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I just received my izunami 1 inch flat iron today and already used it..this iron has just worked wonders on my hair. I just LOVE it!! At first I wasn&#x27;t going to spend $200+ on a flat iron but then I saw the other reviews and said umm I would like to see if it really does work and the icing on the cake was I can purchase one for just $79.50..great buy and my head flipped..I have to get it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair so its been hard finding an iron that can really smooth out my new growth and the izunami does just that. Excellent!!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair, so it takes a while to get it straight and smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried different flat irons in the past, but none of them have ever done the job right.  I was getting a hair cut, and my beautician used this flat iron on my hair.  I, along with several women waiting to get their hair cut, were amazed at how fast and efficient this tool was!  It straightened my hair in a matter of seconds!  I had to purchase it right away, and haven&#x27;t regretted the purchase at all.  It&#x27;s really the best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. I have been looking for a flat iron that can handle my thick roots. This iron is the BUSINESS!</li>
            <li> heats extremely fast! you don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure,it just glides thru your hair. you may have to get used to it working so easily. beware, I burnt myself badly!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron to use after I had received my keratin treatment.  Anyway, I think I may have used it only 6 times before it started blinking and beeping and both irons were not heating up.  I spent over $80 on a product that did not work.</li>
            <li> Love these straighteners!!!!! Im white with long light brown hair - fairly average thickness etc, they work perfectly. One glide through each section - 5-10 mins start to finish. They heat up with in a minute.    Previously owned GHD&#x27;s and these are just as good if not better.     I agree with previous comments about the price fluctuating on these, I bought mine for 82 and today i see they are 65!!! Still a great bargain though!</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener and to my surprise and disappointment I tried to use this morning and the product was not heating up and was beeping non stop. I have only used the straightener a handful of times and it has been very gently used.  The izumani company has a one year warranty, however since this is not an authorized seller they cannot honor the warranty.  I will try to contact amazon and the seller to get a refund or exchange, and I really hope they will because they are selling defective products.</li>
            <li> Bought this item in June and thought it was great!....did a fantastic job of straightening my hair with just the right amount of heat.  However, only 4 months later it has stopped working.  It will come on and give me the telltale beep that it is heating up.  A few seconds later it gives me the double beep that it is at the right temperature.  However, less than one minute into straightening my hair, I am now getting a beep every 5 seconds or so and the heat is turning off.    It&#x27;s really too bad as (a) this is an expensive flat iron and (b) it worked great when it worked.  Now, after doing nothing different, it has managed to just die on me.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Gets Really hot and smooths even the thickest hair wonderfully!! Im able to get close to the scalp on my extra coarse clients and I can style with the floating plates vey well.</li>
            <li> I bought a flat iron from a kiosk at a mall which cost almost twice as much as this one. It did not do the job! My hair did not become smooth. I had purchased the Izunami for my daughter last Christmas and she was thrilled with it. I decided to buy myself one when the more expensive one failed to make me happy. I am so pleased with the results I feel like I just left the salon when finished with my hair!</li>
            <li> I first saw this at my Salon.  I went home and ordered it immediately as my Chi was falling apart.  This product works much better for my very thick, coarse hair.  The power cord is much better than the Chi also.  I think this product will last longer.  I was a little hesitant due to a few negative reviews on Amazon but, cross my fingers, my Izunami will function for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi and wanted to try something a little less expensive. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. There&#x27;s a temp control (i usually keep it a little below max). I generally just straighten my bangs and the front part of my hair and it works GREAT. It&#x27;s been about a year and it still works like new</li>
            <li> I have to say my beautician in Arizona (whom I would recommend - Elizabeth in Gilbert AZ who does the best hair treatments/color/cuts she is late 20&#x27;s and beautiful kind and just wonderful with all ages of her clients) introduced me to the Izunami Flat Iron. I had a CHI and I can tell you that the IZUNAMI is by far BETTER.  It is AMAZING.  It heats up within 30 seconds, cools down fast and it straightens hair fast.  I have thick wavy hair and at one time I did the Keratin treatment. However, I have not done the Keratin treatment for a year now. This iron makes your hair smooth. I would recommend this iron to every woman/man/ or person that uses a flat iron.  You won&#x27;t regret it. I have a metal iron stand holder that I place my iron in so it never damages any of my counter tops no matter where I am. Plus it is safe and secure that way.  Plus this company shipped it quickly and I had it before the timeline.  RECOMMEND RECOMMEND RECOMMEND ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE AND SHIPMENT!!! YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY. Marilyn :)&lt;br /&gt;in link with my flat iron:[[ASIN:B005NLOLLU Izunami Flat Iron Ktx450]]</li>
            <li> This is the second Izunami I bought for my wife.  She loves them both.  This one is slimmer than the previous one, but according to her, they both heat up in a flash and are excellent to use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever taken time to review a product on Amazon.  This flat iron is so good that I HAD to let people know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely curly, long, fine blonde hair.  I have spent hours in the past first blow drying my hair straight with a brush and then flat ironing it only to have it start curling back up within a few hours.  With this flat iron I am able to do a routine hair dry without having to brush it straight and then follow up with about 20 minutes of flat ironing with this product and have stick straight hair that last me several days without a retouch.  It takes only one swipe for each section and my hair is silky smooth and straight.  I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The ONLY flatiron you will ever need!  This gets crazy hot, so if you have thin Caucasian hair, turn down the heat.  Especially when you do your front pieces around your face.  I use this thing to iron clothes on a hanger when I travel and it does a great job on pillow cases.</li>
            <li> These irons are the bomb hunni! I will have these for a while! Thank you for recommending these. Ha! Lol</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Very functional, amazing price</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new flat iron for a while.  I talked to my hair styler and she recommended this one.  She said it was one of the best she had ever uses and she was totally right.  Totally worth the money and easily could sell for 2 or 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best flat irons. The work on real hair and fake hair. They work much better than your average irons. And the price is amazing</li>
            <li> Had it just over a year and it suddenly stopped working.  Just started beeping continuously.  It was used very gently.</li>
            <li> i have thick, wavy, course hair and by fair this iron has been the been the best for me!!!!!!! I have tried Chi,BaByliss and the list goes on but this one really made my hair stay straight and smooth all day!!!! My hairdresser used it on me so i got the model # and found it on amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product.  It is AWESOME!  It heats up very quickly and does a fantastic job on my hair of straightening or adding loose curls.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever. They get hot and keep your hair straight as if you had a relaxer in your.</li>
            <li> These are hands down THE BEST flat irons that you will ever purchase. I have a Chi iron,  Babyliss and a host of other ceramic irons. This iron is the best.  It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset about the Izunami. This is my second izunami purchase and in less than 12 months, the iron broke down.  I use it 3-4 times a week and for no more than 20 minutes at a time.  I&#x27;ve been trying to contact the customer service line and never once do they return your email or call.  This should be covered under the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener works super well but if I have to keep purchasing this product every 10/11 months at $70 a pop then I rather purchase another more reliable brand like the Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me! I will NEVER buy another Izunami product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Izunami 450 Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Flat Iron for over two years and I must say that I&#x27;m just as pleased with it as I was the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> I love it it works very good I have very thick and curly hair and this iron works beautifully .</li>
            <li> Heats up real fast thanks</li>
            <li> This flatiron is actually better than I thought it would be. It has temperature controls so you can use as little or as much hate you need. It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> I have always used a chi flatiron but after reading reviews for this I decided to try it. I love it! Heats up so quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li> It straighten my long curly hair fast without damage. Ordered another one for a back up. It&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> If you are on a budget and need a flat iron that is as good a as Chi, I would recommend ths flat iron. It gets close enough to your roots for you to straighten when you are stretching your relaxer. Im satisfied.</li>
            <li> This worked well for the first year I&#x27;d say and about 2 months ago, I realized that my hair was feeling very frizzy and \\&quot;big\\&quot; after using the flat iron. It felt like it was  getting \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; and not gliding through the flat iron plates smoothly. I could actually feel it pulling on my hair and I realized my hair was becoming damaged. To be sure it was my straightener and mot products or hair dryer, I replaced my shampoo/cond. and bought a new cheap blow dryer. Those were not the issue. By process of elimination, I realized that it was the flat iron causing havoc on my hair. Annoyed and disappointed that this device has only lasted a year and a half, I recently e-mailed the seller to see if they will do anything for me. I ended up buying another brand flat iron and so far am very happy with it. I will not buy another Izunami but would like some sort of compensation. Maybe i am asking too much but flat irons should have a longer shelf life than this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they just contacted me back and said there is nothing they can do. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks but so far I love it. It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever bought and one of the least expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for years now. For the past 2 years I used the InfraRed Chi. I have only been using this iron for a week, but it is far better than the Chi. Hair is smoother and end no longer get tangled. Plus, it only requires one quick movement (I usually have to go over twice with other irons). I am about to travel to the UK next week, which is why I purchased this in the first place (it is supposed to work with 110 or 220V, 50 or 60 Hz). I will update if any problems while there. So far, very pleased with the puchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome straightener! Highly recommend. It only takes me 5 mins to straighten my long hair in the morning. Surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron. I am super lucky to have crazy, coarse, frizzy kind of hair...Not! Anyway, this iron is pretty amazing. I love how straight my hair gets with this iron. I prefer the ones that you can control the temperature which is a huge plus with this one. No matter what products promise on how they can change hair like mine (deep inside you know it isn&#x27;t going to be everything it promises), but yet, you can&#x27;t help but buy it and try it anyway. For me this delivers, I only need to make to passed through my hair so I spend less time straightening my hair. Big bonus!!</li>
            <li> I was at a Janet Collection Show In New York and Celebrity Stylist Janel Sealy-Smith used this iron on a model. ONE STROKE, hair was flat and I was like WHOAH!!! WAIT A MINUTE!!! (LOL) I stopped production and said WHO MAKES THAT IRON? She said its called IZUMANI. I was like....mmm..never heard of it. So you know I googled it...but it was really no info on it, but my eyes seen it all. So I got me one, and its the best iron I have used. And I tried them all. CHI, FHI, GHD, most of all, and Izumani is the best. Now the others will flat iron and do the job but Izumani takes it to a whole other level and I love it. THANKS IZUMANI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is video on Iron [...]</li>
            <li> Money well spent! This flat iron glides through your hair perfectly. I was overjoyed with the results on natural and relaxed hair. Do not spend your money on a cheap flat iron and don&#x27;t fall for product hype. For professional results you need professional tools. Get this flat iron and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase of this flat iron. I don&#x27;t know if I necessarily think it was worth over $90 dollars but I have somewhat wavy hair and what I love about this flat iron was that it straightened my hair and made it shiny without removing the volume from my hair. My old straightener would literally flatten my hair taking out any volume I had and would result in greasy hair the next day. My hair seems much better off after using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is really awesome. i have been searching and searching for a Iron and could not find one which really could help my frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Izunami is the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist asked me to buy this and i thought i have bought so many why not try another one. But when i tried this it was different it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must Have! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Izunami. My old flat iron is used to pull my hair but this one does not. This flat iron is AMAZING it litteritly gets hot in a matter of seconds. I highly recommend this product to any and every one...its a must have. This is my first review and the only reason why i did this review because i felt like it deserved it times 20.</li>
            <li> I had a simple $20 Revlon flattening iron before and I was very disappointed as it was not heating up and my was getting caught in the plates. This one is great as you can specifically set the temperature and it heats up quite quickly. This iron can be set up to 450F. The on and off switch as as well as the temperature dial is located between the two plates so it is quite impossible to turn it off or change the temp accidentally. You can also curl your ends with this iron. One thing that still bothers me is that even with this iron my hair still frizzes up and I have medium thick wavy hair.     Overall, I would recommend this product if you can get it for the lower price. Got it for under $70.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  Keeps hair smooth for days.  Good price and very durable product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift so I haven&#x27;t used it myself, but my daughter researched them and she said this was the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite flat iron ever! It gives my Hair slip and body like no other and leaves it feeling soft and light not to mention how shiny it makes my Hair ! If you don&#x27;t have this flat iron yet then you need to get it now!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my new hair dresser and I really love it. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times, and it still works perfectly. you really only have to run it through your hair once. Also, it heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> The exact product I wanted and they were a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener about a year and a half ago  after using cheapies for so long. This thing was amazing!!!  Really straightens nicely without frying the hair. Very reliable. Just yesterday though it stopped getting hot in the middle of doing my hair. I turned it off and back on thinking it had been on for too long.. But when it came back on the &amp;#34;heat up&amp;#34; beep became a continuous alarm. No longer heats up. This alarm must mean, &amp;#34; our time has come to and end!&amp;#34; So I bought another emergency cheapie for the time being, but it totally sucks. After looking up my warranty information for this product, I learned that not only am I past a one year warranty.. BUT this product, if purchased from amazon, has a warranty that is null and void!!! But for what I paid for it, and how frequently I use thing thing (pretty much every single day).. It was a pretty great purchase. Debating on getting another one of these or opting for a chi at this point.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!! I&#x27;m sorry to hear about the people whose product was faulty. I bought my sister one in April 2012 and hers stopped working recently. However, I have had mine for two years and have NEVER had a problem. You&#x27;re going to have faulty equipment everywhere - things happen. I am half African-American and have always had problems finding the right straightener. I went into a salon and the guy used it on my hair right then. It worked after one slide down my natural hair! I paid $179.99 plus tax on the spot and it was worth every penny! A little sad that when I bought my sister&#x27;s on Amazon, it was only $100, but I still say it&#x27;s a worthy investment, considering I was spending $55 each time I wanted my hair pressed!!! You won&#x27;t regret this!</li>
            <li> happy with this purchase. goes on smoothly on hair when used, i only wish it came in 1 1/4 inch as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent article recommend, everything you say is real and Article gace what it says on the specifications, highly recommended, hope to contribute much.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this flat iron...... the ceramic plates leave my hair really soft.... i would say this is better than a CHI which i had before and for less the price....</li>
            <li> So back in 2011 I saw a youtuber using these flat irons and she was raving about how awesome and good they were. So I search on the original website but they were too much for me, so I finally decided to check on amazon and the price was right up my ally also I needed some new ones anyways also because I wanted to start doing hair professionally too. I ordered them March 5 2011 and they didn&#x27;t take long to come in the mail. I was literally EXCITED! Loved them from the first stroke, had my hair looking shiny, very beautiful.    About a year, I started doing hair professionally. My clients loved the flat irons and I highly recommended them. After a few months they had a shortage in the cord but was still working but I didn&#x27;t use them. NOW THIS IS WHERE IM PISSED OFF!!!! This year in September I was doing a clients hair, she really wanted me to use the irons because her friend told her how good they were. I warned her that they had a shortage, but she still wanted me to use them. As I&#x27;m doing her hair, all of a sudden the flat irons just happened to work perfectly, no shortage NOTHING!! BUT the light kept blinking and I thought they were hot telling me they were hot enough BUT NOOOOO BOY WAS I WRONG!! THEY COMPLETELY BLEW UP AND SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT OF THEM!! I FELT SO FREAKING EMBARRASSED! I Don&#x27;t recommend these! I wish I could get my MONEY BACK! This has NEVER happened to me before!  This is complete BULL****!! Save your money ladies and got to Numu.com Best flat irons I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> This is a great little product. I have been natural for over 3 years and I used this for the first time about a week ago and my hair looked like I had just permed it. I haven&#x27;t even had to re-flat-iron my hair since I did it the first time. I am looking forward to doing this again in the summer for the 2 weddings I am in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It&#x27;s so perfect for me. I have the thickest, curliest, frizziest hair IN THE WORLD, and somehow this amazing straightener slenderizes it down, into sleek straightened hair. it&#x27;s definiely my MUST HAVE product. :)</li>
            <li> I am SO impressed with this straightener. Usually I do quite a bit of research before buying a new straightener, but I saw this one had such good reviews here on amazon, so I just went for it. And I am NOT disappointed! It glides through my hair perfectly and it curls my hair perfectly because my hair slides through so easily. This straightener is worth every penny. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have never had a flat iron that works the way this one does. It heats up fast and it has great results. I have natural hair and it&#x27;s puffy one glide and I was sold. It was worth every penny. I would recommended it to anyone. Hands down this product is a great buy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after viewing several videos on you tube. This is the best flat iron i have ever used.. works way better than my chi.. Gets hot really quick and straightens with one or two swipes.. I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I baught this straightener and thought it was absolutely the best. It worked really well but for only 6 weeks-ugh. Everytime I turned it on, it just beeped and was ice cold. I was able to return it, but I just wanted a good, durable straightener.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightner for years now and it works perfect every time.  I use it just about every day.  Takes 5 seconds to warm up.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product to Amazon after I have used it for just on 1 year. It stopped heating up so is rather useless! I only use it  once or twice per month so about 24 times over a year. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I cant say anything bad about this flat iron. It is probably the best that I have used yet! I have thick hair and with one or two swipes it straightens my hair perfectly. And the hair has life it isn&#x27;t clumped together it moves and feels light and soft. The shine that I get from this iron is crazy!!! I love love love...I actually have before and after result pictures that I posted on a site called Hairlista.com!!!</li>
            <li> I loved, loved, loved this straightener... it was the best I have ever used... until yesterday.. I for some reason, one side would not heat, I turned it on and off and it got hot, but it did make me nervous. I couldn&#x27;t believe that when I went to use it today, no matter what I did, it would not heat up on one side. it sucks! Almost exactly one year and one month to the day and the thing broke. I paid $120 for this thing... I definitely expected it to last longer than that. I used probably 3 or 4 times a week... so if you plan on using more often than that, it probably wont even last a year.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and with this flat iron I can create bouncy voluminous waves in less then 30min.</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener and to my surprise and disappointment I tried to use this morning and the product was not heating up and was beeping non stop. I have only used the straightener a handful of times and it has been very gently used. The izumani company has a one year warranty, however since this is not an authorized seller they cannot honor the warranty. I will try to contact amazon and the seller to get a refund or exchange, and I really hope they will because they are selling defective products.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for over a year and it worked great, until it was plugged into a generator during Hurricane Iassac. Replaced it with this one, only lasted two weeks. Amazon return policy was very helpful or this would have been a bad experience. Not sure if the item was a refurbished unit or what the problem was, but not going with this brand any more.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products and styling techniques.  Nothing has given my hair such a shiny appearance with such ease!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I liked the shine &amp; quick heat but it died less than a year even though I didn&#x27;t use regularly. Too bad warranty is not covered...</li>
            <li> I used to hate washing my hair until I got the Izunami. Now the wash/blow dry/flat iron process is cut in half! My hair is long and thick so I really doubted the Izunami until I used it. One glide is all that was needed, yes, even for thick hair. It is well worth the price!! I decided to order it after I saw Ateela&#x27;s reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this particular flatiron for a while, was pleased to find it and the price was unbeatable!</li>
            <li> At first i was a bit skeptical about purchasing this product, because it seems too good to be true, but I was wrong.  This flat iron is perfection in every way.  I waited a month or so before writing a review to make sure it was perfect and it is.  It glides smoothly, heats evenly and is not hot to the touch.  I have relaxed hair and it is strong , yet gentle.  Amazon is brilliant to make such items available at such an amazing price.  It also arrived really quickly.  I am more than satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener now for roughly three months, and it&#x27;s perfect. My hair is long and naturally pretty straight, but a little wavy and frizzy. When used with the right styling products (For me, small amounts of: a heat protection spray, mousse and anti-frizz serum) and, on good hair days, without, the Izunami creates a professional looking, sleek, smooth and long-lasting hair style. It also works fantastically as a hair-curling tool; even better than a curling iron, in my opinion. My curls don&#x27;t fall flat or get frizzy, problems I&#x27;ve had with previous styling tools.  Now, because my hair isn&#x27;t the most un-manageable there, I&#x27;d also like to say that this worked just as well for a friend of mine with very long, thick, curly and frizzy hair. It was the first time she had ever had her hair straightened, and she fell in love with the look. Her hair came out smooth, pin-straight and stayed that way for the rest of the night.  All in all, I would highly recommend this straightener for all types of hair. I&#x27;ve used CHI straighteners and a number of smaller, cheaper brands and I can say with the utmost certainty that the Izunami 450 Tourmaline trumps them all.</li>
            <li> I love this iron because it straighten well, leaves hair with natural shine and its light weight. It sometimes go into sleep mode when I&#x27;m checking the in the mirror. BUt over all its good. It straights, curls, and flips but you must know how to do it before hand.</li>
            <li> This works well. I love how it heats super fast in 30 secs! I also like knowing it has a sleep mode. Just in case I forget to turn it off. The only thing is the cord twists around too much at the end where it connects to the straightener. I think it does that so the cord doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful experience with this flat iron for 5 months.  Now it&#x27;s dead.  I should have listened to the reviews when they said the company would not warrant it if bought from amazon.  When a company won&#x27;t back their product, it can&#x27;t be good.  My new one won&#x27;t be an izunami.</li>
            <li> I love this item, it heats up fast and straightens my hair perfect, I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Nice flatiron that performs very well. It has really high setting so it is good when using it on extension to get the hair in shape or curly. I&#x27;ve had for about 3 years and haven&#x27;t experience any issues with it. The cord is quite long and the end rotates making it easy to roll the iron when curling your hair. It is also pretty sturdy as I dropped it a few time. One major bonus: it heats super quickly (lest than 20-30 seconds depending on temperature)</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It glides through my hair so smoothly without burning. I would definitely recommend it.  It&#x27;s the same one my hair stylist uses.  They sell it at the salon for more then double the price.</li>
            <li> very happy with this flat iron it works great an heats upfast  the lady that does my hair uses the same one at her shop i have enjoyed it .</li>
            <li> Great straightener!  I got this based off reviews and have been pleased.  I have wavy/straight hair and use the heat setting around 350.  I like how it beeps when ready</li>
            <li> Simply said, I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It works superb for me and that&#x27;s why I love this product. My hairdresser uses it so that&#x27;s how I found out about it</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. It is very easy to use and I love the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend this one over anything on the market.</li>
            <li> Had one and as very pleased with it so I purchased this second one for my daughter who is going off to college in September.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what all the hype is about on this particular flat iron. I dropped almost $200 on it at a store. I wanted to upgrade from my cheapo $25 flat iron. While it does heat up in less than 20 seconds, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything else that I would consider amazing... I have thick curly caucasian hair. This iron did shorten my ironing time, but even with a leave in heat protector, my hair was left very staticy. It looked like I had stuck my finger in a light socket or had my hands on one of those \\&quot;plasma balls.\\&quot; I will be returning this product and trying something else.</li>
            <li> The Izunami 450 is fantastic! I have naturally curly hair and just recently got a keratin treatment. With this flat iron, my hair looks like it&#x27;s been straight all my life! It&#x27;s so easy to use and makes straightening my hair very quick and easy.  I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I was managing a salon 2 1/2 to 3 years ago when this product first came out. When I saw the demonstration I was blown away!! Flat hair after the first pass...impossible!! I had to have it and I have loved it ever since. I would recommend this flat iron to anyone. The only thing I would warn you about is if you bleach your hair or change colors alot make sure you deep condition often bc this iron is powerful and can damage your hair if you don&#x27;t take care of your hair. Which is not the products fault it is not being educated on what to do to keep your hair healthy. I have seen it hundreds of time people blame the product when it is human error!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this flat iron when my current one died. The iron heats so quickly (and beeps when heated within what seems to be one minutes!) and makes fast work of straightening my thick, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the iron and was using it regularly with great luck. Then one day it just quit working. The light would flash and the heating up beep would happen but the plates would not get hot. I tried to call the company, who told me not only will they not work with me to get it repaired but they also do not offer repairs and do not have anyone who knows how to repair the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked more questions about what they do with the item and essentially they give you a new one and throw away the old ones. The straighteners are so cheap even the company doesnt want to deal with getting them fixed. I will NEVER buy anything from Izunami ever again, I was appalled by their customer service and inability to provide a sustainable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would deter everybody from making this purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron along with the short styler.  Not too good with the flat iron yet, but I&#x27;m practicing.</li>
            <li> This is a good flat iron. I&#x27;m African American and it get my hair straight usually in one glide. Try it.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used, especially for the price. My hair looks great, and only takes me about fifteen minutes. That&amp;#34;s huge because I have super long, super thick, super curly hair and older flat irons used to take me an hour plus. This iron heats up fast, like 30 seconds, and offers ultra low to intensively high heat choices, and the plates slide effortlessly over your hair. Best amazon buy this year for me, easy.</li>
            <li> This was a great flat iron for the first 3 months I had it. After that it started making a chirping nose after you put it down. It cools down well making this nose. You then have to turn it off and back on to get it to heat up.</li>
            <li> Love love love this flat iron..I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  I pass through and my hair is bone straight. Cleans easily with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this buy, but was very disappointed when it stopped working within the first month.  Horrible purchase wasted money.  I replaced it with one from Target that cost half the price and hasn&#x27;t stopped working yet.</li>
            <li> What took me so long to buy this professional grade Flat Iron?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life my hair does not react and frizz up in Summer Heat and Humidity after I spend time drying and ironing  it straight..&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t believe it so far. I was actually out on a boat in New York Harbour after a thunderstorm last week and my hair did not react.&lt;br /&gt; I also use Morroccan oil when the hair is damp before the ironing.</li>
            <li> Still using this product without any problems.  I do not use every day or even every week but I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> now almost a year since i bought Izunami Ionic Ceramic, and I can not go any where with out it, i have three iron with high prices, yet this one is so far excellent, i have a dry fine hair, when i use it instantly it smoothes and shines the hair, it is much quicker than a conventional blow dryers with amazing results.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> The primary reason I bought this flat iron was for the \\&quot;sleep\\&quot; function but much to my disappointment it is an error in the Amazon description.  I have contacted the seller and they confirmed it.  I will need to return this item.</li>
            <li> This iron only lasted a little over a year before it burned out.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the chord that became dysfunctional or the iron itself.  The iron worked very well on my hair while it worked.  Much better iron than CHIs.  But, now when I turn on the Izunami iron, it just beeps and does not get hot.  I bought the 1/2 inch Izunami as well and the same thing happened to it.  Maybe I purchased a fake but either way...very disappointed that the irons no longer work.</li>
            <li> I tried my friends izunami and bought myself one the next day.  Completely love it.  I use it to straighten/smooth hair roots and then twist it to get perfect flowing curls Ive never achieved with a curler.  Straigtened once and it did it quickly, but typically I use it to curl.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy overall.</li>
            <li> Did not get to try it as it did not have the sleep function as described. This was a must feature and it fell short. Amazon has a great return program.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron! Great quality!</li>
            <li> Bought this straightner in the beginning of September for my daughter.  We had previously owned a Izunmani Straightner for years and loved it.  However, by October 11th this one no longer worked. It beeps constantly and one of the plates does not get hot.</li>
            <li> Though I only had the Izunami Flat Iron for about a week (Knock on wood, Don&#x27;t wanna jinx it) I must say that I am in love with this iron so far. It is literally a ONE HITTER QUITTER! All it take is one glide to get smooth, silky, and shiny hair.  God knows its hard for to lay down my new growth when I am in between relaxers but with this product it is a hassle no more!  As soon as I got it, I was immediately impressed with the packaging.  It brings a little booklet explaining how the iron works and how to care for it.  After thoroughly reading the manual, i decided to give it a try.  It literally heats up in a matter of 30 seconds...30 SECONDS!  It only took one glide for the izunami to smooth out my new growth-just one! After I was done, my hair was smooth and silky. I MOST DEFINITELY recommend this product.  I know it may be a little to early to write a review, but I just wanted to express and share my joy with this Flat iron to the Amazon community. Should there be any changes i will be sure to come back and update my review but hopefully i won&#x27;t have any mishaps with this product (Knock on wood).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ok so it is now october 2012 and I am STILL in LOVE with my IZUNAMI FLAT IRON!!!  It still works great.  I would recommend that you don&#x27;t use it past 300 degrees depending on your hair type of course, or if your hair is thin or if you are flat ironing in thin sections (dont know if that makes sense to the reader?).  Because even at 270 degrees it gets VERY hot. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my iron (Thank GOD). over all, I would still recommend this product. I would 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Purchased this iron 4 years ago and I LOVE IT!  A must for any hairdresser doing difficult straightening or keratins.</li>
            <li> I Love it, I recommend it to curly haired ladies!!!! It leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth, and best of all doesn&#x27;t pull and pinch your hair !</li>
            <li> Amazing irons have had them a few years couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li> My friend had this hair straightener and I loved it! I got one of my own and it was really great. My hair had never gotten so straight with a CHI or any other flat iron. I could also do curls and waves. I always got compliments and told my friends how it was the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. After about 6 months of using the product 2-3 times a week, it stopped working. It would turn on and off constantly and would beep nonstop (from turning on and off once every second). Izumani would not replace the product because it was not purchased from them! I never dropped the product or misused it, in which case I would have known it was my fault. I still have this flat iron and occasionally try to use it but it turns on for no more than a minute, if that, before automatically turning off. I think its just an issue with my straightener, because my friend has had hers for 2 years and is still using it with no problems. I&#x27;m debating whether or not I should give this product another shot, or whether I should purchase from another store, because I will be really bummed if the same thing happens, but it was the best while it worked!</li>
            <li> Sadly I didn&#x27;t attempt to return this iron in the right amount of time so I&#x27;m stuck with a $200 purchase basically. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this brand so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Izunami but perhaps the seller. As some stated, it started out great the first few uses then suddenly it wasn&#x27;t getting hot anymore. It seems to work intermittently because if I don&#x27;t use it for awhile I get the same results; works well for a few days and then it stops getting hot. The light will be lit which I thought meant it was ready, but it clearly isn&#x27;t warm enough or working. Just a big disappointment for such a decent amount of money spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months. It heats up quickly and straightens well. It&#x27;s comfortable to use. However this iron has caused major breakage with my hair. My hair dresser even noticed. I use protecting serum and it made no difference. Now I have to shop for a new one!!</li>
            <li> love this straightener. i was a Chi person until i was introduced to this. amazing!!!! takes less time to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!! I heats up quicker than any flat iron i have ever had. It works great so far. So as of right now i give it 5 stars. If i have problems with with it in a few weeks like some have had, i will write another review but for now it&#x27;s just GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> Though this is a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; iron, it&#x27;s not worth the price you pay. It doesn&#x27;t track very well on your hair piece so it is difficult to keep it from frizzing. Also, it takes multiple passes to get hair straight. Much prefer my old CHI one, will never buy another of this brand.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these irons in the last three years.  The first one broke within the one year warranty so it was replaced by the salon I purchased it through.  The second iron broke yesterday, and I had it for two years.  While I&#x27;m happy it lasted two years, I guess I&#x27;m concerned that both irons seemed to break in the same way.  They both just randomly started beeping and wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  That&#x27;s your sign that they are officially broken.  I saw other reviews saying the same thing, so I guess it&#x27;s a fairly common problem.  Buyer beware.  Great iron, but doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser and this flat iron is even worse than a chi. I&#x27;m not sure if mine already came defective because it does not get as hot as it says and it hardly straightens the hair. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair tools. Paul Mitchell puts out some good tools, but this is  one of the best flat irons i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love at first pass!!! These are great flat irons, I&#x27;ll always own a pair.. Seller was great and shipping was fast..</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for my hair. I had it for more than 2 years, and I can not complain. I use argan oil on my hair before using this flat iron, and my hair doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because my hairdresser reccommened it to me as a great product to straighten my hair. I have had it for over 1 year and it is just as good as the day I bought it!</li>
            <li> First received the benefits of this flat iron when my hair stylist used it on me in the salon.  Got my hair STRAIGHT without causing any problems, so I decided to purchase it myself. I LOVE it. You set it to the temperature you&#x27;d like, unlike others I&#x27;d previously purchased or had given to me as a gift which were much more in price. Very good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Had this iron for not even 6 months when it shorted out and burned off my bangs! It was awful! I had to cut what was left of them so short that I looked ridiculous until they grew back. Prior to it shorting out, it would get too hot. I should have returned it immediately..</li>
            <li> This is the best iron ever! I have tried CHI, and others that claim to be the best. This iron is second to none. I have never had hair so straight. I have really thick curly hair and this iron makes my hair very straight and silky. Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve done the Japanese straightening. I have recommended this iron to all my friends who want straight hair.  I love this iron. Well done Izunami.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO bummed that my Izunami stopped working this morning after only 3 months, I just get a constant beeping &amp; no heat.  I called Izumani and they said \\&quot;yup...it sounds broken\\&quot; and that they could not do anything, that I would need to contact the original seller on Amazon.  After reading some reviews it sounds like at least a few people have had this same issue.  Very disappointing, I really liked this straightner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after using one of those cheap pharmacy brands, that say professional - but definitely aren&#x27;t.  I have been using this flat iron on my hair every day since receiving it.  My hair comes out shiny, not damaged and it takes me 10 minutes to do my hair, much quicker.  I love the fact that no matter what temp you set it at, it doesn&#x27;t get hotter, it remains at selected the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend, I wish it had an automatic shut off, but other than that no complaints - a great deal from amazon!</li>
            <li> One if the best flat irons on the market!!! This is my 2nd time purchasing this iron.</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying this flat iron then you don&#x27;t need to think twice. I have used 20 different flat irons. This is by far the best and is better than one that I paid 160$ for.</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up in seconds!</li>
            <li> I am in love with my new Flat Iron... It works just perfect and your hair looks so soft and shine...</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great for thick, coarse hair. Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Curls come out really nice...also great for getting your hair really straight :-)</li>
            <li> WOW WOW great product.  Works great no issues. Everyone should have one. It heats fast and does an amazing job of straighting hair.</li>
