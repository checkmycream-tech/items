            <li> i like this no lift nails primer. its the only one i use to do my nails. thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> My nails still come off!  But they do stay on longer then before!</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s so much better than my previous IBD bonder/primer.  Dries quickly and NO LIFTING with my hard gel nais.  AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> Good product, five stars indeed</li>
            <li> I expected it to be stickier to adhere to my UV gel I use at home. I have the sensationail system and do them myself. The smell is pretty nasty but I think it&#x27;s worked pretty good. I&#x27;ve only tried it once and my gel is lasting.</li>
            <li> This product did not prevent lifting for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I used this product each time I did my nails.  I now have found that my nails take much longer to lift if they do at all, without using this product.  Also, the odor is really offensive.  I tried storing it in plastic and I could still smell it.  It was very difficult to work with because of the strong odor.</li>
            <li> Great product really works! I will order it again and again! It lifts a bit but after 2 weeks! Brenda</li>
            <li> Nail stayed on much longer. Impressed with the product.</li>

            <li> Shipped and recieved in good time, used it on two sets of nails so far and both had lifting, but could just be the acrylic I bought too. Overall good product</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work like i thought it would i put this product on one hand and the other nothing.. the hand with the product one it the nail wanted it lift and the hand without the product stayed on down and no lifting</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Love it just Burns a little sometimes</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m a Licensed cosmetologist who does nails here and there for clients of mine. This stuff really keeps my clients nails from lifting.unlike other brands that haven&#x27;t worked for me I can honestly say my clients are so excited I&#x27;ve started using this product. A must use in order to ensure your creative talent is wearable and long lasting on your loyal clients.</li>

            <li> About damn time I found something that keeps my gel from lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else worked.  I was a little put off by the price but the bottle is a lot bigger than expected, so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with order</li>
