    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and it works great!</li>
            <li>it is OUTSTANDING!!!</li>
            <li>However, I must say this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It comes with - floss heads (20) beautifully packed, sulcus tips (2), gum stimulator (1) and off course brush (2+1)     Pros-    </li>
            <li>It is great that they included them in this.</li>
            <li>- Price    Cons-     - Floss did not work, ( the design I thought is great)</li>
            <li>Great toothrbush with lots of extras at a great price.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>looks great however, batteries were leaking and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For now it&#x27;s in my top five best buys of the year.</li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH IT!!!!</li>
            <li>Once again, I ordered this product as it provides the needed aspects of good oral health care.</li>
            <li>Loved the brush, but have had three stop working.</li>
            <li>, it is that good.</li>
            <li>i would buy the amazon product plackers right angle flossers, they are excellent.</li>
            <li>The package came with too many added features I will not use!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I just used this toothbrush for the first time and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>nice, all in one package</li>
            <li>Okay, I just finsihed using this power toothbrush for the first time and just had to get on and tell EVERYONE how great of value this is!</li>
            <li>Also dentist recommended diamond or arrow design heads are more effective.</li>
            <li>It is more like an education for people on what all can be used to maintain their teeth.    </li>
            <li>For $7 I get everything I need and more.</li>
            <li>The pointy brush attachments really does a great job.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t have many points of reference to compare BrushPoint electric toothbrush to.</li>
            <li>But hey, at this value I will call it even glad if this lasts six months</li>
            <li>, my favorite over the years has been crest spin brush pro.</li>
            <li>i felt it cleaned better than all the ones i tried -- until now.</li>
            <li>Plus, the extra attachments are great!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt this clean from brushing them on my own, my teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>the brush itself is very good, it is as good if not better than spinbrush pro original.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for about a month, then just stopped.  </li>
            <li>it is not made of smooth rubber...</li>
            <li>- Cheap cheap quality,     </li>
            <li>I figured that because all this came for so cheap that it would actually be a cheap product</li>
            <li>I got this for $7.50 at Walmart, and it seemed like a great deal until I actually tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>The body is almost identical and all the accessories fit it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth so much more than the cost</li>
            <li>and so far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>it had sat in a drawer in the original packing for a couple of years with batteries in place and had corroded...</li>
            <li>the first one worked great, the on/off was a sliding kind - up for on, down for off.</li>
            <li>you know that dentist clean feel afteryou get a cleaning, that is what this attachment feels like.</li>
            <li>Great product each and every penny is well spent on this product .</li>
            <li>the company was good enough to replace it.</li>
            <li>Have bought two of these and was pretty impressed with both products I&#x27;ve had the same result that once the battery dies it wont even turn on with the new batteries.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my spinbrush and batteries used up quickly.</li>
            <li>Got this based on positive reviews, and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>(they are cheap too, but very well made):)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Plackers Right Angle, 75 ea]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>placed new batteries in  it---still nothing BUT easy refund and didn&#x27;t have to return it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i tried using the flossers and i think if you have wide spaced teeth, it will work good, but i have close teeth, (but not overlapped or anything), and the floss broke on the first tooth i tried to floss, so i have to give an F rating for the floss part of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i found this Brushpoint Vital Health in walmart, not amazon, but i love amazon and their product reviews are very helpful, so i wanted to share my experience</li>
            <li>-Brush is really soft, motor is not too rough, not too smooth, better than other brands which I feel like I am running hair drying in my mouth and 2 of them is really great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely powerful yet gentle and provides a genuine \\&quot;clean mouth\\&quot; sensation that before now only a dentist could provide.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll last even longer than the heads and in that case I&#x27;m glad to see I can order replacements at this web site:</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has performed exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The jostling movement of hitting the counter top sometimes turns it back on.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are very clean after using this toothbrush and if it lasts as long as the three brush heads it will be well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, the MAIN draw for me on this particular toothbrush is the 2 tiny bristle attachments, they are narrow and pointy, and when you use that attachment, and go inbetween your teeth near your gum line, i swear it is the best cleaning i ever had besides the dentist.</li>
            <li>but it works great and makes no more noise than toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past for way more money.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my gums and ceramic braces really well.</li>
            <li>- the default speed seems too much, I suppose I&#x27;ll get used to it.     </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the durability since I have it just for a week.</li>
            <li>it wont fit with this toothbrush obviously, but the design of these flossers keeps you from needing an attachment</li>
            <li>well... I think 4 stars is totally for coming up with such a nice product including all the accessories, and making people know what to use.</li>
            <li>- Sulcus tips are great, they actually work, not many people even know that they exists and to use them.</li>
            <li>The brushes spin very quickly, and when the batteries wear down they are easy to replace with standard sized batteries (AAA I think).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but that is normal in electronic toothbrushes nowadays.</li>
            <li>As a frequent traveler, I find that it is easier to use the model with batteries than having to charge, because for one thing, I might forget the charger ( there are many in the lost and found) and the battery one is lighter and less comber some.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d buy a toothbrush online, but with a new baby at home, online shopping has been a savior.  </li>
            <li>I do not believe the brushes stopped working when the batteries died and then would not work with new batteries.</li>
            <li>That is why new batteries will not get the brush to work.</li>
            <li>Now it won&#x27;t charge even with the brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>i changed the batteries, etc, so i threw it away and ventured out for a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(there are two extra brushes, so if the motor doesn&#x27;t die this set should be good for at least 18 months).</li>
            <li>Stsyem\\&quot; is that after using it once, you&#x27;ll never be able to settle for an ordinary toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>plus this tiny attachment is great for your far back, hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Only the top part of the toothbrush spins instead of the bottom moving up and down also</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery; a week earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>The old generic electric toothbrushes that Walmart used to carry were much stronger and never stopped working.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s a pretty minor thing.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the brushes just stop working and that if you test the batteries with a volt meter, you will find that the batteries are not dead.</li>
            <li>like i say, if you use the tiny bristle attachments pictured right next to it, you dont need to use that in my opinion.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; but the ordinary brush is good and cheaper to use,no battery to pack up in one and a half years.</li>
            <li>Aside from the usual brushing of the teeth, this brush enables me to reach those molars that are in the furthermost corners of my mouth and to adequately clean the area where teeth enter the gums.</li>
            <li>Only con to the \\&quot;Brushpoint Vital Heath Power Oral Care</li>
            <li>Put in a different set of new batteries and it was the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Got a new generic electric toothbrush at Walmart and discovered that it&#x27;s probably made by the same company.  </li>
            <li>i have used several battery operated toothbrushes over the past 10 years, and even bought a rechargeable sonicare (did not like, didnt feel like it made contact with my teeth because of the vibrations, didnt feel like the dentists buffer thing that they clean with)</li>
            <li>I saw it in my local Dollar General store for $7.50.  </li>
            <li>Within the first few months battery died.</li>
            <li>it is so hard to get inbetween the teeth and jawbone back there because of the tightness, you just can barely clean back there, but with this tiny one, i can!</li>
            <li>No complaints other than the fact that the off button is very sensitive so while I am using it if my finger just briefly hovers over it the toothbrush turns off so now</li>

            <li> /&gt;anyway, sorry this is so drawn out, but for those of you that want detailed info, i included everything i could think of to</li>
            <li> It finally loosened up after much forcing it round and round.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s some other attachment piece that you can use that is also included, it looks red in the pic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product. The moment I saw it in Walmart, I was like... nice, all in one package, so thought, let me try...    It comes with - floss heads (20) beautifully packed, sulcus tips (2), gum stimulator (1) and off course brush (2+1)     Pros-    -Brush is really soft, motor is not too rough, not too smooth, better than other brands which I feel like I am running hair drying in my mouth and 2 of them is really great you don&#x27;t need to go around any where for 9 - 12 months.    - Sulcus tips are great, they actually work, not many people even know that they exists and to use them. It is great that they included them in this. It is more like an education for people on what all can be used to maintain their teeth.    - included batteries.    -accessories    - ease of replacing power arms, and accessories.    - Price    Cons-     - Floss did not work, ( the design I thought is great) but sorry it did not work for me or my wife and our regular floss worked.    - gum stimulator actually hurts.. it did... it hurt my gum and the hinge hurt my lip.  i am not exaggerating. it is not made of smooth rubber... it is made of sort of plastic... that&#x27;s a total design flaw. I don&#x27;t think the one who designed brush, designed the gum stimulator.    - Cheap cheap quality,     Summary- If 2 of the 4 products they included did not work... why did I still gave 4 stars. well... I think 4 stars is totally for coming up with such a nice product including all the accessories, and making people know what to use. probably in future if the manufacturers are reading this, hope they will make necessary changes.</li>
            <li> I figured that because all this came for so cheap that it would actually be a cheap product but it works just as well as any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve bought. It is around the same quality too. Only the top part of the toothbrush spins instead of the bottom moving up and down also but that is normal in electronic toothbrushes nowadays. No complaints other than the fact that the off button is very sensitive so while I am using it if my finger just briefly hovers over it the toothbrush turns off so now I just hold it differently.</li>
            <li> Great product each and every penny is well spent on this product . I am sad to see that it is more expensive here compare to walmart . This will last you at least 1 year because it comes with 3 replacement heads</li>
            <li> Once again, I ordered this product as it provides the needed aspects of good oral health care.</li>
            <li> For $7 I get everything I need and more. The pointy brush attachments really does a great job. I bought one for each member of my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a week and so far I am very satisfied.  I saw it in my local Dollar General store for $7.50.  The low price, that it uses AA batteries  for which I have a recharging system, and came with three brush heads made it an irresistible impulse buy.  I worried that, for the price, it would be overly loud or annoying in some other way but it works great and makes no more noise than toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past for way more money.  I feel like my teeth are very clean after using this toothbrush and if it lasts as long as the three brush heads it will be well worth the cost.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll last even longer than the heads and in that case I&#x27;m glad to see I can order replacements at this web site: [...]  If it breaks down too soon I&#x27;ll come back and revise my review.  For now it&#x27;s in my top five best buys of the year.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has performed exactly as advertised.  The brushes spin very quickly, and when the batteries wear down they are easy to replace with standard sized batteries (AAA I think).  My only slight complaint is that when you push the off button, the brush sometimes doesn&#x27;t stay off.  In other words, if you aren&#x27;t careful, the brush turns back on when you put it down.  The jostling movement of hitting the counter top sometimes turns it back on.  You just have to remember to press the off button firmly.  But, that&#x27;s a pretty minor thing.  Overall, for the price, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d buy a toothbrush online, but with a new baby at home, online shopping has been a savior.  Got this based on positive reviews, and was not disappointed.  Great toothrbush with lots of extras at a great price.</li>
            <li> Loved the brush, but have had three stop working. I do not believe the brushes stopped working when the batteries died and then would not work with new batteries. I have found that the brushes just stop working and that if you test the batteries with a volt meter, you will find that the batteries are not dead. That is why new batteries will not get the brush to work.</li>
            <li> I admit, I haven&#x27;t ever used one of them expensive electric toothbrushes. So, I don&#x27;t have many points of reference to compare BrushPoint electric toothbrush to. However, I must say this is a very good product. Cleans my gums and ceramic braces really well. I wish there was a switch to decrease RPM - the default speed seems too much, I suppose I&#x27;ll get used to it.     I can&#x27;t say much about the durability since I have it just for a week. But hey, at this value I will call it even glad if this lasts six months (there are two extra brushes, so if the motor doesn&#x27;t die this set should be good for at least 18 months).</li>
            <li> This is not the product I wanted...I just wanted the round rotating tooth brush of the same brand..This model is too big and not the same item I had purchased initially...I found the one I wanted at Wallgreens in Vegas for ten dollars and it works great! As a frequent traveler, I find that it is easier to use the model with batteries than having to charge, because for one thing, I might forget the charger ( there are many in the lost and found) and the battery one is lighter and less comber some.The package came with too many added features I will not use! I want to minimize things in my life! There is too much waste in our lifestyles!</li>
            <li> no, i did not like got credit for product because it uses batteries , so, bought another prodct which i can recharge as needed.</li>
            <li> I got this for $7.50 at Walmart, and it seemed like a great deal until I actually tried to use it.  Just a small amount of pressure against the brush will stop it from moving.  Put in a different set of new batteries and it was the same thing.  I&#x27;ll definitely avoid this brand in the future.  Update:  Got a new generic electric toothbrush at Walmart and discovered that it&#x27;s probably made by the same company.  The body is almost identical and all the accessories fit it.  It worked fine for about a month, then just stopped.  Taking it apart, I found that the part of the motor that&#x27;s supposed to turn, didn&#x27;t want to turn.  It finally loosened up after much forcing it round and round.  The old generic electric toothbrushes that Walmart used to carry were much stronger and never stopped working.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I&#x27;ve been using the same one for 2 years now!.....Of course I change out the brush head every week or so. Lol. Just buy some rechargeable batteries and yours will last just as long as mine.</li>
            <li> Okay, I just finsihed using this power toothbrush for the first time and just had to get on and tell EVERYONE how great of value this is! It&#x27;s worth so much more than the cost and I&#x27;m definitely stocking up! It&#x27;s extremely powerful yet gentle and provides a genuine \\&quot;clean mouth\\&quot; sensation that before now only a dentist could provide. Only con to the \\&quot;Brushpoint Vital Heath Power Oral Care Stsyem\\&quot; is that after using it once, you&#x27;ll never be able to settle for an ordinary toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> total waste of money. never worked. looks great however, batteries were leaking and wouldn&#x27;t work. placed new batteries in  it---still nothing BUT easy refund and didn&#x27;t have to return it.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery; a week earlier than expected.  Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have bought two of these and was pretty impressed with both products I&#x27;ve had the same result that once the battery dies it wont even turn on with the new batteries. Happened to both of the toothbrushes. Looked online and seems like a lot of others have had the same issue.</li>
            <li> Aside from the usual brushing of the teeth, this brush enables me to reach those molars that are in the furthermost corners of my mouth and to adequately clean the area where teeth enter the gums. In the past, these areas were ones in which tartar accumulated and caused uncomfortable probing by the dental hygenists. Today? Cleaning is a breeze!!</li>
            <li> Within the first few months battery died. Now it won&#x27;t charge even with the brand new batteries. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i have used several battery operated toothbrushes over the past 10 years, and even bought a rechargeable sonicare (did not like, didnt feel like it made contact with my teeth because of the vibrations, didnt feel like the dentists buffer thing that they clean with), my favorite over the years has been crest spin brush pro. i felt it cleaned better than all the ones i tried -- until now. i felt that the spinbrush pro&#x27;s quality has decreased A LOT over the years. the first one worked great, the on/off was a sliding kind - up for on, down for off. the ones they made recently where it just has a button to press, i dont like it. i dont know if it shorted out, or what, but after using that brand/type of toothbrush, and having them last 3 years, i know how to use it, how to treat it, not abuse it, etc, and after 6 months of owning this last one, the thing wont turn on. i changed the batteries, etc, so i threw it away and ventured out for a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found this Brushpoint Vital Health in walmart, not amazon, but i love amazon and their product reviews are very helpful, so i wanted to share my experience here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first the brush itself is very good, it is as good if not better than spinbrush pro original. it does have the push button on/off rather than the sliding on/off, so i am hoping that it doesnt short out like the spinbrush pro did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you also get several brush refills. in the walmart one, it has the dual head attachment (the 2 directional one that spins around, and also has the one that goes back and forth), just like pictured here on theamazon one. but the walmart has 2 additional heads with ONLY the round part, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the MAIN draw for me on this particular toothbrush is the 2 tiny bristle attachments, they are narrow and pointy, and when you use that attachment, and go inbetween your teeth near your gum line, i swear it is the best cleaning i ever had besides the dentist. you know that dentist clean feel afteryou get a cleaning, that is what this attachment feels like. it is OUTSTANDING!!! i&#x27;m going to buy every member of my family one of these, FOR THIS ATTACHMENT ALONE IT IS WORTH IT!!!! it feels as if you&#x27;ve flossed even if you havent, it is that good. plus this tiny attachment is great for your far back, hard to reach places. i have my wisdom teeth still (all 4 of them), and it is so hard to get inbetween the teeth and jawbone back there because of the tightness, you just can barely clean back there, but with this tiny one, i can! i used that attachment and went all the way around the inside/outside of the gum line on each and every one of my teeth, and i almost feel like i dont even need to go to the dentist for a cleaning anymore!!! i guess i&#x27;ll see what they say when i go, i know they will say \\&quot; what have you done differently?!?!??!!? \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, sorry this is so drawn out, but for those of you that want detailed info, i included everything i could think of to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. i dont know if i&#x27;m allowed to say this, so if it gets deleted, i tried.&lt;br /&gt;the set i bought at walmart was $7.50 for the regular battery operated, with 2 multiheads (2directional), 2 round heads, and 2 of those pointy ones that i LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;it also comes with a flossing attachment with floss refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried using the flossers and i think if you have wide spaced teeth, it will work good, but i have close teeth, (but not overlapped or anything), and the floss broke on the first tooth i tried to floss, so i have to give an F rating for the floss part of it. i would buy the amazon product plackers right angle flossers, they are excellent. it wont fit with this toothbrush obviously, but the design of these flossers keeps you from needing an attachment (they are cheap too, but very well made):)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001J8UL3I Plackers Right Angle, 75 ea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, there&#x27;s some other attachment piece that you can use that is also included, it looks red in the pic. i can notspeak about that, i did not use it, nor do i think i will, it looks like it would hurt, and other reviews have said that it does, and like i say, if you use the tiny bristle attachments pictured right next to it, you dont need to use that in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Brush head holes leaked toothpaste etc. and packed up batteries. Phoning or emailing customer service provided no response. Newer design has shows no holes but with their customer service I prefer to use ordinary brushes because the bristles are not soft enough to reach between teeth or reach crevices. Also dentist recommended diamond or arrow design heads are more effective. I can&#x27;t even use their heads like an ordinary brush. As the saying goes &amp;#34;cheap things no good&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; but the ordinary brush is good and cheaper to use,no battery to pack up in one and a half years.</li>
            <li> great electric toothbrush. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Like the toothbrushes but they are noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two battery powered toothbrushes and I am somewhat disappointed with both. The initial brush would not turn on but I did call customer service with my concerns...it had sat in a drawer in the original packing for a couple of years with batteries in place and had corroded...the company was good enough to replace it. The seconded brush worked well till the batteries died. I have changed the batteries and it did not turn on??? Got it going but just returned from vacation and after it has not been used for 8 days can again not get it to turn on ( the batteries are fully charged ). Voicemail has been left for a hopefully a timely reply. Will get back to edit this review when I have answers to my questions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush at Walmart for only $7.50. I haven&#x27;t used a battery operated toothbrush in years but I have braces now so I figured I should try one out. I just used this toothbrush for the first time and I am very happy with it. My teeth have never felt this clean from brushing them on my own, my teeth feel so clean like I just came back from the dentist. I highly recommend this toothbrush. Plus, the extra attachments are great!</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my spinbrush and batteries used up quickly.</li>
