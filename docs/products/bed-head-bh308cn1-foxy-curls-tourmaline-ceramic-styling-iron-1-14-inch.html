            <li>Excellent product and transaction!</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped around and this appears to be the best combination of price and quality one can get!</li>
            <li>I bought this in February 2015 and LOVED it!</li>
            <li>It made great curls that one time</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron makes awesome beach waves</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives perfect curls</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>given the good results.</li>
            <li>This iron gets very hot and does a great job!</li>
            <li>Does a great job curling my fine hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I get consistently good results.</li>
            <li>and I go so many compliments on my curls!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this curling iron!</li>
            <li>I love this for special occasions when I can take time and want my hair to look its best.</li>
            <li>Great curls, heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this to the more popular irons that are clip-free because I like being able to have one hand free while curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Still the heating element worked great and this would be a great product iff used occasionally for light curls.</li>
            <li>they burn me way too easy - but this product is so cheaply made it fell apart!</li>
            <li>Easy and safe to use and does not require any additional tools like heat-resistant gloves.</li>
            <li>Like I said, the curls are great and I love the short clip idea</li>
            <li>The location of the power buttons is clunky and it&#x27;s easy to turn it off while using it.</li>
            <li>My mom tried to let go, but a huge chunk of my hair got burned off.</li>
            <li>From the time you pull it out of the box it feels cheap.</li>
            <li>I love how quick this iron heats up and quickly it curls hair...</li>
            <li>love this curling iron because it heats up fast and gives me easy waves.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is great and holds curls all day long.</li>
            <li>Came as described and right on time!</li>
            <li>It got very, very hot (smelled like it was burning) and died.</li>
            <li>This was my new favorite styling tool</li>
            <li>She just wishes it was a little longer, but otherwise she says it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This Foxy Curls curling iron, with a miniclip is the closest I&#x27;ve come to success.</li>
            <li>If Bed Head could make it with better quality components I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>The clip makes using the wand much easier!</li>
            <li>I love the tiny clip on the end which causes no lines and no need for a glove.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly and makes nice defined curls in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>Found that you can&#x27;t try to curl too large of a tress at one time.  </li>
            <li>The resulting curls look great and, with a little hairspray, last all day.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like tnte curls it gives???  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>It does take time, and you have to be careful not to accidentally hit the on/off button during styling, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Much easier than a clamp-less curling iron as I always burn my hands.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>No burns here and so much faster for me without the glove.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>One day I plugged it in like normal and was about to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Mi girlfriend needed a new curling iron because her old one broke.  </li>
            <li>You would think a professional brand like Tigi Bed Head would produce a quality product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always struggling to get the soft, twisty curls I see everywhere</li>
            <li>I have a professional clipless iron</li>
            <li>My only real quibble is that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t reveal the heat settings.</li>
            <li>I bought the first for myself, and the second recently as a gift for my sister at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The curls last all day which normally does not happen.</li>
            <li>It is a little hard on the ends of my hair, so I would suggest a good heat therapy treatment, but the curls stay put all day if you hairspray before and after curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one complaint is my current iron shuts off a couple times while I am curling my hair, so I always have to check and make sure it is still on.</li>

            <li> this only works on long hair</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about a year and a half, so I don&#x27;t expect it will last forever, but for $20 bucks, it&#x27;s done its job well.</li>

            <li> I have long thick hair, and I can get it all curled in 10 min or less.</li>
            <li> Took a little time to get the hang of, but works like it is supposed.  </li>
            <li> I curl my hair everyday...</li>
            <li> Also malfunctioned and kept randomly turning off while in use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep my hair curled, and this wand does the job!</li>

            <li> You would think a professional brand like Tigi Bed Head would produce a quality product... Not this time.  From the time you pull it out of the box it feels cheap. I only got to use it once before it broke. It made great curls that one time but I couldn&#x27;t put it back together and had to send it back. If Bed Head could make it with better quality components I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.  Like I said, the curls are great and I love the short clip idea - I can&#x27;t use the wands,  they burn me way too easy - but this product is so cheaply made it fell apart!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep my hair curled, and this wand does the job! The clip makes using the wand much easier! Very happy with this product that I bought some for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> Quit working after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this in February 2015 and LOVED it! Great curls, heats up fast.  However 2 months after purchasing it quit working. One day I plugged it in like normal and was about to curl my hair. It got very, very hot (smelled like it was burning) and died. I am so sad!  This was my new favorite styling tool and I go so many compliments on my curls!</li>
            <li> I had a conair curler like this but it went out so I saw this one...don&#x27;t really like tnte curls it gives???  Don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron makes awesome beach waves</li>
            <li> Easy to use but its not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives perfect curls</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this curling iron. I bought the first for myself, and the second recently as a gift for my sister at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this curling iron because it heats up fast and gives me easy waves. I prefer this to the more popular irons that are clip-free because I like being able to have one hand free while curling my hair.

            <li> Took a little time to get the hang of, but works like it is supposed.  Found that you can&#x27;t try to curl too large of a tress at one time.  Gets hot quickly and makes nice defined curls in a few seconds.  Personally like the clamp that holds the hair in places vs the irons that require a glove.</li>
            <li> Does a great job curling my fine hair! The curls last all day which normally does not happen. I am so glad that I purchased this curling iron!</li>
            <li> I curl my hair everyday...this product works perfectly.  I have long thick hair, and I can get it all curled in 10 min or less. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Mi girlfriend needed a new curling iron because her old one broke.  It&#x27;s hard to find one that has a short clip and a tapered curling area.  This one fit the bill perfectly.  She just wishes it was a little longer, but otherwise she says it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> 4.5 Stars. I&#x27;m always struggling to get the soft, twisty curls I see everywhere I look. I have a professional clipless iron but I had such difficulty using it, I finally gave up. This Foxy Curls curling iron, with a miniclip is the closest I&#x27;ve come to success. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I get consistently good results. It does take time, and you have to be careful not to accidentally hit the on/off button during styling, but that&#x27;s okay given the good results. My only real quibble is that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t reveal the heat settings. I assume this is because the \\&quot;high\\&quot; heat is less than other products. I have coarse hair, and this iron works well  as long as I use small sections and hold it in place a second or two longer. I would simply like the manufacturer to provide the heat setting information in order to help consumers make an informed decision. I love this for special occasions when I can take time and want my hair to look its best.</li>
            <li> My daughter said this is the best product she has ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Came as described and right on time! Excellent product and transaction!</li>
            <li> I love how quick this iron heats up and quickly it curls hair...you don&#x27;t even need hairspray!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no clamp!  this only works on long hair -- I need something with a clamp that works for short hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Easy and safe to use and does not require any additional tools like heat-resistant gloves. The resulting curls look great and, with a little hairspray, last all day. I&#x27;ve shopped around and this appears to be the best combination of price and quality one can get!</li>
            <li> Not tapered enough for the curls I was looking for. The location of the power buttons is clunky and it&#x27;s easy to turn it off while using it. Also malfunctioned and kept randomly turning off while in use. Returned!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great and holds curls all day long. Much easier than a clamp-less curling iron as I always burn my hands. This iron gets very hot and does a great job!</li>
            <li> Something went wrong and the heat went on high in a matter of seconds. Literally two seconds and my hair started smoking. My mom tried to let go, but a huge chunk of my hair got burned off.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  I love the tiny clip on the end which causes no lines and no need for a glove.  No burns here and so much faster for me without the glove.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product was not quite as sturdy as I thought it would be. The plastic pieces seemed like they wouldn&#x27;t last over time. Still the heating element worked great and this would be a great product iff used occasionally for light curls. I might try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> I like to wrap my hair around the barrel and slide it off to create big waves/curls and I found that this one &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; too much, as in the surface is not smooth enough for the buttery gliding I am accustomed to with my other curling iron. I returned this one.</li>
