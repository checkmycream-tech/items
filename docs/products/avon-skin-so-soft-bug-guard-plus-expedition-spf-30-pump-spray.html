            <li>AMAZING!!!!   </li>
            <li>It is great!</li>
            <li>I chose this because I know Avon Skin-So_Soft products are always an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it will repel ticks, but worked great for nats, mosquitoes and flies.  </li>
            <li>This is really great bug and sun screen.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to rub in, it smells great!!</li>
            <li>No tug of war, just good service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this will be a good product to use, however, bought it for a cruise taken to Panama Canal and it did not arrive within the time limit stated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, very pleasant to use and effective.</li>
            <li>But make sure to ask for what you want - make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen to you!</li>
            <li>This Avon product is by far the best insect repellant we have found . . .</li>
            <li>I love this product and would order it again from this supplier.  </li>
            <li>Since I have no idea who was at fault for this, all I can say is that it did not meet my expectations since I wasn&#x27;t able to use it when I most wanted it.</li>
            <li>enthusiastically recommend this product, but also suggest that you buy multiple bottles as you do need to reapply faithfully to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of bugs in Louisiana, and I wanted make sure the kids are protected.  </li>
            <li>Love it for trips to the beach.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this product to anyone trying to stay bug bite(s) free!!!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, not as much of a chemical smell as others.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend had dozens of huge sand flea bites.</li>
            <li>Applied once in the morning and was bug free all day, even with sweating it continued to work.  </li>
            <li>Best bug spray we have found yet, really does what is says and you don&#x27;t feel gross wearing it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the feel is more lightweight and less greasy than many others.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this product thanks for making it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaked and ate the color out of a large section of the leather!!</li>
            <li>It came quickly.</li>
            <li>Purchased it here and was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Before getting this, I was the main course for all the bugs that liked to suck my blood the moment I stepped outside.   </li>
            <li>The dog doesn&#x27;t scratch as much either!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this when I was about to leave the country because it works for me better than Deep Woods off and is not Sticky.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item along with several others to send to my grand kids in Louisiana.  </li>
            <li>Used it recently in the mid-west at 95 degrees and 98% humidity in a very buggy area 6 to 8 hours per day for a week while shooting an outdoor archery tournament, mostly in wooded areas.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it spray on lightly</li>
            <li>It really keeps the bugs away.</li>
            <li>Definitely keeps the bugs away..just prefer the original Skin so Soft scent.  </li>
            <li>Wow Wow!!!     </li>
            <li>This is effective, less messy than most and doesn&#x27;t contain the \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; ingredients that force you to hop in the shower immediately after using some of the other brands out there.  </li>
            <li>I went online to find out what might work and discovered skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Shipoing was high but product cost was low so it balanced out when compared to ordering from Avon.</li>
            <li>We could not find this bug/sun spray locally and it is highly rated.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried herbal/natural sprays and this is by far the best bug repellent I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is less toxic and works better than any of the typical products in the market.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product so far that doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation - truly hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>My wife and I like to go boating on lake Erie and earlier this year we had to come in early because we just could not stand those pesky flies that bite at your ankles, feet and legs.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but there is something in the composition that is scary.</li>
            <li>This smells a little too much like bug spray.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Wow Wow!!!     This stuff has saved my skin. Before getting this, I was the main course for all the bugs that liked to suck my blood the moment I stepped outside.   Now I can step outside in a tee shirt at night or at dusk for that matter and not be a target.     AMAZING!!!!   This stuff is PHENOM!!!!!    Highly Recommend this product to anyone trying to stay bug bite(s) free!!!</li>
            <li> Best bug spray we have found yet, really does what is says and you don&#x27;t feel gross wearing it. No odor!</li>
            <li> The Vet told me to try this while on the beach w/ the dog and I tried it.  It is water resistant and has a SPF of 30!  I did not get sun burned!  The dog doesn&#x27;t scratch as much either!  It is great!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my child....it is deet-free and seems to work well for her. It has a pleasant smell, not as much of a chemical smell as others. It was cheaper from Amazon than from Avon.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! Ordered three bottles of pump spray but received three of aerosol! The two products are not the same. My family prefers the pump spray, but we were out of spray and the bugs were biting, so I decided to keep what we were sent. But make sure to ask for what you want - make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen to you!</li>
            <li> Used it recently in the mid-west at 95 degrees and 98% humidity in a very buggy area 6 to 8 hours per day for a week while shooting an outdoor archery tournament, mostly in wooded areas.  Applied once in the morning and was bug free all day, even with sweating it continued to work.  Don&#x27;t know if it will repel ticks, but worked great for nats, mosquitoes and flies.  I use a separate sun screen prior to applying spray so I did not test the sun screen.  Highly recommend, very pleasant to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the bugs away..just prefer the original Skin so Soft scent.  This smells a little too much like bug spray.  But will continue to use in small amounts.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would order it again from this supplier.  It came quickly. Shipoing was high but product cost was low so it balanced out when compared to ordering from Avon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this will be a good product to use, however, bought it for a cruise taken to Panama Canal and it did not arrive within the time limit stated. Since I have no idea who was at fault for this, all I can say is that it did not meet my expectations since I wasn&#x27;t able to use it when I most wanted it.</li>
            <li> We used it for mosquito repellent. It is quite oily.  Left a coating on my ceramic tile floor. It smells nice, but there is something in the composition that is scary. I forgot it was in my back pocket and sat on a leather couch. It leaked and ate the color out of a large section of the leather!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product so far that doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation - truly hypoallergenic. We use it every day to prevent mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> This Avon product is by far the best insect repellant we have found . . . and we have tried quite a few.  This is effective, less messy than most and doesn&#x27;t contain the \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; ingredients that force you to hop in the shower immediately after using some of the other brands out there.  The smell is pleasant and the feel is more lightweight and less greasy than many others.  This is now the only brand we use.  Nothing else gives us these results.</li>
            <li> My wife and I like to go boating on lake Erie and earlier this year we had to come in early because we just could not stand those pesky flies that bite at your ankles, feet and legs.  We tried spraying the boat, driving off to get away from the flies and other bug repellants, but nothing worked.   I went online to find out what might work and discovered skin so soft.  It really works.  We haven&#x27;t been cut short of a boating trip because of flies biting.  Admittedly, I did get bitten once or twice after a few hours after the application but I can put up with an occasional &#x27;hit&#x27;.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I always get bit by bugs, mosquitoes, anything wherever I go. Usually I buy Off! wipes or spray, I&#x27;ve tried herbal/natural sprays and this is by far the best bug repellent I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only does it spray on lightly and it&#x27;s easy to rub in, it smells great!!</li>
            <li> My family and I have used Avon SSS Bug Guard Plus products for over 15 years, we won&#x27;t use anything else to keep us protected when we&#x27;re outdoors.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but had to buy a separate, smaller 3 ounce container while traveling.  It worked well.  I didn&#x27;t get any bug bites while I had it on.  I like that it is bug spray which contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is less toxic and works better than any of the typical products in the market.  It really keeps the bugs away.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the pests off ! Planning on a garden this spring ? Then you will want this product. It works !</li>
            <li> Just got back from Honduras. My girlfriend had dozens of huge sand flea bites. I had 4--all in spots where the SSS had been rubbed off by the hammock.&lt;br /&gt;I enthusiastically recommend this product, but also suggest that you buy multiple bottles as you do need to reapply faithfully to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I was about to leave the country because it works for me better than Deep Woods off and is not Sticky. Unfortunately, I was sent the aerosol instead of the pump, because the order was out. When I called the seller, she apologized, promised to expedite what I needed and in a few days, I received it as promised. No tug of war, just good service. Refreshing.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for a friend who is quite mosquito crazy. It has not really been tested as yet since we must await the warmer summer months. The friend thought it may be her answer to persistent mosquito problems.</li>
            <li> I have finally used this product. This is really great bug and sun screen. I would buy again for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with several others to send to my grand kids in Louisiana.  I chose this because I know Avon Skin-So_Soft products are always an excellent choice.  There are a lot of bugs in Louisiana, and I wanted make sure the kids are protected.  I will be purchasing more of this product thanks for making it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We needed this product for my Grandson who was going to Costa Rica.  We could not find this bug/sun spray locally and it is highly rated.  Purchased it here and was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Love it for trips to the beach. Worked well in jungle type settings in Costa Rica.</li>
