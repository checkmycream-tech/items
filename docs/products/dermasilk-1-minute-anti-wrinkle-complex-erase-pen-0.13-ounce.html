            <li>Cannot apply any kind of makeup or power on top.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the results, and it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true</li>
            <li>it seems to be too good to be true...</li>

            <li>I save it for when I&#x27;m going out mostly.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>BUT... MAKE SURE you PAY for it Because \\&quot;NOBODY\\&quot; is</li>
            <li>this product is somewhat ok but not to buy again</li>
            <li>Glad this is a cream and not a serum.</li>
            <li>but I think she is satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily or break it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order more..</li>
            <li>Does make things look better...</li>
            <li>EVER GONNA STAY on EASY STREET....</li>
            <li>with the brush it was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am so happy - I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t at all oily, and I&#x27;ve even applied it later in the day over make up with good results.</li>
            <li>Dries quick, too.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with DermaSilk&#x27;s Instant Eyelift.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles still show when you smile, but it fades the lines under the eyes when your expressions are at rest.  </li>
            <li>I only use around my upper lip and works great.</li>
            <li>I have been using a different cream and regimen( clarisonic) that seems to do much better.</li>
            <li>Money pulled have been better left in my pocket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will depend on how deep the lines are.  </li>
            <li>It reduces the overhang of my upper eyelids, giving me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and usually around $35 at the stores!  </li>
            <li>Literally smooths fine wrinkles and diminishes deep ones.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find a good product</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat the real thing and that is Derm fill and freeze.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t roll and peel off when applying other makeup over top like serums do.</li>
            <li>At my age which is older lady, Older lady meaning over 60 every bit of help is appreciated.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Mine is semi deep on the right side-</li>
            <li>Finally something that REALLY works!</li>
            <li>You do need to apply it twice, though, the second time one minute after you apply the first.</li>
            <li>of course the wrinkles are not gone completely but</li>
            <li>but a real life saver- especially for pictures!!</li>
            <li>The old adage applies: &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>Only giving one star because I never tried this product, but for anyone it didn&#x27;t work for, Try Instantly Ageless it really works!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m gonna try all the Dermasilk products now and use them as a new routine and then finally choose which products that I will stick with.</li>

            <li> It was either dried up or empty when I received it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> wrinkles gone, love this</li>
            <li> Works like it says...I&#x27;m 65 and trying to not have surgery.  It lessens the appearance of the wrinkles and firms the skin but it&#x27;s temporary. You wash it off and you&#x27;re back to square one. I save it for when I&#x27;m going out mostly.</li>
            <li> Thank you .on time n also as said .</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it for years. No one guessed I am 70 as I have no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. At my age which is older lady, Older lady meaning over 60 every bit of help is appreciated. Hard to find a good product and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Literally smooths fine wrinkles and diminishes deep ones.  This stuff is great and usually around $35 at the stores!  I would highly recommend.  Dries quick, too.  Wear under make up or before bed.</li>
            <li> Best \\&quot;Portable\\&quot; Line Eraser I have found yet ! Take It Wherever You GO ! E-A-S-Y S-T-R-E-E-T ! BUT... MAKE SURE you PAY for it Because \\&quot;NOBODY\\&quot; is EVER GONNA STAY on EASY STREET....&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck ,Josephine A.M. Caiazzo</li>
            <li> Only giving one star because I never tried this product, but for anyone it didn&#x27;t work for, Try Instantly Ageless it really works! It gets rid of wrinkles I&#x27;m minutes. It last 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not see any difference. I am a non smoker 40 something that sees I need a little help and this and all the other dermasilk creams did not deliver. I bought everyone....I have been using a different cream and regimen( clarisonic) that seems to do much better.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the real thing and that is Derm fill and freeze. this product is somewhat ok but not to buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who was always complaining about the wrinkles in her forehead and under her eyes.  She says this is the best product she has ever used (and says she&#x27;s tried them all).  I am giving it 5 stars on her behalf.</li>
            <li> a big joke!!!! customer service nice</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything-in fact it makes you break out. If you have somewhat oily skin, it stinks. It&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> The skin at the end of my eye brows (where frown lines are usually located) dip slightly. It makes me look like I&#x27;m angry. I have tried a lot of ways for a long time to hide the dipping. Finally :-&amp;#62;. The eraser works!! I&#x27;m medium skin African American. When I apply the cream, it looks a little waxy. I have to blend the edges (around where I apply the cream) to blend it in with my skin. It don&#x27;t take a lot of effort.  I am so happy - I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> Unsure why it works for some and not others.  Too good to be true and I saw no results unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Glad this is a cream and not a serum. It doesn&#x27;t roll and peel off when applying other makeup over top like serums do. I&#x27;ll buy this again, heck, I look 10 years younger now! In fact, I&#x27;m gonna try all the Dermasilk products now and use them as a new routine and then finally choose which products that I will stick with. I recommend Dermasilk to all women who have anti aging lines and wrinkles. Thank you.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, the products were not for me but for a friend but I think she is satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now it I can see the difference...of course the wrinkles are not gone completely but the are disappearing...good buy!!</li>
            <li> Money pulled have been better left in my pocket.</li>
            <li> This product was so very nice for those fine lines.  Used on the area above the lips and with the brush it was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Finally something that REALLY works! Try it; you&#x27;ll love it!  I couldn&#x27;t believe the results, and it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Well, I bought three different wrinkle removers at the same time, and this is the only one that works. You do need to apply it twice, though, the second time one minute after you apply the first. I have somewhat oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily or break it out. In fact, it seems to dry up the oil. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews, perhaps they are not applying it right. The product isn&#x27;t at all oily, and I&#x27;ve even applied it later in the day over make up with good results. I&#x27;m about to order more..</li>
            <li> Does make things look better...Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like advertised. It took Biotech 2 weeks to refund my payment.</li>
            <li> I only use around my upper lip and works great. Dont recommend for around eyes as shown.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again seen no difference</li>
            <li> Was very happy with my order</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Cannot apply any kind of makeup or power on top.  Balls up.</li>
            <li> It was either dried up or empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> This does work!  Very Impressed-  Wrinkles still show when you smile, but it fades the lines under the eyes when your expressions are at rest.  I&#x27;m sure it will depend on how deep the lines are.  Mine is semi deep on the right side- but a real life saver- especially for pictures!!</li>
            <li> This item arrived dried out.  Never got to try it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for $7.99 at Marshall&#x27;s and sorry I wasted even that small amount if money. Can&#x27;t see a bit of difference. The old adage applies: &amp;#34;if it seems to be too good to be true...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I am very satisfied with DermaSilk&#x27;s Instant Eyelift. It reduces the overhang of my upper eyelids, giving me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say - can&#x27;t figure out if it just doesn&#x27;t work or it&#x27;s completely dried out -nothing comes out of the pen. Also no instructions - do you shake it, turn it at the end?  Whatever I do I can&#x27;t get anything to come out of it.</li>
