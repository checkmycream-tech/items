            <li>My hair never gets better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this product got so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels when I use it.  </li>

            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love love love John Frieda shampoo.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this line.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t make my blonde hair darker like a lot of the others did, too.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very easy to apply and distribute throughout the hair and it rinses off cleanly and without leaving residue.  </li>
            <li>I think this is all right as a conditioner, but it&#x27;s not the most spectacular one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling great, and soft.</li>
            <li>It is great for natural hair.  </li>
            <li>and I tell them JOHN FRIEDA - Full Repair products!</li>
            <li>I would pick it up in store and not through mail-order because the caps twist off too easily during transit.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly strong scent, although the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>I read on the John Frieda site that the full repair shampoo would be better for my hair than the brunette shampoo that I was using.</li>
            <li>First Off, I have been coloring my hair for many many years.</li>
            <li>I love,the way this voluminous my fine, blonde-colored hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff, it always makes my hair so nice and soft and not greasy or anything, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the word &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; lightly like the teenagers do.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>but boy it is sure worth it....</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so silky smooth after use.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>ect)&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, I was in love.</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a sample</li>
            <li>There has been a significant decrease in hair loss since I started using the full repair shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>she loves it and said it made her hair feel so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair full of life...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but anything that saves me time is worthy of five stars.</li>
            <li>and this does a great job of taming it, but not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Even my 1 year old clip in hair extensions got life from this :) leaves hair full and manageable.</li>
            <li>This natural approach does keep my hair mostly calm, but when paired with this conditioner my hair is even more &amp;#34;tameable.&amp;#34; I also really like how easy it is to spread throughout my hair-</li>
            <li>It does smell and feel nice while applying, though, so I&#x27;ll likely keep using it and get a hair mask.</li>
            <li>Its very affordable, leaves my hair soft and has a really nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten dryer as I have aged&#x27; but most of the moisturizers I tried seemed to make it greasy rather than healthy.</li>
            <li>I did find the smell a unique sophisticated musk which was different.</li>
            <li>and I guess this isn&#x27;t the right conditioner for me.  </li>
            <li>so i tried find what kind of shamppoo and condition to repair full strength and restore hair back normal again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It REPAiRED damaged hair, &amp; strengthened it to reduce future breakage; within months the whole family was in love!</li>
            <li>I thought this conditioner would be good for my hair, but it weighs it down and makes it look stringy.  </li>
            <li>I dyed my hair twice within a month so its pretty damaged right now and that is with a hair trim.</li>
            <li>So if you have thick hair, it should be a great conditioner for you.</li>
            <li>I love it very much same thing that help my hair improve go away damage hair from perm.</li>
            <li>It softened my chemical damaged hair but like most hair products out there after several continuous usage my hair doesn&#x27;t respond as well.</li>
            <li>sadly do not have a sense of smell..</li>
            <li>The texture is more liquidy, while I prefer a thicker conditioner, but that&#x27;s my personal preference.</li>
            <li>It does an okay job detangling my hair and adding a moderate body to it without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li>They most definitely deserve awards and accolades for this one.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel super healthy without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I pretty much have never met a John Frieda product I didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very decent between cuttings.</li>
            <li>i constantly buy new kinds in search of something I love.  </li>
            <li>It really smoothed my hair out</li>
            <li>My hair changes its mind about whether it wants to be straight or somewhat wavy, and I do tend to get some frizz and flyaways</li>
            <li>And I get a reasonable amount of shine.  </li>
            <li>but really this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Used by my daughter who really likes this product.</li>
            <li>but I really haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; to the condition of my hair</li>
            <li>It really stays on your hair and does not drip.</li>
            <li>My husband was complaining about how much hair was in the shower drain when I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li>Mine has keratin and this product has too much alcohol in it.  </li>
            <li>(I live in Georgia where it can be pretty humid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, this is a decent conditioner at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>(I use this one a week as a deep conditioner or for special occasions).</li>
            <li>was starting to feel soft and strong again.</li>
            <li>John Frieda Full Repair Strengthen and Restore Conditioner, 8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)</li>
            <li>Full Repair shampoo and conditioner remedy my lackluster curls almost daily.</li>
            <li>, I use it every time I wash my hair, couldn&#x27;t live without it, thanks</li>
            <li>I really was just browsing for a new decently priced option.</li>
            <li>This is a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>... and it often takes me 20 minutes to comb out knots in the shower, particularly during winter when my hair rubs against my coat collar.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I went to Maui in July with only a carry-on bag and needed to buy conditioner while there.</li>
            <li>and really leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>My hair is normally frizzy and needs lots of help in Texas humidity weather.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has a nice thick formulation.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best price available, I have extremely thick hair that drinks up moisture father than an alcoholic can swill Vodka.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out easily, left your hair smooth &amp; sleek without being greasy or flat, had jut as much volume as their &amp;#34;full volume&amp;#34</li>
            <li>CAUSE I DON T LIVE AT USA.</li>
            <li>I live by</li>
            <li>My hair is not colored or heat-styled, but it is super dry and prone to frizz</li>
            <li>do much for the frizz, but then again nothing but a flat iron or a blowout really gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Even salon products with lower sulfates and high quality cremes leave too much build up for my hair to curl properly (including Wen).</li>
            <li>It detangles my hair so fast and easy, its unbelievable!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is artificial but this contains no dyes or parabens, which is great if you&#x27;re avoiding those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have bought two batches so far.</li>
            <li>I use them at the same time and must say it is very comparable to the mask.</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>and I developed some irritation and bumps where my hair hits my neck.</li>
            <li>Keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin to perfumes.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how soft and manageable this made my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaving hair incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This does contain silicone derivatives (fine by me, as these usually help my hair) but does not contain SLS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on fine hair....</li>
            <li>My hair gets very dry - using this once a week really helps moisturize my hair again!</li>
            <li>Her hair is very full and thick..</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a huge problem with breakage to begin with, but I do think this is reducing what small amount of breakage I get.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and it makes my hair so soft - works better than some of the really expensive hair products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>As far as the listing of active ingrediants, many of which sound scary, but this stuff works to refine and repair damage.</li>
            <li>I also use the 3-Day straight and I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a thick, wavy, unruly mop and this conditioner made it soooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten very frizzy as I have gotten older, and this helps me tame it.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a replacement for the old formula VO5 deep conditioning treatment which I can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
            <li>I have straight Long black hair with silvery purple highlights, and it treats both colors very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a scary process to get dark hair light, and it&#x27;s VERY important to find products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair, make it frizzy, or strip the color</li>
            <li>For the price I actually prefer Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Damage &amp; Color Repair Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask.</li>
            <li>some deep conditioners are so thick that I have to use half a bottle to get my hair evenly covered, but this one smooths throughout nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I use the John Frieda full and thick volume conditioner which works for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that could take my hair from chemically dead to vibrant and soft.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product got so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more noticeable change, but I haven&#x27;t seen one yet.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> and I was so glad to have discovered this.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love John Frieda shampoo.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this line.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t make my blonde hair darker like a lot of the others did, too.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very easy to apply and distribute throughout the hair and it rinses off cleanly and without leaving residue.  </li>
            <li> I think this is all right as a conditioner, but it&#x27;s not the most spectacular one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling great, and soft.</li>
            <li> It is great for natural hair.  </li>
            <li> and I tell them JOHN FRIEDA - Full Repair products!</li>
            <li> I would pick it up in store and not through mail-order because the caps twist off too easily during transit.</li>
            <li> It has a fairly strong scent, although the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> I read on the John Frieda site that the full repair shampoo would be better for my hair than the brunette shampoo that I was using.</li>
            <li> First Off, I have been coloring my hair for many many years.</li>
            <li> I love,the way this voluminous my fine, blonde-colored hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, it always makes my hair so nice and soft and not greasy or anything, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the word &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; lightly like the teenagers do.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> but boy it is sure worth it....</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so silky smooth after use.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> ect)&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, I was in love.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a sample</li>
            <li> There has been a significant decrease in hair loss since I started using the full repair shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> she loves it and said it made her hair feel so nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair full of life...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but anything that saves me time is worthy of five stars.</li>
            <li> and this does a great job of taming it, but not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Even my 1 year old clip in hair extensions got life from this :) leaves hair full and manageable.</li>
            <li> This natural approach does keep my hair mostly calm, but when paired with this conditioner my hair is even more &amp;#34;tameable.&amp;#34; I also really like how easy it is to spread throughout my hair-</li>
            <li> It does smell and feel nice while applying, though, so I&#x27;ll likely keep using it and get a hair mask.</li>
            <li> Its very affordable, leaves my hair soft and has a really nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten dryer as I have aged&#x27; but most of the moisturizers I tried seemed to make it greasy rather than healthy.</li>
            <li> I did find the smell a unique sophisticated musk which was different.</li>
            <li> and I guess this isn&#x27;t the right conditioner for me.  </li>
            <li> so i tried find what kind of shamppoo and condition to repair full strength and restore hair back normal again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It REPAiRED damaged hair, &amp; strengthened it to reduce future breakage; within months the whole family was in love!</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner would be good for my hair, but it weighs it down and makes it look stringy.  </li>
            <li> I dyed my hair twice within a month so its pretty damaged right now and that is with a hair trim.</li>
            <li> So if you have thick hair, it should be a great conditioner for you.</li>
            <li> I love it very much same thing that help my hair improve go away damage hair from perm.</li>
            <li> It softened my chemical damaged hair but like most hair products out there after several continuous usage my hair doesn&#x27;t respond as well.</li>
            <li> sadly do not have a sense of smell..</li>
            <li> The texture is more liquidy, while I prefer a thicker conditioner, but that&#x27;s my personal preference.</li>
            <li> It does an okay job detangling my hair and adding a moderate body to it without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> They most definitely deserve awards and accolades for this one.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel super healthy without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I pretty much have never met a John Frieda product I didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very decent between cuttings.</li>
            <li> i constantly buy new kinds in search of something I love.  </li>
            <li> It really smoothed my hair out</li>
            <li> My hair changes its mind about whether it wants to be straight or somewhat wavy, and I do tend to get some frizz and flyaways</li>
            <li> And I get a reasonable amount of shine.  </li>
            <li> but really this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Used by my daughter who really likes this product.</li>
            <li> but I really haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; to the condition of my hair</li>
            <li> It really stays on your hair and does not drip.</li>
            <li> My husband was complaining about how much hair was in the shower drain when I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> Mine has keratin and this product has too much alcohol in it.  </li>
            <li> (I live in Georgia where it can be pretty humid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , this is a decent conditioner at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> (I use this one a week as a deep conditioner or for special occasions).</li>
            <li> was starting to feel soft and strong again.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Full Repair Strengthen and Restore Conditioner, 8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)</li>
            <li> Full Repair shampoo and conditioner remedy my lackluster curls almost daily.</li>
            <li> , I use it every time I wash my hair, couldn&#x27;t live without it, thanks</li>
            <li> I really was just browsing for a new decently priced option.</li>
            <li> This is a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> ... and it often takes me 20 minutes to comb out knots in the shower, particularly during winter when my hair rubs against my coat collar.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I went to Maui in July with only a carry-on bag and needed to buy conditioner while there.</li>
            <li> and really leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally frizzy and needs lots of help in Texas humidity weather.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice thick formulation.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best price available, I have extremely thick hair that drinks up moisture father than an alcoholic can swill Vodka.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out easily, left your hair smooth &amp; sleek without being greasy or flat, had jut as much volume as their &amp;#34;full volume&amp;#34</li>
            <li> CAUSE I DON T LIVE AT USA.</li>
            <li> I live by</li>
            <li> My hair is not colored or heat-styled, but it is super dry and prone to frizz</li>
            <li> do much for the frizz, but then again nothing but a flat iron or a blowout really gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Even salon products with lower sulfates and high quality cremes leave too much build up for my hair to curl properly (including Wen).</li>
            <li> It detangles my hair so fast and easy, its unbelievable!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is artificial but this contains no dyes or parabens, which is great if you&#x27;re avoiding those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have bought two batches so far.</li>
            <li> I use them at the same time and must say it is very comparable to the mask.</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> and I developed some irritation and bumps where my hair hits my neck.</li>
            <li> Keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how soft and manageable this made my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaving hair incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This does contain silicone derivatives (fine by me, as these usually help my hair) but does not contain SLS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on fine hair....</li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry - using this once a week really helps moisturize my hair again!</li>
            <li> Her hair is very full and thick..</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a huge problem with breakage to begin with, but I do think this is reducing what small amount of breakage I get.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and it makes my hair so soft - works better than some of the really expensive hair products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> As far as the listing of active ingrediants, many of which sound scary, but this stuff works to refine and repair damage.</li>
            <li> I also use the 3-Day straight and I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thick, wavy, unruly mop and this conditioner made it soooo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten very frizzy as I have gotten older, and this helps me tame it.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a replacement for the old formula VO5 deep conditioning treatment which I can&#x27;t find anymore</li>
            <li> I have straight Long black hair with silvery purple highlights, and it treats both colors very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a scary process to get dark hair light, and it&#x27;s VERY important to find products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair, make it frizzy, or strip the color</li>
            <li> For the price I actually prefer Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Damage &amp; Color Repair Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask.</li>
            <li> some deep conditioners are so thick that I have to use half a bottle to get my hair evenly covered, but this one smooths throughout nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I use the John Frieda full and thick volume conditioner which works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that could take my hair from chemically dead to vibrant and soft.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I live at high altitude and the water is very hard.  </li>
            <li> I only use it every few times I condition (because of my mostly natural approach) but do like the results every time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner helps sooo much and you only need a SMALL amount!</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting my naturally wavy hair to curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine anyway</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t heat treat or blow dry</li>
            <li> For people with curly dry color treated hair stay away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> so my hair was dry and brittle but it looks and feels healthier now that I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Since yes, the only con I can think of is that it really is not available in bottles larger than 12oz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair- not wavy- curly.. and therefore, it&#x27;s usually frizzy and prone to drying out.</li>
            <li> Right now, my hair is down to the middle of my back, and I have already been considering chopping it off before it turns cold outside, because I am fed up with the frustration.</li>
            <li> And sadly, do get those lovely colors and crazy pigments just right</li>
            <li> I try a natural approach, by using cleansing conditioners, and only using a harsh shampoo after a day at the lake or after a hard day of work (I work with horses).</li>
            <li> If the caps get wet, mold starts to grow in the interior of the caps.</li>
            <li> and a little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and trade off shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Made me break out along my hairline and dried out my hair long term.</li>
            <li> The only two problems I had were the small size and that I&#x27;m allergic to it.</li>
            <li> It helps my dry hair which I washed everyday after practicing Bikram yoga.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the packaging.</li>
            <li> About half of it fell out and the hair that was left was limp, dry, and weak.</li>
            <li> Medium weight conditioner, not too heavy but thick enough</li>
            <li> then it did before, and seems to have a slightly volumizing effect.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like I&#x27;ve paid for an expensive deep conditioning at my local hair boutique.</li>
            <li> maybe its a placebo effect, but i swear my hair feels less fried, moisturized, strengthened.</li>
            <li> I know that this brand is a little pricey</li>
            <li> A DIFFERENT LABEL BEHIND.</li>
            <li> I typically use Pantene&#x27;s Color Preserve, but have noticed my strands getting drier than usual, so I thought it was time for a switch.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all either, so it feels less limp and thin</li>
            <li> It only makes it worse!</li>
            <li> I have always used $$$ Aveda products, since I pay hundreds for highlights and, in the past, drug store brands have faded my color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can explain this shampoo (and conditioner)</li>
            <li> I do not get split ends, although the ends are generally in a little bit worse condition than the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have waist-length, Caucasian-textured, fairly thick, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and you can feel the silkiness as soon as you put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I hate that it&#x27;s so small because it hardly lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair give it a shot..you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I M REALLY MAD ABOUT THIS.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> What a horrible conditioner and shampoo.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Keeps hair full looking and in great condition and has a very appealing smell. Nice price and you get two of them!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner. It really smoothed my hair out but it only comes in 8.45 oz. I hate that it&#x27;s so small because it hardly lasts me a month. But it smells great and I will continue to buy it for now.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use this every other day and trade off shampoo and conditioners. Seems to keep my hair healthier and shiny.</li>
            <li> Works great to thicken and strengthen my hair, even with daily use and smells good, too!  One of my favorite products!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel super healthy without weighing it down. And smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love, love love this hair conditioner! Leaves my hair untangled and silky smooth and smells SO GOOD!  People ask me what I use on my hair because it smells so good and I tell them JOHN FRIEDA - Full Repair products!</li>
            <li> this is a great product for a great price.  It feels like salon quality and smells fantastic! have bought two batches so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by describing my hair type, because people with different hair types and conditions may have different results using this product.  I have waist-length, Caucasian-textured, fairly thick, color-treated hair.  I don&#x27;t heat treat or blow dry but I do shampoo every day.  I do not get split ends, although the ends are generally in a little bit worse condition than the rest of my hair.  My hair changes its mind about whether it wants to be straight or somewhat wavy, and I do tend to get some frizz and flyaways (I live in Georgia where it can be pretty humid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with breakage to begin with, but I do think this is reducing what small amount of breakage I get.  I think this is all right as a conditioner, but it&#x27;s not the most spectacular one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Most, but not all, of my flyaways are controlled.  And I get a reasonable amount of shine.  I do not notice color fading with this.  Whether or not that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been staying inside a lot recently, or because this is reducing color fading, I can&#x27;t say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very easy to apply and distribute throughout the hair and it rinses off cleanly and without leaving residue.  It has a fairly strong scent, although the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  This does contain silicone derivatives (fine by me, as these usually help my hair) but does not contain SLS.  The fragrance is artificial but this contains no dyes or parabens, which is great if you&#x27;re avoiding those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is a decent conditioner at a reasonable price.  It just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me.</li>
            <li> the best cream rinse every, I just love it, I use it every time I wash my hair, couldn&#x27;t live without it, thanks</li>
            <li> I used this based on the great reviews I saw here but really this product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I dyed my hair twice within a month so its pretty damaged right now and that is with a hair trim. I did find the smell a unique sophisticated musk which was different. This was on sale when I bought it but I&#x27;ll never buy it again, still looking for a good damage repair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner would be good for my hair, but it weighs it down and makes it look stringy.  My hair is very thin and fine anyway and I guess this isn&#x27;t the right conditioner for me.  I use the John Frieda full and thick volume conditioner which works for me. I gave this one to a friend of mine at work.  Her hair is very full and thick.. she loves it and said it made her hair feel so nice and soft. So if you have thick hair, it should be a great conditioner for you.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this shampoo and conditioner. It really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> Medium weight conditioner, not too heavy but thick enough that I can still detangle my hair in the shower (lightweight conditioners do not allow for this). My hair is not colored or heat-styled, but it is super dry and prone to frizz so this works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do much for the frizz, but then again nothing but a flat iron or a blowout really gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A CLAIM TO DO , I ASKED FOR THIS KIT, WHICH WAS SUPPOUSED TO COME, WITH 2 CONDITIONERS, 2 SHAMPOOS AND THE DEeP INFUSION. BUT INSTEAD OF THAT, WHAT I RECEIVED WAS 4 SHAMPOOS, WHERE (IN THE PICTURE) YOU LL REALIZE THAT 2 OF THE SHAMPOOS SAY THEY ARE CONDITIONERS , BUT THEY AREN&#x27;T, THEY HAVE ON THE OFFICIAL COVER &amp;#34;SHAMPOO&amp;#34;BUT A DIFFERENT LABEL BEHIND. I M REALLY MAD ABOUT THIS. CAUSE I DON T LIVE AT USA. A FAMILY MEMBER BROUGHT ME THIS THINGS, AND I DON&#x27;T HAVE A WAY TU TURN THEM BACK, WHAT CAN WE DO, TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM?, I NEED THE 2 CONDITIONERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PLS WRITE ME BACK TO MY EMAIL: nathalie.salame@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I love it very much same thing that help my hair improve go away damage hair from perm. I will never do perm again forever cause my hair damage so i tried find what kind of shamppoo and condition to repair full strength and restore hair back normal again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Michelle</li>
            <li> Works great to repair your hair!</li>
            <li> What a horrible conditioner and shampoo. I have hair like Sarah Jessica Parker. I read the reviews and I had to buy. I soo regret it! For people with curly dry color treated hair stay away from this stuff. It only makes it worse!</li>
            <li> It softened my chemical damaged hair but like most hair products out there after several continuous usage my hair doesn&#x27;t respond as well. Back to musical chairs with the hair products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not knowing what it would be like.  Let me tell you it smells wonderful and conditions has great.</li>
            <li> This has improved the health of my hair. Love it</li>
            <li> First Off, I have been coloring my hair for many many years. And sadly, do get those lovely colors and crazy pigments just right, It did require me to lighten my hair. It&#x27;s always a scary process to get dark hair light, and it&#x27;s VERY important to find products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair, make it frizzy, or strip the color out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a bottle of both the shampoo and conditioner on sale at Target for about $4 each. I really was just browsing for a new decently priced option. (I had tried Nexxus Humectress, Pual Mitchell...ect)&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, I was in love. The conditioner is GLORIOUS for dyed hair. I have straight Long black hair with silvery purple highlights, and it treats both colors very well. Calms frizzy hair without being TOO weighty or greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I sadly do not have a sense of smell..BUT I often get compliments on how my hair smells \\&quot;amazing!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a great product for a great price. Compared to EXPENSIVE salon names, it works better, and I don&#x27;t sob while entering my credit card information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that Target often has the \\&quot;Bonus 20% more\\&quot; bottle which is LOVELY to find! Since yes, the only con I can think of is that it really is not available in bottles larger than 12oz.</li>
            <li> This is a decent conditioner. The texture is more liquidy, while I prefer a thicker conditioner, but that&#x27;s my personal preference. It does an okay job detangling my hair and adding a moderate body to it without making it greasy. The scent is great and complements the shampoo well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging. I would pick it up in store and not through mail-order because the caps twist off too easily during transit. You also don&#x27;t want to keep this conditioner in the shower. If the caps get wet, mold starts to grow in the interior of the caps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the word &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; lightly like the teenagers do.  The conditioner is fabulous.  Bought it as a replacement for the old formula VO5 deep conditioning treatment which I can&#x27;t find anymore and glad I did.  This conditioner is superior to the VO5.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes hair softer.</li>
            <li> A great conditioner, that smells amazing. I have naturally curly hair- not wavy- curly.. and therefore, it&#x27;s usually frizzy and prone to drying out. I try a natural approach, by using cleansing conditioners, and only using a harsh shampoo after a day at the lake or after a hard day of work (I work with horses). This natural approach does keep my hair mostly calm, but when paired with this conditioner my hair is even more &amp;#34;tameable.&amp;#34; I also really like how easy it is to spread throughout my hair- some deep conditioners are so thick that I have to use half a bottle to get my hair evenly covered, but this one smooths throughout nicely. I am fairly &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34; with my hair, and what products I use, but I would recommend this product. I only use it every few times I condition (because of my mostly natural approach) but do like the results every time.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It keeps my hair very decent between cuttings.</li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER responded to a conditioner like this...and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds!  My hair detangles in seconds and styles so nicely now.  Thank you John Frieda!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores so thank goodness Amazon sellers have it!  I love,the way this voluminous my fine, blonde-colored hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never gets better. I&#x27;m hooked with this conditioner and continue using it. It helps my dry hair which I washed everyday after practicing Bikram yoga. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am soooo picky about finding a great shampoo...i constantly buy new kinds in search of something I love.  This stuff is GREAT!!  Smells super good!!!!  and really leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Made me break out along my hairline and dried out my hair long term. I don&#x27;t understand how this product got so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> For years every conditioner I used made my hair greasy. This stuff is amazing.  I have used it for a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I live by it&#x27;s a ten hair mask, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. So I did some research and discovered this and tresemmee protein renewal cream and bought them both. I use them at the same time and must say it is very comparable to the mask.</li>
            <li> Used by my daughter who really likes this product.</li>
            <li> ... and it often takes me 20 minutes to comb out knots in the shower, particularly during winter when my hair rubs against my coat collar. Right now, my hair is down to the middle of my back, and I have already been considering chopping it off before it turns cold outside, because I am fed up with the frustration. Luckily, I went to Maui in July with only a carry-on bag and needed to buy conditioner while there. I have always used $$$ Aveda products, since I pay hundreds for highlights and, in the past, drug store brands have faded my color. This time, I decided to give John Frieda a try. I am so in love with this conditioner. My hair combs out in five minutes now rather than 20. I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but anything that saves me time is worthy of five stars.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair and how convenient to find it cheaper with my shipment! Smells amazing! Also ordered shampoo.</li>
            <li> For the price I actually prefer Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Damage &amp; Color Repair Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask.</li>
            <li> A hairdresser told me about this product.  You can buy it in a supermarket but when it looked like mine was phasing it out (no doubt people don&#x27;t know about it). I panicked and went looking for it....thank goodness for amazon.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can explain this shampoo (and conditioner) but my hair feel cleaner longer and just feels luxurious.  Even my son (age 25) noticed and it&#x27;s all he likes to use now too.  Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really works.  I live at high altitude and the water is very hard.  My hair gets very dry - using this once a week really helps moisturize my hair again!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling great, and soft. It is great for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;After you blow dryer your hair look like it was don at the salon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FABULOUS!  I love how my hair feels when I use it.  It&#x27;s not designed to use this way, but this is now my daily conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is alright. I was hoping for a more noticeable change, but I haven&#x27;t seen one yet. I typically use Pantene&#x27;s Color Preserve, but have noticed my strands getting drier than usual, so I thought it was time for a switch. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle. It does smell and feel nice while applying, though, so I&#x27;ll likely keep using it and get a hair mask.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner that would compare with the conditioner that comes in my hair dye box. This is the closest I have come across. It is thick and you can feel the silkiness as soon as you put it in your hair. I LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel so silky after coloring it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have very curly hair and this does a great job of taming it, but not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s great as a conditioner but I really haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; to the condition of my hair</li>
            <li> When I was in Florida, I bought a travel size of this product.  I loved it.  When I returned home, I&lt;br /&gt;could not find it anywhere in my area.  Love the product.  It does not leave my hear greasy.  It leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s the only thing that could take my hair from chemically dead to vibrant and soft. It smells great as well. The only two problems I had were the small size and that I&#x27;m allergic to it. The perfume I think is what specifically is the problem though and I developed some irritation and bumps where my hair hits my neck. Keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin to perfumes.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Smooth, silky, rinses out easily, great for detangling &amp; strengthening. John Frieda Full Repair Strengthen and Restore Conditioner, 8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2) Did EVERYTHING it promised to, &amp; was so affordable. PLEASE BRING IT BACK AMAZON IF YOU CAN!  It REPAiRED damaged hair, &amp; strengthened it to reduce future breakage; within months the whole family was in love! It rinsed out easily, left your hair smooth &amp; sleek without being greasy or flat, had jut as much volume as their &amp;#34;full volume&amp;#34; conditioner does but without the added benefits this formula has. PLEASE BRING IT BACK AMAZON IF YOU CAN!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! I originally got this as a sample and I was so glad to have discovered this. It is reasonably priced and it makes my hair so soft - works better than some of the really expensive hair products I&#x27;ve tried. I love this and will definitely continue to use. The smell is nice too. I will not overpay for hair conditioners anymore.</li>
            <li> I was recently on an RX that destroyed my hair. About half of it fell out and the hair that was left was limp, dry, and weak. I used this conditioner (with matching shampoo) and within a couple of uses my hair was starting to feel soft and strong again. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all either, so it feels less limp and thin then it did before, and seems to have a slightly volumizing effect.</li>
            <li> I pretty much have never met a John Frieda product I didn&#x27;t like so when I saw this I had to give it a try. This conditioner has a nice thick formulation. It really stays on your hair and does not drip. It has a nice scent to it. I cannot believe how soft and manageable this made my hair. I have a thick, wavy, unruly mop and this conditioner made it soooo soft and smooth. All I did was apply and let it sit on for about 5 minutes in the shower. I bet if you used a shower cap for added heat and penetration of the hair shaft it would be even better!! I know that this brand is a little pricey but boy it is sure worth it....and a little bit of this goes a long way. (I use this one a week as a deep conditioner or for special occasions). I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on fine hair....but if you have thick hair give it a shot..you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best price available, I have extremely thick hair that drinks up moisture father than an alcoholic can swill Vodka. My hair feels like I&#x27;ve paid for an expensive deep conditioning at my local hair boutique. As far as the listing of active ingrediants, many of which sound scary, but this stuff works to refine and repair damage. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I Love this product. It has helped to make my hair softer and stronger. Love IT! Buy It. You Will Like IT!</li>
            <li> Love love love John Frieda shampoo. It makes my hair feel so silky smooth after use.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally frizzy and needs lots of help in Texas humidity weather.  I love this product and use it with the shampoo and it works for me!</li>
            <li> maybe its a placebo effect, but i swear my hair feels less fried, moisturized, strengthened. Not thicker, but by all means it feels and looks healthier to me. I need to buy more of this!</li>
            <li> Its very affordable, leaves my hair soft and has a really nice smell to it. What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve tried everything...and nothing compares to this! It detangles my hair so fast and easy, its unbelievable! Leaving hair incredibly soft and shiny. I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this line. Leaves my hair full of life... Even my 1 year old clip in hair extensions got life from this :) leaves hair full and manageable.</li>
            <li> Make hair beautiful and full</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, it always makes my hair so nice and soft and not greasy or anything, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years!</li>
            <li> Heartbreaking work by the John Freida Team. They most definitely deserve awards and accolades for this one. Genius! Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten dryer as I have aged&#x27; but most of the moisturizers I tried seemed to make it greasy rather than healthy. This makes my hair feel wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t make my blonde hair darker like a lot of the others did, too.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I read on the John Frieda site that the full repair shampoo would be better for my hair than the brunette shampoo that I was using. I got on the Amazon site and saw that you had 2 packs that were around the same price that you pay for 1 tube in the store! I ordered it and it arrived within 5 days. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and I see a great difference in my hair. I also use the 3-Day straight and I blow dry my hair. Sometimes I flat iron it. This conditioner helps sooo much and you only need a SMALL amount! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My husband was complaining about how much hair was in the shower drain when I washed my hair.  There has been a significant decrease in hair loss since I started using the full repair shampoo and conditioner.  I have color treated hair so my hair was dry and brittle but it looks and feels healthier now that I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months.  It is great for natural hair.  Mine has keratin and this product has too much alcohol in it.  It is stripping off my keratin</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner ever. My hair has gotten very frizzy as I have gotten older, and this helps me tame it.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting my naturally wavy hair to curl. It doesn&#x27;t help that I dye it regularly. I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of products meant for curly and died hair. Even salon products with lower sulfates and high quality cremes leave too much build up for my hair to curl properly (including Wen). Full Repair shampoo and conditioner remedy my lackluster curls almost daily. I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out a few years ago. I&#x27;m happy to see Amazon sells it in a two pack. As an added bonus, it happens to be the best-smelling conditioner I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
