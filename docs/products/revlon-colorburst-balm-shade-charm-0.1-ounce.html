    <ol>
            <li>Great products!</li>
            <li>The best I ever had.</li>
            <li>This product will be your best friend in the summertime!</li>
            <li>Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips feeling moisturized and Charm is a great nude/peachy color.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Looks great on me.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look good at all.</li>
            <li>Warm colours fit me best.</li>
            <li>nice color.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love these!</li>
            <li>I got the &#x27;Charm&#x27; color, and it goes on like a very light peach color.  </li>
            <li>I have very light skin, brown eyes and hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth feels just like lipgloss, but not the sticky kind.</li>
            <li>This balm stain is just ok.</li>
            <li>If you were looking more for an orangey tone, try the color \\&quot;rendezvous\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>cute color, easy to apply,</li>
            <li>It does kiss and wear off but the more you reapply it the more it leaves a light stain that also builds in color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my coloring; I have pale skin with warm undertones.</li>
            <li>Also,its best to warm the product on the back of your hand, much like an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Color is not nude, but very beautiful light pink.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s build able - the more you put on the more intense the color.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick very much!</li>
            <li>This is a nice shade and I actually like it better than the precious color, which is a nude/tan color.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and I like the application as there isn&#x27;t any goopiness to this product, so that helps with precise application.</li>
            <li>I thought that I would initially like the precious color on me better than the Charm shade, but the Charm just looks better with my skintone and coloring.  </li>
            <li>Good for a natural look, but makes you look more done-up and pretty than bare lips!</li>
            <li>The color is kind of sheer</li>
            <li>I was able to wear it for about an hour give or take before it faded completely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to use as a mixer with other lipsticks for a whole new color.</li>
            <li>Color is a nice change from pink for spring and summer</li>
            <li>I bought this at a local drugstore, but I&#x27;m sure the quality does not vary.</li>
            <li>It takes many applications for it to actually look like the color its supposed to look like.</li>
            <li>Works fine as a balm, but definitely not a stain.</li>
            <li>Love this balm but not much substance</li>
            <li>This balm stain has light, thin, yet smooth pigment.</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>I love this color on me, I originally bought this as a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; for my upcoming wedding make-up set, but it failed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true what some other commenters say: does not apply well to chapped lips.</li>
            <li>The pencil shape makes it so much easier to use, especially if you don&#x27;t have a mirror.</li>
            <li>recommend this product love it when run out will buy more...:()))</li>
    </ol>

            <li> recommend this product love it when run out will buy more...:()))</li>
            <li> The only way it will stay on the lips is if they are extremely dry or if you apply another lipstick underneath.</li>
            <li> I picked the wrong color as I have light brown skin.  </li>
            <li> Stays very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, doesn&#x27;t stick to the lips.</li>
            <li> I do recommend you prep your lips with a balm, because the balm can get a bit on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it goes on a nude color and fades into a flattering coral pink.</li>
            <li> Not for anyone that has dry lips provides slight moisture with reapplication.</li>
            <li> subtle color&lt;br /&gt;Cons: color slips into cracks in my lips, has to be reapplied often to remain moist, the consistency of the balm is a bit different to get used to</li>
            <li> It has a slightly minty taste, and a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the colour is hard to put on the lip...</li>
            <li> Also this color, if you can call it that is really hard to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the way lipstick feels on my lips - cakey or drying or like plastic wrap</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Broken when I recieved</li>
            <li> It also has a very subtle mint flavor to it, and keeps my lips hydrated.</li>
            <li> (I know I&#x27;m weird)</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It looks awful on my lips.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s okay. it&#x27;s great to use as a mixer with other lipsticks for a whole new color.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show on my lips at all. I knew it would be nude but it doesn&#x27;t look good at all. Wish I had gotten a different color!</li>
            <li> the colour is hard to put on the lip...</li>
            <li> Just what i wanted shipping was fat and product just how they describe it will purchase again... recommend this product love it when run out will buy more...:()))</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s true what some other commenters say: does not apply well to chapped lips. Otherwise, it goes on a nude color and fades into a flattering coral pink. It&#x27;s perfect for my coloring; I have pale skin with warm undertones. Good for a natural look, but makes you look more done-up and pretty than bare lips! It also has a very subtle mint flavor to it, and keeps my lips hydrated.</li>
            <li> Seriously. I love this product. I&#x27;ve never liked the way lipstick feels on my lips - cakey or drying or like plastic wrap (I know I&#x27;m weird) - but this stuff feels just like lip balm. It keeps my lips feeling moisturized and Charm is a great nude/peachy color. The color is kind of sheer but it&#x27;s build able - the more you put on the more intense the color. It does kiss and wear off but the more you reapply it the more it leaves a light stain that also builds in color. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> My fault.  I picked the wrong color as I have light brown skin.  I&#x27;ll stick with the pinks and reds next time.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these! The pencil shape makes it so much easier to use, especially if you don&#x27;t have a mirror. Great products!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a stain.  I got the &#x27;Charm&#x27; color, and it goes on like a very light peach color.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the color because it makes me look like I&#x27;m lipless, but I can see where the appeal might be for someone else with a different skin tone (I&#x27;m freckly, blonde, brown eyes).  Works fine as a balm, but definitely not a stain.</li>
            <li> I love this color on me, I originally bought this as a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; for my upcoming wedding make-up set, but it failed. I was able to wear it for about an hour give or take before it faded completely. It goes on smooth feels just like lipgloss, but not the sticky kind. I just wished it lasted longer I guess I&#x27;ll probably end up wearing lipstick. Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li> This balm stain is just ok. I haven&#x27;t ever used it before, but after using it for a day or two it has pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cute color, easy to apply, subtle color&lt;br /&gt;Cons: color slips into cracks in my lips, has to be reapplied often to remain moist, the consistency of the balm is a bit different to get used to</li>
            <li> Color is not nude, but very beautiful light pink. Stays very long. I love this lipstick very much! The best I ever had. Looks great on me. I have very light skin, brown eyes and hair. Skin tone is closer to neutral. Warm colours fit me best.</li>
            <li> Love this balm but not much substance</li>
            <li> It looks awful on my lips.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shade and I actually like it better than the precious color, which is a nude/tan color.  I thought that I would initially like the precious color on me better than the Charm shade, but the Charm just looks better with my skintone and coloring.  Charm is a bit on the peachy side, with nude undertones.  I do not find this product drying to my lips either.  It glides on smooth and I like the application as there isn&#x27;t any goopiness to this product, so that helps with precise application.</li>
            <li> Not for anyone that has dry lips provides slight moisture with reapplication. Color is a nice change from pink for spring and summer</li>
            <li> nice color.  Very natural.</li>
            <li> This product was not shipped to me by amazon. I bought this at a local drugstore, but I&#x27;m sure the quality does not vary. This balm stain has light, thin, yet smooth pigment. It has a slightly minty taste, and a creamy texture. I do recommend you prep your lips with a balm, because the balm can get a bit on the dry side. Also,its best to warm the product on the back of your hand, much like an eyeliner. If you were looking more for an orangey tone, try the color \\&quot;rendezvous\\&quot;. The product twists up, and has about the same amount of product that a lipstick tube has. This product will be your best friend in the summertime!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be something like Clinique&#x27;s chubby lipstick but I was wrong. Also this color, if you can call it that is really hard to wear. And calling it a stain is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> Broken when I recieved</li>
            <li> I got it cause I saw it in a magazine and the shade looked nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, doesn&#x27;t stick to the lips. It takes many applications for it to actually look like the color its supposed to look like. The only way it will stay on the lips is if they are extremely dry or if you apply another lipstick underneath. What a waste of money. Kissable? Naaaaah. Will come off after you tap your lips together.</li>
