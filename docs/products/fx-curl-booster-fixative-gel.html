            <li>It is the greatest product in the world for my fine curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most everything on the market for curls in every price range and NOTHING compares to this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this gel!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy how they last perfectly for some days and the curls are looking cute.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything on the market, and this is by far the best going.</li>
            <li>Tried so many gels and this is by far the best one  Not sticky at all and holds my curls in all day.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find the FX products anywhere in Chicago, but Osco and CVS stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I finally love my hair.</li>
            <li>the whole line is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to find any product that even comes close to what this product does for me.</li>
            <li>Many products.</li>
            <li>I am glad it works for others</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It is great to use on natural hair.</li>
            <li>so I bought it for 10.56 no tax and free shipping, but</li>
            <li>It brings new life to my hair when I most need it!</li>
            <li>Curl Booster Fixative Gel gives my hair body and shine, and even lets my hair stay clean looking longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best, and as far as I can tell no longer carried locally by CVS or walgreens where I used to get it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this gel for 7-8 years and also FX Root Lifter, and these are really the best gels ever, as other reviews have said.  </li>
            <li>Nice and curly and bouncy, soft (not crunchy).  </li>
            <li>I have to use quite a bit in my hair to eliminate frizz, and it&#x27;s a bit touchy and can be easy to then use too much.</li>
            <li>Love this product for naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I used a diffuser to dry a little more and my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I add a leave-in conditioner for extra moisture but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted a more natural alternative to Curls Rock.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the company could put it back in stores!</li>
            <li>Blow dry or air dry, works great either way!</li>
            <li>works best on just slightly damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li>this not only adds volume to my hair but makes my curls come out - i love it</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a good curly hair product that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and can be purchased locally.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that cannot tolerate a leave-on product without instantly appearing oily.  </li>
            <li>Is frizz a real word?</li>
            <li>They both work very well</li>
            <li>I have permed hair, and it helps my old perm look fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But I was really hoping it would have for the price  </li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>For the price I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I have fine, thin hair with a natural curl to it.  </li>
            <li>A couple years ago, this gel disappeared off the shelves where I live.  </li>
            <li>I want to know where to find it because it looks like they are changing the line, however I haven&#x27;t found their new version of the Curl Booster gel.</li>
            <li>Also, if you let it dry naturally, you have the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, or, you can scrunch it and it will take away the crunch and your hair looks soft and smooth, not sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be either \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot; or limp.  </li>
            <li>This product holds the curl, makes her hair soft and eliminates the frizz.</li>
            <li>And, that is very upsetting because it is the only curl gel I have found that works for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 1 year, actually this product and the older version of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves you with SOFT spiral type curls, no frize AND with body not like most other products that weight the hair down.</li>
            <li>We live in a dry high desert climate.</li>
            <li>so I only have to use about a nickel-size dollop of this product in my hair right after I towel dry it.  </li>
            <li>I am stuck with fine, limp, curly hair, I have found that this is the only product that seems to make the curls look somewhat presentable.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I use this gel on my thick natually curly hair and I get great curl definition and hold all day long with a small amount of gel.    </li>
            <li>My hair is med-thick, normal to dry, and wavy curls  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and it tightens my ringlets and holds their shape all day long without frizz!</li>

            <li> Dont overuse this product because it will really make you care hard to manage.</li>
            <li> But as long as I can purchase it on-line</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s curly again ALL DAY LONG!  </li>
            <li> I finished my previous gel and wanted to purchase my third gel and noticed that the price has been increased.</li>
            <li> I have a short frizzy curly hair, and I need a product to boost it without the frizz look, its help a little to boost the curls but</li>
            <li> Now the last few weeks it looks like Walgreen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t carry it either.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 8 years now, but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> So after a month of buying, trying, and throwing out other gels that don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m shopping online for FX.  </li>
            <li> Other products either (1) build up like glue, (2) make my hair instantly oily, or (3) are useless, do nothing after about 1 hr.  </li>
            <li> My hair is crazy thick and heavy, this product tightens up my very wavy hair and makes it look curly.  </li>
            <li> When I purchase, I always buy at least 5 or 6 containers at a time.</li>
            <li> Last time the increased price wasn&#x27;t that bad from 8$ to 10.56$</li>
            <li> now I see that the price has changed to $14.99 + $5.25 shipping which I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I just hate that the only place that I can get it is online now.</li>
            <li> This product is 5.99 a bottle how can you sell it for 12.99 a bottle your making it impossible to buy</li>
            <li> Everything else either make the curls look greasy or a bad perm.</li>

            <li> I love this product. I found it at Walgreens but checked review here at Amazon. I have searched high and low for a good curly hair product that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and can be purchased locally. This one is great. Sometimes I add a leave-in conditioner for extra moisture but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I use this gel on my thick natually curly hair and I get great curl definition and hold all day long with a small amount of gel.    For the price I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife reviews as follows. We live in a dry high desert climate. She has curly hair that at time frizzes. This product holds the curl, makes her hair soft and eliminates the frizz. She loves it. Is frizz a real word?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before but for some reason I couldn&#x27;t find at store, I found it at Amazon and I am so happy about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 year, actually this product and the older version of it. They both work very well and I&#x27;m happy how they last perfectly for some days and the curls are looking cute. I finished my previous gel and wanted to purchase my third gel and noticed that the price has been increased. Last time the increased price wasn&#x27;t that bad from 8$ to 10.56$ so I bought it for 10.56 no tax and free shipping, but now I see that the price has changed to $14.99 + $5.25 shipping which I&#x27;m not happy with it. Hope they sell it again with lower price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for 7-8 years and also FX Root Lifter, and these are really the best gels ever, as other reviews have said.  I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be either \\&quot;flyaway\\&quot; or limp.  Other products either (1) build up like glue, (2) make my hair instantly oily, or (3) are useless, do nothing after about 1 hr.  I used to be able to find the FX products anywhere in Chicago, but Osco and CVS stopped carrying it.  Now the last few weeks it looks like Walgreen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t carry it either.  So after a month of buying, trying, and throwing out other gels that don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m shopping online for FX.  Hopefully, they will never stop making this!  There&#x27;s just no substitute.</li>
            <li> I finally love my hair. I&#x27;ve tried most everything on the market for curls in every price range and NOTHING compares to this! Blow dry or air dry, works great either way! Leaves you with SOFT spiral type curls, no frize AND with body not like most other products that weight the hair down. Best Product out there for curls...the whole line is great.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair gel going. I have very fine thin hair. It is the only thing that gives me volume and body, without any sticky residue. I don&#x27;t know why I cannot find it in the stores anymore. But as long as I can purchase it on-line I am a happy camper! When I purchase, I always buy at least 5 or 6 containers at a time. I have tried everything on the market, and this is by far the best going.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 10 + years. I have permed hair, and it helps my old perm look fresh. I get perms less frequently because of this gel.  Also, if you let it dry naturally, you have the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, or, you can scrunch it and it will take away the crunch and your hair looks soft and smooth, not sticky.  A couple years ago, this gel disappeared off the shelves where I live.  I went through several other gels, throwing them all away, then finally wised up and started ordering from Amazon.  Hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> If you have fine to medium hair, this is the best! I got a perm about 6 months ago and, using this, it&#x27;s curly again ALL DAY LONG!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this not only adds volume to my hair but makes my curls come out - i love it</li>
            <li> I have a short frizzy curly hair, and I need a product to boost it without the frizz look, its help a little to boost the curls but the frizz still there</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that cannot tolerate a leave-on product without instantly appearing oily.  Curl Booster Fixative Gel gives my hair body and shine, and even lets my hair stay clean looking longer.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product for naturally curly hair!  It is my go to gel and I wish it was easier to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a more natural alternative to Curls Rock. It does not work quite as well, but it does the job well enough. I have to use quite a bit in my hair to eliminate frizz, and it&#x27;s a bit touchy and can be easy to then use too much. Sticking with it for now.</li>
            <li> I love this gel! I have been using it for about 8 years now, but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. And, that is very upsetting because it is the only curl gel I have found that works for me. I have naturally curly hair and it tightens my ringlets and holds their shape all day long without frizz! I want to know where to find it because it looks like they are changing the line, however I haven&#x27;t found their new version of the Curl Booster gel. Help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I just hate that the only place that I can get it is online now. It would be nice if the company could put it back in stores! I&#x27;ve not been able to find any product that even comes close to what this product does for me.</li>
            <li> Used this gel for 10 years. It is the greatest product in the world for my fine curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens. Many products. Such stress. If they would just make this forever, I would be the happiest curly girl ever.</li>
            <li> * Unfortuneately FX Curl did not work for me, left my hair feeling waxy  * But I was really hoping it would have for the price  * My hair is med-thick, normal to dry, and wavy curls  * I am glad it works for others</li>
            <li> Dont overuse this product because it will really make you care hard to manage. Remeber this is a gel no a sheen or activator.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well. It just took some getting used to. works best on just slightly damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it to be. I am so glad I found it. It is great to use on natural hair.</li>
            <li> This product is 5.99 a bottle how can you sell it for 12.99 a bottle your making it impossible to buy</li>
            <li> I too have been looking everwhere for this gel and the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore so I will have to order it.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am stuck with fine, limp, curly hair, I have found that this is the only product that seems to make the curls look somewhat presentable. Everything else either make the curls look greasy or a bad perm. Thank goodness for the internet and online shopping.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy thick and heavy, this product tightens up my very wavy hair and makes it look curly.  It&#x27;s the best, and as far as I can tell no longer carried locally by CVS or walgreens where I used to get it.</li>
            <li> Tried so many gels and this is by far the best one  Not sticky at all and holds my curls in all day. It brings new life to my hair when I most need it!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have fine, thin hair with a natural curl to it.  I have short hair so I only have to use about a nickel-size dollop of this product in my hair right after I towel dry it.  I used a diffuser to dry a little more and my hair looks great!  Nice and curly and bouncy, soft (not crunchy).  This stuff is amazing!</li>
