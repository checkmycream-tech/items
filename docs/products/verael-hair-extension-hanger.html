            <li>And I don&#x27;t need to spend more money on her extensions too.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love it if you have clip in hair extensions.</li>
            <li>must say I am completely IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>This device is easy to use in storing, styling, washing, and transporting my extensions.</li>
            <li>Arrived in time and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Designed for easy cleaning in mind.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>product is also made to make it easier to clean the hair extensions.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up special space.</li>
            <li>It convenient, durable and works exactly like it should!</li>
            <li>I actually bought some Cashmere hair extensions (the clip in kind)</li>
            <li>The packaging of the actual product was nice and allows for the consumer to store the hanger when not in use.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received the product I went right to work attaching my clip-in hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I spent a long time researching the best ways to store my hair extensions.</li>
            <li>First one went almost right after i got it.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser, my friends, and multiple stylists- has fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>I hope my review helped in making your possible purchase :)</li>
            <li>I hope my review helped in making your possible purchase :)</li>
            <li>I will also say that I have the 26 inch hair extensions and had no problem with the long length fitting in the bag.</li>
            <li>It works as just as described and it has made storing and cleaning my clip-in extensions so much easier.  </li>
            <li>It makes cleaning/drying the clips much easier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was a little leery at first as there were no reviews on this product, but decided that I have had nothing but great dealings with Amazon in the past that I would take the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good concept executed poorly.</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of clip-in hair extensions, so when I got my clip-in hair extension weft set</li>
            <li>Each fabric &amp;#34;Hair Clip Holder&amp;#34; has actual compartments, for lack of a better word, in which to attach the clips and keep them firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had it enough buying her new extensions every so often!</li>
            <li>Plus, when I&#x27;m traveling with them or bringing them to my stylist&#x27;s place it is more subtle than carrying a giant extension box.</li>
            <li>you can store it flat (with rungs one right under the other) or by keeping each rung separate (hanging both bangers apart from one another so as to keep the rungs apart).</li>
            <li>I felt sort of stupid spending $30 on something just to hold my hair extensions, but I am so happy I did.</li>

            <li> I felt sort of stupid spending $30 on something just to hold my hair extensions, but I am so happy I did. This device is easy to use in storing, styling, washing, and transporting my extensions. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Zipper broke the day I got it.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this hanger a lot, but I wasn&#x27;t a big fan . I purchased it couple years ago but only used it a handful of times. My big problem with it was that the hunger hooks broke of . First one went almost right after i got it. Second just broke recently. That would have been okay if I had Been using it a lot . I think if the hooks we different I would like it more</li>
            <li> THis product was pretty awesome luv it&lt;br /&gt;it works , just wish it had come with instructions&lt;br /&gt;and i luved the face mask it came with&lt;br /&gt;i thought it was awesome that it came with a gift&lt;br /&gt;recommend it</li>
            <li> Love the idea. Yet the hanger on the side broke off within a month. Needs to be a little be more tough.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product! couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. i needed something to store my hair extensions and this was the best buy for it</li>
            <li> Arrived in time and was easy to use. This is the perfect storage for my hair extensions. Hangs in my closet like a dress bag so it doesn&#x27;t take up special space. Designed for easy cleaning in mind.</li>
            <li> This is great for clip in extensions no doubt! Air dries great and stores great I&#x27;d recommend to everyone with clip ins!</li>
            <li> It works as just as described and it has made storing and cleaning my clip-in extensions so much easier.  I think everyone with clip-ins should invest in one (or more) of these.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome idea. I actually bought some Cashmere hair extensions (the clip in kind) and I didnt like the storage that they had So I looked around online for something and found this. This is such a great idea and it hangs perfectly in my closet and Its flat so it doesn&#x27;t take up alot of room. It keeps the hair pieces nice and neat. HIghly recommended if you have expensive hair pieces.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves extension hangers and those extensions are expensive! But she just put it everywhere and I had it enough buying her new extensions every so often! So I did little research and found this storage. Had some good reviews so I purchased one. She loves it and I love it too. I don&#x27;t have to see those creepy hairs lying around everywhere anymore. And I don&#x27;t need to spend more money on her extensions too. Thank god.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to store my extensions and at the same time to use for travel.  It actually is a little awkward but I do like how it hangs in my closet.  Not bulky and my extension are not getting tangled. I haven&#x27;t traveled with them yet but I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I recently spent a lot on buying and customizing clip in extensions for my wedding-related activities. I found this when searching for a box to hold them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who see this- my hairdresser, my friends, and multiple stylists- has fallen in love with it. It makes cleaning/drying the clips much easier. Plus, when I&#x27;m traveling with them or bringing them to my stylist&#x27;s place it is more subtle than carrying a giant extension box. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Heavy, ugly, to much big for 2 pieces of hair extension, not work very well and clip in your extension...</li>
            <li> this contraption is amazing. It convenient, durable and works exactly like it should! you&#x27;ll love it. best hair storage I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I love it if you have clip in hair extensions. This is a must have. I am really happy i purchased it. You wont regret it. I would give thia a rating of 10 stars if i could.</li>
            <li> This is the best invention EVER. I even bought one for my best friend who&#x27;s a hair dresser and she Loves it!</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of clip-in hair extensions, so when I got my clip-in hair extension weft set I never realized I&#x27;d have to get something to store them in. I spent a long time researching the best ways to store my hair extensions. Somewhere along the way I came across a website suggesting this product. I have to admit I was a little leery at first as there were no reviews on this product, but decided that I have had nothing but great dealings with Amazon in the past that I would take the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I am completely IN LOVE with this product. It came in a timely manner and was shipped in a nice box. The packaging of the actual product was nice and allows for the consumer to store the hanger when not in use. As soon as I received the product I went right to work attaching my clip-in hair extensions. The hanger has 5 plastic rungs with 6 attached fabric &amp;#34;Hair Clip Holders&amp;#34;. With the the 2 hangers attached (one in the middle and one in the back) you can store it flat (with rungs one right under the other) or by keeping each rung separate (hanging both bangers apart from one another so as to keep the rungs apart). Each fabric &amp;#34;Hair Clip Holder&amp;#34; has actual compartments, for lack of a better word, in which to attach the clips and keep them firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item also comes with a storage bag which was a surprisingly good quality (looks like a garment bag). This just adds to the appeal of the product. It puts my mind at ease, esp. with the curious kitties in my house. I will also say that I have the 26 inch hair extensions and had no problem with the long length fitting in the bag. In fact, there was room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also made to make it easier to clean the hair extensions. The only con I have found since receiving this product was that it didn&#x27;t come with an actual paper &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; just some directions on the outside of the box. But, then again, it wasn&#x27;t hard to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to write reviews on products but felt since no one had written one yet that I would put one up here. I hope my review helped in making your possible purchase :)br /&gt;I am not one to write reviews on products but felt since no one had written one yet that I would put one up here. I hope my review helped in making your possible purchase :)</li>
            <li> Hard to actually clip the hair to it</li>
            <li> Only reason I keep buying is because I can&#x27;t find an alternative. I have ordered probably 5 of these in the last 3 years but the hanger part keeps breaking. It&#x27;s still great for storing my clips but they need to fix the hanger part and make it better quality.</li>
            <li> This product is poorly designed. The hangers come undone and are impossible to put back together. Good concept executed poorly.</li>
            <li> Great storage for extensions</li>
    </ol>
